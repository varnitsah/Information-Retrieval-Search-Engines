8108171	to the gold coast for gold  a personal narrative  by richard f burton and verney lovett cameron  in two volumesvol i    to our excellent friend  james irvine  of liverpool frgs fsa c  we inscribe these pages as a token of our appreciation and admiration for his courage and energy in opening and working the golden lands of western africa    much have i travelled in the realms of gold  shakespeare    preface  the following extract from wanderings in west africa a book which i wrote in 1862 and published anonymously in 1863 will best explain the reasons which lately sent me to western africa  in several countries for instance dinkira tueful wásá wassaw and especially akim the hillregion lying north of accra the people are still active in digging gold the pits varying from two to three feet in diameter and from twelve to fifty deep eighty feet is the extreme are often so near the roads that loss of life has been the result shoring up being little known the miners are not unfrequently buried alive the stuff is drawn up by ropes in clay pots or calabashes and thus a workman at the bottom widens the pit to a pyriform shape tunnelling however is unknown the excavated earth is carried down to be washed besides sinking these holes they pan in the beds of rivers and in places collect quartz which is roughly pounded  they the natives often refuse to dig deeper than the chin for fear of the earth caving in and quartzcrushing and the use of quicksilver being unknown they will not wash unless the gold show colour to the naked eye  as we advance northwards from the gold coast the yield becomes richer  it is becoming evident that africa will one day equal halfadozen californias  will our grandsons believe in these times  that this ophirthat this california where every river is a tmolus and a pactolus every hillock is a goldfielddoes not contain a cradle a puddlingmachine a quartzcrusher a pound of mercury that half the washings are wasted because quicksilver is unknown that whilst convict labour is attainable not a company has been formed not a surveyor has been sent out i exclaim with dominie sampsonprodigious  western africa was the first field that supplied the precious metal to mediaeval europe the french claim to have imported it from elmina as early as ad 1382 in 1442 gonçales baldeza returned from his second voyage to the regions about bojador bringing with him the first gold presently a company was formed for the purpose of carrying on the goldtrade between portugal and africa its leading men were the navigators lanzarote and gilianez and prince henry the navigator did not disdain to become a member in 1471 joão de santarem and pedro escobar reached a place on the gold coast to which from the abundance of gold found there they gave the name of são jorje da mina the present elmina after this a flood of gold poured into the lap of europe and at last cupidity having mastered terror of the papal bull which assigned to portugal an exclusive right to the eastern hemisphere english french and dutch adventurers hastened to share the spoils  for long years my words fell upon flat ears presently the ashanti war of 187374 brought the subject before the public the protectorate was overrun by british officers and their reports and itineraries never failed to contain with a marvellous unanimity of iteration the magic wordgold  the fraction of country twentysix miles of seaboard out of two hundred by a depth of sixtyin fact the valley of the ancobra rivernow early 1882 contains five working companies upwards of seventy concessions to my knowledge have been obtained from native owners and many more are spoken of in fact development has at length begun and the line of progress is clearly traced  at madeira i was joined january 8 1882 by captain cameron rn cb c our object was to explore the socalled kong mountains which of late years have become quasimythical he came out admirably equipped nor was i less prepared but inevitable business had delayed us both and we landed on the gold coast at the end of january instead of early october the hotdry season had set in with a heat and a drought unknown for years the climate was exceptionally trying and all experts predicted early and violent rains finally we found so much to do upon the ancobra river that we had no time for exploration geography is good but gold is better  in this joint book my energetic and hardworking friend and fellowtraveller has described the five working mines which i was unable to visit he has also made an excellent routesurvey of the country corrected by many and careful astronomical observations it is curious to compare his work with the sketches of previous observers jeekel wyatt bonnat and dahse to my companions industry also are mainly due our collections of natural history  we are answerable only for our own not for each others statements as regards my part i have described the goldland as minutely as possible despite the many and obvious disadvantages of the photographic style indeed we travellers often find ourselves in a serious dilemma if we do not draw our landscapes somewhat in preraphaelite fashion they do not impress the reader if we do critics tell us that they are wearisome longueurs and that the half would be better than the whole the latter alternative must often be risked especially in writing about a country where many at home have friends and relatives of course they desire to have as much detail about it as possible hence the reader will probably pardon my curiosity  the appendix discusses at some length the various objections made to the gold coast mines by the public which suffers equally from the bull and the bear and from the wild rumours set afloat by those not interested in the speculation i first dispose of the dangers menaced by ashanti invasions the second number notices the threatened labourfamine and shows how immigration of chinese of coolies and of zanzibarmen will when wanted supply not only the gold coast but also the whole of our unhappy west african stations miscalled colonies which are now starving for lack of hands the third briefly sketches the history of the goldtrade in the northwestern section of the dark continent discusses the position and the connections of the auriferous kong mountains and suggests the easiest system of getting the precious metal this is by shallow working by washing and by the hydraulicking which i had studied in california the earlier miners have it is believed begun at the wrong end with deep workings shafts and tunnels with quartzcrushers stamps and heavy and expensive machinery when flumes and forcepumps would have cost less and brought more our observations and deductions drawn from a section of coast will apply if true as i believe they are to the whole region between the assini and the volta rivers  i went to the gold coast with small expectations i found the wásá wassaw country ancobra section far richer than the most glowing descriptions had represented it gold and other metals are there in abundance and there are good signs of diamond ruby and sapphire  remains to be seen if england has still honesty and public spirit enough to work this oldnew california as it should be worked i will answer for its success if the workers will avoid overexclusiveness undue

been unfavoured of fortune where two purblind feverstricken men plodded painfully through fetid swamp and fiery thornbush over the zanzibartanganyika track missionhouses and schools may now be numbered by the dozen missionaries bring consuls and consuls bring commerce and colonisation on the gold coast of western africa whence came the good old guinea not a washingcradle not a pound of quicksilver was to be found in 1862 in 1882 five mining companies are at work and in 1892 there will be as many score  i had long and curiously watched from afar the movement of the golden land our longneglected el dorado before the opportunity of a revisit presented itself at last in the autumn of 1881 mr james irvine of liverpool formerly of the west african oilrivers and now a large mineowner in the gulf of guinea proposed to me a tour with the object of inspecting his concessions and i proposed to myself a journey of exploration inland the foreign office liberally gave me leave to escape the winter of trieste where the ferocious bora nornoreaster wages eternal war with the depressing and distressing scirocco or southeaster some one marvelled aloud and said you are certainly the first that ever applied to seek health in the genial and congenial climate of the west african coast but then some one had not realised the horrors of january and february at the stormbeaten head of the ever unquiet adriatic  thus it happened that on november 181881 after many adieux and au revoirs i found myself on board the cunard ss demerara captain c jones bound for gib my wife was to accompany me as far as hungarian fiume  the cunard route to gib is decidedly roundabout we began with a run to venice usually six hours from the vicequeen of the adriatic it was prolonged to double by the thick and clinging mistfog the seacity was enjoying her usual lethargy of repose after the excitement of the geographical carnival as we called the farcical congress of last september she is essentially a summering place her winter is miserable neither city nor houses being built for any but the finest of fine weather her societyseason lasts only four months from st stephens day her travellerseasons are spring and autumn we found all our friends either in bed with bad colds or on the wing for england and elsewhere we inhaled a quant suff of choking vapour even in the comfortable britannia hotel and on the morning of the 23rd we awoke to find ourselves moored alongside of the new warehouses on the new port of hungarian or rather croatian fiume  fiume had made prodigious strides since i last saw her in 1878 and she is gradually taking the wind out of the sails of her sisterrival while old tergeste wastes time and trouble upon futile questions of policy and angry contrasts between germans and slavs and italians and triestines fiume looks to the main chance the neat clean and wellwatered little harbourcity may be called a twodinneraday place so profuse is her hospitality to strangers here too we once more enjoyed her glorious outlook the warm winter sun gilding the snowysilvery head of monte maggiore and raining light and life upon the indigotinted waters of fiume bay next to naples i know nothing in europe more beautiful than this illnamed quarnero we saw a shot or so of the farfamed whitehead torpedo which now makes twentyone miles an hour and on nov 25 we began to run down the gulf en route for patras  it was a pleasure to emerge from the stern and gloomy adriatic and nothing could be more lovely than the first evening amongst the ionian islands to port backed by the bold heights of the grecian searange lay the hoary mount and the red cliffs 780 feet high of sapphos leap a neverforgotten memory starboard rose bleak ithaca fronting the black mountain of cephalonia now bald and bare but clothed with dark forests till these were burnt down by some mischievous malignant whatever of sterility deformed the scene lay robed under a glory of colour painted with perfect beauty by the last smile of the sun earth and air and sea showed every variety of the chromatic scale especially of rosetints from the tenderest morning blush of virgin snow to the vinous evening flush upon the lowlands washed by the purple wave the pure translucent vault never ceased to shift its chameleonlike hues that ranged between the diaphanous azure of the zenith and the faintest rainbow green a borderland where blue and yellow met and parted the air felt soft and balmy a holy calm was on the face of creation all looked delicious after the rude north and we acknowledged once more that life was worth living  patras also has greatly improved since i last saw her in 1872 the malariaswamps to the north and south of the town have been drained and are being warped up the neverfailing succession of aguish fevers will presently fade out of the guidebooks a macadamised boulevard has been built and a breakwater is building the once desert square georgios a has been planted with trees which should be eucalyptus and adorned with two french statues of bronze which harmonise admirably with the surroundings the thoroughfares are still sloughs of despond after rain and gridirons of st laurence in dusty summer but there are incipient symptoms of trottoirs and throughout there is a disappearance of the hovels which resembled port said in her younger day and a notable substitution of tall solid houses  all this has been brought about by fruit which in patras means currants that is corinthian grapes the export this year is unusual 110000 tons including the morea and the islands and of this total only 20000 go to france for winemaking it gives a surprising idea of the christmas plumpudding manufacture patras also imports for all the small adjacent places inhabited by shaggy capotes and she will have a fine time when that talented and energetic soldier general türr whom we last met at venice begins the piercing of the isthmus À propos of which one might suggest to patras with due respect that politically speaking honesty is the best policy  being at patras on st andrews day with a scotch demoiselle on board we could hardly but pilgrimage to the place of the apostles martyrdom mrs wood kindly sent her daughters to do the honours aghyos andreas lies at the extreme south of the town on the system of ruts called a road which conducts downcoast the church is a long yellow barn fronting a cypressgrown cemetery whose contents are being transferred to the new extramural a little finger of the holy man reposes under a dwarf canopy in the southeastern angle his left arm is preserved at mount athos in a silver reliquary set with gems outside near the southwestern corner is the old well of demeter ceres which has not lost its curative virtues by being baptised you descend a dwarf flight of brick steps to a mean shrine and portrait of the saint and remark the solid bases and the rude rubble arch of the pagan temple a figtree under which the martyrdom took place grew in the adjacent court it has long been cut down probably for fuel  the population of patras still affords a fine study of the dirty picturesque with clothes mostly homemade sheepskin cloaks fustanellas or kilts which contain a whole piece of calico red leggings and the rudest of sandals turkish caps and an occasional pistolbelt the palikar still struts about in all his old bravery and the bourgeois humbly imitates the dingy garb of southern italy the people have no taste for music no regard for art no respect for antiquities except for just as much as these will bring they own two and only two objects in life firstly to make money and secondly to keep and not to spend it but this dark picture has a bright side no race that i know is so greedy of education the small boys instead of wending unwillingly to school crowd the doors before they are opened where this exceptional feeling is universal we may hope for much  the last evening at patras showed us a beautiful view of what is here called parnassus parnassó the tall bluff mountain up the gulf whose snows at sunset glowed like a balass ruby we left the morea at 2 am december 2 and covered the fiftytwo miles to zante before breakfast there is and ever has been something peculiarly sympathetic to me in the flower of the levant eh tis a bonny bonny place repeatedly ejaculated our demoiselle the city lies at the foot of the grey cliffs whose northern prolongation extends to the akroteri or lighthouse point a fine quay the strada marina has been opened during the last six years along the northern seafront where the arcades suggest those of chester it is being prolonged southwards to the old quarantineground and the modern prison which rests upon the skirts of the remarkable skopo the prospect mountain 1489 feet high this feature which first shows itself to mariners approaching zakynthos from north or from south has a saddleback skyline with a knob of limestone shaped like a turkish pommel and sheltering its monastery panaghia of skopo alias our lady of the lookout below it appears another and a similar outcrop near a white patch which has suggested marblequarrying and the northern flank is dotted with farmhouses and villas the dwarf breakwater so easily prolonged over the shallows has not been improved but at its base rises a brandnew operahouse big enough for a firstrate city similarly at barletta they raised a loan to build a mole and they built a theatre unlike patras zante long had the advantage of italian and then of english rule and the citizens care for music more than for transformationscenes the palikar element also is notably absent and the soldiers are in uniform not in halfuniform and halfbrigand attire i missed the british flag once so conspicuous upon the southern round tower of the castle where in days or rather nights of old i had spent not a few jolly hours but i heard with pleasure that it is proposed to make a hauteville of the now deserted and crumbling triangle a sommerfrisch where the parboiled citizens of athens will find a splendid prospect and a cooling seabreeze  mr e barff kindly accompanied us in the usual drive round the wrekin for which we may here read the wreck we set out along the seaflank of the castle hill this formation once a regular hogsback has been split by weather about the middle and its southern end has been shaken down by earthquakes and carved by wind and rain into precipices and pinnacles of crumbling sandstone which form the grey cliffs having heard at patras the worst accounts of zante since it passed under greek rule i was not a little surprised by the excellent condition of the roads and the general look of prosperity  turning to the right we entered mr barffs gardenhouse where the grounds were bright and beautiful with balsam and mignonette dahlias and cyclamens chrysanthemums and oleanders jasmine and doubleviolets orangeblossoms and a perfect gulistan of roses roses of york and lancaster white pink and purple yellow and greena perfumed spring in dreary december laden with bouquets we again threaded the olivegrounds whose huge trunks are truly patriarchal and saw basking in the sun old eumæus the swineking waiting upon his black and bristly herd the glimpse led to a characteristic tale a wealthy greek merchant in london had made the most liberal offers to his brother a shepherd in the hills of cephalonia the latter returned his very best thanks but declared himself perfectly happy and unwilling to tempt fortune by change of condition to england greece it is evident has not ceased to breed wise men  we returned viâ the landward flank of the hogsback along the fine plain o kampos bounded west by the range called after mount meriy the apex rising 3274 feet anglozantiots fondly compare its outline with the juras the look of the rich lowlands the vale as our charts call it suggested a rivervalley but river there is none every nook and corner was under cultivation and each countryhouse had its chapel and its dryingground for fruit level yards now hidden under largeleaved daisies and wild flowers we passed through the graetani village whose tenants bear a bad name and saw none of the pretty faces for which zante is famed the sex was dressed in dark jackets and petticoats à litalienne and the elders were apparently employed in gathering bitter herbs dandelion and the wild endive verily this is a frugal race  the drive ended with passing up the strada larga the inner high street running parallel with the marina after turkish fashion trades flock together shoemakers to the south and vegetablevendors to the north there are two good specimens of venetian palazzetti one fantastic the other classical and there is a rough pavement which is still wanting in patras a visit to the silkshop of garafuglia papaiouanou was obligatory here the goldenhued threads reminded me of the indian tussurmoth also de rigueur was the purchase of nougat and raki the local mandorlato and mastaché almondcake and grapespirit  zante appears to me an excellent home for a large family with a small income a single man lives at the best hotel nazionale for fortyfive francs per week a countryhouse with nine bedrooms cellarage stabling doghouse orangery and large garden is to be had for 25l a year fowls cost less than a franc turkeys if you do not buy them from a shipchandler two francs and a half the strong and sherryflavoured white wine of zante rarely exceeds three shillings the gallon sixpence a bottle and other necessaries in the same proportion  but oh that st dionysius patron saint of zante would teach his protégés a little of that old persian wisdom which abhorred a lie and its concomitants cheating and mean trickery the esmeralda after two days and one night at zante was charged 15l for pilotage when the captain piloted himself for church where there is no parson and for harbour dues where there is no harbour it is almost incredible that so sharpwitted a race can also be so shortsighted so wise about pennies so foolish about pounds  on saturday we left zante in the teeth of a fresh but purely local northeaster which whistled through the gear and hurled the spray high up cape skinari the result was as the poet sings    that peculiar upanddown motion   which belongs to the treacherous ocean  not without regret i saw the last of the memorious old castle and of skopo the picturesque we ran along the western shore of cephalonia the isle of three hundred villages anyone passing this coast at once understands how greece produced so many and such excellent seamen the island was a charming spectacle with its two culminations maraviglia 3311 ft and elato 5246 ft both capped by purple cloud its fertile slopes and its fissured bight argostoli bay running deep into the land  we fondly expected to pass the messina straits by daylight and to cast another glance upon old etna scylla and charybdis the liparis and stromboli and all looked well as about noon we were abreast of cape spartivento the splitwind which divides the mild northers and southers of the straits from the raw boras and rotting sciroccos of the adriatic but presently a signal for succour was hoisted by a marvellous old tub a sailermadesteamer sans boats sans gunwales a something whose dirt and general dilapidation suggested the flying dutchman i almost expected to see her drop out of form and crumble into dust as our boys boarded her the america of barletta bound from brindisi to genoa had hurt her boilers we hauled in her cablethese gentry must never be trusted with a chance of slipping looseand tugged her into messina thereby losing a valuable day  the famous straits were almost a replica of ionian island scenery the shores of the mediterranean limestone and sandstone with here and there a volcanic patch continually repeat themselves after passing the barren heel of the boot and its stony big toe the wadystreaked shores become populous and well cultivated while railway trains on either side island and continent toss their snowy plumes in the pride of civilisation the ruined castles on the crags and the new villages on the lowlands told their own story of turkish and algerine piracy now doomed to the limbo of things that were in the evening we were safely anchored within the zancle sickle of messinaport whose depth of water and circular shape have suggested an old crater flooded it was sunday and we were greeted with the familiar sounds the ringing of cracked bells the screaming of harsh hoarse voices a military band and detached musical performances the classical facade of the marina through whose nineteen archways and upper parallelograms you catch a vista of dark narrow wynd contrasts curiously with catania the former is a dicky a front hiding something unclean while the latter is laid out in eastern style where for the best of reasons the marble palace hides behind a wall of mud the only new features i noted were a metal fishmarket engineer art which contrasts marvellously with the ionic pilasters and the solid ashlar of the dicky and at the root of the sickle a new customhouse of six detached boxes reddestroofed and whitestwalled built to copy childrens toy cottages croatian fiume would blush to own them of the general impurity of the town and of the bouquet de messine the less said the better  as we made fast to the marina our tobacco was temporarily sealed after the usual mean italian fashion next morning an absurd old person in a broad red baldrick came on board and counted noses to ascertain that we had not brought the dreaded smallpox from the ionian islands after being graciously and liberally allowed to land we were visited by the local chapmen whose goods appeared rather mixedpolished cowhorns and mildewed figs dolls in costume and corrosive oranges by the normal musical barber who imitates at a humble distance bird and beast and by the vendor of binoculars who asks forty francs and who takes ten the captain noted his protest at the consulate and claimed by way of sauvetage 200l the owners offered 200 lirepunds scots briefly noon had struck before we passed out of the noise and the smells of messina  our good deed had cost us dear a wet scirocco had replaced the bright norther and saddened all the view passing the tiderip charybdis a meeting of currents which called only for another hand at the wheel and the castled crag of naughty scylla whose town has grown prodigiously we bade adieu to the tower of pelorus then we shaped our course for the islands of Æolus or the winds and the lipari archipelago all volcanic cones whose outlines were misty as ossians spectres and we plodded through the dreary dullgrey scene of drizzling scirocco    till when all veilèd sank in darkling air   naught but the welkin and the wave was there  next morning showed us to port the cone of maritimo it outlies marsala whose wine caused the blinding of polyphemus and since that time has brought on many an attack of liver the world then became to us pontus et aer days and nights were equally uneventful the diary tells only of quiet seas under the lee of sardinia and of the balearics ghostly glimpses of the north african coast and the steady setting in of the normal wester the indraught of the straits  on friday november 9 the weather broke and deluged us with rain at gibraltar the downpour lasted twentyfour hours we found ourselves at anchor before midnight with a very low barometer which suggested unpleasantries next morning we sighted the deep blue waters of the bay and the shallow brown waters of the bayside crested with foam by a furious norther that had powdered the far ronda highlands with snow before noon however the gale had abated and allowed me to transfer myself and african outfit on board the fez capt hay moroccan steamship company trading to north africa this was a godsend there is no regular line between gibraltar and lisbon and one might easily be delayed for a week  the few hours halt allowed me time to call upon my old friend m dautez a belgian artist apparently he is the only person in the place who cares for science he has made extensive collections he owns twentyfour coins from carteia whereas florez medallas madrid 1773 shows a total of only thirtythree amongst his antiquities there is a charming statuette of minerva a bronze miniature admirably finished he has collected the rock fauna especially the molluscs fossil and modern he is preparing an album of the flora calpensis his birds nests were lately sold to an englishman all these objects of immense local interest were offered by him at the lowest possible rate to the military library but who is there to understand their value i wonder how many englishmen on the rock know that they are within easy ride of the harbour which named the ships of tarshish tartessus which was carteia although certain german geographers would against the general voice of antiquity make the former the country and the latter the city lay on both sides of the little guadarranque stream generally called first river and the row of tumuli on the left bank probably denotes the site of the famous docks i was anxious to open diggings in 1872 but permission was not forthcoming now however they say that the duke of medina sidonia would offer no objections  gib though barbarous in matters of science is civilised as regards business it was a treat to see steamer after steamer puff in load up with blue peter at the fore and start off after a few hours which would have been days at patras zante and messina here men work with a will as a walk from the convent to the old mole the mersa or waterport of a moroccan town amply proves the uniforms are neat and nattythey were the reverse five years agoand it is a pleasure to look upon the fresh faces of english girls still unstained by unconsumed carbon and the authorities have had the good sense to preserve the old moorish town of tárik and his successors the triangle of walls with the tall towerlike mosque for apex and the base facing the bay  we left gibraltar at 5 pm on saturday december 10 giving a wide berth to the hated pearl rock which skippers would remove by force of arms seen from east or west gib has an outline of its own the britisher whose pride it is sees the lion of england who has laid his paw upon the key of the mediterranean and compares it with the king of beasts sejant the tail being europa point the spaniards to whom it is an eyesore liken it to a shrouded corpse the outlined head lying to the north and declare truly enough that to them it is a dead body  the norther presently changed to the rainy southwester the builder of the moroccan bars and the scourge of the coast fringing northwest africa rolling set in with the usual liveliness events were not eventful the first midnight found us off cape trafalgar and the second off st vincent at 4 pm december 12 we saw the light of espíchel promóntorium barbaricum the last that shines upon the voyager bound brazilwards before nightfall we had left buzio lighthouse to starboard we then ran up the northern passage in charge of a lagging pilot and as the lamps were lighting we found ourselves comfortably berthed off that pretty toy belem tower  next morning broke upon a lovely view no wonder that the tagus is the pride of portuguese bards the rosicler or rosy dawnlight was that of a may morningthe may of poetry not of meteorologyand the upper windows of distant lisbon were all ablaze with the unrisen sun it was a picture for the loveliest colours not for wordpainting and the whole scene was classical as picturesque we may justly say of it nullum sine nomine saxum far over the rising hills of the north bank rose shaggy cintra the most blessed spot in the habitable globe with its memorious convent and its moorish castle the nearer heights were studded with the oldestfashioned windmills when the newest are found even in the canaries a single crest bore its bakers dozen mostly decapitated by steam advancing we remarked the glorious belem monastery defiled by its ignoble modern ruin to the west the new hippodrome crowning the grassy slope the bed house of belem now being brightened up for royal residence during the exhibition of 1882 the memoria and the ajuda palace more unfinished if possible than ever as we approached the bulk of the city the marking objects were the cypressed prazeres cemetery the red necessidades palace and the estrella whose dome and domelets built to mimic st peters look only like hen and chickens then in due time came the carmo church still unrepaired since 1755 blackhorse square still bare of trees the government offices still propped to prevent a tumbledown and the old custom house still a bilious yellow the vast barracklike pile of s vicente the historic sé or cathedral with dumpy towers the black castle of são jorge so hardly wrung from the gallant moors and the huge santa engracia apparently ever to be a ruin  i spent a pleasant week at lisbon and had a fair opportunity of measuring what progress she has made during the last sixteen years we have no longer to wander up and down disconsolate    mid many things unsightly to strange ee  if the beggars remain the excessive dirt and the vagrant dogs have disappeared the tagus has a fine embankment but the land side is occupied by mean warehouses the sewers like those of trieste still want a cloaca maxama a general conduit of masonry running along the quay downstream the rocio has been planted with mean trees greatly to the disgust of the average lusitanian who hates such sunexcluding vegetation like a backwoodsman yet the quintella squarelet shows what fine use may be made of cactus and pandanus aloes and palms not to mention the ugly and useful eucalyptus the thoroughfares are far cleaner than they were and lisbon is now surrounded by good roads the new houses are built with some respect for architectonic effect of light and shade such fine old streets as the rua augusta offend the eye by façades flat as cards with rows of pips for windows finally a new park is being laid out to the north of the passeio publico  having always found olisipo exceptionally hospitable and pleasant i look forward to the days when she will be connected with paris by direct railway her hotels are firstrate her prices are not excessive her winter climate is delightful and she is the centre of most charming excursions the capital has thrown off much of her old lethargy her geographical society is doing hard and honest work she has nobly expiated the national crime by becoming a camonian city and she indulges freely in exhibitions one of ornamental art was about to be opened when i last saw her and it extended deep into the next spring    chapter ii  from lisbon to madeira  my allotted week in lisbon came to an end only too soon in the society of friends and in the camonian room bibliotheca nacional which contains nearly 300 volumes i should greatly have enjoyed a month the ss luso captain silva of the empresa insulana one of the very few portuguese steamers announced her departure for december 20 and i found myself on board early in the morning with a small but highly select escort to give me godspeed  unfortunately the may weather had made way for the cacimbas mists of a rainy souwester the bar broke and roared at us cintra the apex of lisbons extinct volcano and the mountain of the sun and moon hid her beautiful head and even the rock of lisbon disdained the normal display of sturdy flank then set in a brise carabinée which lasted during our voyage of 525 miles and the luso rolling like a moribund whale proved so lively that most of the fourteen passengers took refuge in their berths a few who resisted the seafiends assaults found no cause of complaint the captain and officers were exceedingly civil and obliging and food and wines were good and not costly  from madeira the luso makes once a month the tour of the azores touching at each islanda great convenienceand returning in ten days  early on thursday the 22nd the lumpy churning sea began to subside and the invisible balm seduced all the sufferers to the quarterdeck they were wild to sight madeira as children to see the rising of the pantomimecurtain there was not much to gaze at but what will not attract mans stare at seaa gull a turtle a flying fish by the by captain tuckey of the congo expedition remarked the extraordinary absence of seabirds in the vicinity of madeira and the canaries they have since learned the way thither porto santo appeared as a purple lump of three knobs a manner of gizzard island backed by a deeper gloom of cloudsmadeira then it lit up with a pale glimmer as of snow the effect of the sun glancing upon the thin greens of the northern flank and lastly it broke into two massesnorthern and southernof peaks and precipices connected by a strip of lowland  it is generally held that the discovery of the madeiran group 141819 was the first marking feature of the century which circumnavigated africa and that porto santo was invented by the portuguese before madeira the popular account however goes lame for instance the story that tried and sturdy soldiers and seamen were deterred from advancing a few miles and were driven back to portugal by the thick impenetrable darkness which was guarded by a strange noise and by anile fancies about the mouth of hell and cipango reads like mere stuff and nonsense again great are the difficulties in determining the nationality of the explorers and settling the conflicting claims of the french genoese portuguese spanish

this is also at best a negative argument the livy of portugal never mentions the great mathematician martin behaim who accompanied diego cam to his discovery of the congo in those days fair play was

lived as a mapper with his fatherinlaw and thence travelled between 1470 and 1484 to guinea where he found that the equatorial regions are not uninhabitable by reason of the heat he inherited the old

of small cattle and to produce cereals whose yield is said to have been 60 to 1 meanwhile it cut down for bowls mortars and canoes as the guanches did for shields its thin forest of dragons the dragoeiro dracaena draco linn palma canariensis tourn which an irish traveller called a dragonpalm owed its vulgar name to the fancy that the fruit contained the perfect figure of a standing dragon with gaping mouth and long neck spiny back and crocodiles tail it is a quaint tree of which any ingenious carpenter could make a model the young trunk is somewhat like that of the oreodoxa regia or an asparagus immensely magnified but it frequently grows larger above than below at first it bears only bristly ensiform leaves four feet long by one to three inches broad and sharppointed crowning the head like a giant broom then it puts forth gouty fingers generally five standing stiffly up and still capped by the thick yuccalike tufts lastly the digitations grow to enormous arms sometimes eighteen feet in girth of light and porous soft and spongy wood the tree then resembles the baobab or calabash the elephant or hippopotamus of the vegetable kingdom  amongst the minor uses of this dragon the sweet yellowish berries called masainhas were famous for fattening pigs the splinters made toothpicks which dipped in the juice secured health for human gums but the great virtue resided in the sanguis draconis the indian cinnabaris of pliny footnote nh xxxiii 38 who holds it to be the sanies of the dragon mixed with the blood of the dying elephant the same semimystical name is given to

the bark is wounded or fissured at first it is soft as that of the cherry but it hardens by exposure to a dry red lump somewhat like mummy it has no special taste when burnt the smell is faintly balsamic the produce was collected in canes and hence the commercial name dragons blood in reeds  mr p barker webb believed the dragoeiro to be a species peculiar to the madeiras and canaries but its chief point of interest is its extending through morocco as far as araboafrican socotra and through the khamiesberg range of southern africa where it is called the kokerboom as it is utterly african like the hippopotamus the zebra and the giraffe we must account by transplantation from socotra for the d draco seen by cruttenden in the mountains behind dhofar and on the hills of elyemen footnote journ r geogr soc p 279 vol viii of 1838 the line of growth like the coffeeshrub and the copaltree suggests a connection across the dark continent thus the similar flora of fernando po peak of camarones volcano and of the highlands of abyssinia seems to prove a latitudinal range traversing the equatorial regions where the glacial epoch banished for ever the hardier plants from the lower levels when humboldt determined it to be a purely indian growth he seems to have confounded the true dragon with a palm or some other tree supplying the blood it was a dazzling theory but unsound the few specimens in indusland its real country are comparatively young and are known to have been imported  the endogenous monster indigenous to the elysian fields is to the surrounding vegetation what the cockatrice is to the cock the wyvern to the python i should say was for all the replants at madeira and the canaries are modern and resemble only big toothsticks but dragons proper have existed and perhaps memories of these portents long lingered in the brain of protohistoric man even if they had been altogether fabulous the fanciful hellenic mind would easily have created them the dragoeiro

others again join them to southern europe and to northern america the old portuguese and certain modern realists make them a continuation of the serra de monchique in the algarves even as the azores

found him an excellent seaman and i deeply regretted his death   as early as 1827 the rambler in madeira mr lyall proclaimed the  theme utterly threadbare in consequence of every traveller opening  his quarto  with a short notice of it and he proceeded at once to  indite a fairsized octavo humboldt said something of the same sort in  his personal narrative and forthwith wrote the worst description of  the capital and the pike of tenerife that any traveller has ever  written of any place he confesses to having kept a meagre diary not  intending to publish a mere book of travels and drew his picture  probably from recollection and diminutive notebooks  i found funchal openhearted and openhanded as ever and the pleasure of my stay was marred only by two considerations both purely personal elysian fields and green countries do not agree with all temperaments many men are perfectly and causelessly miserable in the damp heats of western india and the brazil we must in their case simply reverse the wordsworthian dictum    not melancholyno for it is green  they are perfectly happy in the arabian desert and even in tenerife where others feel as if living perpetually on the verge of high fever  to this little misery were added the displeasures of memory our last long visit was in 1863 when the conde de farrobo ruled the land and when the late lord brownlow kept open house at the beautiful vigia i need hardly say that we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves the impressions of that good old time were deep and durable  amongst other things governor farrobo indulged his fair friends with a display of the old jogo de canas or running at the ring the praça academica had been rigged out to serve as a tiltingyard with a central alley of palisading and two stands grand and little the purpose was charitable and the performers were circushorses mounted by professionals and amateurs who thus renowned it before the public and their damas the circlet hanging to a line equalled the diameter of a small boys hat and when the knight succeeded in bearing it off upon his pole he rode up to be decorated by the hands of a very charming person with a ribbonbaudrière of bath dimensions

carefully avoid it in winter especially when we attempted the first part february being the very worst month after many days of glorious weather the temper of the atmosphere gave way the mercury fell to 285 and we were indulged with a succession of squalls and storms mists and rain the elemental rage it is true was that of your southern coquette sharp but short and broken by intervals of a loving relapse into caress in the uplands and on the northern coast however it shows the concentrated spleen and gloom of a climate in high european latitudes  we contented ourselves with the caminho do meio

donkey except in january and february it is still intensely stillthe very leaves seem to hang motionless this softness shows itself especially in the language which has none of the abruptness of european portuguese the sound is a drawling singsong the articulation is peculiar and the vocabulary is in some points confined to the island  the country people an active agile unmuscular race mostly preserve the old national dress some men still wear and both sexes once wore the ridiculous carapuça or funnelcap with a rattail for a tassel the rest of the toilet consists of homespun cottons shirts and knickerbockers with buff shoes or boots broadsoled and heelless the traveller who prefers walking should always use this chaussure and the little girl in topboots is still a standing joke the women affect particoloured petticoats of homemade baize or woollen stuff dyed blue scarlet brown or orange a scalloped cape of the same material bound with some contrasting hue and a white or coloured

boats to visit the southern coast east and west of funchal for the last twelvemonth mr blandys steamtug falcão has carried travellers to and fro it is a great convenience to the lazy sightseer who cares only to view the outside of things and here the outsides are the only things worth viewing  we will begin with the western trip to paül do mar affording a grand prospect of basaltic pillars and geological dykes and of the three featuresrocky sylvan and floral steaming by the mouth of the wady or ravine sao joão whose decayed toy forts s lazaro and the palacebattery are still cumbered with rusty cannon we pass under the cliff upon whose brow stand some of the best buildings these are the princess dona maria amelias hospicio or consumptive hospital built on mr lambs plans and now under management of the french soeurs whose gull wings are conspicuous at funchal the asylo or poorhouse opened in 1847 for the tempering of mendicancy and facing it in unpleasant proximity the portuguese cemetery decorated as to its entrance with sundry skulls and crossbones and showing its tall cypresses to the bay here comes the quinta comtesse lambert once occupied by queen adelaide the owner doubled the rent consequently las angustías the agonies as it was called from an old chapel has been unrented for the last two years a small pleasaunce overhanging a perpendicular cliff and commanding

charming countess tyszkiewicz landward it faces the rua da imperatriz which leads to the loo fields  the study of basaltic pillars at once begins loo fort is partly built upon them beyond vigia cliff we pass in succession three jagged islandrocks called gurgulhos or blackbeetles curculio which like the opposite foreshore admirably show the formation as a rule the columns are quadrangular i saw but few pentagons and hexagons we cast a look at a spouter of circular shape the forja and the forno a funnelformed blowingrock the cliff is pierced with a multitude of caves large and small and their regular arches look as if the ejected matter as happens with lava had cooled and solidified above while still flowing out in a fiery torrent below mostly however they are the work of wind and water  then comes the old gurgulho forta dwarf square partly thatched and converted into a private dwelling it lies below signal hill with its dwarf ruined tower a lumpy parasitic crater whose western slopes have been ruined by disforesting between the two runs the new road which owes its being to the grapefamine of 1852 it is the rotten row of funchal where horses tread the earth instead of skating and sliding over the greased pebbles and where fair amazons charge upon you like indian irregular cavalry five miles long it is the only level line of any extent in madeira and it wants but one thingprolongation the lion in the path however is cape girâo which would cost a treasure to tunnel or to cut into a corniche  the next feature is the ponta da cruz a fantastic slice of detached basalt here at the southernmost point of the island the descobridores planted a cross and every boatman doffs his cap to its little iron descendant beyond it comes the praia formosa a long line of shingle washed down by a deep ravine all these brooks have the same origin and their extent increases the importance of the wady in 1566 the french pirates under de montluc miscalled heretics hereges ugnotas landed here as indeed every enemy should the colour of fair reach is ashen grey scolloped with cinderblack where the creamy foam breaks for beauty it wants only golden sands and for use a few bathing machines  the next notable feature is the ribeira dos soccorridos river of the rescued where two of the zargos lads were with difficulty saved from the violent stream then flowing it is now provided with a long bridgecauseway of three arches approached by a chapel nossa senhora das victorias whose tiled and pillared porch reminds one of istria this bed is the drain of the grand curral called by the people das freiras because the holy women here took refuge from the plundering french lutherans the favourite picnicground is reached in three hours from funchal by two roads both winding amongst the papshaped hillocks which denote parasitic cones and both abutting upon the ravineside east and west the latter skirting the pico dos bodes of hegoats a tall cone seen from near funchal and sentinelling the great gap is the joyforever of midshipmites to the horror of the burriqueiro or syce they gallop hired screws highheeled as their grandams over paths at which an english stag would

the papers first appeared in the old original pall mall gazette august 26september 41877 and then were published in a volume by ward and lock 1880  the only cure of this pest known to madeira is the troublesome and expensive process practised by a veteran oenologist mr leacock  he bares every vineroot paints it with turpentine and resin and carefully manures the plant to restore its stamina mr taylor of funchal has successfully defended the vines about his townhouse by the simple tonic of compost but the lobos people have methinks done wisely to uproot the infected plant wholesale indeed from this point to the furthest west we hardly saw a vinestock they have supplied its place with gardenstuff an article which always finds a ready sale the island is annually visited by at least 500 english ships and there is a steady demand for green meat i am not aware that beetroot one of the best antiscorbutics has been extensively tried  off cama di lobos is the best tunnyfishing it is practised quite differently from the mediterranean style here the labyrinth of nets is supplanted by the line of 300 fathoms at night the bright fires on board the fishingcanoes make travellers

stormblast some writers have described them as ramifying like a tree and its branches and crossing and interlacing like the ties of a building as if sundry volcanic vents had a common centre below i saw nothing of this kind the dykes of light grey material sometimes hollowed out and converted into gutters by falling water appeared to have been shot up in distinct lines and the only crossing was

of such distinct superimpositions we counted in one place five there may have been many more all are altered soils as is shown by remains of trees and decayed vegetation  beyond cabo girão the scenery is grand enough but monotonous in the extreme the island is girt by a seawall more or less perpendicular from this coping there is a gentle upslope the marvellous terracing for cultivation being carried up to the mountaintops the lower levels are everywhere dotted with white farmhouses and brown villages the colours of the wall are the grey of basalt the purple of volcanic conglomerates and the bright reds and yellows of tufas here and there however a thread of water pouring from the summit or bursting from the flank fills a cavity which it has worn and turned for itself and from this reservoir the industrious peasant has diverted sufficient to irrigate his dwarf terraced plots of cane bananas yams or other vegetables not a drop of the precious fluid is wasted and beds are laid out wherever the vivifying influence can extend the waterrace down the wall is shown by mosses and lichens pellitories and rockplants curtains and hangers slides shrubs and weepers of the most vivid green which give life and beauty to the sternest stone  the only breaks in this regular coastwall are the spines and spurs protruding seawards the caverns in which the surges break and roar and the ribeiras or ravines whose heads are far inland and whose lines show grey second distances and blue third distances at their mouths lie the seabeaches and the settlements the latter with their towered churches and their large whitewashed houses look more like detached bits of city than our notion of villages other places are built upon heaps of débris washed down from the heights which hold out no promise of not falling again the huts scattered amidst the cultivation remind one of nothing but africa in some places too a soft layer of tufa has been hollowed for mans abode suggesting like the caves a fine old smugglingtrade as many as eight doors may be counted side by side in other places a rockledge or even a detached boulder has been converted into a house by masonrywalls we shall seldom see these savageries on the eastern coast of the island  the seafaring settlements are connected with the interior by breakneck paths and by rude steps slippery with green moss the people seem to delight in standing like wild goats upon the dizziest of jumpy peaks we see boys perched like birds upon impossible places and men walking along precipicefaces apparently pathless the villages are joined to one another by roads which attempt to follow the sealine the chasms are spanned by the flimsiest wooden bridges and the cliff is tunnelled or cut into a corniche  after disembarking passengers at ponta dagua and ribeira nova we passed the great landslip of 1805 lugar do baixo the heap of ruins has long been greened over the cause was evidently a waterfall which now descends freely it must have undermined the cliff which in time would give way so in the brazil they use water instead of blasting powder a trench is dug behind the slice of highland to be removed this is filled by the rains and the pressure of the column throws the rock bodily down we shall find this cheap contrivance useful when hydraulicking the auriferous clays of the gold coast  then we came to ponta do sol the only remarkable site on the trip famous for bodicemaking and infamous for elephantiasis here a huge column of curiously contorted basalt has been connected by a solid higharched causeway with the cliff which is equally remarkable showing a central boss of stone with lines radiating quaquaversally there are outer steps and an inner flight leading under a blind archway the latter supplied with a crane

twentyone direct knots and returned to her moorings crowded with passengers at halfpast five instead of halfpast four my companion m dahse and i agreed that the coast was well worth seeing  it would

but never so comfortably as when on board the steamtug falcão garajáo whose ruddy rocks of volcanic tufa embedding bits of lava probably entitled it brazenhead is worth inspecting from the sea

while the western abutment slopes to the water eastward however there has been immense degradation half the dome has been shaken down and washed away while a succession of upheavals and earthquakes

the foreign colony was hospitable as usual with dinners dances and christmas trees but amongst the people festivities seemed to consist chiefly of promenading ones best clothes about the military band and firing royal salutes not to speak of pistols and squibs the noise reminded me of natal amongst the cairene greeks here as in the brazil if you give a boy a copper he expends it not on lollipops but on fireworks we wished one another boas entradas the buon principio of italy and remembered the procession of seventeen years ago the lifesized figures coarsely carved in wood and dressed in real clothes were st francis st antonio de noto a negro madeiran catholics recognise no aristocracy of the skin a couple of married saints for even matrimony may be sanctified ss bono and luzia with half a dozen others the several platforms carried by the brotherhoods in purple copes were preceded by the clergy with banners and crosses and were followed by soldiers the latter then consisted of a battalion of caçadores 480 to 500 men raised in the island and commanded by a colonel entitled military governor they are small dark figures compared with the burly portuguese artillerymen stationed at the loo fort and são thiago battery and they are armed with old english sniders  behind the tree of penitence and the crosses of the orders came an ecce homo and a bit of the true cross shaded by a canopy the peasantry who crowded into townthey do so no longerknelt to kiss whatever was kissable and dodged up and down the back streets to gain opportunities even the higher ranks were afoot they used to acquire in infancy a relish for these mild amusements and one thing is to be noted in favour of the processions the taste of towndecoration was excellent and the combinations of floral colours were admirable perhaps there is too much of nosegay in madeira making us remember the line    posthume non bene olet qui bane semper olet  i went to the jesuit church to hear the predica or sermon the preacher does not part his hair amidships or display cambric and diamondrings yet his manner is none the less maniérée for him and his order in portugal as in spain the strictest minutiae of demeanour and deportment are laid down the body should be borne upright but not stuck up and when the congregation is addressed the chest is slightly advanced the dorsal region must never face the sacrament this would be turning ones back as it were upon the deity the elbow may not rest upon the cushion the head held erect but not haughtily should move upon the atlas gently and suavely avoiding lightness and undue vivacity the lips must not smile but when occasion calls for it they may display a saintly joy the eyebrows must not be raised too high towards the hairroots nor should one be elevated while the other is depressed the voice should be at times tremolando and the tone periodically singsong  finally the eyes are ordered to wander indiscriminately and with all pudicity over the whole flock and never to be fixed upon a pretty lamb  our countrymen are not overpopular in portugal or in madeira such mortal insults as those offered by byron to name only the corypheus will rankle and can never be forgotten in this island strangers especially englishmen have a bad practice of not calling upon the two governors civil and military the former visconde de villa mendo is exceptional he likes england and the english as a rule the highest classes mix well with strangers not so the medio ceto who under a constitutional régime rule the roast men with small fixed incomes have little to thank us for we make things dear and we benefit only the working men bourgeois exactions have driven both french ships and american whalers to tenerife and many of them would do the same with the english and german residents and visitors of funchal not a few have noble and historic names whose owners are fallen into extreme poverty professor azevedos book is also a nobiliaire de madère the last generation used to be remarkably prim and precise in dress as in language and manner they never spoke of hogs or horns and they wore the skimpy waistcoats and the regulation whiskers of wellingtons day the fair sex appeared only at functions at church and at the sunday promenade in the place the moderns dress better than their parents who affected the most violent colours an exceedingly pink pink upon a remarkably green green and the shape of the garment was an obsolete caricature of london and paris they no longer assume the peculiar waddle looking as if the lower limbs were unequal to the weight of the upper story but the walk never equals that of the spanish woman this applies to portugal as well the strong points here as in the peninsula are velvety black eyes and blueblack hair dressed à la diane it is still the fashion as at lisbon to look somewhat boudeuse when abroad by way of hint that man must not expect too much yet these cross faces at home or with intimates are those of bonnes enfants lastly the dark complexions and the irregular features do not contrast well with the charming faces and figures of tenerife who mingle the beauty of guanchedom with that of spain and ireland  the list of public amusements at funchal is not extensive years ago the theatre was converted into a grainstore and now it is a winestore the circus of lumber has been transferred from under the peak fort to near the sea it mostly lacks men and horses the germans have a tolerable lending library and the public bibliotheca in the town house near the jesuit church is rich in old volumes mostly collected from religious houses in 1851 the books numbered 1800 now they may be 2000 kept neat and clean in two rooms of the fine solid old building of course the collection is somewhat mixed foxs martyrs and the lives of the saints standing peacefully near the encyclopédie and voltaire a catalogue can hardly be expected  there are three masonic lodges and two portuguese clubs one good the other not and the former club funchalense well lodged in a house belonging to viscountess torre bella gives some twice or three times a year very enjoyable balls the café central with estaminet and french billiardtable is much frequented by the youth of the town but not by residents the great institution is the club called the english rooms which has been removed from over a shop in the aljube to viscondessa de torre bellas house in the rua da alfandega the british consulate is under the same roof and next door is messieurs blandys ubiquitous steamer agency the roomy and comfortable quarters with a fine covered balcony looking out upon the sea are open to both sexes the collection of books is old but the sum of 100l laid out on works of reference would bring it fairly up to the level of the average english countryclub strangers names were hospitably put down by any proprietary member as guests and visitors if they did not outstay the fortnight otherwise they became subscribers but crowding was the result and the term has been reduced to three days a months subscription however costs only 10s 6d the doors close at 730 pm i used to think this an oldworld custom kept up by the veteran hands but in an invalid place perhaps it is wisely done  the principal passetemps at madeira consists of eating drinking and smoking it is the life of a horse in a loose box where the animal eats pour passer le temps after early tea and toast there is breakfast à la fourchette at nine an equally heavy lunch or rather an early dinner no 1 appears at 1 to 2 pm afternoon tea follows and a second dinner at 6 to 7 residents and invalids suppress tiffin and dine at 2 to 3 pm in fact as on board ship people eat because they have nothing else to do and english life does not admit of the sensible french hoursdéjeuner à la fourchette at 11 am and dinner after sunset  the first walk through funchal shows that it has not improved during the last score of years and to be stationary in these days is equivalent to being retrograde it received two heavy blowsin 1852 the vinedisease and since that time a gradual decline of reputation as a sanatorium yet it may i think look for a better future when the land bill law system extending to england and scotland will cover the continent with colonies of british rentiers who rejoice in large families and small incomes moreover angloafrican officials are gradually learning that it is best to leave their wives and wees at madeira and the coming mines of the gold coast will greatly add to the numbers for the economist funchal and its environs present peculiar advantages the dearness of coin appears in the cheapness of houses and premises estates which cost 5000l to 15000l a generation ago have been sold to demerarists for onetenth that sum palmeira for instance was built for 42000l and was bought for 4000l a family can live quietly even keeping ponies for 500l per annum and it is something to find a place four to seven days sail from england inhabitable to a certain extent all the year round the mean annual temperature is 673 degrees that of summer varies from 70 degrees to 85 degrees and in winter it rarely falls below 50 degrees to 60 degrees the range which is the most important consideration averages 9 degrees with extremes of 5 degrees to 35 degrees the moist heat is admirably adapted for old age and i doubt not that it greatly prolongs life youth english youth cannot thrive in this subtropical air there are certain advantages for education at funchal but children are sent north as from angloindia to be reared otherwise they will grow up yellow and languid without energy or industry and with no object in life but to live  madeira has at once gained credit for comfort and has lost reputation as a sanatorium a subject upon which fashion is peculiarly fickle during the last century the faculty sent its incurables to lisbon and montpellier despite the mistral and the fatal vent de bise the latter town then lodged some 300 english families of invalids presently reduced to a few economists and winemerchants succeeded nice and pisa one of the most wearying and relaxing of sick bays and pau in the pyrenees of which the native béarnais said that the year has eight months of winter and four of inferno madeira then rose in the world and a host of medical residents sounded her praises till mentone was written up and proved a powerful rival and the climate of the hotdamp category was found to suit mainly if not only that tubercular cachexy and those bronchial affections and lunglesions in which the viscus would suffer from the overexcitement of an exceedingly dry air like the light invigorating medium of tenerife or thebes lastly when phthisis was determined to be a disease of debility of anæmia of organic exhaustion and of defective nutrition cases fitted for madeira were greatly limited here instruments deceive us as to humidity the exceeding dampness is shown by the rusting of iron and the tarnishing of steel almost as effectually as upon the west african coast yet mr vivians observations assuming 100 to be saturation made torquay 76 and funchal 73 footnote others make the mean humidity of funchal 76 and remark that in the healthiest and most pleasant climates the figures range between 70 and 80 moreover it was found out that consumption as well as intermittent fevers are common on the island so common indeed as to require an especial hospital for the poorer classes although the people declare them to have been imported by the stranger i may here observe that while amongst all the nations of southern europe great precautions are taken against the contagion of true phthisis english medicos seem to ignore it a pisan housekeeper will even repaper the rooms after the death of a consumptive patient at funchal sufferers in every stage of the disease live in the same house and even in the same rooms  then came the discovery that for consumptives dry cold is a medium superior to damp heat invalids were sent to the tyrol to the engadine to canada and even to iceland where phthisis is absolutely unknown and where a diet of oleaginous fish is like feeding upon codliver or sharkliver oil the air as well as the diet proved a tonic and patients escaped the frequent cough catarrh influenza and neuralgia which are so troublesome at funchal here too the invalid must be accompanied by a prudent and watchful friend or friends and the companions will surely suffer i know few climates so bad and none worse for those fecund causes of suffering in europe liveraffections mucous fevers diarrhoeas and dysenteries for nervous complaints tic douloureux and neuralgia or for rheumatism and lumbago asthma is one of the disorders which shows the most peculiar forms and must be treated in the most various ways here some sufferers are benefitted others are not madeira is reputedly dangerous also for typhoid affections for paralysis and for apoplexy there is still another change to come the valley north of the beautiful and ever maligned dead sea of palestine where the old knights templar had their sugarmills and indigomanufactories has peculiar merits lying some 1350 feet below the mediterranean it enables a man to live with a quarter of a lung you may run till your legs fail with fatigue but you can no more get out of breath than you can sink in the saline waters of lake asphaltites when a railway from jafa to jerusalem shall civilise the holy land i expect great things from the sites about the jordan embouchure  after the gadding vine had disappeared the people returned to their old amours the sugarcane whose five loaves disposed crosswise gave the island her heraldic cognisance madeira first cultivated sugar in the western hemisphere and passed it on to the new world yet the cane was always worked under difficulties space is limited the upper extreme of cultivation on the southern side may be estimated at 1000 feet the crop exhausts the soil the plant requires water and it demands what it can rarely obtain in quantitymanure again machinery is expensive and adventure is small jamaica and her slavelabour soon reduced the mills from one hundred and fifty to three and now five my hospitable friend mr william hinton is the only islander who works sugar successfully at the torreão the large rival mill with the tall regulation smokestack near the left mouth of the ribeira de são joão though inscribed omnia vincit improbus labor and though provided with the most expensive modern appliances is understood not to be a success for the companhia fabril dassucar  here sugarworking in the present day requires for bare existence high protective duties the government however has had the common sense and the madeirans patriotic feeling enough to defend their industry from certain ruinous vagaries by taxing imported growths 80 reis 4d per kilo a hardgrit freetrader would abolish this abomination and ruin half the island and here i would remark that in england the world has seen for the first time a wealthy and commercial a great and generous nation proclaim and take pride in proclaiming the most immoral doctrine free trade so called i presume because it is practically the reverse of free or fair trade openly abjures public spirit and the chief obligation of the citizento think of his neighbour as well as himself and not to let charity end as it often begins at home buy cheap and sell dear is the law delivered by its prophets the whole duty of the merchant and the man when its theorists ask me the favourite question would you not buy in the cheapest market i reply yes but my idea of cheapness is not yours i want the best no matter what its price because it will prove cheapest in the end how long these freetrade fads and fooleries will last no one can say but they can hardly endure till that millennium when the world accepts the doctrine and when free trade becomes free trade and fair trade  as regards petite industrie in madeira there is a considerable traffic in products of native industry sold to steamerpassengers the list gives

native mutton was described in 1842 as strong in flavour and lean in condition in fact very little superior to that of trieste now it is remarkably good and will be better silk i have said has not been fairly tried and the same is the case with ginger cotton suffered terribly from the worm chinchona propagated from cuttings not from the seed did well dr grabham footnote the climate and resources of madeira by michael c grabham md frgs frcp london churchill 1870 tells us that the coffeeberry ripens and yields a beverage locally thought superior to that of the imported kinds it has

to eat the figs or prickly pears bananas grow well and a large quantity is now exported for the english market but the climate does not agree with european fruits and vegetables strawberries and french beans are equally flavourless i remarked the same in the glorious valley of the lower congo it must result from some telluric or atmospheric condition which we cannot yet appreciate  tobacco has been tried with some success though the results do not equal those of the canaries there however the atmosphere is too dry here it is not the estanco monopoly and the chronic debt to those who farm the importtax long compelled the public to pay dear for a poor article homegrowth was forbidden till late years now it is encouraged and ratepayers contribute a small additional sum hitherto however results have not been overfavourable because i believe the tobaccobeds have been unhappily placed rich valleysoils and seaslopes as at cuban vuelta de abajo and syrian latakia are the proper habitats of the holy herb here it is planted in the high dry grounds about the peak fort and the uplands east of the city manure also is rare and dear and so is water which by the by is sadly wasted

claro which smoked very mild and a short escuro which tasted a trifle bitter the blacks complained that they were too new and i should rank them with the average produce of brazilian bahia a papered cigarilha clad in an outer leaf of tobacco was exceptionally good the cígarros cigarettes neatly bound in bundles of twentyfive were of three kinds fortes strong entrefortes and fracos mild all were excellent and full of flavour they did not sicken during the voyage and i should rank them with the farfamed bragança of the brazil  the most successful of these small speculations is that of mr e

shakespeare in henry iv  makes drouthy jack sell his soul on good friday for a cup of madeira and a cold capons leg mr h vizetelly whose professional work should be read by all who would master the subject marvels why and how this magnificent wine went out of fashion the causes are many all easy to trace men not yet very old remember the day when england had no vino de pasto fit to be drunk at meals when they found only ports sherries and loaded clarets and when they sighed in vain for light rhine or bordeaux growths good ordinaire being to drink what bread is to food  footnote this however is a mere individual opinion i have lately read a book recommending strong and wellbrandied wines as preventing the crave for pure alcohol  now however the national taste has changed the supply of madeira not sufficing for the demand the class called boticarios apothecaries brought rivals into the market and extensive imitations with apples loquats japanese medlars and other frauds brandied to make the stuff keep plastered or doctored with parisplaster to correct overacidity and coloured and sweetened with burnt sugar and with boiled must mosto to mock the madeira flavour gave the islandproduce a bad name again the revolution in the winetrade of 186061 brought with it certain continental ideas in france a glass of madeira follows soup and in austria it is drunk in liqueurglasses like tokay  footnote madeira is the island modification of the cyprus and the candia  grape tokay comes from the languedoc muscatel and constantia from burgundy like most of the rhinewines  the island wine must change once more to suit public taste at present it ships at the average strength of 18°25° per cent of proof spirit which consists of alcohol and water in equal proportions for that purpose each pipe is dosed with a gallon or two of porto santo or são vicente brandy this can do no harm the addition is homogeneous and chemically combines with the grapejuice but when potatospirit and canerum are substituted for alcohol distilled from wine the result is bad the vintage is rarely ripened by time whose unrivalled work is imperfectly done in the estufa or fluestove the old fumarium or in the sertio apotheca an attic whose glass roofing admits the sun the voyage to the east indies was a clumsy contrivance for the same purpose and now the merchants are beginning to destroy the germs of fermentation not by mere heat but by the strainer extensively used in jerez the press shown to me was one of messrs johnson and co which passes the liquor through eighteen thick cottons supported by iron plates it might be worth while to apply electricity in the form used to destroy fuseloil lastly the wine made for the market is a brand or a blend not a vintagewine  at any of the armazems or stores you can taste the wines of 70 75 76 and so forth of a 1 quality and you can learn their place as well as their date of birth but these are mixed when wine of a particular kind is required and the produce becomes artificial what is now wanted is a thin light wine red or white with the madeira flavour and this will be the drink of the future the nowforgotten tisane de madère and the rainwater madeira made for the american markets a soft delicate and strawcoloured beverage must be the models  i sampled the new wines carefully and with due remembrance of the peaches in gil blas i came to the conclusion that they are no longer what they were the wine is tainted with sulphur in its odorous union with hydrogen it is unduly saccharine fermenting irregularly and insufficiently for years the plant has constantly been treated against oidium with antiseptics which destroy the spores and germgrowths and we can hardly expect a firstrate yield from a chronicallydiseased stock still the drink is rich and highly flavoured and under many circumstances it answers better than any kind of sherry no more satisfactory refreshment on a small scale than a biscuit and a glass of bual moreover the palate requires variety and here finds it in a harmless form but as a daily drink madeira should be avoided even in the island i should prefer french bordeaux not english claret with an occasional change to burgundy meanwhile london particular is a fact and the supply will probably exceed the demand of the present generation  i also carefully sampled the wines of the north coast which had not as in funchal been subjected to doctoring by stove by spirits and by blend they are lighter than the southern but if unbrandied some soon turn sour and others by keeping get strong and heady the proportion of alcoholism is peremptorily determined by climatethat is the comparative ratio of sun and rain in europe for instance light wines cannot be produced without liquor as the trade calls aqua pura by latitudes lower than germany and southern france when heat greatly exceeds moisture the wines may be mild to mouth and nose yet they are exceedingly potent witness the vino doro of the libanus  at funchal i also tasted a very neat wine a vin de pays with the island flavour and not old enough to become spirituous if the vine be again grown in these parts its produce will be drunk in england under some such form but madeira has at last found her manifest destiny she will be an orchard to northern europe and like the england of the future a kitchengarden to the west african coast especially the gold mines  my sojourn at the isle of wood and its lotuseating which means double dinners came to an end on sunday january 8 the ss senegal captain w l keene bringing my longexpected friend cameron of african fame the last day passed pleasantly enough in introducing him to various admirers and we ate at santa clara a final dinner perfectly conscious that we were not likely to see its like for many a month we were followed to the beach by a choice band of wellwishersbaron adelin de vercour colonel h w keays young and dr strutherswho determined upon accompanying us to tenerife the night was black as it well could be and the white surf rattled the clicking pebbles as we climbed into the shoreboat with broad cheekpieces and were pulled off shipwards on board we found mr william reid junior who had carefully lodged our numerous impediments and at 10 pm we weighed for tenerife  i must not leave the isle of wood which has so often given me hospitality without expressing a hearty wish that the portuguese government now rhyming with impediment will do its duty by her the canaries and their free ports which are different from free trade have set the best example and they have made great progress while the madeiras have stood still or rather have retrograded the funchal customhouse is a pest the import charges are so excessive that visitors never import and for landing a single parcel the ship must pay high portcharges where no port exists the population is heavily taxed and would willingly pronounce if it could only find a head the produce instead of being spent upon the island is transmitted to lisbon surely a portion of it might be diverted from bureaucratic pockets and converted into an emigration fund it is sad to think that a single stroke of the ministerial pen would set all right and give new life to the lovely island and yet that the pen remains idle  and a parting word of praise for madeira whatever the traveller from europe may think of this quasitropical tyrol those homewardbound from asia and africa will pronounce her a paradise they will enjoy good hotels comfortable tables dhôte and beef that does not resemble horseflesh or unsalted junk nor is there any better place wherein to rest and recruit after hard service in the tropics moreover at the end of a month spent in perfect repose the visitor will look forward with a manner of dismay to the plunge into excited civilised life  but madeira is not played out au contraire she is one of those obligatory points for commerce which cannot but prosper as the world progresses the increasing traffic of the west african coast will make men resort to her for comforts and luxuries for climate and repose and when the gold mines shall be worked as they should be this island may fairly look forward to catch many a drop of the golden shower  the following interesting table given to me by m

running of the union s s c and the comfortable castle line alias the cape steamers  the b and a ss senegal is a fair specimen of the modern west african trader improved unfortunately the improvements affect the shareholders pockets rather than the passengers persons the sleepingberths are better but the roomy welllighted comfortable old saloon sadly shorn of its fair proportions has become the

companionable  both lines however are distinctly traders they bind themselves to no time they are often a week late and they touch wherever demand calls them the freightcharges are exorbitant three pounds for fine goods and a minimum of thirtysix shillings when fifteen per ton would pay the white star line therefore threatens concurrence let us also hope that when the gold mines prosper we shall have our special steamers where the passenger will be more prized than the puncheon of palmoil but future rivals must have a care they will encounter a somewhat unscrupulous opposition and they had better ship american crews at any rate not liverpudlians  the night and the next day were spent at sea in a truly delicious climate which seemed to wax softer and serener as we advanced here the moon

mixed with these palaces were catfaced cottages and pauper mildewed tenements whose rusty ironwork tattered planks and broken windows gave them a truly dreary and dismal appearance the sole noticeable

late d sebastian casilda collected by his father a merchantcaptain de long cours it was a chaos of curiosities ranging from china to peru amongst them however were four entire mummies including one from grand canary thus we can correct m berthelot who follows others in asserting that only the guanches of tenerife mummified their dead the oldest description of this embalming is by a judicious and ingenious man who had lived twenty years in the island as a physitian and merchant it was inserted by dr thomas sprat in the transactions of the royal society london and was republished in john ogilbys enormous folio footnote the physitian was dr eden an englishman who visited tenerife in 1662bohns humboldtr i 66 yclept africa the merchant set out from guimar a town for the most part inhabited by such as derive themselves from the antient guanchios in the company of some of them to view their caves and the corps buried in them a favour they seldom or never permit to any having the corps of their ancestors in great veneration and likewise being extremely against any molestation of the dead but he had done many eleemosynary cures amongst them for they are very poor yet the poorest think themselves too good to marry with the best spaniard which endeared him to them exceedingly otherwise it is death for any stranger to visit these caves and bodies the corps are sewd up in goatskins with thongs of the same with very great curiosity particularly in the incomparable exactness and evenness of the seams and the skins are made close and fit to the corps which for the most part are entire the eyes closd hair on their heads ears nose teeth lips and beards all perfect onely discolourd and a little shrivelld he saw about three or four hundred in several caves some of them standing others lying upon beds of wood so hardened by an art they had which the spaniards call curay to cure a piece of wood that no iron can pierce or hurt itfootnote the same writer tells that they had earthen pots so hard that they could not be broken i have heard of similar articles amongst the barbarous races east of dalmatia these bodies are very light as if made of straw and in some broken bodies he observd the nerves and tendons and also the string of the veins and arteries very distinctly by the relation of one of the most antient of this island they had a particular tribe that had this art onely among themselves and kept it as a thing sacred and not to be communicated to the vulgar these mixt not themselves with the rest of the inhabitants nor marryd out of their own tribe and were also their priests and ministers of religion but when the spaniards conquerd the place most of them were destroyd and the art perisht with them onely they held some traditions yet of a few ingredients that were usd in this business they took butter some say they mixed bearsgrease with it which they kept for that purpose in the skins wherein they boyld certain herbs first a kind of wild lavender which grows there in great quantities upon the rocks secondly an herb calld lara of a very gummy and glutinous consistence which now grows there under the tops of the mountains thirdly a kind of cyclamen or sowbread fourthly wild sage which grows plentifully upon this island these with others bruised and boyld up into butter rendered it a perfect balsom this prepard they first unbowel the corps and in the poorer sort to save charges took out the brain behind after the body was thus orderd they had in readiness a lixivium made of the bark of pinetrees wherewith they washt the body drying it in the sun in summer and in the winter in a stove repeating this very often afterward they began their unction both without and within drying it as before this they continud till the balsom had penetrated into the whole habit and the muscle in all parts appeard through the contracted skin and the body became exceeding light then they sewd them up in goatskins the antients say that they have above twenty caves of their kings and great personages with their whole families yet unknown to any but themselves and which they will never discover lastly the physitian declares that bodies are found in the caves of the grand canaries in sacks quite consumed and not as these in teneriff  this assertion is somewhat doubtful apparently the practice was common to the archipelago it at once

rounded the perceptive region was well developed and the reflective as usual amongst savages and barbarians was comparatively poor the facial region appeared unusually large  the industrial implements were coarse needles and fishhooks of sheepbone the domestic supellex consisted of wooden ladles coarsely cut and of rude pottery red and yellow generally without handles roundshaped and adorned with scratches none of these ganigos or crocks were painted like those of grand canary they used also small basaltic querns of two pieces to grind the gofio footnote the gofio was composed of ripe barley toasted pounded and kneaded to a kind of porridge in leathern bags like turkish tobaccopouches the object was to save the teeth of which the guanches were particularly careful or parched grain the articles of dress were grasscloth thick as matting and tamarcos or smockfrocks of poorly tanned goatskins they had also rough cords of palmfibre and they seem to have preferred plaiting to weaving yet

peru they were used to record dates and events a few were of reddish agate a material not found in the island these resembled bits of thick pipestem varying from half an inch to an inch in length perhaps they were copies of the mysterious popobead found upon the slave coast and in inner africa  the gruanches were doomed never to reach the age of metal their civilisation corresponded with that of the chinese in the days of fohi footnote abel rémusat tells us that of the two hundred primitive chinese hieroglyphs none showed a knowledge of metal the chief weapons were small triangles of closegrained basalt and iztli obsidian flakes for tabonas or knives both being without handles they carried rude clubs and banot or barbed spears of pinewood with firecharred points the garrotes pikes had heads like two flattened semicircles a shape preserved amongst negroes to the present day our old author tells us that the people would leap from rock to rock sometimes making ten fathoms deep at one leap in this manner first they tertiate their lances which are about the bigness of a halfpike and aim with the point at any piece of a rock upon which they intend to light sometimes not half a foot broad in leaping off they clap their feet close to the lance and so carry their bodies in the air the point of the lance comes first to the place which breaks the force of their fall then they

mere bone wanting tarsus and metatarsus the stomach was full of dried fragments of herbs ohenopodium c and the epidermis was easily reduced to powder in this case as in the other three the mortuary skins were coarsely sewn with the hair inside it is a mistake to say that the work was like that of a glove  no 2 was largestatured and complete the framework and the form of the pelvis were masculine the skin adhered to the cranium except behind where the bone protruded probably the effect of long resting upon the ground near the right temporal was another break in the skin which here appeared much decayed all the teeth were present but they were not particularly white nor good the left forearm and hand were wanting and the right was imperfect the lower limbs were well preserved even to the toenails  no 3 also of large size resembled no 2 the upper limbs were complete and the lower wanted only the toes of the left foot the lower jaw was absent and the upper had no teeth an oval depression about an inch in its greater diameter lay above the right orbit if this be a bulletmark the mummy may date from before the final conquest and submission in ad 1496 but it may also have resulted from some accident like a fall or from the blow of a stone a weapon which the guanches used most skilfully mr sprat confirmed by glas affirms that they throw stones with a force almost as great as that of a bullet and now use stones in all their fights as they did antiently  no 4 much smaller than the two former was the best preserved the shape of the skull and pelvis suggested a female the arms also were crossed in front over the body whereas in the male mummy they were laid straight the legs were covered with skin the hands were remarkably well preserved and the nails were darker than other parts the tongue in all four was absent having probably decayed  these crania were distinctly oval the facial angle well opened and ranging from 80° to 85° counterbalanced the great development of the face which showed an animal type a little hair remained coloured ruddychestnut and straight not woolly the entrails had disappeared and the abdominal walls not existing it was impossible to detect the incisions by which the tannobalsamic substances noted by bory de saintvincent and many others were introduced the method appears uncertain it is generally believed that after removing the entrails through an irregular cut made with the tabona or obsidian knife the operators who as in egypt were of the lowest caste injected a corrosive fluid they then filled the cavities with the balsam described above dried the corpse and after fifteen to twenty days sewed it up in tanned goatskins such appears to have been the case with the mummies under consideration  the catacombs

guancheland by no means proves that the emigration took place when the canaries formed part of the continent the same was the case with the australians the tasmanians and the new zealanders the guanches at the same time were admirable swimmers easily able to cross the strait nine miles wide separating lanzarote from la graciosa they could even kill fish with sticks when in the water the

knickerbockers with black velveteen overalls looking as if pointed before and behind brown hose or long leather gaiters ornamented with colours and untanned shoes despite the heat many wore the

unpleasant memory of wales some hundreds of men women and children were working on the road and we were surprised by the beauty of the race its classical outlines oval contours straight profiles

la villa lies some two miles and a half from and about 1140 feet above the puerto and the streets are paved and precipitous as any part of funchal the population varied from 7000 to 8000 souls whereas the lower town had only 3500 it contains a few fine houses with huge hanging balconies and interior patios courts which would accommodate a regiment they date from the gente muy caballerosa knightly

guajara 8903 feet  riding over the pumicebeach of a once fiery sea whose glare and other accidents suggested the desert between cairo and suez we made our way towards the rastrojito this little stubble is a rounded heap of pumice a southern offset of the main mountain on the left rose the montana negra black mountain and the lomo de la nieve snow ridge a dark mass of ribbed and broken lavas 8970 feet in which summersnow is stored a little black kid half wild was skipping over the rocks our men pursued it with the garrotes alpenstocks loudly shouting tio jose uncle joseph however escaped running like a guanche here it is allowed to shoot the animals on condition of leaving a shilling with the skin the latter is used in preparing the national gofio the guanche ahoren the kuskusu of northwestern africa the polenta or daily bread of the neolatins  climbing the rastrojito slopes we sighted the pedras negras these are huge travelled rocks of basalt jetblack breaking with a conchoidal fracture and showing debris like onioncoats about their base the aspect was fantastic resembling nothing so much as skulls 10 to 15 feet high they are doubtless the produce of the upper slopes which by slow degrees gravitated to the present pumicebeds  the first step of the pike is las canadas whose glacis forms the cumbre or pumiceplains 6500 feet the long dorsum which shows far out at sea bending abruptly to the east we began to breast the red pumicebed leading to the estancia de abajo or de los inglezes el es inglez porque subio al pico he is english because he climbed the pike say the people this ramp whose extreme angle is 26 degrees bordered by thick bands of detached lavarocks is doubtless the foundationmatter of the pike hence the latter is picturesquely termed hijo de las canadas footnote especially by d benigno carballo wanguement in his work las afortunadas madrid 1862 a happy title borrowed from d francisco escobar heyley cosmography quoted by glas and mrs murray tells us of an english ambassador who deeming his own land the fortunate islands protested against pope clement vi so entitling the canaries in a deed of gift to d luis de la cerda the disinherited conde de claramonte the latter was deprived of the crown of castile by his uncle sancho iv and became the founder of the medina celi house  after a total climb and ride of six hours we reached the english station m eden aug 13 1715 footnote trans royal soc of london 171416 calls it simply stancha and m borda station des rochers pere feutree a frenchman who ascended in 1524 and wrote the earliest scientific account had baptised it station de st francois de paul and set up a cross it is a shelf in the pumiceslope 9930 feet high and protected against the cold nightwinds of the northnortheast the lower or polar current by huge boulders of obsidian like gigantic sodawaterbottles the routine traveller sleeps upon this level a few hundred yards square because the guides store their fuel in an adjacent bed of black rocks humboldt miscalls the station a kind of cavern and a little above it he nearly fell on the slippery surface of the compact shortswarded turf which he had left 4000 feet below him  the bâtmules were unpacked and fed and a rough bed was made up under the lea of the tallest rock where a small curral of dry stone kept off the snow this as we noticed in madeira is not in flakes nor in haillike globes it consists of angular frozen lumps and the selvage becomes the hardest ice some have compared it with the swiss firn snow stripped of fine crystals and granulated by time and exposure in march the greatest depth we saw in the gullies radiating from the mountaintop was about three feet but in the cold season all must be white as a bridecake and fatal accidents occur in the canada drifts professor piazzi smyth characterises the elevated region as cold enough at night and stormy beyond measure in winter when the southwester or equatorial upper current produces a fearful climate yet the pike summit lies some 300 feet below the snowline 12500 feet  the view was remarkable we were in sight of eighty craters at sunset the haze cleared away from the horizon which showed a straight greyblue line against a blushing sky of orange carmine pale pink and tender lilac passing through faint green into the deep dark blue of the zenith in this cumbre or upper region the stars did not surprise us by their brightness at 6 pm the thermometer showed 32 degrees f the air was delightfully still and pure footnote we had no opportunity of noticing what mr addison remarks the air becoming sonorous and the sound of the sea changing from grave to acute after sunset and during the night he attributes this increased intensity to additional moisture and an equability of temperature in the atmospheric strata perhaps the silence of night may tend to exaggerate the impression and death mummifies but does not decay  a bright fire secured us against the piercing dry nightcold and the arrieros began to sing like capirotes footnote the capirote or tinto negro a grey bird with black head sylvia atricapilla is also found in madeira and much resembles the eastern bulbul or persian nightingale it must be caged when young otherwise it refuses to sing and fed upon potatos and bread with milk not grain an enthusiast following humboldt p 87 describes the joyous and melodious notes of the bird as the purest incense that can ascend to heaven bulbuls sundry seguidillas and el tajaraste the music may be heard everywhere between morocco and sind it starts with the highest possible falsetto and gradually falls like a wail all in the minor clef  we rose next morning with nipped feet and hands which a cup of hot coffee with speedily corrected and were en route at 430 am formerly animals were left at the lower estancia now they are readily taken on to alta vista my wife rode a surefooted black nag i a mule which was perfect whilst the footlong lever acting curb lay loose on its neck returning we were amazed at the places they had passed during the moonless night  our path skirted the estancia de los alemanos about 300 yards higher than the english and zigzagged sharply up the pumiceslope the talus now narrowed the sidewalls of dark trachytic blocks pinching it in at this grisly hour they showed the quaintest figurestowers and pinnacles needles and treetrunks veiled nuns and monstrous beasts amongst them were huge bombs of obsidian and masses with translucent vitreous edges that cut like glass most of them contained crystals of felspar and pyroxene  after half an hour we reached the dwarf platform of alta vista 700 feet above the estancia and 10730 in round numbers above sealevel the little shelf measuring about 100 to 300 yards at the head of the fork where the northeastern and the southwestern lavastreams part is divided by a medial ledge here we saw the parent rock of the pumice fragments an outcrop of yellowish brown stone like fractured and hardened clay the fourfooted animals were sent back one rides up but not down such places  passing in the lower section the shell of a house where the astronomers  footnote the author came out in 1856 to make experiments in astronomical observations scientific men have usually a contempt for language we find the same in our inheritanse c dalby  co london 1877 where the poor modern hierogrammats are not highly appreciated but it is a serious blemish to find montana blanco malpays chahzorra for chajorra and tiro del guanches the author also is wholly in error about guanche mummification he derides p 329 the shivering and shaking of his canarian guide under a cloudy sky of 40°f when the sailor enjoyed it in their glorious strength of saxon  constitution but when the latter were oppressed and discouraged by dry heat and vivid radiation manoel was active as a chamois why should enduring cold and not heat be held as a test of manliness  experiment had been tried guide manoel pointed out the place where stood the tormentos as he called the instruments thence we toiled afoot up the mal pais this bad country is contradictorily described by travellers glas ad 1761 makes it a sheet of rock cracked crosswise into cubes humboldt 1799 says the lava broken into sharp pieces leaves hollows in which we risked falling up to our waists von buch 1815 mentions the sharp edges of glassy obsidian as dangerous as the blades of knives wilde 1857 tamely paints the scene as a magnified roughcast prof piazzi smyth is as usual exact but he suggests more difficulty than the traveller finds i saw nothing beyond a succession of ridgebacks and shrinkagecrevasses disposed upon an acute angle these ragged angular and mostly cuboidal blocks resembling the icepack of st lawrence river have apparently been borne down by subsequent lavacurrents which however lacked impetus to reach the lower levels of las cañádas  springing from boulder to boulder an exhilarating exercise for a time over a surface of horrible roughness as prof dana says of hawaii we halted to examine the cueva de hielo whose cross has long succumbed to the wintry winds the icehouse in a region of fire occupies a little platform like the ruined base of a pompeys pillar this is the table upon which the neveros pack their stores of snow the cave a mere hole in the trachytic lava opens to the east with an entrance some four feet wide the general appearance was that of a large bubble in a baked loaf inside we saw a low ceiling spiky with stalactites possibly icicles and a coating of greenish ice upon the floor a gutter leads from the mouth showing signs of waterwear and the blocks of trachyte are so loaded with glossy white felspar that i attempted to dust them before sitting down  local tradition connects this icecave with the famous burialcavern near ycod on the northern coast this would give a tunnel 8 miles long and 11040 feet high many declare that the meltings ebb and flow with the seatide and others recount that lead and lines of many fathoms failed to touch bottom we are told about the normal dog which fell in and found its way to the shore through the cave of ycod de los vinos in the latter a m auber spent four hours without making much way in parts he came upon scatters of guanche bones mr robert edwards of santa cruz recounted another native traditionthat before the eruption of ad 1705 there was a run of water but no cave mr addison was let down into it and found three branches or lanes the longest measuring 6070 feet what the neveros call el hombre de nieve the snowman proved to be a honeycombed mass of lava revetted with icedrippings he judged the cave to be a crater of emission and did not see the smoke or steam issuing from it as reported by the icecollectors  professor p smyth goes i think a little too far in making this contemptible feature compose such a quarrel as that between the english eruptionist and the continental upheavalist deciding a disputed point that elevation is a force and a method in nature he explains the cave by the explosion of gases which blew off the surface of the dome when the heavy sections of the lavaroof unsupported from below fell downward again wedging into and against each other so as nearly to reform their previous figure but the unshattered state of the stones and the rounded surfaces of the sides show no sign of explosion the upper piton is unfitted for retaining water which must percolate through its cinders pumices and loose matter into many a reservoir formed by blowingholes snow must also be drifted in and retain the cold moisture would be kept in the cavern by the low conducting power of its walls so lyell found on etna a bed of solid ice under a lavacurrent possibly also this cave has a frozen substratum like many of the icepools in north america  we then toiled up to another little estancia a sheltered rockgirt hollow the floor of snow or rather frozen rain was sprinkled with red dust and fronts the wind with sharp icy points rising at an angle of 45° here despite the penetrating cold we gravely seated ourselves to enjoy at ease the hardly won pleasures of the sunrise the pallid white gleam of dawn had grown redder brighter and richer an orange flush the first breaking of the beams faintly reflected from above made the sky before a deep and velvety blackblue look like a gilt canopy based upon a rim of azure mist the brilliancy waxed golden and more golden still the blending of the colours became indescribably beautiful and lastly the suns upper limb rose in brightest saffron above the dimmed and spurious horizon of northeast cloud the panorama below us emerged dimly and darkly from a torrent of haze whose waving convex lines moving with a majestic calm wore the aspect of a deluge whelming the visible world martin the great might have borrowed an idea from this waste of waters as it seemed to be heaving and breaking surging and sweeping over the highest mountaintops we saw nothing of the immense triangular gnomon projected by the pilon as far as gomera island footnote at sunset of july 10 1863 i could trace it extending to grand canary darkening the southern half and leaving the northern in bright sunshine the right limb was better defined than the left  and gradually contracting as the lamp of day rises item we saw nothing of the archipelago like a map in relief the latter however is rarely visible in its entirety disappointment  during the descent we had a fair prospect of the canarian triquetra somewhat like madeira it has a longitudinal spine of mountains generically called las cañádas but whilst the volcanic ridge of the isle of wood runs in a latitudinal line the junonian cordillera has a whorl the ancient as well as the modern seat of eruption around the island appeared to be a rim as if the seahorizon formed a raised saucera common optical delusion at these altitudes  as we advanced the mal pais became more broken the bad step was ugly climbing and we often envied our men who wore heelless shoes of soft untanned leather with soles almost as broad as they were long the roughness of the trachytic blocks however rendered a slip impossible at 645 we reached the second floor of this threestoried volcano here 11721 feet high the guides call it the pico del pilon because it is the ancient peakcrater and strangers the rambleta not rembleta volcano which strewed las cañádas with fiery pumice and which shot up the terminal head conical as a cylinder  it has now become an irregular and slightly convex plain a mile in diameter whose centre is the terminal chimney its main peculiarity is in the fumaroles or escapes of steam and mofetti mephitic emanations of limpid water and sulphurvapour of these we counted five narices within as many hundred yards their temperature greatly varies 109° and 158° fahr being perhaps the extremes my thermometer showed 130° these soupiraux or respiradouros are easily explained the percolations from above are heated to steam by stones rich in grough brimstone here it was that humboldt saw apparent lateral shiftings and perpendicular oscillations of fixed stars and our admiralty not wishing to be behind him directed professor p smyths attention to scintillations in general only the youngest of travellers would use such a place as an observatory and only the youngest of observers would have considered this libration of the stars an extraordinary phenomenon  directed by a regular line of steampuffs we attacked el pilon the third story the most modern cone of eruption the dwarf chimney which looks like a thimble from the sea the lower third was of loose crumbling pumice more finely comminuted than we had yet seen this is what humboldt calls ashcones there was also a strew of porphyritic lavachips covered with a red ochreous  crust presently we reached a radiating rib of lately ejected lava possibly the ridge of a dyke brown below and gradually whitening with sulphuric acid as it rose towards the craterwalls the resting took longer than the walking up the steep talus and at 745 after a total of nine hours and a mornings work of two hours and a half which occupied two in descending we stood upon the corona or lip of teyde  the height of the tenerife pike once held the loftiest in the world is 12198 feet in round numbers 12200 thus it stands nearly at the altitude of mont blanc 15784 feet above the chamounix valley a figure of 12284 feet the slope from the base is 1 in 46 the direct distance from orotava on the map measures 105 miles along the road 18 according to the guides the terminal chimney and outlet for vapours which would erupt elsewhere rises 520 feet from its pedestal the central rambleta and its ascent generally occupies an hour one visitor has reduced this montagne pelée to 6070 feet and compares it with the dome of a glasshouse from below it resembles nothing so much as a cone of dirty brown cassonade and travellers are justified in calling it a sugarloaf i can hardly rest satisfied with von buchs description teyde is a pointed tower surrounded by a ditch and a circular chain of bastions  the word teyde is supposed to be a corruption of echeyde meaning hades hence the title isla infierno found in a map of ad 1367 the guanches also called it ayadyrma and here placed their pandemonium under guayota the headfiend the countryfolk still term the craterring la caldera de los diablos en que se cuecen todas las provisiones del infierno the devils caldron wherein are cooked all the rations of the infernals seen by moonlight or on a starlit night the scenery would be weird and ghostly enough to suggest such fancies which remind us of etna and lipari  i had been prepared by descriptions for a huge chasmlike crater or craters like those on theon ochéma camerones peak i found a spoonshaped hollow with a gradual slope to the centre 100 × 150 feet deep the greater length of the oval running northeast where the side is higher to southwest where there is also a tilt of the cup the floor was a surface of burning marl and whitish earthy doughlike paste the effect of sulphurous acid vapours upon the argile of the lava this stratum was in places more than 80 feet thick and fumes rose fetid with sulphuric acid and sulphates of soda alumina and ammonia from the dead white purple red vivid green and brilliant yellow surface of the solfatara hence the puffs of vapour seen from below against the sparkling blue sky and disappearing like huge birds upon the wings of the wind hence too the tradition of the mast and the lateen sail a dig with the guanche magada or lanza the island alpenstock either outside or inside the crater will turn up under the moist white clay lovely trimetric crystals of sulphur with the palest straw tint deepening to orange and beautifully disposed in acicular shapes the acid eats paper and the colours fade before they leave the cone  footnote dr wilde 1837 analysed the sulphur as follows silica 81·13 water 8·87 and a trace of lime others have obtained from the mineral when condensed upon a cold surface minute crystals of alum mr

cold air neatly removes all cloth in contact with the surface more than one excursionist has shown himself in that humphrey clinker condition which excited the wrath of count tabitha it is evident that teyde is by no means exhausted and possibly it may return to the state of persistent eruption described by the eyewitness ca da mosto who landed on the canaries in ad 1505  not at all impressed with the grandeur of the inferno we walked round the narrow rim of the cratercirque and were shown a small breach in the wall of porphyritic lava facing west mrs murrays authorities describe the caldera as being without any opening if this be the case the gap has lately formed the cold had driven away the lively little colony of bees birds and butterflies which have been seen disporting

repulse of nelson from santa cruz de tenerife  footnote from the relacion circumstanciada de la defensa que hizo la plaza de santa cruz by m monteverde published in madrid 1798  the following pages afford a circumstantial and i believe a fairly true account of an incident much glossed over by our naval historians the subject is peculiarly interesting at santa cruz as at fontenoy the irish whom harsh measures at home drove for protection to more friendly lands took ample share in the fighting which defeated englands greatest sailor again the shortsighted policy which sent to the crimea 20000 british soldiers to play second instrument in concert with 40000 frenchmen thus lowering us in the eyes of europe made nelson oppose his 960 hands to more than eight times their number the day may come when the attack shall be repeated now that steam has rendered fleets independent of southwest winds it is to be hoped the assailant will prefer day to night so that his divisions can communicate that he will not land in the raging surf of the ebbtide and that he will attack the almost defenceless south instead of the wellfortified north of the city  already the heroic island had inflicted partial or total defeat upon three english admirals footnote grand canary also did her duty by beating off in october 1795 drakes strong squadron in april 1657 the roundhead general at sea admiral sir

lossesfifty killed and 500 wounded  footnote the late mr hepworth dixon life of blake p 346 describes the open roadstead of santa cruz as a harbour shaped like a horseshoe and defended at the north side of the entrance by a regular castle in p 350 we also read of the bay and its entrance any hydrographic chart would have set him right  in 1706 during the spanish war of succession admiral

nobles in the castles lower rooms and swore them to loyalty the english attempted to disembark and were beaten back whereupon as under nelson they sent a parliamentary and summoned the island to surrender to the archduke charles of austria the envoy informed the governor who is described by dampier as sitting in a low dark uncarpeted room adorned only with muskets and pikes that philip v had lost gibraltar that cadiz and minorca had nearly fallen and that the american galleons in the port of vigo had been burnt or captured by the english whose army entering castile had overrun aragon catalonia and valencia the braves reply was if philip our king had lost his all in the peninsula these islands would still remain faithful to him and the castle guns did such damage that the jennings squadron sailed away on the same evening  the third expedition detached by admmiral sir john jervis afterwards earl st vincent to cut out a richly freighted manilla ship also resulted in a tremendous

of sixteen occupied our front the other twentythree took the direction of the bufadero valley a wild gap two or three miles to the north of the harbour  an alarm signal was immediately made in the town when the enemy returned to his ships and made his troops prepare to disembark at ten am the three frigates towed by their boats cast anchor out of cannonshot near the bufadero whilst the other vessels plied to windward footnote at the time the weather was calm in the town but a violent levante or east wind prevented vessels from approaching the bay where the lee shore is very dangerous and disembarked about 1200 men on the beach of valle seco between the town and the valley this party occupied the nearest hill before it could be attacked its movements showed an intention to seize the

would have been enabled to land fresh troops during the night and after gaining the heights and roads leading to the town to attack us in flank as well as in front  light troops were detached to annoy the invader and they soon occupied the passes with praiseworthy celerity and boldness one party was led by the capitaine de frégate citizen ponné footnote james calls him zavier pommier he commanded

a large ship in the roads he carried her after an hours work safe out of gunshot only 15 men were wounded including lieutenant hardy this officer was at once put in command of the mutine which he had so gallantly won and by the lieutenant de vaisseau citizen faust both officers who had been exchanged and restored at the same port showed much presence of mind on this occasion and on july 25 they applied to be posted at a dangerous point of attackthe beach to the south of the town near puerto caballas beyond where the lazaretto now lies when the enemy purposed assaulting a more central post they came up at the moment of the affair ending in our victory  a second party was composed of the infantry battalion of the canaries footnote this battalion afterwards distinguished itself highly in

the enemy saw these troops he formed in five companies near his fieldgun lieutenantcolonel creagh was joined by some 500 men of the laguna militia and their lieutenant don nicholas quintin garcia followed by the peasantry of the adjoining districts under the alcalde or mayor of taganana these and all the other troops were liberally supplied with provisions by the ayuntamiento municipality of the island  on the next morning july 23 our scouts being sent down to the valley found that the enemy had disappeared during the night notwithstanding which the marquess de las palmas ordered a deliberate fire to be kept up in case of surprise our general when informed of the event recalled the troops the marquess who unfortunately received a fall which kept him hors de combat for many days footnote i find pencilled in the original volume que caida tam oportuna what a lucky fall obeyed with his command at 5 pm leaving behind him thirty men under don felix uriundo second lieutenant of the battalion of canaries don juan creagh did the same with his men but as the french commandant reported that some of the enemy were still lurking about the place our generalinchief directed captain don santiago madan second adjutant of the same corps to reconnoitre once more the valle seco with 120 rozadores this duty was well performed despite the roughness of the paths and the excessive heat of the sun  the enemys squadron now seemed inclined to desist from its attempt at 6 am of july 23 rearadmiral nelsons flagship which with the other ships of the line had kept in the offing drew near and signalled the frigates to sheer off from the point and to rejoin the rest of the squadron these however at 3 pm allowed themselves to drop down the coast towards the dangerous southern reaches between barranco hondo beyond the quarantinehouse and the village of candelaria distant a days march from santa cruz to prevent their landing men captain don antonio eduardo and the special engineer don manuel madera reconnoitred the shore about puerto caballas to see if artillery could be brought there meanwhile sublieutenant don cristobal trinidad of the guimar regiment watched with fifty of his men the coast near san isidro footnote here the landing is easiest which is not far from barranco hondo the squadron however retired to such a distance that it could hardly be discerned from the town as it bore se 14 e notwithstanding which all preparations were made to give the enemy a warm reception  at daylight on july 24 the squadron again appeared crowding on all sail to gain the weatherside the lookout at anaga point north of the island signalled three ships from that direction and two to the south where we could distinguish only one of fifteen guns which was presently joined by the rest at 6 pm the enemy anchored with his whole force on the same ground which the frigates chose on the 22nd and feinted to attack paso alto fort our general and chiefs were not deceived foreseeing that we should be assaulted in front and to the right or south footnote the town of santa cruz runs due north and south in a right line the bay affords no shelter to shipping and the beach is rocky they made their dispositions accordingly without however neglecting to protect the left  at 6 pm a frigate and the bombketch approached paso alto and the latter opened fire upon the fort and the heights behind it these positions were occupied by 56 men of the battalion of the canaries 40 rozadores under second lieutenant don felix uriundo and 16 artillerymen commanded by sublieutenant of militia artillery don josef cambreleng footnote a flemish name i believe the family is still in the island of 43 shells however only one fell in the fort bursting in a place where straw for soldiers beds had been stored and this like the others did no damage footnote a fragment of this shell is preserved in the fort chapel for the edification of strangers paso alto commanded by the captain of the royal corps of artillery don vicente rosique replied firmly at the same time don juan del castillo sublieutenant of militia with 16 men reconnoitred by h e the governors orders the valle seco the operation was boldly performed despite the darkness of night and other dangers and our soldiers returned with a prisoner an irish sailor of the fox cutter who had swum off from his ship  the enemy now prepared his force for the attack one thousand five hundred men footnote james numbers 200 seamen and marines from each of the three lineofbattle ships and 100 from each of the three frigates besides officers servants and a small detachment of royal artillery this made a total of 1000 to 1060 men commanded by captain afterwards admiral sir thomas troubridge bart nelson despatches vol ii p 43 says 600 to 700 men in the squadron boats 180 on board the fox and about 70 or 80 in a captured boat total at most 960 as we were afterwards informed well armed with guns pistols pikes swords saws and hatchets and led by their best officers among whom was the rearadmiral embarked in their boats at 215 am july 25 they put off in the deepest silence the frigate of the philippine islands company anchored outside the shipping in the bay discovered them when close alongside almost at the same moment the paso alto fort under lieutenantcolonel don pedro de higueras and the captain of artillery don vicente rosique gave the signal to the saluting battery of san antonio footnote this old work à fleur deau still remains and near it are the ruins of the bateria de los melones on land bought by the davidson family in the town held by the captain of militia artillery don patricio madan they alarmed the citizens by their fire and the enemy attacked with rare intrepidity  the defence was gallantly kept up by the battery of san miguel under sublieutenant of artillery don josef marrero by the castle of san pedro footnote the san pedro battery dated from 1797 it defended the southern town with six embrasures and three guns en barbette for many years huge mortars and old guns lay outside this work under the captain of artillery don francisco tolosa by the provisional battery de los melones

the town are also the bateria de la rosa near the coalsheds and the santa isabel work the latter had 22 fine brass guns each of 13 centimètres made at seville once a famous manufactory  however captain don diego fernandez calderia trained four guns to bear upon the beach which was protected by the laguna militia regiment under lieutenantcolonel juan de castro  so hot and welldirected was our fire that almost all the boats were driven back and the fox cutter with her commander and 382 of the landing partyothers said 450also carrying a reserve store of arms and ammunition was sunk footnote nelson loc cit says 180 men were in the fox and of these 97 were lost so captain brenton naval history says 97 in vol ii p 84 speaking of trafalgar he informs us that the french ship indomptable 84 m hubart was wrecked off rota where her crew said to be 1500 men all perished add except m maffiote of tenerife and about 143 others rearadmiral nelson lost his right arm before he could touch ground and was compelled to return to his flagship with the other officers of his boat all badly wounded footnote the grapeshot was fired from the castle of san pedro others opine from san cristobal and the canarese say that a splinter of stone did the work according to most authorities nelson was halfway up the mole james declares that nelsons elbow was struck by a shot as he was drawing his sword and stepping out of his boat in nelsons despatches loc cit we read that the mole was instantly stormed and carried although defended by 400 or 500 men and the gunssix 24pounderswere spiked but such a heavy fire of musketry and grapeshot was kept up from the citadel and houses at the head of the mole that we could not advance and nearly all were killed the brave captain bowen was killed on the first step of the mole a volley of grape tearing away his stomach footnote this officer is said to have caused the expedition by describing it to admiral jervis and the british government as an easy exploit he had previously cut out of this bay a philippine island frigate el principe fernando and he had with him as guide a chinese prisoner taken in that vessel the guide was also killed captain bowens family made some exertions to recover certain small articles which he carried about himwatch pistols cand failed one pistol was lost and for the other its possessor modestly demanded 14l nineteen other englishmen were struck down by a discharge of grape the gun which fired it had on that same night been placed by the governor of the castle of san cristobal don josef monteverde footnote there is a note in my volume father of the adopted son miguelito morales at a new embrasure which he caused to be opened in the flank of the bastion footnote this part of the castle has now been altered and mounted with brass 80pounders  thus it commanded the landingplace where before there was dead ground the enemy afterwards confessed that the injury thus done was the first cause of his misfortunes  notwithstanding the rearadmirals wound and the enemys loss in men and chief officers a single boat carrying captain and commodore troubridge covered by the smoke and the darkness landed at the caleta footnote caleta means literally a cul de sac at santa cruz it is applied to a rocky tract near the customhouse battery in those days it was the place where goods were disembarked  beach at the same time the main body of the english who had escaped the grape of the castle of san cristobal and the batteries la concepcion and san telmo disembarked a little further south at the barranquillo del aceyte footnote this ditch is now built over and converted into a drain it runs a little above the present omnibus stables at the butcheries and at the barranco santo footnote also called de la cassonaof the dogfishthat animal being often caught in a charco or pool in the broad watercourse so those baptised in the parish church are popularly said to have been dipped in the waters of the dogfish pool the levies of havana and cuba posted in the butcheries under second lieutenant don pedro de castilla being unable to repulse the enemys superior force retreated upon the battalion of infantry of the canaries consisting of 260 men and officers including the militia this corps supported by two fieldguns footnote in the original canones violentos ie 4pounders 6pounders or 8pounders ably and energetically worked by the pilots nicolas franco and josef garcia did such damage that the english were in turn compelled to fall back upon the beaches of the barranco and the butcheries  these were the only places where the enemy was able to gain a footing in the town he marched in two columns one with drums beating by the little square of the parish church la concepcion to the convent of santo domingo footnote afterwards pulled down to make room for a theatre and a marketplace and the other to the plaza footnote plaza here means the square behind the castle in other places it applies to the fortified part of the town of the san cristobal castle his plan of attack was to occupy the latter post but he was driven back from the portcullis after losing one officer by the hot fire of the militiacaptain don esteban benitez de lugo thus driven back to the caleta the invaders marched along the street called de las tiendas footnote it is now the cruz verde in those days it was the principal street the galle del castello holding at present that rank then showed only scattered houses they then drew up at the head of the square maintaining a silence which was not broken by nine guns discharged at them by the captain of laguna chasseurs don fernando del hoyo nor by the aspect of the two fieldpieces ranged in front of them by the mayor who was present at all the most important points in the centre of the line the cause was discovered in an order afterwards found in the pocket of lieut robinson rm it ran to this effectfootnote this and other official documents are translated into english from the spanish according to our naval despatches and histories the senior marine officer who commanded the whole detachment was captain thomas oldfleld rm the relacion circumstanciada declares that the original is in the hands of don bernardo cologan y fablon another irishspanish gentleman who united valour and patriotism he was seen traversing sabre in hand the most dangerous places encouraging the men and attending to the wounded so zealously that he parted even with his shirt for bandaging their hurts  july 24 night  siryou will repair with the party under

charged with distributing rations  the english seized it wounding dons patricio power and casalon who after receiving two blows with an axe escaped they then obliged under parole the deputy power and don luis fonspertius to conduct into the castle a sergeant sent to parly our commandantgeneral when summoned to surrender the town within two minutes under pain of its being burned returned an answer worthy of his honour and gallantry such a proposal he remarked requires no reply and in proof thereof he ordered the party to be detained footnote according to james who follows troubridges report the sergeant was shot in the streets and no answer was received  meanwhile our militiamen harassed the first column of the enemy compelling it by streetfighting to form up in the little squares of santo domingo and of the parish church our commandantgeneral was startled when he found that this position cut off direct communication between san cristobal and the battalion of the canaries whose fire like that of the militiamen on the right suddenly ceased but he was assured that the battalion was unbroken and all the central posts except the mole were supported by the report of lieutenant don vicente siera this officer had just attacked with 30 men of that battalion the enemys boats as they lay grounded at the mouth of the barranco santo dislodging the defenders who had taken shelter behind them and making five prisoners the english were stopped at the narrow way near the base of the pier by the hot fire of the troops under captain and adjutant of chasseurs don luis roman the nine militiamen under don francisco jorva the sergeant of the guard domingo mendez and a recruit of the havana levy these made fortyfour prisoners including six officers whilst twelve were wounded our commandantgeneral was presently put out of all doubt by don josef monteverde this governor of san cristobal when informed that 2000 englishmen had entered the town intending probably to attack the castle with the scalingladders brought from their boats resolved himself to inspect the whole esplanade and accordingly reconnoitred the front and flank of the citadel  all our advantages were wellnigh lost by a report which spread through the garrison when our firing ceased a cry arose that our chief was killed and that as the english who had taken the town were marching upon la laguna they must be intercepted at the cuesta or hill behind santa cruz it is easy to conceive what a panic such rumours would cause among badly armed and halfdrilled militia the report arose thusour commandantgeneral seeing the defenders of the battery at the foot of the mole retreating and hearing them cry que nos cortan we are cut off sallied out with don juan creagh and other officers the port captain the town adjutant and the chief collector of the tobaccotax after ordering the corps of chasseurs 89 men and 9 officers to fire our chief returned leaning upon the arm of don juan creagh and some inconsiderate person thought that he was wounded fortunately this indiscretion went no further than the chasseur battalion of the canaries and the militiamen on our right  when this battalion was not wanted in its former position it was ordered to the square behind the citadel the movement was effected about daybreak by don manuel salcedo lieutenant of the king footnote an old title now changed given to the military governor of santa cruz and the second highest authority in the archipelago marshal odonnell was teniente del rey at tenerife and he was born in a house facing the cross in the main square of santa cruz that officer had never left his corps patrolling with it along the beaches where the enemy disembarked and he had sent to the barracks twentysix prisoners besides three whom he captured at san cristobal when the battalion was formed up and no enemy appeared the adjutantmajor enquired about them in a loud voice meanwhile the laguna militia who in two divisions each of 120 men under lieutcol don juan baptista de castro had been posted from san telmo to the grariton footnote meaning a large garita or sentrybox it is a place near the windmills to the south of the town were also ordered to the main square in two separate parties they marched one in direct line the other by upper streets to cut off the enemys retreat and place him between two fires as the latter however entered the little square of santo domingo their commander lieutcol de castro hearing a confusion of tongues mistook for spaniards and frenchmen the english who were holding it thereupon the enemy fired a volley which killed him and a militiaman and wounded many whilst several were taken prisoners  the attackers presently manned the windows of santo domingo and kept up a hot fire against our militiamen they then determined to send an officer of marines to our commandantgeneral once more demanding the surrender of the town under the threat of burning it at the order of lieutcol don juan guinther the parliamentary was conducted to the citadel by captain don santiago madan our chief replied only that the city had still powder ball and fighting men  thereupon the affair recommenced one battalion came up with two fieldguns to support its friends and several militiamen died honourably exposing themselves to the fire of an entrenched enemy our position was further reinforced by the militiapickets that had been skirmishing in the streets and by the greater part of those who deceived by a false report had retired to the slopes of la laguna  already it was morning when a squadron of five armed boats was seen making for our right our brave artillerymen had not the patience to let them approach but at once directed at them a hot fire especially from the mole battery under don francisco grandi that officer accompanied by the second constable manuel troncos had just passed from the citadel footnote la ciudadela to the north of the mole is not built as we read in colburn u s magazine january 1864 on an artificial wall it has a moat casemates loopholes and twelve bouches à feu for plunging fire the lines will connect with la laguna and complete the defences of the capital to the battery in question and had removed the spikes driven into the guns by citoyen françois martiney when he saw them abandoned footnote the english diary shows that the spaniards had spiked the guns the principal castle and the mole batteries supported by that of la concepcion rained a shower of grape at a long range with such precision that three boats were sunk and the two others fell back upon the squadron at the same time the port captain and flag officer of the frigate ordered his men to knock out the bottoms of eighteen boats which the enemy after his attack had left on the beach  the english posted in the convent seeing the destruction of their reinforcements lost heart and persuaded the prior fray carlos de lugo and the master fray juan de iriarte to bear another message to our chief the officer commanding the enemys troops declared himself ready to respect the lives and property of those about him provided that the royal treasury and that of the philippine company were surrendered otherwise that he could not answer for the consequences  this deputation received the same laconic reply as those preceding it seeing the firmness of our commandantgeneral and the crowds of peasantry gathering from all parts the enemys courage was damped and his second in command captain samuel hood came out to parley this officer perceiving that the militiamen who had joined the chasseurs were preparing to attack signalled with a white flag a cessation of hostilities and our men were restrained by the orders of don fernando del hoyo both parties advanced to the middle of the bridge where they were met by lieutenantcolonel don juan guinther commanding the battalion of the canaries who could speak many languages and by the adjutantmajor don juan battaler these officers also withheld their men who were opening fire as they turned the corner of the street in which a little before don rafael fernandez a sublieutenant of the same corps had fallen shot through the body whilst heading an attack upon the enemy  with a white flag and drums beating the english officer accompanied by those who had already parleyed with our commandantgeneral marched to the citadel at the bridge of the street de las tiendas he was met by the lieutenant of the king by the sergeantmajor of the town by lieutenantcolonel creagh by captain madan carrying the flag of truce and by the town adjutant who conducted him with eyes bandaged to the presence of our chief captain hood did not hesitate again to demand surrender which was curtly refused this decision and the chances of destruction in case of hostilities continuing made him alter his tone at length both chiefs came to terms the instrument was written by captain hood and was at once ratified by captain thomas troubridge commanding hbms troops the following is a copy of the terms agreed upon with the governor of the canary islands  footnote the original is in the nelson papers it is written by captain hood and signed by him captain troubridge and the spanish governor  santa cruz july 251797  that the troops c belonging to his britannick majesty shall embark with their arms of every kind and take their boats off if saved and be provided with such others as may be wanting in consideration of which it is engaged on their part that the ships of the british squadron now before it shall in no way molest the town in any manner or any of the islands in the canaries and prisoners shall be given up on both sides  given under my hand and word of honour  saml hood  ratified by  t troubridge commander of the british troops jn antonio gutierrez comtegen de las islas de canaria  this done captain samuel hood was escorted back to his men by those who had conducted him to the citadel  at this moment a new incident occurred at sea the squadron convinced of the failure of its attempt began to get under way already hbms ship theseus carrying the rearadmirals flag and one of the frigates had been swept by the current to opposite the valley of san andres footnote a gorge lying to the north of the town like the valle seco and the bufadero from its martellotower the lieutenant of artillery don josef feo fired upon them with such accuracy that almost every shot told the theseus losing a yardarm and a cable she replied with sundry broadsides whilst the bombketch which had got into position discharged some ten shells and yet was so maltreated one man being killed and another wounded that she was either crippled or hoisted on board by the enemy  when the terms of truce were settled the english troops marched in column out of the convent and reaching the bridge of the barranquillo del aceyte fired their pieces in the air then with shouldered arms and drums beating they made for the mole passing in front of our troops and of the french auxiliaries who had formed an oblong square in the great plaza behind the citadel from whose terrace our chief watched them  when captain hood suddenly sighted his implacable enemies the french he gave way to an outbreak of rage and violent exclamations and he even made a proposal which might have renewed hostilities had he failed to give prompt satisfaction he presently confessed to having gone too far and renewed his protestations to keep the conditions of peace  boats and two brigantines island craft were got ready to receive the british troops at the mole meanwhile our commandantgeneral ordered all of them to be supplied with copious refreshments of bread and wine a generous act which astonished them not less than the kindness shown to their wounded by the officials of the hospital they hardly knew how to express their sense of a treatment so different from what they had expected during their cruise from cadiz their officers hoping to make them fight the better told them that the canarians were a ferocious race who never gave quarter to the conquered  our chief invited the british officers to dine with him that day they excused themselves on the plea that they must look after their men upon whom the wine had taken a strong effect and deferred it till the morrow they also offered to be the bearers of the tidings announcing our success and to carry to spain all letters entrusted to their care our chief did not hesitate to commit to their charge under parole his official despatches to the crown and all the correspondence was couched in terms so ingenuous that even the enemy could not but admire so much moderation  during the course of the day the english reembarked bearing with a guard of honour the corpses of captain bowen and of another officer of rank footnote this is fabulous captain richard bowen than whom a more enterprising able and gallant officer does not grace hms naval service was the only loss of any consequence all the rest were lieutenants they who had stripped off his laced coat when he expired in a cell of the santo domingo convent footnote in spanish two saints claim the title santo viz domingo and thomas all the rest are san disfigured his face and dressed him as a sailor the wounded twentytwo in number did not leave the hospital till next day among them was lieutenant robinson in the agonies of death  rearadmiral sir horatio nelson hearing the politeness the generosity and the magnanimity with which our commandantgeneral followed up his success and feeling his own noble heart warm with grateful sentiments dictated to him an official letter which he signed for the first time with his left hand footnote the original of this peculiarly interesting document written on official paper was kept in a tin box under lock at the captaingenerals office santa cruz and in 1864 it was transferred to the archives of madrid the writing is that of a secretary who put by mistake 1796 for 1797 a copy of it published in harrisons life of nelson vol i p 215 was thence transferred to nicolass despatches and letters it is bonâ fide the first appearance of nelsons signature with his left hand despite the number of first signatures owned by the curious of england  to his excellency don antonio gutierrez commandantgeneral of the canary islands  his

señor mio de mi mayor attencion footnote this courteous castilian phrase would lose too much by translationi have received with the greatest pleasure your estimable communication the proof of your generosity and kindly feeling my belief is that the man who follows only the dictates of humanity can claim no laurels and to this may be reduced all that has been done for the wounded and for those who disembarked i must consider them my brethren the moment hostilities terminate  if sir in the state to which the ever uncertain fortunes of war have reduced you either i or anything which this island produces could afford assistance or relief it would afford me a real pleasure i hope that you will accept two demijohns of wine which is i believe not the worst of our produce  it would be most satisfactory to me if i could personally discuss when circumstances permit a subject upon which you sir display such high and worthy gifts in the meantime i pray that god may preserve your life for many and happy years  i am sir  your most obedient and attentive servant  signed don antonio gutierrez  santa cruz de tenerife july 26 1797  ps i have received and duly appreciated the beer and the cheese with which you have been pleased to favour me  pps i recommend to your care sir the petition of the french which commodore troubridge will have reported to you in my name  to admiral don horatio nelson   such was the end of an event which will ever be memorable in the annals of the canarian islands when we know that on our side hardly 500 men armed with firelocks entered into action and that the 97 cannon used on this occasion and requiring 532 artillerymen were served by only 320 gunners of whom but 43 were veterans and the rest militia footnote according to james who follows the report of captain troubridge vol ii p 427 there were 8000 spaniards and 100 frenchmen under arms unfortunate clio when we remember that we took from the enemy a fieldgun a flag footnote this was

soldier of the havana depôt 1 ditto of cuban ditto 1 militia artilleryman and 5 french auxiliaries this however does not include those suffering from contusions amongst whom was don juan rosel sublieutenant of the provincial regiment of orotava whereas the enemy lost 22 officers and 576 men footnote nelson despatches vol ii p 424 says 28 seamen 16 marines killed total 44 90 seamen 15 marines wounded 97 seamen and marines drowned 5 seamen and marines missing total killed 141 wounded 105 and grand total 246 hors de combat the total of 251 casualties nearly equals that of the great victory at cape st vincentwhen i say we take into consideration all these circumstances we cannot but consider our defence wonderful and our triumph most glorious  we must not forget the gallant part taken in this affair by the two divisions of the rozadores irregulars who were provided with sickles knives and other weapons by the armoury of la laguna one division of forty peasants was placed under the marquess del prado and the viscount de buenpaso who both though not military men hastened to the town when the attack was no longer doubtful the other body of thirtyfive men was committed to don simon de lara already mentioned amongst the wounded in the heat of the affair and the darkness of night the first division was somewhat scattered as it entered the streets leading to the barranco santo watercourse where the canarian battalion was attacking the english as they landed the marquess after escaping the enemy who for half an hour surrounded without recognising him and expecting instant death attempted to cross the small square of santo domingo to the plaza of the citadel he was prevented from so doing by the voices of the attacking party posted in the little place he therefore retired to the upper part of the town and took post on the conventflank the viscount marched his men to the square of the citadel where they were detained by lieutenant jorva to reinforce the post and to withdraw a fieldgun that had been dangerously placed in the street of san josef  equally well deserving of their countrys gratitude were sundry others especially diego correa first chief of the provincial regiment of guimar who forgetting his illness sprang from his bed at the trumpets sound boldly met the foe with sword and pistol and took eleven prisoners to the citadel don josef de guesala not satisfied with doing the mounted duties required of him followed the enemy with not less courage than diego correa at the head of certain militiamen who had lost their way in the streets  good service was also done by the alcalde and the deputies footnote the local aldermen of the district in charge of the four parties composed of tradesmen and burghers they patrolled the streets and guarded against danger from fire they also issued to all those on duty rations of bread and wine punctually and abundantly from the night of the 22nd till that of the 25th of july  no circumstantial account of our remarkable success would be complete without recording in the highest and the most grateful terms the zeal with which the very noble the municipality ayuntamiento of tenerife took part in winning our laurels since july 22 when the first alarmsignal was made at santa cruz don josef de castilla the chief magistrate corregidor with the nobility and men at arms armastomar assembled in force on the main square of la laguna plaza del adelantado the mayor alcalde mayor don vicente ortiz de rivera presided over the court cabildo at which were present all those members  regidores  who were not personally serving against the enemy these were the town deputies don lopo de la guerra don josef saviñon don antonio riquel don cayetano pereza don francisco fernandez bello don miguel de laisequilla and don juan fernandez calderin with the deputy syndicgeneral don filipe carillo their meetings were also attended by other gentlemen and underofficers  curiales  who were told off to their respective duties according to the order laid down for defending the island after making a careful survey of the bread and provisions in the market also of the wheat and flour in the bakeries and of the reserve stores they promptly supplied the countrypeople who crowded into the city wind being at this season wanting for the mills we were greatly assisted by a cargo of 3000 barrels of flour taken before madeira from an angloamerican prize by the buonaparte a french privateer who brought her to our port this supply sufficed for the militia stationed on the heights of taganana in the valle seco near the streams of the punta del hidalgo texina baxamar the valley of san andrés and lastly the line of santa cruz guadamogete and candelaria whose posts cover more than twentyfour miles of coast between the northwest and the south of the island  equally well rationed were the peasants who passed by la laguna en route to santa cruz and other parts they consumed about 16000 lbs of bread 300 lbs of biscuit seven and a half pipes of wine rice meat cheese and other comestibles meanwhile at the application of the municipality to the venerable vicar ecclesiastic and to the parish priests and superiors of the community prelados prayers were offered up in the churches and certain of the clergy collected from the neighbouring houses lint and bandages for the wounded the soldiers in the paso alto and valle seco received 100 pairs of slippers for which our commandantgeneral had indented many peasants who had applied for and obtained guns knives and other weapons from the laguna armoury were sent off to defend the northern part of the island on the main road descending to santa cruz the chief magistrate planted a provisional battery

in the mansion house engaged in the most important matters from the dawn of july 22 to noon on the 25th nor was its firmness shaken even by the sinister reports to which others lent ear when on the morning of the latter day our chief communicated to them the glowing success of our arms and the disastrous repulse of the enemy they hastened to appoint july 27 for a solemn te deum it is the day on which the island of tenerife was conquered exactly three centuries before and thus it became the annual festival of san cristobal its patron  the secular religious and the regular monastic communities performed this function with pomp and singular apparatus in the parish church of our lady of the conception the towncourt carried the banner which had waved in the days of the conquest escorted by a company of the canarian battalion and its band these stood during the office at the church door and saluted with three volleys the elevation of the host master fray antonio raymond of the order of st

officers followed by a picket of garrison troops and a crowd of townspeople carried the colours taken from the english  on the next day were celebrated the obsequies of those who had fallen honourably in defence of their beloved country the ceremony took place in the parish church of santa cruz and was repeated in the cathedral of grand canary and in the churches and convents of the other islands the ecclesiastical court of tenerife ordered the chapter of music to sing a solemn te deum at which the municipal body attended on the next day a mass of thanksgiving was said with exposition of the holy sacrament throughout the day and a sermon was preached by the canon superior don josef icaza cabrexas lastly a very solemn funeral function with magnificent display did due honour to their memory

and blackett 1859 i quote from vol i chap iv adds certain local details concerning nelsons illfated attack it is boldly stated that during the rash affair the commandantgeneral and his staff remained safely inside the castle of san cristobal and that when the english forces captured the monastery the spanish authorities resolved to surrender this step was opposed by a sergeant manoel cuera who with more familiarity than is usual when soldiers are separated so far by their respective ranks placed his hand upon the shoulder of his commanding officer and said no your excellency you shall not give up the plaza we are not yet reduced to such a strait as that  whereupon the general assuming his usual courage followed his sergeants advice and continued the engagement till it was brought to a termination equally honourable to englishmen and spaniards  mrs murray also declares that captain troubridge when invested in the monastery by superior numbers placed before his men a line of prisoners and that these being persons of influence the assailants fired high moreover that colonel monteverde the commander of the island troops was an italian who spoke bad spanish and kept shouting to his men condanate vois a matar a la santisima trinitate the officer sent to parley captain hood was we are told accompanied to the citadel by a gentleman named murphy whom the english had taken prisoner a panic before mentioned came from three militia officers who mounting a single animal rode off to la laguna assuring the cabildo and the townspeople that santa cruz had fallen one of this valiant triumvirate had succeeded to a large property on condition of never disgracing his name and after the flight he had the grace to offer it to a younger brother who had distinguished himself in south america the junior told him not to be a fool and the property was left to the proprietors children his grandson being in possession of it at the present day  the chapter ends with the fate of one orooney a merchants clerk who cast his lot with the spaniards and whom general gutierrez sent with an order to the commandant of paso alto fort being in liquor he took the marina or shortest road and when questioned by the enemy at once told his errand in those days and in such circumstances writes the lively lady soldiers were very speedy in their decisions and the marine who had challenged orooney at once bayonetted him while his comrade rifled his pockets and appropriated his clothes  remains only to state that the colours of the unfortunate cutter fox and her boats are still in the chapel of sant iago on the left side of the santa cruz parish church la concepcion planted against the wall flanking the cross in long coffinlike cases with glass fronts they have been the object of marked attention on the part of sundry british middies and the baser sort of townfolk never fail to show by their freedom or rather impudence of face and deportment that they have not forgotten the

the quondam good shepherd of the socalled palmoil lambs all were young fellows without a sign of the old trader and wellmannered enough when returning homewards however their society was by no means so pleasant it was noisy and larky besides being addicted to the dullest practical jokes such as peppering beds on board senegal each sat at meat with his glass of adams ale by his plateside looking prim and grave and precise as persons at a christening who are not in the habit of frequenting christenings captain keene took the earliest opportunity of assuring me that since my timeindeed since the last ten yearsthe bights and the bightsmen had greatly changed that spiritdrinking was utterly unknown and that tenoclockgotobed life was the general rule but this unnatural state of things did not last long wine beer and even martell three stars presently reappeared and i noted that the eveningchorus had preserved all its peculiar verve the fact is that west africa has been subjected to the hateful espionage that prying into private affairs which dates in western india from the days of a certain nameless governor every attempt at jollification was reported to the houses at home and often an evil rumour against a man went to liverpool and returned to the coast before it was known to himself and his friends in the same river may all such dismal attempts to make jack and jill dull boys and girls fail as utterly  early in the afternoon we steamed past galdar and la guia rival villages famed for cheeses on the northwestern coast of lumpy grand canary sheets of habitation gleaming

their mummies in caves built detached sepulchres and raised tumuli of scoriae over their embalmed dead as at peruvian arica many remains have been exposed by modern earthquakes and landslips  rounding the islet and accompanied by curious canoes like paperboats and by fishingcraft which bounded over the waves like dolphins we spun by the puerto de la luz a line of flattopped whitewashed houses the only remarkable feature being the large and unused lazaretto a few barques still lie off the landingplace where i have been compelled more than once to take refuge in my day it was proposed to cut a

paved with concrete and by an excellent highroad the sand of the neck thrown by the winds high up the cliffs which back the city evidently dates from the days when la isleta was an island it contrasts sharply with the grey basaltic shingle that faces the capital and forms the shipbuilding yard  we coasted along the yellow lowland with its tormented background of tall cones bluffs and falaises and we anchored at 4 pm in the roadstead of las palmas north of the spot where our ss senegal whilom broke her back the capital fronting east like santa cruz lies at the foot of a high seawall whose straight and sloping lines betray their submarine origin in places it is caverned for quarries and for the homes of the troglodyte artisans and up its flanks straggle whitewashed boxes towards the

back upon the world of voyagers  in former days when winds and waves were high we landed on the sands near the dark grey castillo de la luz in the port of light thence we had to walk ride or drivewhen a carriage was to be hiredover the four kilomètres which separated us from the city we passed the castles of san fernando and la catalina to the villas and the gardens planted with thin trees that outlie the north and we entered the capital by a neat bridge thrown over the barranco de la mata where a wall from the upper castle once kept out the doughty aborigines thence we fell into the northern quarter la triana and found shabby rooms and shocking fare either at the british hotel mrs bishop or the hôtel monsonboth no more now we land conveniently thanks to dons santiago verdugo and juan leon y castilhos at a spur of the new pier with the red light to the north of the city and find ourselves at once in the streets for many years this comfortable mole excited the strongest opposition it was wasting money and the stones carelessly thrown in would at once be carried off by the sea and increase the drenching breakers which outlie the beach time has as usual settled the dispute it is now being prolonged eastwards but again they say that the work is swept away as soon as done that the water is too deep and even that sinking a ship loaded with stones would not resist the strong arm of eurus who buries everything in surf the mole is provided with the normal sanidad or health office with solid magazines and with a civilised tramway used to transport the huge cubes of concrete at the tongueroot is a neat little garden wanting only shade two dragontrees here attract the eye thence we pass at once into the main line la triana which bisects the commercial town this reminiscence of the seville suburb begins rather like a road than a street but it ends with the inevitable cobblestones the trottoirs we remark are of flags disposed lengthways in the rival island they lie crosswise the thoroughfares are scrupulously named after spanish fashion in fernando po they labelled even the bushroads the substantial houses with green balconies are white bound in brown edgings of trachyte basalt and lava here and there a single story of rude construction stands like a dwarf by the side of its giant neighbour  the huge and still unfinished cathedral is well worth a visit it is called after santa ana a personage in this island when grand canary had been attacked successively and to scant purpose by de béthencourt 1402 by diego de herrera 1464 and by diego de silva the catholic queen and king sent on january 24 1474 don juan rejon to finish the work this conquistador a morose and violent man was marching upon the west of the island where his reception would have been of the warmest when he was met at the site of the present ermita de san antonio by an old fisherman who advised him of his danger he took warning fortified his camp which occupied the site of the present city beat off the enemy and defeated at the battle of giniguada a league of chiefs headed by the valiant and obstinate doramas the fisherman having suddenly disappeared incontinently became a miraculous apparition of the virgins mother rejon founded the cathedral in her honour but he was not destined to rest in it he was recalled to spain he attacked grand canary three times and as often failed at last he left it and after all his campaigns he was killed and buried at gomera nor despite saint anne did the stout islanders yield to pedro de vera 148083 till they had fought an eighty years fight for independence  the cathedral which mr p barker webb compares with the church of st sulpice is built of poor schiste and bad sandstonerubble revetted with good lava

done at belem lisbon the interior is gothic unlike all others in the islands and the piers lofty and elegant imitate palmfronds a delicate flattery to las palmas and a good specimen of local invention there are a nave and two aisles four noble transversal columns sustaining the choirvault adorn the walls the pulpit and high altar are admirable as the choir the only eyesores are the diminutive organ and the eleven sidechapels with their caricatures of high art the large and heavilyrailed choir in midnave so common in the mother country breaks the unity of the place and dwarfs its grand proportions after the manner of spanish churches which love to concentrate dazzling colour at the upper end the high altar is hung with crimson velvet curtains and its massive silver lamps one italian

governors the new audiencia at the bottom of colegio street built by m botta at an expense of 20000 dollars has a fine court with covered cloisters above and an open gallery below supported by thin pillars of basalt  resuming our walk down la triana southwards we note the grand new theatre not unlike that of dresden it wants only opening and a company then we cross the giniguada wady by a bridge with a wooden floor iron railings and stone piers and enter the viñeta or official as opposed to the commercial town on the south side is the fishmarket new pretty and gingerbread it adjoins the general market a fine solid old building like that of santa cruz containing bakers and butchers stalls and all things wanted by the housekeeper a little beyond it the triana ends in an archway leading to a square court under whose shaded sides mules and asses are tethered we turn to the right and gain balcones street where stands the comfortable hotel of don ramon lopez most soothing to the eye is the cool greengrown patio after the prospect of the hot and barren highlands which back the palmcity  walking up the right flank of the giniguada ribeira we cross the old stone bridge with three arches and marble statues of the four seasons it places us in the plazuela the irregular space which leads to the mayor de triana the square of the old theatre the western side is occupied by a huge yellow building the old church and convent of san francisco now turned into barracks in parts it is battlemented and its belfry a wall of basalt pierced with a lancetarch to hang bells hints at earthquakes an inscription upon the old theatre the usual neat building of white and greybrown basalt informs us that it was built in 1852 ad honorem of two deputies but santa cruz the modern capital has provided herself with a larger and a better house ergo las palmas the old capital must fain do the same the metropolis of grand canary moreover claims to count more noses than that of tenerife to the west of the older theatre in the same block is the casino club and ballroom with two french billiardtables and smokingrooms the old hotel attached to the theatre has now ceased to exist  on the opposite side of the square lies the little alameda promenade the grounds once belonging to st francis the raised walk shaded by a pretty archway of palmtrees is planted with myrtles dahlias and bignonias it has all the requisites of its kindbandstand greenposted oillamps and scrolled seats of brown basalt round this square rise the best houses mostly new as in the peninsula however as well as in both archipelagos all have shops below we are beginning to imitate this excellent practice of utilising the unwholesome groundfloor in the big new hotels of london two large houses are or were painted to mimic brick things as hideous as anything further north  in this part of the triana lived the colony of english merchants once so numerous that they had their own club and gymnasium all had taken the local colouring and were more spanish than the spaniards a celebrated case of barratry was going on in 1863 the date of my first visit when lloyds sent out a detective and my friend capt heathcote in to conduct the legal proceedings i innocently asked why the british viceconsul was not sufficient and was assured that no resident could interfere alias dared do his duty under pain of social ostracism and a host of enmities in those days a man who gained his lawsuit went about weaponed and escorted as in modern ireland by a troop of armed servants landlordpotting also was by no means unknown and the murder of the marquess de las palmas caused memorable sensation  indescribable was the want of hospitality which characterised the hispanoenglishmen of las palmas i have called twice upon a fellowcountryman without his dreaming of asking me upstairs such shyness may be understood in foreigners who often entertain wild ideas concerning what an englishman expects but these people were wealthy nor were they wholly expatriated finally it was with the utmost difficulty that i obtained from one of them a pound of homegrown arrowroot for the sick child of a friend  on the other hand i have ever met with the greatest civility from the spanish canarians i am especially indebted to don j b carlo the packetagent who gave me copies of el museo canario revista de la sociedad del mismo nombre las palmasthe transactions published by the museum of las palmas two mummies of canarian origin have lately been added to the collection and the library has become respectable the steamers are now so hurried that i had no time to inspect it nor to call upon don gregorio chil y naranjo president of the anthropological society this savant whose name has become well known in paris is printing at las palmas his estudios historicos c the outcome of a lifes labour don agustin millares is also publishing la historia de las islas canarias in three volumes each of 400 to 450 pages  i made three short excursions in grand canary to telde to the caldera and to doramas which showed me the formation of the island my notes taken at the time must now be quoted en route for the former we drove past the large cityhospital here in old times was another strong wall defending the southern part and corresponding with the northern or barranco line the road running to the southsouthwest was peculiarly good the tunnel through the hillspur suggested classical and romantic posilippo it was well parapeted near the sea and it had heavy cuttings in the white tosca a rock somewhat resembling the calcaire grossier of the paris basin this light pumicelike stone occasionally forming a conglomerate or pudding and slightly effervescing with acids is fertile where soft and where hard quite sterile hereabouts lay gando one of the earliest forts built by the conquistadores we then bent inland or westward crossed barren stony ground red and black and entered the pretty and fertile valley with its scatter of houses known as la vega de ginamar  i obtained a guide and struck up the proper right of a modern lavabed which does not reach the sea the path wound around rough hills here and there scattered with figtrees and vines with lupines euphorbias and other wild growths from the summit of the southern front we sighted the cima de ginamar popularly called el pozo the well it is a volcanic blowinghole of oval shape about fifty feet in long diameter and the elliptical mouth discharged to the north the lavabed before seen apparently it is connected with the bandana peak further west here the aborigines martyred sundry friars before the conquistadores divided land and water amongst them the guide declared that the hole must reach the sea which lies at least 1200 feet below that the sound of water is often to be heard in it and that men let down to recover the corpses of cattle had been frightened away by strange sights and sounds he threw in stones explaining that they must be large otherwise they lodge upon the ledges i heard them dash dash dash from side to side at various intervals of different depths till the pomomm subsided into silence the crevasses showed no sign of the rockpigeon columba livia a bird once abounding nothing could be weirder than the effect of the scene in clear moonlight the contrast of snowy beams and sable ground perfectly suited the uncanny look and the weird legends of the site  beyond the cima we made the gay little town of telde which lodges some 4000 souls entering it by a wide fiumara over which a bridge was then building the streets were mere lines of scattered houses and the prominent buildings were the white dome of san pedro and san juan with its two steeples of the normal grey basalt near the latter lay the little alameda beggarhaunted as usual on the north side of the barranco rose a caverned rock inhabited by the poor we shall see this troglodytic feature better developed elsewhere  to visit the caldera de bandana three miles from the city we hired a carriage with the normal row of three lean rats which managed however to canter or gallop the greater part of the way the boydriver agustin was a fair specimen of his race obstinate as a berber or a mule as it was sunday he wanted to halt at every venta pub curioseandothat is admiring the opposite sex some of the younger girls are undoubtedly pretty yet they show unmistakable signs of guanche blood the toilette is not becoming here the shawl takes the place of the mantilla and the headcovering as in tenerife is capped by the hideous billycock to all my remonstrances don agustin curtly replied with the usual island formula am i a slave this class has a surly grumbling way utterly wanting the dignity of the lowerorder spaniard and the moor and it is to be managed only by threatening to withhold the propinas tip but the jarvey like the bathman the barber and generally the bodyservant and the menial classes which wait upon mans person are not always models of civility  we again passed the hospital and ascended the new zigzag to the right of the giniguada the torrentbed now bright green with arum and pepper grows vegetables maize and cactus its banks bear large plantations of the dates from which las palmas borrows her pretty eastern names in most places they are mere brabs and like the olive they fail to fruit the larger growths are barbarously docked as in catholic countries generally and the fronds are reduced to mere brooms and ratstails the people are not fond of palms the shade and the roots they say injure their crops and the tree is barely worth one dollar per annum  at the top of the cuesta de san roque which reminded me of its namesake near gibraltar i found a barren ridge growing only euphorbia the barranco seco on the top showed in the sole a conspicuously big house which has no other view but the sides of a barren trough this was the folly of an eccentric nobleman who preferred the absence to the company of his friends  half an hours cold bleak drive placed us at the tafira village here the land yields four crops a year two of maize and two of potatoes formerly worth 100 per acre the annual value had been raised by cochineal to 500 all however depends upon water which is enormously dear the yelping curs have mostly bushy tails like those which support the arms of the canary islands the grey and green finches represent our domestic warbler fringilla canaria which reached england about 1500 when a ship with a few birds on board had been wrecked off elba  footnote the canary bird builds on tall bushes rather than trees a nest of moss roots feathers and rubbish where it lays from four to six paleblue eggs it moults in august and september pairs in february and sometimes hatches six times in a season the natives declare that the wild birds rarely survive the second year of captivity yet they do not seem to suffer from it as they begin to sing at once when caged mr addison describes the note as between that of the skylark and the nightingale and was surprised to find that each flock has a different songan observation confirmed by the people and noted by humboldt p 87  the country folk were habited in shirts drawers derived from the moors and tasseled caps of blue stuff big enough for carpetbags the vine still covered every possible slope of black soil and the aloes crowned with flowers seemed to lord it over the tamarisks the hemlocks and the nightshades  upon this monte or wooded height most of the gentry have countryhouses the climate being 12 degrees fahr cooler than by the sea la brigida commands a fine view of the isleta with its black sand and white foam leekgreen waters upon the reefs and deep offing of steely blue  leaving the carriage at the forking road i mounted after a bad descent a rough hill and saw to the left the pico de bandana a fine regular cone 1850 feet high a group of a few houses el pueblo de la caldera leads to the famous cauldron which sir charles lyell visited by mistake for that of palma travellers compare it with the lakes of nemi and albano i found it tame after the cup of fernando po with its beautiful lining of hanging woods it has only the merit of regularity the unbroken upper rim measures about half a mile in diameter and the lower funnel 3000 feet in circumference the sides of piedra pomez pumice are lined and ribbed with rows of scoriaceous rock as regular as amphitheatreseats full 1000 feet deep and slope easily into a flat sole which some are said to have reached on horseback a copious fountain springing from the once fiery inside is collected below for the use of the farmhouse el fondo de la caldera the fields have the effect of a little alpine tarn of bright green here wild pigeons are sometimes caught at night and rabbits and partridges are or were not extinct i ascended bandana peak to the northnortheast the piton of this long extinct volcano and enjoyed the prospect of the luxuriant vegetation the turquoise sea and the golden sands about maspalomas the southernmost extremity of grand canary  returning to the roadfork i mounted a hill on the right hand and sighted the atalaya another local lion here a perpendicular face of calcareous rock fronts a deep valley backed by a rounded hill with the blue chine of el cumbre in the distance this is the highest of the ridge measuring 8500 feet the wall is pierced like the torrentside of mar saba jerusalem with caves that shelter a troglodyte population numbering some 2000 souls true to their berber origin they seek refuge in the best of savage lodgings from heat cold and wind the site rises some 2000 feet above sealevel and the strong wester twists the trees grand canary preserves more of these settlements than tenerife they are found in many parts of the island and even close to the capital madeira on the other hand affects them but little we must not forget that they still exist at st come within two hours rail of paris where my learned and lamented friend dr broca had a countryhouse  descending a rough steep slope i entered the upper tier of the settlement where the boxes were built up with whitewashed fronts the caves are mostly divided by matting into buts and bens heaps of pots antiquated in shape and somewhat like the etruscan showed the trade of the place and hillocks of potatoes the staff of life the sidewalls were hollowed for shelves and a few prints of the virgin and other sacred subjects formed the decoration settles and rude tables completed the list of movables and many had the huge bed affected by the canarian cottager which must be ascended with a run and a jump the predatory birds gypsies and others flocked down from their nests clamouring for cuartitos and taking no refusal  it occupies a week to ride round the island whose circumference measures about 120 miles i contented myself with a last excursion to doramas which then supplied meat cheese and grain to tenerife my guide was old antonio martinez who assured me that he was the most classical man in the island and with two decent hillponies we struck to the northwest there is little to describe in the tour the cuesta blanca showed us the regular cones of arúcas beyond tenoya town i inspected a crateriform ravine and monte cardones boasted a honeycomb of caves like the atalaya the fine rich vega of arúcas a long white settlement before whose doors rose drying heaps of maize and black cochineal was a pleasant smiling scene all the country settlements are built pretty much upon the same plan each has its campo santo with white walls and high grey gate through which the coffin is escorted by gaucholike riders who dismount to enter doramas proved to be a fine monte with treestumps especially chestnuts somewhat surprising in a region of ferns and furze near the little village of friga i tasted an agua agria a natural sodawater which the people hold to be of sovereign value for beast as well as man it increases digestion and makes happy mothers like the fountain of villaflor on the tenerifan pike slope i found it resembling an eau gazeuse left in the open all night we then pushed on to teror famous for turkeys traversed the high and forested northern plateau visited galdar and guia of the cheeses and rode back by bañaderos bay and the cuesta da silva renowned in olden island story  these three days gave me a fair general view of grand canary the cumbre or central plateau whose apex is los pexos 6400 feet well wooded with pines and alpines collects moisture in abundance from this plateau barrancos or ravinevalleys said to number 103 radiate quaquaversally their bottoms becoming more and more level as they near the sea are enriched by gushing founts and are unrivalled for fertility while the high and stony intervening ridges are barren as arabia deserta even sun and rain cannot fertilise the dividing walls of the rich and riant vegas here as at madeira and showing even a better likeness the tierra caliente is egypt the mediania middleheights are italy and the upper mesetas the cloudcompelling tablelands are the bleak north of europe plus a quasitropical sun    chapter ix  the cochinealthe gallocanary sackadieu to the canaries  i must not leave the jezirát elbard of gold or jezirát elkhálidát happy islands without some notice of their peculiar institutions the cochineal the gallo and canary sack  the nopal or tunal plant opuntia tuna or cactus cochinellifera is indigenous on these islands as well as on the mainland of africa but the native growth is woody and leanleaved and its cooling fruit which we clumsily term a prickly pear or fig is everywhere a favourite in hot climates there are now sundry claimants to the honour of having here fathered the modern industry some say that in 1823 a retired intendant introduced from mexico the true terciopelo or velvetleaf together with the mexican cochineal the coccus cacti hemipter footnote the male insect is winged for flight the female never stirs from the spot where she begins to feed she lays her eggs which are innumerable and microscopic and she leaves them in the membrane or hardened envelope which she has secreted so called from the old greek kÓkkos a berry or the neogreek kokkivos red scarlet it is certain that don santiago de la cruz brought both plant and bug from guatemala or honduras in 1835 and that an englishman who has advanced a right even in writing labours under a not uncommon hallucination  but the early half of the present century was the palmy day of the vine the people resisted the cactusinnovation as the english labourer did the introduction of machinery and tore up the plants enough however remained in the south of tenerife for the hour of need travellers in search of the picturesque still lament that the ugly stranger has ousted the trellised vine and the wild free myrtles but public opinion changed when fortunes were made by selling the insect greedy as the agriculturist in general the people would refuse the value of a full crop of potatoes or maize if they suspected that the offerer intended to grow cochineal no dye was prepared on the islands and the peasants looked upon it as a manner of mystery  the best tuneras cochinealplantations lay in grand canary where they could be most watered wherever maize thrives producing a good dark leaf and grain in plenty there cochineal also succeeds the soil is technically called mina de tosca a whitish pumicelike stone often forming a gravel conglomerate under a rocky stratum hardening by exposure it is good for building immense labour is required to prepare such ground for the cactus the earth must be taken from below the surfacerock as at malta spread in terraced beds and cleared of loose stones which are built up in walls or in molleras cubes or pyramids such ground sold for 150 per acre 600 were paid for mètredeep soil unencumbered by stone where the chalk predominates it must be mixed with the volcanic sand locally called zahorra in all cases the nopals are set at distances of half a yard in trenches at least three feet deep the streets or intervals must measure nearly two yards so that water may flow freely and sunshine may not be arrested good ground if irrigated in winter and kept clear of weeds by the haçada hoe produces a cactus capable of being seeded after the second year if poor a third is required the plant lasts with manure to defend it from exhaustion a full decade footnote the compost was formerly natural dry or liquid as in switzerland but for some years the costly guano and chemicals have been introduced formerly also potatoes were set between the stems and wellwatered lands gave an annual graincrop as well as a green crop  i now translate the memoir sent in ms to me by my kind friend dundas it is the work of don abel de aguilar consul impérial de russie a considerable producer of the bug  the semillado or cochinealsowing is divided into three cosechas crops according to the several localities in the islands  the abuelas grandmothers are those planted in octobernovember their seed gives a new growth set in februarymarch and called madres mothers thirdly those planted in junejuly gathered in septemberoctober and serving to begin with the abuelas are called la cosecha the crop the first and second may be planted on the seaboard the last is confined to the midlands and uplands on account of the heat and the hot winds especially the souther and the southsoutheaster which asphyxiate the insect  and now of the abuelas as cultivated in the maritime regions of santa cruz tenerife  every cochinealplantation must have a house with windows facing the south and freely admitting the lightan indispensable condition the cuarto del semillado breedingroom should be heated by stoves to a regular temperature of 30°32° r at this season the proportion of seed is calculated at 30 boxes of 40 lbs each or a total of 1200 lbs per fanega the latter being equivalent to a halfhectare the cochineal is placed in large wooden trays lined with cloth and containing about 15 lbs of the recently gathered seed when filled without crowding the trays are covered with squares of cottoncloth raw muslin measuring 1216 inches usually the fanega requires 2030 quintals 128 lbs or a cwt each costing 15 to 17 the newly born insects hijuelos adhere to the cochinealrags and these are carried to the tunera in covered baskets  the operation is repeated with fresh rags till the parturition is completed the last born after 1215 days are the weakest they are known by their dark colour the earlier seed being greywhite like cigarashes the cochineal which has produced all its insects is known in the markets as zacatillas it commanded higher prices because the watery parts had disappeared and only the colouring matter remained now its value is that of the white or cosecha  the cochinealrags are then carried by women and girls to the tunera and are attached to the cactusleaves by passing the cloths round them and by pinning them on with the thorns this operation requires great care judgment and experience the good results of the crop depend upon the judicious distribution of the bugs and error is easy when making allowance for their loss by wind rain or change of temperature the insects walk over the whole leaf and choose their places sheltered as much as possible although still covered by the rags after 810 days they insert the proboscis into the cactus and never stir till gathered at the end of three and a half to four months they become grains of cochineal not unlike wheat but smaller rounder and thicker the sign of maturity is the appearance of new insects upon the leaf the rags are taken off as they were put on by women and girls and the cochineal is swept into baskets with brushes of palmfrond as the abuelas grow in winter there is great loss of life for each pound sown the cultivator gets only two to two and a half innumerable insects being lost either in the house or out of doors  the crop thus gathered produces the madres mothers the latter are sown in februarymarch and are gathered in mayjune the only difference of treatment is that the rags are removed when the weather is safe and the free draught benefits the insects the produce is greaterthree and a half to four pounds for one  the cosecha of the madres produces most abundantly on account of the settled weather the cochineal breeds better in the house where there is more light and a higher temperature the result is that 8 to 10 lbs become 100 it is cheaper too as a lesser proportion of rag is wanted for the field and it is kept on only till the insect adheres thus a small quantity goes a long way at this season there is no need of the cuarto and bags of pierced paper or of rengue loose gauze measuring 10 inches long by 2 broad are preferred a spoonful of grain about 4 ounces is put into each bag and is hung to the leaves the young ones crawl through the holes or meshes till the plant is sufficiently populated in hot weather they may be changed eight times a day with great economy of labour this is the most favourable form the insects go straight to the leaves and it is easy to estimate the proportions  so far don abel he concludes with saying that cochineal which in other days made the fortune of his native islands will soon be completely abandoned let us hope not  the cosechainsects shelllike in form greycoloured of light weight but all colouring matter are either sold for breeding abuelas or are placed upon trays and killed in stoves by a heat of 150°160° fahr the drying process is managed by reducing the temperature to 140° the time varies from twentyfour to fortyeight hours when hurried it injures the crop ninety fullgrown insects weigh some fortyeight grains and there is a great reduction by drying some 27000 yield one pound of the prepared cochineal the shiny black cochineal which looks like small beetles is produced by sundrying and by shaking the insect in a linen bag or in a small merrygoround so as to remove the white powder footnote mr h vizetelly p 210 says that black metallic sand is used to give it brilliancy the form however must be preserved it sells 6d per lb higher than the cochinilla de plata or silver cochineal lastly the dried crop is packed in bags covered with mats and is then ready for exportation  the traffic began about 1835 with an export of only 1275 lbs and between 1850 and 1860 the lb was worth at least ten francs admiral robinson footnote seadrift a volume published by subscription pitman london 1852 in 1852 makes the export one million of lbs at one dollar each or a total of 250000l during the rage of the oïdium the cultivation was profitable and raised the canaries high in the scale of material prosperity in 1862 the islands exported 10000 quintals or hundredweights the total value being still one million of dollars in 187778 the produce was contained in 20000 to 25000 bags each averaging 175 lbs at a value of half a crown per lb it was then stated that owing to the increased expense of irrigation and of guano or chemical manures nothing under two shillings would repay the cultivator in 187879 the total export amounted to 5045007 lbs in 187980 this figure had fallen off to 4036871 lbs a decrease of 5482 bags or 1008136 lbs moreover the prices which had been forced up by speculation declined from 2s 6d3s 4d to 1s 8d and 1s 10d footnote these figures are taken from the able consular report of mr consul dundas printed in part viii 1881 when i last visited las palmas april 1880 cochineal under the influence of magenta and mineral dyes was selling at 1s 4d instead of one to two dollars  it is to be feared that the palmy days of cochineal are over and that its chief office besides staining liqueurs and toothpowders will be to keep down the price of the chemicals with regret i see this handsome and harmless colour being gradually superseded by the economical anilines whose poisonous properties have not yet been fully recognised by the public the change is a pregnant commentary upon the good and homely old english saying cheap and nasty  the fall of cochineal throughout the canaries brought many successors into the field but none can boast of great success silk woven and spun was tried unfortunately the worms were fed on tartago a ricinus instead of the plentiful red and white mulberries the harvest was abundant but not admired by manufacturers in fact the moderns have failed where their predecessors treated the stuff so well that levantines imported silks to resell them in italy formerly tenerife contained a manufactory whose lasting and brilliant produce was highly appreciated in spain as in havana at palma crimson waistsashes used to sell for an ounce of gold  tobaccogrowing was patronised by government in 1878 probably with the view of mixing it in their monopolymanufactories with the growths of cuba and manilla but on this favour being withdrawn the next years harvest fell to onefourth 354640 lbs to 36978 the best sites were in hierro ferro and adejo in the south of tenerife the chief obstacles to success are imperfect cultivation the expense of skilled labour and deficiency of water to irrigate the deep black soil both virginia and havana leaves were grown and good brands sold from eight to sixteen dollars per 100 lbs the customers in order of quantity are germany england france south america and the west coast of africa where the cigars are now common one brand republicanos is so good that i should not wish to smoke better at home they sell for twelve dollars per 1000 a price which rises i am told in england to one shilling each they are to be procured through messieurs davidson of santa cruz  the canarians now talk of sugargrowing but the cane will inevitably fare worse for want of water than either silk or tobacco  next to cochineal in the canary islands especially in tenerife ranks the gallo or fightingcock cockfighting amongst ourselves is redolent of foul tobacco bad beer and ruffianism in low places this is not the case in spain and her colonies where the classical sport of greece and rome still holds its ground i have pleasant reminiscences of the good padre in the argentine republic who after mass repaired regularly to the pit wearing his huge canoelike hat and carrying under his arm a wellbred bird instead of a breviary here too i was told that the famous derby breed of the twelfth earl had extended in past times throughout the length and breadth of the land and the next visit to knowsley convinced me that the legend was based on fact as regards cruelty all popular sports foxhunting and pigeonshooting are cruel grallus however has gained since the days of cockmondays and cockfridays when he was staked down to be killed by cocksticks or was whipped to his death by blindfolded carters he leads the life of a friar he is tended carefully as any babe he is permitted to indulge his pugnacity which it would be harsh to restrain and at worst he dies fighting like a gentleman a tenerifan would shudder at the horror of our fashionable sport where ruffians gouge or blind the pigeon with a pin squeeze it to torture wrench out its tail and thrust the upper through the lower mandible  the bird in tenerife surpasses those of the other canary islands and more than once has carried off the prizes at seville a moderately wellbred specimen may be bought for two dollars but firstrate cocks belonging to private fanciers have no price  many proprietors as at hyderabad in the dakhan will not part with even the eggs the shape of the canarian bird is rather that of a pheasant than a rooster the coat varies it is black and red with yellow shanks black and yellow white and gold and a grey henlike colour our duckwing locally called gallinho here as in many other places the white feather is no sign of bad blood the toilet is peculiar comb and wattles are dubbed clean shaven and the circumvental region is depilated or clipped with scissors leaving only the long tailfeathers springing from a naked surface the skin is daily rubbed after negro fashion with lemonjuice inducing a fiery red hue this is done for cleanliness and is supposed also to harden the cuticle altogether the appearance is coquet sportsmanlike and decidedly appropriate  the gamechicks are sent to the country like townborn babes in france or the sons of arabian cities to the bedawins black tents the cockerel begins fighting in his second and is not a stale bird till his fifth or sixth year in early spring aspirants to the honours of the arena are brought to the towns for education and for training which lasts some six weeks i was invited to visit a walk belonging to a wealthy proprietor at orotava who obligingly answered all my questions some fifty birds occupied the largest room of a deserted barrack which proclaimed its later use at the distance of half a mile the gladiators were disposed in four long parallel rows of cages open canework measuring three feet square each had a short wooden trestle placed outside during the day and serving by night as a perch they were fed and watered at 2 pm the fattening maize was first given and then wheat with an occasional cram of breadcrumb and water by way of physic the masálá and multifarious spices of the hindostani trainer are here ignored  the birds are not allowed as in india to become so fierce that they attack men this is supposed to render them too hot and headstrong in combat every third day there is a pecha or spurringmatch which proves the likeliest lot the pit for exercise is a matted circle about 6 feet in diameter a wellhodded bird is placed in it and the assistant holds up a second waving it to and fro and provoking no 1 to take his exercise by springing to the attack the indian style of galloping the cock by showing a hen at either end of the walk is looked upon with disfavour because the sight of the sex is supposed to cause disease during high condition the elaborate eastern shampooing for hours has apparently never been heard of after ten minutes hard running and springing the bird is sponged with jamaica rum and water to prevent chafing the lotion is applied to the head and hind quarters to the tender and dangerous parts under the wings and especially to the legjoints the lower mandible is then held firmly between the left thumb and forefinger and a few drops are poured into the beak every alternate day the cage is placed on loose ground in sun and wind and once a week there is a longer sparringbout with thick leather hods or spurpads  cockfighting takes place once a year when the birds are in fittest feather it begins on easter sunday and ends with the following wednesday    the bird that warned peter of his fall  has then if victorious a pleasant easy twelve months of life before him he has won many a gold ounce for his owner i have heard of a man pouching 400l in a contest between orotava and la laguna which has a wellmerited celebrity for these exhibitions the canarians ignore all such refinements as rounds or welsh mains the birds are fairly matched in pairs navajas or spurs either of silver or steel are unused if not unknown the natural weapon is sharpened to a needlelike point and then blood and condition win the cockpit somewhat larger than the trainingpit is in the casa de la galera there is a ring for betters and the spectators are ranged on upper seats  lastly of the wine canary now unknown to the english market where it had a local habitation and a name as early as madeira and sherry all claiming shakespearean recognition the elizabethans constantly allude to cups of cool canary and mr vizetelly quotes howells familiar letters wherein he applies to this farfamed sack the dictum good wine sendeth a man to heaven but i cannot agree with the learned oenologist or with the tradition of tenerife when told that the original canary was a sweet and not a dry wine as those who derive sack from the french word sec would have us believe sherris sack jerez seco was a harsh dry wine which was sugared as we sweeten tea hence poins addresses falstaff as sir john sack and sugar and the latter remarks if sack and sugar be a fault god help the wicked and the island probably had two growthsthe saccharine malvasia footnote as we find in leake p 197 researches in greece and henderson history of wines malvasia is an italian corruption of monemvasia greek monae embasiaa single entrance the neogreek name for the minoa promontory or island connected by a bridge with the laconian coast hence the french malvoisie and our malmsey prof azevedo loc cit opines that the date of the wines introduction disproves the legend of that maudlin clarence in his malmsey butt whose black grape was almost a raisin and a harsh produce like that of the modern gual with great volume and alcoholic strength but requiring time to make it palatable  the canaries mostly grew white wines that is the liquors were fermented without skins and stalks thus they did not contain all the constituents of the fruit and they were inferior in remedial and restorative virtues to red wines indeed a modern authority tells us that none but the latter deserve the name and that white wines are rather grapeciders than real wines  the best tenerife brands were produced on the northern slopes from sauzal and la victoria to garachico and ycod de los vinos the latter famed for its malmsey has lost its vines and kept its name the cultivation extended some 1500 feet above the sea and the plant was treated after the fashion of madeira and carniola s austria the latadas or trellises varied in height some being so low that the peasant had to creep under them all however had the same defect the fruit got the shade and the leaves the sun unless trimmed away by the cultivator who was unwilling to remove these lungs in too great quantities the french style the pruned plant supported by a stake was used only for the old and wornout and none dreamt of the galvanised wires along which mr leacock of funchal trains his vines in grand canary i have seen the grapeplant thrown over swathes of black stone like those which bare of fruit stretch for miles across the fertile wastes of the syrian haurán by heat and evaporation the grapes become raisins and as in dalmatia one pipe required as much fruit as sufficed for three or four of ordinary  the favourite of the canaries is or was the vidonia a juicy berry mostly white seldom black the same is the case with the muscadels the malvasia is rarely cultivated as it suffered inordinately from the vinedisease the valuable verdelho preferred at madeira is or was a favourite and there are or were half a dozen others the vendange usually began in the lowlands about the end of august and in the uplands a fortnight or three weeks later the grape was carried in large baskets by men women and children to the lagar or wooden press and was there trodden down as in madeira austria and italy the canarians like other neolatins an unmechanical race care little for economising labour the vinification resembled that of the isle of wood with one important exceptionthe stove this artificial heating to hasten maturity seems to have been soon abandoned  mr vizetelly is of opinion that the pure juice was apt to grow harsh or become ropy with age they remedied the former defect by adding a little gloria a thin sweet wine kept in store from the preceding vendange this was done in april or in may when the vintage was received at headquarters ropiness was cured by repeated rackings and by brandying eight gallons per pipe being the normal ratio that distinguished connoisseur found in an old malmsey of 1859 all the aroma and lusciousness of a good liqueur the london particular of 1865 tasted remarkably soft with a superior nose an 187172 made for the russian market had an oily richness with a considerable aroma an 1872 was mellow and aromatic and an 1875 had a good vinous flavour  canary possessed its own especial charácter as jonathan says if it developed none of the highest qualities of its successful rivals it became after eight to twelve years keeping a tolerable wine which many in england have drunk paying for good madeira the shorter period sufficed to mature it and it was usually shipped when three to four years old it kept to advantage in wood for a quarter of a century and in bottle it improved faster my belief is that the properest use of tenerife was to lengthen out the finer growths i found canary bearing the same relation to madeira as marsala bears to sherry the best specimens almost equalled the second or thirdrate madeiras moreover these wines are even more heady and spirituous than those of the northern island and there will be greater difficulty in converting them to the category vino de pasto a light dinnerwine  before 1810 tenerife exported her wines not from santa cruz but from orotava the centre of commerce here since the days of charles ii there was an english factory with thirty to forty british subjects protestants under the protection of the captaingeneral and their cemetery lay at the west end of el puerto whose palmy days were in 181215 the trade was then transferred to the modern capital where there are and have been for years only two english wineshipping firms messieurs hamilton and messieurs davidson the seniors of both families have all passed away but their sons and grandsons still inhabit the picturesque old houses on the marina  in 181215 the annual export of wine was 8000 to 11000 pipes the peace of 1815 was a severe blow to the trade between 1830 and 1840 however the vintage of the seven chief islands averaged upwards of 46000 of these tenerife supplied between 4000 and 5000 equivalent to the total produce since the days of the oïdium in 1852 admiral robinson reduced the number of pipes to 20000 worth 200000l in 186065 i saw the grape in a piteous plight the huge bunches were composed of dwarfed and wilted berries furred and cobwebbed with the foul mycelium the produce fell to 100150 pipes and at present only some 200 to 300 are exported the peninsula and the west african coast take the bulk england and germany ranking next and lastly spain which used the import largely in makingup wines the islanders now mostly drink the harsh coarse catalonians they still however make for home consumption a cheap white wine which improves with age it is regretable that fears of the oïdium and the phylloxera prevent the revival of the industry for which the islands are admirably fitted potatoes and other produce have also suffered but that is no obstacle to their being replanted  i left santa cruz and las palmas after two short visits with the conviction that both are on the highway of progress and much edified by their contrast with funchal the difference is that of a free port and a closed port in the former there is commercial industrial and literary activity las palmas can support two museums in the latter there is neither this that nor the other madeira also suffers from repressed emigration the canaries wisely allow their sons to make gold ounces abroad for spending at home  spain also a few years ago so backward in the race is fast regaining her place amongst the nations she is now reaping the benefit of her truly liberal not liberal policy such were the abolition of the morgado primogeniture in 1834 the closing of the 1800 convents in 183637 and the disamortizacion or suppression of church property and granting liberty of belief in 1855 finally the vigour infused by a shortwhich will lead to a longertrial of democracy and of republican institutions have given her a new life she is no longer the gallio of the western world    chapter x  the ruined riverport and the tattered flag  on the night of january 10 we steamed out of las palmas to cover the long line of 940 miles between grand canary and bathurst the a s s generously abandons the monopoly of the gambia to its rival the b and a receiving in exchange the poor profits of the isles de los consequently the old companys ships when homewardbound run directly from sierra leone to grand canary a weeks work of 1430 knots  hardly had we lost sight of the brown and barren island and las palmas in her magpie suit than we ran out of the brisa parda or grey northeast trade into calm and cool harmatan footnote the word is of disputed origin ahalabata or ahalalata on the gold coast is a foreign term denoting the dry norther or northeaster that blows from january to march or april zimmerman christalier makes haramata spanish harmatan an arabic word weather we begrudged the voyage this lovely season which should have been kept for the journey after the damp warmth of madeira the still and windless air felt dry but not too dry cold but not too cold decidedly fresh in early morning and never warm except at 3 pm the sun was pale and shorn as in england seldom showing a fiery face before 10 am or after 5 pm the sea at night appeared slightly milky like the white waters so often seen off the western coast of india every traveller describes the harmatan and most travellers transcribe the errors touching the infusoria and their coats which ehrenberg found at sea in the impalpable powder near the cape verde islands the dry cold blast is purely local not cosmical there is a fine reddishyellow sand in the lower airstrata we see it we feel it and we know that it comes from the deserttracts of northern africa the air rises en masse from the great sahara the vacuum is speedily filled by the heavier and cooler indraught from the north or south and the higher strata form the upper current flowing from the equator to the poles but siliceous dust will not wholly account for the veiling of the sun and the opaqueness of the higher atmosphere this arises simply from the want of humidity the air is denser and there is no vapour to refract and reflect the lightrays hence the haze which even in england appears to overhang the landscape when there is unusually droughty weather and hence conversely as all know the view is clearest before and after heavy showers when the atmosphere is saturated or supersaturated  on my return in early april we caught the northeast trades shortly after turning cape palmas and kept them till close upon grand canary they were a complete contrast with the harmatan the firmament looking exceptionally high and the sun shining hot while a crisp steady gale made the herds of proteus gambol and disport themselves over the long ridges thrown up by the cool plain of bright cerulean the horizon when clear had a pinkish hue and near coast and islands puffy folds of dazzling white nearly 5000 feet high were based upon darkgrey streaks of cloudland simulating continents and archipelagoes within the tropics the heavens appear lower and we never sight blue or purple water save after a tornado the normal colour is a dirty brassy yellowbrown here and there transparent but ever unsightly in the extreme it must depend upon some unexplained atmospheric conditions and the wateraspect is often at its ugliest when the skies are clearest i have often seen the same tints when approaching liverpool  through the harmatanhaze we failed to sight cape juby opposite fuerteventura and at santa cruz i missed mr mackenzie the energetic flooder of the sahará he has they say given up this impossibility and opened a comptoir its presence is very unpleasant to the french monopolists who seem to monopole more every year south of juby comes historic cape bojador the gorbellied and cabo blanco which is to northern what cabo negro is to southern africa the sole remarkable events in its life are firstly its being named by ptolemy granaria extrema whence the canarii peoples southwest of the moroccan atlas and our corrupted canaries and secondly its rediscovery by one gonçalez baldeza in 1440  on the afternoon of saturday january 14 we sighted in the offing the two paps of ovedec or cabo verde the hesperou keras the hesperium or arsenarium promontorium of pliny the trouvaille of diniz fernandez in 1446 the name is sub judice some would derive it from the grassy green slope clad with baobabs adansonia digitata megatheriumlike monsters topping the precipitous seawall which falls upon patches of yellow sand others would borrow it from the sargasso baccifera golfão or gulfweed which here becomes a notable feature cape verde the prasum promontorium of west africa is the trafalgar the westernmost projection of the dark continent fiery yet gloomy measuring 17° 3 from the meridian of greenwich the coast is exceedingly dangerous consequently shipwrecks are rare the owners as their national wont is have done their best to make it safe two lighthouses to the north of the true cape mark and define a long shoal with a heavy break the almadies rocks a ledge mostly sunk but here and there rising above the foam in wickedlooking diabolitos devilings or black fangs of which the largest is dieshaped a third pharos also brilliantly whitewashed crowns the cape and by its side is a lower seafacing building the sanatorium finally there is a light at the moleend of dakar  steaming past the madeleine rocks here and there capped with green and whitened by seafowl we sight through an opening in the curtain of coast the red citadel and the subject town of goree the gibraltar of western africa and the harbour of st louis capital of senegambia the island is now the only port the headquarters having suffered from the sandbar at the mouth of the senegal here our quondam rivals have made the splendid harbour of dakar whose jetties accommodate 180000 tons of shipping at the same time this powerful and warlike colony distant only twelve hours steaming from bathurst has her fleet of steamers for river navigation her tirailleurs du sénégal and her large force of fighting native troops fortified stations defend the course of the river even above the falls from the hostile and treacherous moors the subject and protected territories exceed algeria in extent and the position will link the french possessions in the mediterranean with the rich mineral lands proposed for conquest in the south  we english hug to ourselves the idea that the french are bad colonists if so france like china and india is improving at a pace which promises trouble algeria senegambia and siam should considerably modify the old judgment our neighbours have and honestly own to two grand faultsan excessive bureaucracy and a military or rather a martinet discipline which interferes with civil life and which governs too much on the other side england rules too little she is at present between the two proverbial stools she has lost the norm of honour aristocracy and she has lost it for ever but she has not yet acquired the full strength of democracy this is part secret of that disorganisation which is causing such wonder upon the continent of europe moreover colonial england has caught the disease of noninterference and the infection of economy the spawn of liberalism while her savings made by starving her establishments are of the category popularly described as pennywise and poundfoolish france has adopted the contrary policy she spends her money freely in making ports and roads and in opening communication through adjacent countries she lately sent a cruiser to madeira proposing to connect dakar by telegraph with the cape verde islands she is assiduous in forming friendly or rather peaceable relations with the people she begins on the right principle by officering her colonies with her best men naval and military in england anyone is good enough for west africa she impresses the natives before beginning to treat by an overwhelming display of force and if necessary by hard knocks she educates the children of the chiefs and compels all her lieges under a penalty to learn and if possible to speak french so far from practising noninterference she allows no one to fight but herself this imperious warlike imperial attitude is what africa wants it reverses our quakerlike fad for peace we allow native wars to rage ad libitum even at porto loko almost within cannonshot of sierra leone on the gambia river the natives have sneeringly declared that they will submit to the french who are men but not to us who are  later still the chiefs of futajalon went not to london but to paris  in 1854 france commenced a new and systematic course of colonial policy she first beat the pulos fulahs once so bold and then she organised and gave flags to them she checked with a strong hand the attacks of the moors upon the gumgatherers of the sahará and now after drawing away from us the gambia trade she has begun a railway intended to connect the senegal with the niger and completely to outflank us this line will annex the native regions behind our settlements and make bathurst and sierra leone insignificant dependencies upon the continent of gallic rule the total distance is at least 820 miles and the whole will be guarded by a line of forts it begins with a section of 260 kilometres which will transport valuable goods now injured by ass and camelcarriage the natives wearied with incessant petty wars are ready to welcome the new comers the western súdán or nigerbasin has a population estimated at forty millions ready if a market be opened to flock to it with agricultural and industrial products including iron copper and gold meanwhile the joliba black water with the benuwe and other tributaries offers a readymade waterway for thousands of miles sierra leone lies only 400 miles less than half from the niger but what would the colonial office say if a similar military line were proposed nor can we console ourselves by the feeble excuse that senegal has a climate superior to that of our pesthouses on the contrary she suffers severely from yellow fever which has never yet visited the british gold coast her mortality is excessive but she simply replaces her slain she has none of that mawkish hysterical humanitarianism which of late years has become a salient feature in our campaigning during the ashanti affair the main object seems to have been not the destruction of the enemy but to save as many privates as possible from ague and fever sunstroke and dysentery  ninety miles beyond cape verde placed us in the gambia waters off the lands of the guinea region i will not again attempt a history of the disputed word which barbot derives from ginahoa the first negro region visited by the portuguese others from ghana the modern kano from the jenneh or jinne of mungo park from jenna a coasttown once of note governed by an officer under the king of gambialand and in fine from the italian genoa  the ss senegal spent the night of the 14th on the soft and slippery mud awaiting the dawn what can the hydrographic department of the admiralty be doing what is the use of the three cruisers that still represent the old coffin squadron this coast has not had a survey since 1830 yet it changes more or less every year and half a century makes every map and plan obsolete but perhaps it would be wrong to risk seamens lives by exposure in open boats to insolation showers and surf  from sunrise the sea had changed its harmatangrey for a dull muddy dirty green and the leadsman who is now too civilised to sing out in the good old style calmly announced that the channel was shallowing gambia or gambi the gamboa and gambic of barbot chapter vii is said to mean clear water here a perfect misnomer it is miry as the mersey the molten gold of the gambia river is only the fine phrase of some poetic traveller low land loomed on both sides with rooty and tufted mangroves apparently based upon the waves showing that we approached an estuary which soon narrowed from thirty miles to seven and to two three buoys the outermost red then the fairway with chequers and cage and lastly white without cage all at a considerable distance off the land marked the riverbar and presently a black pilot came on board from his cutter we made some easting running along shore and gave a wide berth to the horseshoe bank and st marys shoal portwards to african knoll and middle ground starboardwards and to a crowd of other pleasant patches where the water was dancing a breakdown in the liveliest way  as we drew in shore the now burning sun shone with a sickly african heat through the sciroccoclouds and the thick yellow swampreek it will be

eastern africa the bole bears sharp broadbased thorns the wings or flying buttresses are larger several trunks rarely anastomose the branches seldom stand out horizontally nor are the leaves disposed in distinct festoons it is however a noble growth useful for shade and supplying a soft wood for canoes and stuffing for pillows fort bullen about one hours row from bathurst formerly lodged a garrison of seventeen men under the commandant and governor of the queens possessions in the barra country now the unwholesome site has been abandoned  the island and station of st mary bathurst of old a graveyard now start up to starboard the site was chosen apparently for its superior development of mud and mangrove miasma and malaria it is an island within an island st mary the greater is the northernmost of that mass of riverine holms and continental islands which formed by the cachéo and other great drains extends south to the rio grande measuring some twenty miles from north to south by six from east to west it is embraced by the two arms of the gambia delta and is marked in old maps as the combo forni and felúp country st mary the less upon which stands the settlement facing east is bounded eastward by the main mouth and westward by oyster creek a lagoonlike branch it is a mere sandpatch of twentyone square miles clothed by potent heats and flooding rains with a vivid and violent vegetation water is found everywhere three feet below the surface but it is bad and brackish there is hardly any versant or shed in places the land sinks below the waterlevel and despite the excellent brick sewers the showers prefer to sop and sod the soil and lest the island should be bodily carried away by man there is a penalty for removing even a pailful of sand from the beach  bathurst was unknown in the days of mungo park when traders ran up stream to jilifri nearly opposite fort james and to pisania the end of rivernavigation st marys island together with british combo albreda and the land called the ceded or english mile were bought from the mandenga chief of the combo province first christened st leopold and then bathurst after the minister of that name the actual town owes its existence to an order issued by sir charles macarthy that illstarred governor of sierra leone 181424 is still remembered in ashanti and on the gold coast he is immortalised by a pestiferous island in the upper gambia well described by winwood reade the settlement designed for the use of liberated africans was built in 1816 by lieutenantcolonel brereton and by captain alexander grant in 1821 it was made like the gold coast a dependency of sierra leone whose jurisdiction after the african company was abolished in 1820  footnote the first african company was established by queen elizabeth and in 1688 was allowed to trade with guinea the royal african company or guinea company of royal adventurers of england trading to africa was incorporated under charles ii on january 20 1663 a third was patented on september 27 1672 the african company 172224 was not allowed to interfere with interlopers  on may 71820 it was abolished after bankruptcy and its possessions passed over to the crown  extended from n lat 20° to s lat 20° i found it an independent government one of four in 1860 to 1865 in 1866 it again passed under the rule of sierra leone in 1874 this illadvised measure was withdrawn and the gambia was placed under an administrator and a legislative council the former subject to the governorinchief of sierra leone a score of years ago it was garrisoned by some 300 men of the west african corps now it is reduced to 100 armed policemen the gambia militia composed of the combo and macarthys island forces is never called out the population of the twentyone square miles is given by whittaker for 1881 as 14150 including 105 whites the wesleyans here as everywhere preponderating on the coast number 1405 souls the catholics 500 and the episcopalians 200  another halfhour placed before us bathurst in full view the first salient point is the graveyard where the station began and where the stationed end wags declare that the first question is have you seen our burialground a few tombstones mostly without inscriptions are scattered so near the shore that corpses and coffins have been washed away by the waves if new orleans be a normal wet grave this everywhere save near the sea is dry with a witness the depth and looseness of the sand making the excavation a crumbling hole four governors a list greatly to be prolonged lie here interred but matters of climate are becoming too serious for overattention to such places or subjects  the first aspect of this pesthouse from afar is not unpleasant a long line of scattered houses leads to the mass of the settlement faced by its marine parade and the tall trees give it a homelook some have compared the site with parts of the park at cheltenham  at a nearer view the town of some 5000 head suggests the idea of a small european wateringplace the execrable position has none of those undulations which make heaps of mens homes picturesque everything is low flat and straightlined as a yard of pumpwater the houses might be those of byculla bombay in fact they date from the same epoch they are excellent of their kind large uncompact piles of masonry glisteningwhite or dullyellow with blistered paint and slates tiles or shingles which last curl up in the sun like feathers a nearer glance shows the housewalls stained and gangrened with rot and mildew the riverfloods often shaking hands with the rains in the groundfloors the european ends in beehive native huts rising from the swamp and sand and these gradually fine off and end upstream becoming small by degrees and hideously less  bathurst has one compensating feature the uncommon merit of an esplanade the noble line of silkcotton trees separating houses from river is apparently the only flourishing item we remark that while some of these giants are clad in their old leaves others are bright green with new foliage while others are bare and broomy as english woods in midwinter they are backed by a truly portentous vegetation of red and white mangroves palms plantains and baobabs rank guineagrass filling up every gap with stalks and blades ten feet tall  nor was the scene in the riverharbour at all more lively the old albert of nigerian fame has returned to mother earth but we still note hms dover a venerable caricature with funnel long and thin which steams up stream when not impotenther chronic condition there are two large frenchmen loading groundnuts but neer an englishman the foreshore is defaced by seven miserable wharves shaky mangrovepiles black with age and white with oystershells driven into the sand and loosely planked over there is an eighth the gunpowder pier on the north face of the island and we know by its dilapidation that it is government property these stages are intended not for landingoh nobut only for loading ships stairs are wanting and passengers must be carried ashore pickaback the labourers are mainly if not wholly golah women of british combo whose mates live upon the proceeds of their labours today being sunday the juvenile piscators of bathurst muster strong upon the piers and no policeman bids them move on  when the mailbags were ready we received a visit from the black healthofficer and we reflected severely on the exceeding cheek of inspecting as a rule new comers from old england at this yellow home of pestilence but in the healthy time of the year we rarely see the listless emaciated whites with skins stained by unoxygenised carbon of whom travellers tell despite the sun all the bathurstians save the government officialsnow few too fewflocked on board maildays are here as in other places downcoast high days and holidays but times are changed and the ruined riverport can no longer afford the old traditional hospitality  cameron and i landed under browns wharf the southernmost pier opposite the red roof and the congeries of buildings belonging to the late proprietor we then walked up the high street or esplanade which is open to the river except where the shore is cumbered with boats hides lumber and beachnegroes this is a kind of openair market where men and women sit in the shade spinning weaving and selling fruits and vegetables with one incessant flux of tongue here too amongst the heaps and intimately mixed with the naked infantry stray small goats pretty and deershaped and gaunt pigs sharpsnouted and longlegged as the worst irisher  several thoroughfares upper and lower run parallel with the river all are connected like a chessboard by crosslanes at right angles and their grassgrown centres are lined by open drains of masonry now bonedry the pavement is composed of stone and dust which during the rains becomes mud the trottoirs are in some places of brick in others of asphalte in others of cracked slabs mostly however we walk on sand and gravel which fills our boots with something harder than unboiled peas the multiplicity of useless walls the treeclumps and the green sward faintly suggested memories of a semideserted singlecompany station in western india and the decayed tumbledown look of all around was a deadlylively illustration of the hebrew ichabod  i passed with a sense of profound sadness the old commissariat quarters now degraded to a customhouse the roomy substantial edifice of stone and lime with large open verandahs here called piazzas lofty apartments galleries terraced roofs and in fact everything an african house should have still stood there but all shut up as if the antique domus were in mourning for the past what homeric feeds what noctes coenoeque deorum we have had there in joyous past times but now that most hospitable of westcoasters commissary blanc has been laid in the sandy cemetery and where oh where are the rest of the jovial crew martin and sherwood i found only one relic of the bygoneand a wellfavoured relic he ismr w n corrie with whom to exchange condolences and to wail over the ruins  passing the postoffice and the french spanish portuguese and american consulates poor copies of the dear old commissariat we halted outside at mr goddards and obtained from mr r e cole a copy of his lecture the river gambia read at york september 1881 it gave me pleasure to find in it the man that is wanted throughout the west coast of africa is not the negro but the chinaman and should he ever turn his steps in its direction he will find an extensive and remunerating field for the exercise of his industry and intelligence  we then turned our attention from the town to the townspeople they have not improved in demeanour during the last twenty years even then the liberateds and recaptives chiefly akus and ibos had begun the high jinks which we shall find at their highest in sierra leone they had organised companies the worst of tradeunions elected headmen indulged in strikes and more than once had come into serious collision with the military the mandengas whom mungo park calls mandingoes and characterises as a wild sociable and obliging people soon waxed turbulent and unruly this is to be expected a race of warriors must be governed by the sword they would prefer for themselves military law to all the blessings of a constitution or a plébiscite but philanthropy wills otherwise and in these days the english authorities do not keep up that state whose show secures the respect of barbarians where the governor walks about escortless like a private individual he must expect to be treated as such  there is no difficulty in distinguishing at first sight moslem from kafir besides the gypsylike pulo the brown race our older fúlahs and fellalahs whose tongue is said to be a congener of the nubian and the wild halfnaked pagan jolu the principal tribes are two the mandengas and the wólofs the former whom europeans divide into the marabút who does not drink and the soninki who does inhabit a triangle its base being the line from the south of the senegal to the gambia river and its apex the niger it has even extended to near tinbukhtu the well of bukhtu our timbuctoo in old mohammedan works their territory is called wángara this race of warmen and horsemen surprisingly resembles the somal who hold the same parallels of latitude in eastern africa as to small heads semicaucasian features asiatic above the nosetip and african below tall lithe figures high shoulders and long limbs especially the forearm  there is the usual negroland variety in the picturesque toilette no two men are habited alike a phrygian bonnet glengarry or libertycap of dark indigodyed cotton and sometimes a kantop or earcalotte of india and hausaland surmount their cleanshaven heads for this they substitute when travelling country umbrellas thatches of plaited palmleaves in umbrellashape further down coast we shall find the regular sunhat of madeira with an addition of loose strawends which would commend itself to ophelia the decent bodygarb is a kamís a nightgown of longcloth and wide short drawers the whole is covered with a sleeveless abá or burnous and sometimes with a halfsleeved caftanhere termed tobegarnished with a huge breastpocket it is generally indigostained with marblings or broadnarrow stripes of lighter tint than the groundwork an essential article hung round the neck or slung to the body is the grigri taawíz or talisman a koranic verse or a magic diagram enclosed in a leathern roll or in a flat square of these prophylactics which answer to european medals and similar fetish a serious person will wear dozens and they are held to be such strong medicine that even pagans will barter or pay for them blacksmiths weavers and spinners work out of doors contrary to the general moslem rule these mandengas honour workers in iron and leather and the kings blacksmith and cobbler are royal councillors  some of the motley crowd sit reading what the incurious stranger tells you is the alcoran they are perusing extracts and prayers written in the square semicufic maghrabi character which would take a learned meccan a week to decipher others polluted by a license which calls itself liberty squat gambling shamelessly with pegs stuck in the ground now and then fightinglooking fellows ride past us with the arabic ringbit and the heavy mandenga demipique the nags are ponies some ten hands high ragged and angular but hardy and surefooted as most of the equines in this part of africa they are when well fed intensely vicious and quarrelsome like the syrians they have only three paces the walk the lazy loping canter and the brisk hard gallop the trot is a provisional passage from slow to fast yet with all their shortcomings i should prefer them to the stunted bastard barb locally called an arab and priced between 20l and 40l the latter generally dies early from chills and checked perspiration which bring on loindisease paralysis of the hindquarters or from a fatal swelling of the stomach the result of bad forage most of the men carried knives daggers and crooked swords in curious leather scabbards this practice should never be permitted in africa natives entering a station should be compelled to leave their weapons with the policeman at the nearest guardhouse  the wólofs a name formerly written joloff also dwell in senegambia between the senegal and the gambia and their habitat is divided into sundry petty kingdoms as early as 1446 they were known to the portuguese and one bemoy of princely house soon afterwards visited lisbon was baptised and did homage to d joão ii more like the abyssinians than their mandenga neighbours they are remarkable for good looks pendent ringlets and tasteful dress and decorations black but comely with long oval faces finely formed features straight noses and glossy jetty skins in character they are brave and dignified and they are distinctly negroids not negroes this small maritime tribe who make excellent sailors is interesting and civilisable many have been christianised especially by the roman catholic missioners the only native tongue spoken by european residents at bathurst is the wólof as m dard remarks in his grammaire wolof the footnote he was instituteur de lÉcole woloffrançaise du sénégal and published in 1826 it is still said that no one will speak wolof like him the result of the new régíme of compulsory french instruction i printed 226 of his proverbs in wit and wisdom from west africa london tinsleys 1865 it is curious to compare them with those of the pagan negroes further south  language is widely spread mungo park often uses expressions which he deems mandenga but which belong to the jews of west africa as the wólofs are sometimes called their extensive commercial dealings between the coast and the western sudan being the only point of likeness for instance in the tale of poor nealee the cry kangtegi cut her throat is the wólof kungakateke let her head be cut off and nealee affeeleeata nealee is lost  appears equally corrupted by author or printer from nealu afeyleata nealee breathes no more  pursuing our peregrinations we reach no 1 fort at the northern angle of the town northeastern corner of the islet st mary the less this old round battery is surmounted by three 32pounders en barbette with iron carriages and traversing platforms but without racers a single 7inch shell would smash the whole affair thence we bent westward and passed the once neat albert market with its metal roof built in 185456 by governor luke oconnor and isaac bage we did not enter the place swarms with both sexes in blue african indigo yields a charming purple but one soon learns to prefer white clothing nor need i describe the stuff exposed for sale there will be a greater variety at sierra leone  passing the market we come upon the engineers yard which a handbill sternly forbids us to enter it contains a chapel where the rev mr nicol officiates this loose box is more hideous than anything i have yet seen a perfect study of architectural deformity the cracked bell and the nasal chant at times rising to a howl as of anguish were completely in character as the service ended issued a stream of worshippers mostly women attired in costumes which will be noticed further on most of them led negrolings suggesting the dancing dog meanwhile the police armed only with sidearms swordbayonets and looking more like sierra leone convicts reformed and uniformed followed a band composed of drums cymbals and a haughty black sergeant a mulatto noncommissioned bringing up the rear they went round and round the barrack square a vast space occupied chiefly by grass and drains in the background is the large jaundiced building upon whose clocktower floated or rather depended the flag of st george the white building by its side is the colonial hospital it has also seen better days  we resolved to call upon mr administrator v s goulsbury md and cmg he had lately been subjected to an attack of course anonymous in the african times an attack the more ungentlemanly and cowardly because it reflected upon his private not public life and consequently he could neither notice it nor answer it nor bring an action for libel this scandalous print which has revived the old satirist in its most infamous phase habitually inserts any tissue of falsehoods suggested to proceed from a native an african a negro and carefully writes down to the lowest level of its readers it attracts attention by the cant of charity and shows its devotion to the bible and nothing but the bible by proving that the earth having four corners is flat and that the sun which once stood still must move round its parasite the manner of this pestilence is right worthy of its matter and the style would be scouted in a decent housekeepers room all wellmeaning men of either colony declare that it has done more harm in west africa than the grossest abuse yet written its tactic is to set black against white to pander for the public love of scandal and systematically to abuse all the employés of government and the sole object of this vile politic loudly proclaimed to be philanthropic and negrophile has been low lucrein fact an attempt to butter its bread with black brother  we inspected the second or western fort a similar battery of six 32pounders with two 10inch mortars fit only to pound fúfú or bananapaste add a single brass fieldpiece useful as a morning and evening gun for this highly military station then we came to government house apparently deserted flying a frayed and tattered white and blue flag which might have been used on board hms dover but which ought to have been supplanted on shore by a union jack after waiting a quarter of an hour we managed with the assistance of a sentinel whose feet were in slippers and whose artillery carbine was topheavy with a fixed swordbayonet to arouse a negro servant by whom we sent in our cards to he the administrator an old traveller on the gold coast and lately returned from a long expedition into the interior footnote gambia expedition to the upper gambia london eyre and spottiswoode 1882 he had much to tell us his knowledge of ashantiland however induced him to place the kong mountains in that meridian too far north he held the distance from the seaboard to be at least 500 miles but he quite agreed with us about the necessity of importing chinese coolies here no free man works the people say when a slave gets his liberty he will drink rainwaterrather than draw it from a well the chief cargo of the ss senegal was chinese rice when almost every acre of the lower gambia would produce a cereal superior in flavour and bolder in grain hands however are wanting and all the women are employed in loading and unloading ships  the residency is a fine large building in an advanced stage of decomposition the glorious vegetation around itcottontrees caoutchoucfigs and magnificent oleandersmaking the pile look grimmer and grislier and here we realised to the fullest extent how thoroughly ruined is the hapless settlement the annual income is about 24500l the expenditure is 20000l in round numbers and the economies are said to reach 25000l this sum is forwarded to the colonial chest instead of being expended in local improvements and practically when some petty warstorm breaks it is wasted like water the local officials are not to be blamed for this miserable system this niggardly colonial policy of the modern economical school which contrasts so poorly with the lavish republican expenditure in french senegambia they have to their honour be it said often protested against the taxes raised from struggling merchants and a starveling population poor as hindûs being expended upon an imperial policy but economy is the order of the day at home and an administrator inclined to parsimony gladly seizes the opportunity of pleasing his office the result is truly melancholy i complained in 1862 that the civil establishment at bathurst cost 7075l i now complain that it has been reduced to 2600l footnote administrator  1300l chief magistrate  600l collector and treasurer  700l thus there is no colonial secretary and curious to say no colonial chaplain i formerly recommended the establishment to be reduced by at least onehalf and that half to be far better paid wanderings in west africa i 182 the whole establishment is starved decay appears in every office public and private and ruin is writ large upon the whole station an englishman who loves his country must blush when he walks through bathurst even john bull would be justified in wishing that he had been born a frenchman in west africa  we returned to the ss senegal anything but edified and there another displeasure awaited us our gallant captain must have known that he could not load and depart that day yet diplomatically mysterious he would not say so consequently we missed a visit to cape st mary the breezy cliff of which i retain the most agreeable memory the scenery had appeared to me positively beautiful after the foul swamps of st marys islandstubbles of guineacorn loved by quails a velvety expanse of green grass sloping inland with here and there a goodly palmyra grander than the columns of baalbek palms necklaced with winecalabashes and a grove of baobab and other forest trees cabled with the most picturesque llianas where birds of gorgeous plume sit and sing we could easily have hired hammocks or horses or these failing have walked the distance six or seven miles true oyster creek the shallow western outlet of the gambia has still a ferry a bridge was lately built but it fell before it was finished it would however have been pleasurable to pass a night away from the feverhaunts of bathurst  during one of my many visits to bathurst i resolved to inspect old fort james one thirsts for a bit of antiquity in these african lands so bare of all but modern ruins like bance island further south it is the parent of the modern settlement and so far it has the charm of origin my companion was captain philippi then well known at lagos the last time we met was unexpectedly at solingen a boat with four krumen was easily found but our friends warned us that the ascensus would be easy and the descensus the reverse the latter has sometimes taken a day and a night  the gambia river here opens its mouth directly to the north and after a great elbow assumes its normal eastwest course we ran before a nineknot breeze and shortly before noon after two hours southing we were off the halfway house reefgirt dog island and dog point in the barra country the dull green stream sparkled in the sun and the fringe of mangroves appeared deciduous some trees were bare as if dead others were clothed with bright foliage presently we passed british albreda where our territory now ends this small place has made a fuss in its day it was founded by the french in 1700 as a dependency of goree and it carried on a slavetrade highly detrimental to english interests in 1783 the owners had abandoned all right to its occupation and in 1858 they ceded it to their english rivals the landing is bad especially when the miry ebbtide is out the old village of the french company was reduced when we visited it to a few huts and two whitewashed and redroofed houses occupied by a frenchwoman in native dress and by an english subject mr hughes the latter did the honours of the place and showed us the only punkah at that time known to the west african coast  from dog island we bent to the east and passed the jilifri or grilofre village in the badibu country a place well known during the days of park then bending southeast after a total of four hours covering seventeen to eighteen knots we landed upon james island the site of fort james the scrap of ground has a history first the portuguese here built a factory captain jobson found this fact to his cost when 1621 he sailed up in search of gold to satico then the last point of navigation a few words in the native dialectsalcalde for instancepreserve the memory of the earliest owners it passed alternately into the hands of the dutch french and english who exchanged some shrewd blows upon the matter of possession in 1695 it was destroyed by m de gennes and was rebuilt by the royal african company which had monopolised the traffic it fell again in 1702 to capitaine de la roque and cost the conqueror his life in 1709 it was attacked for the third time by m parent commanding four privateering frigates about 1730 we have from mr superintendent francis moore a notice of it amongst the companys establishments on the gambia river the island is described as being situated in midstream here three to four miles broad thirty miles from the mouth the extent was 200 yards long by fifty broad the factory had a governor and a deputygovernor two officers eight factors thirteen writers two inferior attendants and thirtytwo negro servants the force consisted of a company of soldiers besides armed sloops and shallops compare the same with our starved establishment at the ruined riverport in other parts of the gambia valley eight subordinate comptoirs including jilifri or gilofre traded for hides and beeswax ivory slaves and gold when mungo park travelled 179597 the opening of the european trade had reduced its exports to a gross value of 20000l in three ships voyaging annually after the african company was abolished 1820 it passed over to the crown and the station was transferred to its graveyard saintemarie de bathurst barbot footnote lib i chap vii a description of the coasts of north and south guinea c in 1700 printed in churchills collection also his supplement ibid pp 42626 tells us that fort james was founded 1664 under the names of the duke of york and the royal african company by commodore holmes when expeditioning against the hollanders in north and south guinea it was the headcentre of trade and its principal defence but he says the occupants were obliged to fetch fresh water from either bank had the cistern and the powdermagazine been bombproof and drink as well as meat stored quant suff the fort would have been in a manner impregnable if well defended by a suitable garrison the latter in his day consisted of sixty to seventy whites besides gromettoes free black sepoys  this quasivenerable site is a little holm a hundred yards in diameter somewhat larger than the many which line the rivers western bank we found its stony shingle glazed with a lightgreen sediment which forbade bathing and which suggested fever the material is conglomerate fine and coarse in an ironreddened matrix hence old writers call it a sort of gravelly rock a little above water salsolaceæ tapestry the shore and figtrees and young calabashes spring from the stone the ground is strewn with white shells tiles bricks and iridescent bottlesthe invariable concomitants and memorials of civilisation the masonry lime and ashlar is excellent but time and the portentous growth of the tropics have cracked and fissured the walls masses of masonry are fallen and others are assuming the needleshape the great quadrangle had lozengeshaped bastions at each end then lined with good brickwork the outliers which run round the riverholm were three horseshoe redoubts with batteries along the palisades from one to another four old iron guns remained out of a total of sixty to seventy pieces the features were those of the ancient slavebarracoon dwellinghouses tanks and cisterns magazines stores and powderroom all broken by the treasurehunter  the return to bathurst was a bitter draught we had wind and water against us and the thick mist prevented our taking bearings hungry thirsty weary cross and cramped we reached the steamer at 5 am and slept spitefully as long as we could  the last displeasure of my latest visit to bathurst was the crowd of native passengers daddy mammy and piccaninny embarking for sierra leone and the host of friends that came to bid them goodbye they did not fail to abscond with m colonnas pet terrier and with the stewards potatoes no surveillance can keep this longfingered lot from picking and stealing it is a political as well as a social mistake to take negro firstclass passengers a ruling race cannot be too particular in such matters and the white mans position on the coast would be improved were the black man kept in his proper place a kind of firstclass secondclass might be invented for them nothing less pleasant than their society the stewards have neglected to serve soup to some negro who at every meal has edged himself higher up the table and whose conversation consists of whispering into the ear of a black neighbour with an occasional guffaw like that of the laughing jackass  i say daddee i want my soop all de passenger he drink im soop me no drink my soop what he mean dis palaver  the sentence ends in a scream the steward smiles and the firstclass resumes  ah you larf and what for you larf i no larf i no drinkee soop  here the dialogue ends and men confess by their looks that travelling sometimes does throw us into the strangest society  even in sierra leone where the negro claims to be civilised a dusky belle after dropping her napkin at a government house dinner has been heard to say to her neighbour please mr officerman pick up my towel the other day a dark dame who missed her parasol thus addressed he grovernah me come ere wid my umbrellah where he be my umbrellah give me my umbrelláh no go widout my umbrelláh  for our black and brown passengers fore and aft there is a graduated and descending scale of terminology 1 european that is brought up in england 2 civilised man 3 african 4 man of colour the cullered pussun of the united states 5 negro 6 darkey and 7 nigger which here means slave all are altogether out of their assiettes at home they will eat perforce cankey fufu kiki and bad fish washing them down with mimbo bamboowine and pitto hopless beer the pombe of the east coast here they abuse the best of roast meat openly sigh for palaversauce and palmoil chop and find fault with the claret and champagne chez eux they wear breechcloths and natures stockingseoco tutto here both men and women must dress like europeans and a portentous spectacle it is the horror reaches its height at sierra leone where the pulpit as well as the press should deprecate human beings making such caricatures of themselves  in west africa we see three styles of dress the first or seminude is that of the kruraces a scanty pagne or waistwrapper the dark skin appearing perfectly decent the second is the ample flowing robe at once becoming and picturesque with the shalwar or wide drawers of the moslems from morocco to the equator the third is the hideous frank attire affected by sierra leone converts and white blackmen as their fellowdarkies call them  many of the costumes that made the decks of the ss senegal hideous are de fantaisie as if the wearers had stripped pegs in

and that there is truth in the african proverb if your head is not torn off you will wear a headdress corresponding with our common saying better out of the world than out of the fashion but this nuisance i repeat should be abated with a strong hand by the preacher as well as by the pressman the women and the children are well enough as nature made them they make themselves mere caricatures

would at first appear pure english as a language is too difficult in all points to spread far and wide pidgin english is not already the chinese have produced a regular lingua franca and the japanese

aggrandisement much like forbidding a growing boy to grow expired in 1855 since that time whilst we have refrained even from abating the nuisance of native wars our very lively neighbours have annexed the casamansa river with the fine coffeelands extending from the nunez southwards to the ponga river and have made a doughty attempt to absorb matacong lying a few miles north of sierra leone  whilst english gambia is monopolised by the french french gaboon is or rather was in english hands for a score of years men of sense have asked why not exchange the two when nations so decidedly rivalistic meet assuredly it is better to separate à laimable moreover so long as our economical and freetrade fads endure it is highly advisable to avoid the neighbourhood of france and invidious comparisons between its policy and our nonpolicy or rather impolicy  according to the best authorities the whole of the west african coast north of sierra leone might be ceded with advantage to the french on condition of our occupying the gaboon and the regions coast and islands south of it except where the land belongs to the portuguese and the spaniards some years ago an energetic effort was made to effect the exchange but it was frustrated by missionary and sentimental considerations those who opposed the idea shuddered at the thought of making over to a romanist power  the poor converts of protestantism the peoples who had been peaceful and happy so long under the protecting aegis of great britain the races whom we were bound by an unwritten contract not only to defend but to civilise to advance in the paths of progress the colonists feared to part with the old effete possession lest the french should oppose as they have done in senegal all foreign industryin fact seal up the gambia a highly respectable merchant the late mr brown contributed not a little by his persuasive pen to defeat the proposed measure and now it is to be feared that we have heard the last of this matter our rivals have found out the high value of their once despised equatorial colony if ever the exchange comes again to be discussed i hope that we shall secure by treaty or purchase an exclusively british occupation of grand bassam and the assini valley mere prolongations of our protectorate on the gold coast a future page will show the reason why our imperial policy requires the

tone there was none of the extreme bumptiousness and pugnacious impudence of twenty years ago indeed the beachboys nowhere a promising class were rather civil than otherwise not a single allusion to the contrast of white niggahs and black genlemen nor did the unruly disorderly african character ever show itself as formerly it often did by fisticuffing hairpulling and cursing with a mixture of english and darkcontinent ideas and phraseology whose tout ensemble was really portentous  the popular voice ascribes this immense change for the better to the energetic action of governor s rowe 1876

for glass windows the dead arches in the long walls are externally stone and internally brick the building was full of fat middleaged negresses sitting at squat before their blyes or round baskets

succeeded to this american hotel and visitors must depend upon the hospitality of acquaintances a frenchman lately opened a gasthaus and lost no time in becoming bankrupt there is however a manner of boardinghouse kept by a mrs king  turning south from water street we passed the wilberforce or rather the willyfoss memorial a colossal scandal noticed by every visitor at sá leone a folly which has cost 3000l its condition is exactly what it was two decads agoa chapellike shell of dingy mouldy laterite with six lancetwindows and metal pillars its case is a complicated concern the ecclesiastical authorities wanted it for their purposes and so did the secular civilians and so did the military at last the sá leonites hopeless of obtaining a government grant have set on foot a subscription which reached 500lsome say 700l there are therefore certain fitful signs of activity and bricks and firebricks now cumber the ground but it is all a flash in the pan the present purpose is to make it a library in place of the fine old collection which went to the dogs it is also to serve as a lectureroom but who is there in the african liverpool that can lecture what is he to lecture about who will stand or sit out being lectured  immediately beyond this grim and grisly reminiscence are the neat dwellinghouse and the store of the honourable mr sybille boyle so named from a ship and from her captain rn who served in the preventive squadron about 1824 he is an unofficial member of council and a marked exception to the rule of the liberateds everybody has a good word to say of him the establishment is the regular colonial where you can buy anything between a needle and a sheetanchor bottled ale is not wanting and thus steamerpassengers learn to congregate in the back parlour  we then walked to the top of gloucester street expecting to see the duke of edinburghs memorial i left it an arch of sticks and timber spanning this main crossline which leads to government house the temporary was to be supplanted by a permanent marble arc de triomphe commemorating the auspicious occasion when the black colony first looked upon a live white royal highness at once 700l was subscribed and only 800l was wanting but all those interested in the matter died and the 350l which remained in the chest was i believe transferred to the willyfoss  the august day is still kept as a public holiday for the people are after their fashion loyalmouthed in the extreme but the memorial is clean forgotten and men stare if you ask about it halfway up the street is the postoffice whose white chief is not a whit more civil than the negro head in 1862  upon this highly interesting spot we stood awhile to note the peculiarities of the place and its position the soil is a loose clay deepred or brown impregnated with iron and where unclothed with humus cold and infertile as the spontaneous aloe shows the subsoil is laterite also highly ferruginous soft and working well with the axe while it retains the quarrywater it soon hardens by exposure and thus weathered it forms the best and ugliest of the local building materials embedded in the earths surface are blocks and boulders apparently erratic dislodged or washed down from the upper heights where similar masses are seen many are scattered as if by an eruption others lie in slab or dome shape upon the shore the shape is usually spheroidal and the material hypersthene a hard and closegrained bluish granite or diorite greenstonetrap blackened by sun and rain in the few cuttings of the higher levels i afterwards remarked that detached hardheads are puddinged into the friable laterite but i nowhere found the granitic floorrock protruding above ground the boulders are treated by ditching and surrounding with a hot fire for fortyeight hours cold water not vinegar is then poured upon them and causes the heated material suddenly to contract and fracture when it can easily be removed magnetic iron also occurs and specimens have been sent to england but veins have not yet been discovered  our walk had furnished us with a tolerable idea of the citys plan without referring to the printed affair fronting north with westing it is divided into squares blocks and insulae after the fashion of a chessboard this is one of the oldest as well as the newest mode of distributions the temples of the classical gods being centrally situated required for general view broad straight approaches from washington to buenos ayres the modern cities of the new world have reverted to this ancient system without other reason but a love of regularity and simplicity here the longer streets flank the sea and the shorter run at right angles up the inner slopes both are bright red lines worn in the vegetation between the houses the ribbons of green are the american or bahama grass fine silky and creeping along the ground it is used to stuff mattresses and it forms a good substitute for turf when first imported it was neglected cut away and nearly killed out now it is encouraged because its velvety plots relieve the glaring red surface it keeps off the bush and it clears the surface of all other vegetation looking upon the city below we were surprised to see the dilapidation of the tenements some have tumbled down others were tumbling down many of those standing were lumber or board shanties called quarterframes and groundfloors sundry large piles rose grisly and firecharred and the few good houses looked quite modern but what can be expected in a place where europeans never expect to outstay the second year and where africans who never yet worked without compulsion cannot legally be compelled to work  we then walked up to government house the fort thornton of old charts whose roof seen from the sea barely tops the dense curtain of tree and shrubbery that girds and hangs around it passing under a cool and shady avenue of mangoes and figs and the archway guarded by a porters lodge and a detachment of the three hundred local police we came in sight of the large rambling residence built piecemeal like many an english countryhouse there is little to recommend it save the fine view of the sea and the surrounding shrubberyground i can well understand how with the immense variety of flower and fruit suddenly presented to his eyes the gentleman fresh from england required six months to recover the free and full use of all his senses and faculties  a policemanno longer a zouave of the west indian corpstook in our cards and we introduced ourselves to captain a e havelock governorinchief of sierra leone and the gambia he is no 47 since captain day rn first ruled in ad 1803 i had much to say to him about sundry of his predecessors captain havelock who dates only from 1881 has the reputation of being slightly black the neri and the bianchi factions here represent the buffs and blues of a land further north he is yet in the heyday of popularity when in the consecrated phrase the ruler gains golden opinions but colonial judgments are fickle and mostly in extremes after this smiling season the weather lowers the storm breaks and all is elemental rage when from being a manner of demigod the unhappy ruler gradually becomes one of the meanest and basest of men absit omen  we returned at sunset to government house and spent a pleasant evening the smokes had vanished and with them the frowse and homeliness of morning the sun with rays of lilac red set over a panorama of townlet land and sea to which distance added many a charm mingling afar with the misty horizon the nearer waters threw out by their golden and silvery sheen the headlands capes and tongues stretching in long perspective below while the sugarloaf father of mountains rose in solitary grandeur high above his subject hills on the nearer slope of signal hill we saw the first of the destructive bushburnings they are like prairiefires in these lands and sometimes they gird freetown with a wall of flame complexion is all in all to sá leone and she showed for a few moments a truly beautiful prospect  the governor has had the courage to bring out mrs havelock and she has had the courage to stand firm against a rainy season the climate is simply the worst on the west coast despite the active measures of sanitation lately taken the department of public health the ordinances of the colonial government in 1879 and the excellent water with which the station is now provided on a clear sunny day the charnelhouse i repeat is lovely mais cest la mort it is the terrible beauty of death mrs melville says with full truth i felt amidst all the glory of tropic sunlight and everlasting verdure a sort of ineffable dread connected with the climate even when leaving the pestilent shore she was haunted by the shadowy presence this is womanly but a little reflection must suggest it to man  even half a century ago opinions differed concerning the climate of the colony dr madden could obtain only contradictory accounts footnote see wanderings in west africa for details vol i p 275 there is a tradition of a chief justice applying to the colonial office for information touching his pension the clerks could not answer him and he presently found that none of his predecessors had lived to claim it mr judge rankin was of opinion that its illfame was maintained by policy on the one hand and by ignorance of truth on the other but mr judge died a few days after so with dr macpherson of the african colonial corps it appears illomened to praise the place and after repeated visits to it i no longer wonder that the medical gazette of april 14 1838 affirmed no statistical writer has yet tried to give the minutest fraction representing the chance of a surgeons return from sierra leone  on the other hand mrs falconbridge whose husband was sent out from england on colonial business in 1791 and who wrote the first ladys book upon the coast pointed out at the beginning that sickness was due quite as much to want of care as to the climate in 1830 mr john cormack merchant and resident since 1800 stated to a committee of the house of commons that out of twentysix europeans in his service seven had died seven had remained in africa and of twelve who returned to england all save two or three were in good health we meet with a medical opinion as early as 1836 that not onefourth of the deaths results merely from climate cases of old residents are quotedfor instance governor kenneth macaulay a younger brother of zachary macaulay who resisted it for twenty years mr reffall for fifteen years and sundry other exceptions  in this section of the nineteenth century it is the custom to admit that the climate is bad and dangerous but that it has often been made the scapegoat of european recklessness and that much of the sickness and death might be avoided the improvement is attributed to the use of quinine unknown to the early settlers and much is expected from sanatoria and from planting the blue gum eucalyptus globulus which failed owing to the carelessness and ignorance of the planters a practical appreciation of the improvement is shown by the star life assurance society which has reduced to five per cent its former very heavy rates lastly the bad health of foreigners is accounted for by the fact that they leave their own country for a climate to which they are not accustomed where the social life and the habits of the people are so different from their own and yet that they continue doing all things as in england  but how stand the facts at the white mans red grave mrs havelock and the wife of the officer commanding the garrison are the only europeans in the colony whereas a score of years ago i remember half a dozen even the warmest apologisers for the climate will not expose their wives to it preferring to leave them at home or in madeira during last march there were five deaths of white menthat is more than a thirdout of a total of 163 what would the worst of english colonies say to a mortality of 350 per thousand per annum of course we are told that it is exceptional and the case of the insurance societies is quoted but they forget to tell us the reason a mail steamer now calls at freetown once a week and the invalid is sent home by the first opportunity similarly a silly east indian statistician proved from the rare occurrence of fatal cases aden to be one of the healthiest stations under the company he ignored the fact that even a scratch justified the surgeons in shipping a man off on sick leave  i quite agree with the view of mr frederick evans footnotes the colonies and india dec 24 1881 let anyone anxious to test the nature of the climate go to kew gardens and sit for a week or two in one of the tropical houses there he may be assured that he will by no means feel in robust health when he leaves the simile is perfect europeans living in africa like europeans as regards clothing and diet are i believe quite right we tried grasscloth instead of broadcloth in western india when general rheumatism was the result in the matter of meat and drink the englishman cannot do better than adhere to his old mode of life as much as possible with a few small modifications let him return to the mealtimes of queen elizabeths day    sunrise breakfast sun high dinner   sundown sup makes a saint of a sinner  and especially shun the 9 am breakfast which leads to a heavy tiffin at 1 pm the hottest and most trying section of the day with respect to diet if he drinks a bottle of claret in england let him reduce himself in africa to a pint cut with water if he eats a pound of meat he should be contented with eight ounces and an extra quantity of fruit and vegetables in medicine let him halve his cathartics and double his dose of tonics  from its topographical as well as its geographical position the climate of freetown is oppressively hot damp and muggy the annual mean is 795° fahr the usual temperature of the dwellings is from 78° to 86° fahr its year is divided into two seasons the dries and the rains the wet season begins in may and ends with november for the last five years the average downfall has been 155 inches five times greater than in rainy england these five months are times of extreme discomfort the damp heat despite charcoal fires in the houses and offices mildews everythingclothes weapons books man himself it seems to exhaust all the positive electricity of the nervous system and it makes the patient feel utterly miserable it also fills the air with noxious vapours during the short bursts of sunshine perpendicularly rained down and breeds a hateful brood of what the portuguese call immundiciesa foul insectyouth only the oldest residents prefer the wet to the dry months the rains end in the sickliest season of the year when the sun now getting the upper hand sucks the miasmatic vapours from the soil and distributes them to mankind in the shape of ague and fever dysentery and a host of diseases the dries last from november to april often beginning with tornadoes and ending with the harmatan smokes or scirocco the climate is then not unlike bombay except that it lacks the mild east indian attempt at a winter and that barometric pressure hardly varies  during my last visit to sá leone i secured a boat and accompanied by dr lovegrove of the ass armenian set out to inspect the lower bed of the rokel and the islands which it waters passing along fourah bay we remarked in the high background a fine brook cold clear and pure affording a delicious bath it is almost dry in the dries and swells to a fiumara during the rains its extent was then a diminutive rivulet tumbling some hundreds of feet down a shelving bed into granville bay the break beyond fourah on the way we passed several timni boats carrying a proportionately immense amount of muslin of old the lords of the land they still come down the river with rice and cocoanuts from the kwiah quiah country from porto loko from waterloo and other places up stream they not unfrequently console themselves for their losses by a little hard fighting witness their defence of the modúka stockade in 1861 when four officers and twentythree of our men were wounded footnote wanderings in west africa vol i pp 24647 some of the boats are heavy rowbarges with a framework of sticks for a sternawning an old mandenga with cottony beard sits at each helm they row simplices munditiis at sá leone men are punished for not wearing overalls and thus the city becomes a ragfair the timni men are dark negroids with the slightest infusion of semitic blood some had coated their eyebrows and part of their faces with chalk for ophthalmia they appeared to be merry fellows enough and they are certainly the only men in the colony who ever pretend to work a government official harshly says of them i would willingly ascribe to the nearest of our neighbours and their representatives in freetown of whom there are many some virtues if they possessed any but unfortunately taken as a people they have been truly described by able and observant writers as dishonest and depraved mr secretary evidently forgets the civilising and infectious example of sá leone versus the culture of elislam  arrived at bishopscourt we disembarked and visited the place here in old days satisfaction was given and taken and a satirical medico declared that forty years of rencontres had not produced a single casualty he was more witty than wise i heard of one gentleman who had been paraded and winged old granville town which named the bay has completely disappeared the ruins of the last house are gone from the broad grassy shelf upon which the first colonists built their homes  from granville bay the traveller may return by the kissy road once it was the pet promenade the corso the showwalk of freetown now it has become a tottenham court road to which water oxford and westmoreland streets are preferred the vegetation becomes splendid running up to the feet of the hills which swell suddenly from the shelfplain the approach to sá leone is heralded by a row of shops even smaller and meaner than those near the marketplace there are whole streets of these rabbithutches whose contents mammy when day is done carries home in a blybasket upon her head possibly

home of fevers shows no outward and visible sign of exceeding unhealthiness the soil is sandy the bush is comparatively thin and the tall trees give it the aspect of a high and dry land we then turned northeast and skirted tasso island a strip of riverholm girt with a wall of mangroves it had an old english fort founded in 1695 the factors traded with the pulo fulah country for slaves ivory and gold it was abandoned after being taken by van ruyter when he restored to the dutch west indian company the conquests of commodore holmes the rich soil in 1800 supported a fine cotton plantation and here mr heddle kept a factory the villagers turned out to gaze not habited like the wolofs of albreda but clad in shady hats and seedy pantaloons  after clearing tasso we advanced merrily and at the end of two hours and a half actual sailing and pulling we landed upon bance which some call bences island a ruined jetty with two rusty guns buried like posts projected from the sandstrip and a battery where nine cannon still linger defended the approach there is a similar beach to the northeast with admirable bathing in the tepid brackish waves and a fine view of the long leonine sierra the outlying rocks capped with guano look like moored boats and awnings the seabreeze was delicious the lapping dazzling stream made sweet music and the huge cottontrees with laminar buttresses gave most grateful shade  the island resembles gambian james multiplied by four or five behind the battery are the ruins of a huge building like the palaces of old goa vast rooms magazines barracoons underground vaults and all manner of contrivances for the good comfort and entertainment of the slaver and the slave a fine promenade of laterite which everywhere about sá leone builds the best of roads and a strip of jungle rich in the guilandina bonduc whose medicinal properties are well known to the people leads to the longdeserted graveyard we pass an old well with water thirtyfive feet deep and enter the enceinte that contains four tombs the marble tablets which would soon disappear in india for the benefit of currystuffs here remain intact one long home was tenanted by thomas

on a steep rock of difficult access ascended only by a sort of stairs cut in the stone and acting as the storehouse of the royal african company the low walls of lime and ashlar had a round flanker with five guns a curtain with embrasures for four large cannon and a platform just before it for six guns all well mounted the only good buildings were the slavebooths winterbottom who places it over eighteen miles above st georges bay baie de france and north of tasso island thus describes bance this is a small barren island considerably elevated with a dry gravelly soil but being placed as it were in the midst of an archipelago of low marshy islands the breeze from whatever quarter it blows is impregnated with moisture and marsh effluvia which render it sickly the air also is very much heated and the thermometer generally stands 4° or 5° higher on this island than it does at freetown  we regained the steamer shortly after dark delighted with our picnic and resolved always to take the same advantage of all halts in those days the interior was most interesting the rivers scarcies nunez and ponga were unknown the equestrian susu tribe had never been visited and the timbo country
