mr tod   i have made many books about wellbehaved people now for a change i am going to make a story about two disagreeable people called tommy brock and mr tod  nobody could call mr tod nice the rabbits could not bear him they could smell him half a mile off he was of a wandering habit and he had foxey whiskers they never knew where he would be next  illustration  one day he was living in a stickhouse in the coppice causing terror to the family of old mr benjamin bouncer next day he moved into a pollard willow near the lake frightening the wild ducks and the water rats  in winter and early spring he might generally be found in an earth amongst the rocks at the top of bull banks under oatmeal crag  he had half a dozen houses but he was seldom at home  the houses were not always empty when mr tod moved out because sometimes tommy brock moved in without asking leave  tommy brock was a short bristly fat waddling person with a grin he grinned all over his face he was not nice in his habits he ate wasp nests and frogs and worms and he waddled about by moonlight digging things up  illustration  illustration  his clothes were very dirty and as he slept in the daytime he always went to bed in his boots and the bed which he went to bed in was generally mr tods  now tommy brock did occasionally eat rabbitpie but it was only very little young ones occasionally when other food was really scarce he was friendly with old mr bouncer they agreed in disliking the wicked otters and mr tod they often talked over that painful subject  old mr bouncer was stricken in years he sat in the spring sunshine outside the burrow in a muffler smoking a pipe of rabbit tobacco  he lived with his son benjamin bunny and his daughterinlaw flopsy who had a young family old mr bouncer was in charge of the family that afternoon because benjamin and flopsy had gone out  illustration  illustration  the little rabbitbabies were just old enough to open their blue eyes and kick they lay in a fluffy bed of rabbit wool and hay in a shallow burrow separate from the main rabbit hole to tell the truthold mr bouncer had forgotten them  he sat in the sun and conversed cordially with tommy brock who was passing through the wood with a sack and a little spud which he used for digging and some mole traps he complained bitterly about the scarcity of pheasants eggs and accused mr tod of poaching them and the otters had cleared off all the frogs while he was asleep in winteri have not had a good square meal for a fortnight i am living on pignuts i shall have to turn vegetarian and eat my own tail said tommy brock  illustration  it was not much of a joke but it tickled old mr bouncer because tommy brock was so fat and stumpy and grinning  so old mr bouncer laughed and pressed tommy brock to come inside to taste a slice of seedcake and a glass of my daughter flopsys cowslip wine tommy brock squeezed himself into the rabbit hole with alacrity  illustration  then old mr bouncer smoked another pipe and gave tommy brock a cabbage leaf cigar which was so very strong that it made tommy brock grin more than ever and the smoke filled the burrow old mr bouncer coughed and laughed and tommy brock puffed and grinned  and mr bouncer laughed and coughed and shut his eyes because of the cabbage smoke  when flopsy and benjamin came backold mr bouncer woke up tommy brock and all the young rabbitbabies had disappeared  mr bouncer would not confess that he had admitted anybody into the rabbit hole but the smell of badger was undeniable and there were round heavy footmarks in the sand he was in disgrace flopsy wrung her ears and slapped him  illustration  benjamin bunny set off at once after tommy brock  there was not much difficulty in tracking him he had left his footmark and gone slowly up the winding footpath through the wood here he had rooted up the moss and wood sorrel there he had dug quite a deep hole for dog darnel and had set a mole trap a little stream crossed the way benjamin skipped lightly over dryfoot the badgers heavy steps showed plainly in the mud  the path led to a part of the thicket where the trees had been cleared there were leafy oak stumps and a sea of blue hyacinthsbut the smell that made benjamin stop was not the smell of flowers  illustration  illustration  mr tods stick house was before him and for once mr tod was at home there was not only a foxey flavour in proof of itthere was smoke coming out of the broken pail that served as a chimney  benjamin bunny sat up staring his whiskers twitched inside the stick house somebody dropped a plate and said something benjamin stamped his foot and bolted  he never stopped till he came to the other side of the wood apparently tommy brock had turned the same way upon the top of the wall there were again the marks of badger and some ravellings of a sack had caught on a briar  benjamin climbed over the wall into a meadow he found another mole trap newly set he was still upon the track of tommy brock it was getting late in the afternoon other rabbits were coming out to enjoy the evening air one of them in a blue coat by himself was busily hunting for dandelionscousin peter peter rabbit peter rabbit shouted benjamin bunny  the blue coated rabbit sat up with pricked ears  illustration  whatever is the matter cousin benjamin is it a cat or john stoat ferret  no no no hes bagged my familytommy brockin a sackhave you seen him  tommy brock how many cousin benjamin  seven cousin peter and all of them twins did he come this way please tell me quick  illustration  yes yes not ten minutes since  he said they were caterpillars i did think they were kicking rather hard for caterpillars  which way which way has he gone cousin peter  he had a sack with something live in it i watched him set a mole trap let me use my mind cousin benjamin tell me from the beginning benjamin did so  illustration  my uncle bouncer has displayed a lamentable want of discretion for his years said peter reflectively but there are two hopeful circumstances your family is alive and kicking and tommy brock has had refreshment he will probably go to sleep and keep them for breakfast which way cousin benjamin compose yourself i know very well which way because mr tod was at home in the stickhouse he has gone to mr tods other house at the top of bull banks i partly know because he offered to leave any message at sister cottontails he said he would be passing cottontail had married a black rabbit and gone to live on the hill  peter hid his dandelions and accompanied the afflicted parent who was all of a twitter they crossed several fields and began to climb the hill the tracks of tommy brock were plainly to be seen he seemed to have put down the sack every dozen yards to rest  he must be very puffed we are close behind him by the scent what a nasty person said peter  illustration  illustration  the sunshine was still warm and slanting on the hill pastures half way up cottontail was sitting in her doorway with four or five halfgrown little rabbits playing about her one black and the others brown  cottontail had seen tommy brock passing in the distance asked whether her husband was at home she replied that tommy brock had rested twice while she watched him  he had nodded and pointed to the sack and seemed doubled up with laughingcome away peter he will be cooking them come quicker said benjamin bunny  they climbed up and uphe was at home i saw his black ears peeping out of the hole they live too near the rocks to quarrel with their neighbours come on cousin benjamin  when they came near the wood at the top of bull banks they went cautiously the trees grew amongst heaped up rocks and there beneath a cragmr tod had made one of his homes it was at the top of a steep bank the rocks and bushes overhung it the rabbits crept up carefully listening and peeping  illustration  illustration  this house was something between a cave a prison and a tumbledown pigstye there was a strong door which was shut and locked  the setting sun made the window panes glow like red flame but the kitchen fire was not alight it was neatly laid with dry sticks as the rabbits could see when they peeped through the window  benjamin sighed with relief  illustration  but there were preparations upon the kitchen table which made him shudder there was an immense empty piedish of blue willow pattern and a large carving knife and fork and a chopper  at the other end of the table was a partly unfolded tablecloth a plate a tumbler a knife and fork saltcellar mustard and a chairin short preparations for one persons supper  illustration  no person was to be seen and no young rabbits the kitchen was empty and silent the clock had run down peter and benjamin flattened their noses against the window and stared into the dusk  then they scrambled round the rocks to the other side of the house it was damp and smelly and overgrown with thorns and briars  the rabbits shivered in their shoes  oh my poor rabbit babies what a dreadful place i shall never see them again sighed benjamin  they crept up to the bedroom window it was closed and bolted like the kitchen but there were signs that this window had been recently open the cobwebs were disturbed and there were fresh dirty footmarks upon the windowsill  the room inside was so dark that at first they could make out nothing but they could hear a noisea slow deep regular snoring grunt and as their eyes became accustomed to the darkness they perceived that somebody was asleep on mr tods bed curled up under the blankethe has gone to bed in his boots whispered peter  illustration  benjamin who was all of a twitter pulled peter off the windowsill  tommy brocks snores continued grunty and regular from mr tods bed nothing could be seen of the young family  the sun had set an owl began to hoot in the wood there were many unpleasant things lying about that had much better have been buried rabbit bones and skulls and chickens legs and other horrors it was a shocking place and very dark  they went back to the front of the house and tried in every way to move the bolt of the kitchen window they tried to push up a rusty nail between the window sashes but it was of no use especially without a light  illustration  they sat side by side outside the window whispering and listening  in half an hour the moon rose over the wood it shone full and clear and cold upon the house amongst the rocks and in at the kitchen window but alas no little rabbit babies were to be seen  the moonbeams twinkled on the carving knife and the pie dish and made a path of brightness across the dirty floor  the light showed a little door in a wall beside the kitchen fireplacea little iron door belonging to a brick oven of that oldfashioned sort that used to be heated with faggots of wood  and presently at the same moment peter and benjamin noticed that whenever they shook the windowthe little door opposite shook in answer the young family were alive shut up in the oven  illustration  benjamin was so excited that it was a mercy he did not awake tommy brock whose snores continued solemnly in mr tods bed  but there really was not very much comfort in the discovery they could not open the window and although the young family was alivethe little rabbits were quite incapable of letting themselves out they were not old enough to crawl  after much whispering peter and benjamin decided to dig a tunnel they began to burrow a yard or two lower down the bank they hoped that they might be able to work between the large stones under the house the kitchen floor was so dirty that it was impossible to say whether it was made of earth or flags  illustration  they dug and dug for hours they could not tunnel straight on account of stones but by the end of the night they were under the kitchen floor benjamin was on his back scratching upwards peters claws were worn down he was outside the tunnel shuffling sand away he called out that it was morningsunrise and that the jays were making a noise down below in the woods  benjamin bunny came out of the dark tunnel shaking the sand from his ears he cleaned his face with his paws every minute the sun shone warmer on the top of the hill in the valley there was a sea of white mist with golden tops of trees showing through  again from the fields down below in the mist there came the angry cry of a jayfollowed by the sharp yelping bark of a fox  then those two rabbits lost their heads completely they did the most foolish thing that they could have done they rushed into their short new tunnel and hid themselves at the top end of it under mr tods kitchen floor  illustration  illustration  mr tod was coming up bull banks and he was in the very worst of tempers first he had been upset by breaking the plate it was his own fault but it was a china plate the last of the dinner service that had belonged to his grandmother old vixen tod then the midges had been very bad and he had failed to catch a hen pheasant on her nest and it had contained only five eggs two of them addled mr tod had had an unsatisfactory night  illustration  as usual when out of humour he determined to move house first he tried the pollard willow but it was damp and the otters had left a dead fish near it mr tod likes nobodys leavings but his own  he made his way up the hill his temper was not improved by noticing unmistakable marks of badger no one else grubs up the moss so wantonly as tommy brock  illustration  mr tod slapped his stick upon the earth and fumed he guessed where tommy brock had gone to he was further annoyed by the jay bird which followed him persistently it flew from tree to tree and scolded warning every rabbit within hearing that either a cat or a fox was coming up the plantation once when it flew screaming over his headmr tod snapped at it and barked  he approached his house very carefully with a large rusty key he sniffed and his whiskers bristled the house was locked up but mr tod had his doubts whether it was empty he turned the rusty key in the lock the rabbits below could hear it mr tod opened the door cautiously and went in  illustration  the sight that met mr tods eyes in mr tods kitchen made mr tod furious there was mr tods chair and mr tods pie dish and his knife and fork and mustard and salt cellar and his tablecloth that he had left folded up in the dresserall set out for supper or breakfastwithout doubt for that odious tommy brock  there was a smell of fresh earth and dirty badger which fortunately overpowered all smell of rabbit  but what absorbed mr tods attention was a noisea deep slow regular snoring grunting noise coming from his own bed  he peeped through the hinges of the halfopen bedroom door then he turned and came out of the house in a hurry his whiskers bristled and his coatcollar stood on end with rage  illustration  for the next twenty minutes mr tod kept creeping cautiously into the house and retreating hurriedly out again by degrees he ventured further inright into the bedroom when he was outside the house he scratched up the earth with fury but when he was insidehe did not like the look of tommy brocks teeth  he was lying on his back with his mouth open grinning from ear to ear he snored peacefully and regularly but one eye was not perfectly shut  mr tod came in and out of the bedroom twice he brought in his walkingstick and once he brought in the coalscuttle but he thought better of it and took them away  illustration  when he came back after removing the coalscuttle tommy brock was lying a little more sideways but he seemed even sounder asleep he was an incurably indolent person he was not in the least afraid of mr tod he was simply too lazy and comfortable to move  mr tod came back yet again into the bedroom with a clothes line he stood a minute watching tommy brock and listening attentively to the snores they were very loud indeed but seemed quite natural  mr tod turned his back towards the bed and undid the window it creaked he turned round with a jump tommy brock who had opened one eyeshut it hastily the snores continued  illustration  mr tods proceedings were peculiar and rather uneasy because the bed was between the window and the door of the bedroom he opened the window a little way and pushed out the greater part of the clothes line on to the window sill the rest of the line with a hook at the end remained in his hand  tommy brock snored conscientiously mr tod stood and looked at him for a minute then he left the room again  tommy brock opened both eyes and looked at the rope and grinned there was a noise outside the window tommy brock shut his eyes in a hurry  mr tod had gone out at the front door and round to the back of the house on the way he stumbled over the rabbit burrow if he had had any idea who was inside it he would have pulled them out quickly  illustration  his foot went through the tunnel nearly upon the top of peter rabbit and benjamin but fortunately he thought that it was some more of tommy brocks work  he took up the coil of line from the sill listened for a moment and then tied the rope to a tree  tommy brock watched him with one eye through the window he was puzzled  illustration  illustration  mr tod fetched a large heavy pailful of water from the spring and staggered with it through the kitchen into his bedroom  tommy brock snored industriously with rather a snort  mr tod put down the pail beside the bed took up the end of rope with the hookhesitated and looked at tommy brock the snores were almost apoplectic but the grin was not quite so big  mr tod gingerly mounted a chair by the head of the bedstead his legs were dangerously near to tommy brocks teeth  he reached up and put the end of rope with the hook over the head of the tester bed where the curtains ought to hang  mr tods curtains were folded up and put away owing to the house being unoccupied so was the counterpane tommy brock was covered with a blanket only mr tod standing on the unsteady chair looked down upon him attentively he really was a first prize sound sleeper  it seemed as though nothing would waken himnot even the flapping rope across the bed  mr tod descended safely from the chair and endeavoured to get up again with the pail of water he intended to hang it from the hook dangling over the head of tommy brock in order to make a sort of showerbath worked by a string through the window  illustration  but naturally being a thinlegged person though vindictive and sandy whiskeredhe was quite unable to lift the heavy weight to the level of the hook and rope he very nearly overbalanced himself  the snores became more and more apoplectic one of tommy brocks hind legs twitched under the blanket but still he slept on peacefully  mr tod and the pail descended from the chair without accident after considerable thought he emptied the water into a washbasin and jug the empty pail was not too heavy for him he slung it up wobbling over the head of tommy brock  surely there never was such a sleeper mr tod got up and down down and up on the chair  as he could not lift the whole pailful of water at once he fetched a milk jug and ladled quarts of water into the pail by degrees the pail got fuller and fuller and swung like a pendulum occasionally a drop splashed over but still tommy brock snored regularly and never movedexcept one eye  illustration  illustration  at last mr tods preparations were complete the pail was full of water the rope was tightly strained over the top of the bed and across the window sill to the tree outside  it will make a great mess in my bedroom but i could never sleep in that bed again without a spring cleaning of some sort said mr tod  illustration  mr tod took a last look at the badger and softly left the room he went out of the house shutting the front door the rabbits heard his footsteps over the tunnel  he ran round behind the house intending to undo the rope in order to let fall the pailful of water upon tommy brock  i will wake him up with an unpleasant surprise said mr tod  the moment he had gone tommy brock got up in a hurry he rolled mr tods dressinggown into a bundle put it into the bed beneath the pail of water instead of himself and left the room alsogrinning immensely  he went into the kitchen lighted the fire and boiled the kettle for the moment he did not trouble himself to cook the baby rabbits  illustration  illustration  when mr tod got to the tree he found that the weight and strain had dragged the knot so tight that it was past untying he was obliged to gnaw it with his teeth he chewed and gnawed for more than twenty minutes at last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it nearly pulled his teeth out and quite knocked him over backwards  illustration  inside the house there was a great crash and splash and the noise of a pail rolling over and over  but no screams mr tod was mystified he sat quite still and listened attentively then he peeped in at the window the water was dripping from the bed the pail had rolled into a corner  in the middle of the bed under the blanket was a wet flattened somethingmuch dinged in in the middle where the pail had caught it as it were across the tummy its head was covered by the wet blanket and it was not snoring any longer  there was nothing stirring and no sound except the drip drop drop drip of water trickling from the mattress  illustration  mr tod watched it for half an hour his eyes glistened  then he cut a caper and became so bold that he even tapped at the window but the bundle never moved  yesthere was no doubt about itit had turned out even better than he had planned the pail had hit poor old tommy brock and killed him dead  i will bury that nasty person in the hole which he has dug i will bring my bedding out and dry it in the sun said mr tod  i will wash the tablecloth and spread it on the grass in the sun to bleach and the blanket must be hung up in the wind and the bed must be thoroughly disinfected and aired with a warmingpan and warmed with a hotwater bottle  illustration  i will get soft soap and monkey soap and all sorts of soap and soda and scrubbing brushes and persian powder and carbolic to remove the smell i must have a disinfecting perhaps i may have to burn sulphur  he hurried round the house to get a shovel from the kitchenfirst i will arrange the holethen i will drag out that person in the blanket  he opened the door  tommy brock was sitting at mr tods kitchen table pouring out tea from mr tods teapot into mr tods teacup he was quite dry himself and grinning and he threw the cup of scalding tea all over mr tod  illustration  illustration  then mr tod rushed upon tommy brock and tommy brock grappled with mr tod amongst the broken crockery and there was a terrific battle all over the kitchen to the rabbits underneath it sounded as if the floor would give way at each crash of falling furniture  they crept out of their tunnel and hung about amongst the rocks and bushes listening anxiously  illustration  inside the house the racket was fearful the rabbit babies in the oven woke up trembling perhaps it was fortunate they were shut up inside  everything was upset except the kitchen table  and everything was broken except the mantelpiece and the kitchen fender the crockery was smashed to atoms  the chairs were broken and the window and the clock fell with a crash and there were handfuls of mr tods sandy whiskers  the vases fell off the mantelpiece the canisters fell off the shelf the kettle fell off the hob tommy brock put his foot in a jar of raspberry jam  and the boiling water out of the kettle fell upon the tail of mr tod  illustration  illustration  when the kettle fell tommy brock who was still grinning happened to be uppermost and he rolled mr tod over and over like a log out at the door  then the snarling and worrying went on outside and they rolled over the bank and down hill bumping over the rocks there will never be any love lost between tommy brock and mr tod  illustration  as soon as the coast was clear peter rabbit and benjamin bunny came out of the bushes  now for it run in cousin benjamin run in and get them while i watch at the door  but benjamin was frightened  oh oh they are coming back  no they are not  yes they are  what dreadful bad language i think they have fallen down the stone quarry  still benjamin hesitated and peter kept pushing him  be quick its all right shut the oven door cousin benjamin so that he wont miss them  decidedly there were lively doings in mr tods kitchen  illustration  at home in the rabbit hole things had not been quite comfortable  after quarrelling at supper flopsy and old mr bouncer had passed a sleepless night and quarrelled again at breakfast old mr bouncer could no longer deny that he had invited company into the rabbit hole but he refused to reply to the questions and reproaches of flopsy the day passed heavily  old mr bouncer very sulky was huddled up in a corner barricaded with a chair flopsy had taken away his pipe and hidden the tobacco she had been having a complete turn out and springcleaning to relieve her feelings she had just finished old mr bouncer behind his chair was wondering anxiously what she would do next  illustration  in mr tods kitchen amongst the wreckage benjamin bunny picked his way to the oven nervously through a thick cloud of dust he opened the oven door felt inside and found something warm and wriggling he lifted it out carefully and rejoined peter rabbit  ive got them can we get away shall we hide cousin peter  peter pricked his ears distant sounds of fighting still echoed in the wood  five minutes afterwards two breathless rabbits came scuttering away down bull banks half carrying half dragging a sack between them bumpetty bump over the grass they reached home safely and burst into the rabbit hole  illustration  illustration  great was old mr bouncers relief and flopsys joy when peter and benjamin arrived in triumph with the young family the rabbitbabies were rather tumbled and very hungry they were fed and put to bed they soon recovered  a long new pipe and a fresh supply of rabbit tobacco was presented to mr bouncer he was rather upon his dignity but he accepted  illustration  old mr bouncer was forgiven and they all had dinner then peter and benjamin told their storybut they had not waited long enough to be able to tell the end of the battle between tommy brock and mr tod  the end
