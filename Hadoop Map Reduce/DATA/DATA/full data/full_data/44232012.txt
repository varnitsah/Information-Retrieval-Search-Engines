rivals is a complete story in itself but forms the seventh volume in a line issued under the general title of dave porter series  when i brought out the first volume of this series entitled dave porter at oak hall i trusted that the story would please the young people for whom it was written but i did not imagine that so many thousands of boys and girls all over our broad land would take to dave as they have and would insist upon knowing more about him  my opening tale was one of boarding school life and this was followed by dave porter in the south seas whither our hero had gone in search of his father and then by dave porters return to school in which book dave met all of his friends again and likewise a few of his enemies  so far our hero had heard about his father but had not yet seen his parent and the next volume dave porter in the far north related the particulars of a trip to norway where the youth had some stirring adventures amid snow and ice in the land of the midnight sun  coming back to america the lad was sent again to oak hall as set down in the next volume called dave porter and his classmates during that term at school many complications arose and our hero did something for the honor of oak hall that was a great credit to him  daves father was now with him but his sister laura was in the far west and upon her return he received an invitation to visit a large ranch and how he went and what strenuous times he had were related in dave porter at star ranch  as soon as his western outing was at an end dave returned home and then betook himself once more to oak hall here to his surprise he found an unusual state of affairs the particulars of which are given in the pages that follow  once again i thank those who have praised my books in the past i hope the present volume will also please them and do them good  edward stratemeyer     contents          i an automobile ride        ii dave and his past       iii what happened at the falls

porter and his rivals     chapter i  an automobile ride   everybody ready  yes dave let her go cried phil lawrence  how about you folks in the other auto queried dave porter as he let off the hand brake and advanced the spark and lever of the machine he was about to run  we are all ready responded roger morr  been ready for an hour added ben basswood who sat beside roger  oh ben not quite as long as that burst out laura porter who was one of three girls in the tonneau of the second car  well make it fiftyeight minutes then im not particular responded ben calmly  are the lunch hampers in asked jessie wadsworth anxiously mamma said we musnt forget anything  trust dave and roger to look after the food burst out phil lawrence  likewise mr phil lawrence added dave just wait till it comes lunch time and youll see phil stow away about fifteen chicken sandwiches ten slices of cake three pickles five olives  stop i draw the line on olives dave cried phil making a wry face  oh olives are fine i love them cried belle endicott  then all that are coming to me are yours returned phil quickly but start her up fellows if we are going he added and then putting a big horn to his lips he blew a loud blast  take good care of yourselves cried a voice from the veranda of the mansion in front of which the two automobiles were standing and mrs wadsworth waved a hand to the young people  well try to answered dave and then he threw in the clutch on low gear and the big touring car moved gently away out of the grounds of the wadsworth mansion and into the main highway leading from crumville to shady glen falls the second car speedily followed  it was a late summer day with a clear blue sky overhead and just enough breeze blowing to freshen the air a shower of rain the day previous had laid the dust of the road and added to the freshness of fields and woods  the boys and girls had planned this outing for several days all of the youths were to return to oak hall school the following week and they wished to do something for the girls to remember them by as dave expressed it  might have a party roger had suggested  no good unless it was a lawn party phil had answered its too stuffy in the house these warm days  we might take a couple of autos and go for a days outing up the river road dave had suggested and this proposition had been accepted immediately it was decided that dave should run the wadsworth machine he having learned to do so some time before and roger was to run a car hired at the new crumville garage each car had a capacity of five passengers including the driver and the party consisted of ten young people five boys and five girls  now dave dont let her out for more than fifty miles an hour remarked sam day who sat in the back of the leading auto between two of the young ladies  fifty miles an hour shrieked jessie wadsworth what an idea dave dont you dare  oh lazy is only fooling jessie answered dave he wouldnt want to ride at that rate of speed himself  twenty miles an hour is fast enough said belle endicott i want to view the scenery it is lovely around crumvilleso different from around the ranch  yes the scenery is fine even though we havent such big mountains as you have out west answered dave  and shady glen falls is an ideal spot for a picnic said jessie papa took us there last summer  youve got to make the most of the falls this summer went on dave i heard in town last week that next year a paper company is going to put a mill there  oh dave is that the eureka paper company questioned jessie  yes what do you know about them  why i heard papa and your uncle talking about it it is a company in which mr aaron poole holds a big interest  aaron poole murmured the youthful driver of the automobile and his face grew serious as he remembered the trouble he had had with that mean individual  yes papa heard nat bragging down at the postoffice about what great things his father was going to do when the paper company got started  thats just like nat poole was phil lawrences comment if nat couldnt brag about something hed die  by the way where does nat keep himself questioned sam day i havent met him since i came to crumville  he has been keeping shadysince our little affair at niagara falls explained dave  is he going to return to oak hall  i presume so he left his motorboat and some other things up there so i heard  we can get along without nat poole dave  right you are lazy put in phil lawrence but maybe with link merwell gone he wont be quite so bad as he was  oh that horrid link merwell cried jessie i trust we never see or hear of him again  well one thing is certain merwell will never get back to oak hall said dave he got his walking papers and that settled it he is out for good the same as nick jasniff  dave have you heard anything about jasniff lately questioned phil  one of the boys wrote that he had heard nick had returned to the united states personally i havent seen or heard from him since we met in europeand i dont want to see him added dave earnestly  toot toot came from behind the leading automobile and a moment later the second car ranged up alongside  guess you folks are doing more talking than running cried roger with a grin here is where we show you the road and in a twinkling the second car shot ahead and was hitting her up as ben expressed it at thirty miles an hour dave immediately turned on more speed likewise and over the smooth straight road both machines spun  oh dave is it safe asked jessie with a little gasp as the speed increased  yesas long as we are on the straight road he answered well have to slow down at the turn  i like to ride fastbut not too fast said lucy basswood bens cousin the other girl in the car  the turn in the road was almost gained and both machines had slowed down once more when there came a shrill screeching whistle from behind and a racing car shot into sight moving along with a great noise for the muffler had been cut out all of the girls screamed in fright and instinctively dave and roger ran their cars as close to the right side of the road as possible then with a roar the racing car shot past sending up a cloud of dust and a shower of small stones one of which hit laura porter in the cheek and another striking phil in the ear  fellows that run that way ought to be arrested was rogers comment  oh i was so afraid we should be struck gasped jessie sinking back into her seat with a white face  did you recognize them asked belle endicott  i didnt have time to look answered roger i was busy getting out of the way  just what i was doing added dave i didnt want them to take off the mudguard or a wheel  i caught sight of one of the fellows said ben basswood he looked right at me as he passed  who was it questioned several eagerly  nat poole  nat poole cried dave surely he wasnt driving that racing car  no he was in the rear with another chapand two were on the front seat but i didnt recognize any of the others  i saw that machine in crumville last week said laura i believe it belongs in lumberdale  i hope those fellows are not bound for shady glen falls said laura it would quite spoil our outing to have such persons around  a picnic like ours would be dead slow for that crowd remarked phil if they stop anywhere it will be most likely at some roadhouse where they can drink and smoke and play pool and cards  the racing car had long since disappeared in the distance and now the other automobiles proceeded on their way the girls were very nervous and the boys did all in their power to remove the strain but the girls declared that they had had a narrow escape from a serious accident and it put much of a damper on the trip  if ever i meet the driver of that car ill give him a piece of my mind said dave its against the law to run at such high speed  the distance to shady glen falls from crumville was thirtyfive miles the last half of the journey was over a winding dirt road and the boys had calculated that it would take them two hours to reach the picnic grounds  well go by way of darnells corners and come back by way of haslow said dave that will give us a sort of round trip and so it was decided  darnells corners was but five miles from the falls it was only a small settlement boasting of a tavern a blacksmith shop a church and two stores as they came in sight of the place phil uttered a cry  there is that racing car now  phil was right the car stood in front of the tavern the engine still running and letting out short puffs of smoke  where are the fellows who were in it questioned sam  must have gone inside for a drink answered ben  here come two of them now said roger in a low voice as the tavern door swung open and two young men appeared each wearing a linen duster and a touring cap  its nat poole cried jessie  i know that driver said dave he is pete barnaby a sport from lumberdale he used to follow the horse races before autoing became popular he once tried to sell caspar potts a horse but we found out the animal was doctored up and worthless and we didnt take him barnaby was furious when the deal fell through  ive heard of him said ben he wanted to sell my father a horse but father wouldnt have anything to do with him  while the boys were talking the tavern door had swung open again and now two other persons stepped forth they too wore linen dusters and touring caps and one carried a basket containing something to eat and to drink  dave cried phil in astonishment look who they are  link merwell and nick jasniff murmured dave how in the world did they get here and what underhanded work are they up to now     chapter ii  dave and his past   dave porter had good reasons for looking upon link merwell and nick jasniff with suspicion in the past these two unworthies had caused dave a good deal of trouble and when exposed each had vowed that sooner or later he would square accounts with the youth who had gotten the better of him dave had hoped he had seen the last of them but here they were eyeing him closely each with a face that plainly showed his envy and his hatred  to those of you who have read the preceding volumes of this series dave porter and his friends and enemies will need no special introduction for the benefit of others let me explain that dave had once upon a time been a homeless child having been found wandering along the railroad tracks near crumville he was placed in the local poorhouse and later on bound out to a brokendown college professor named caspar potts who had taken to farming for his health  professor potts could not make farming pay and was in danger of being sold out by aaron poole the father of nat poole already introduced when a most unexpected happening changed the whole current of events in the town lived mr oliver wadsworth a rich manufacturer he had a young daughter named jessie and one day when this miss was waiting for an automobile ride the gasoline tank of the machine took fire and jessie was in danger of being burned to death when dave rushed in and rescued her  a boy who will do such a brave deed deserves to be assisted said mr wadsworth and he talked to the boy and learned that caspar potts had once been one of his own college professors arrangements were at once made for the professor and dave to move to the wadsworth mansion and then dave was sent to boarding school as related in detail in my first volume entitled dave porter at oak hall with dave went ben basswood his one chum in crumville  at the school dave made a number of friends including roger morr who was the son of a united states senator phil lawrence the offspring of a wealthy shipowner sam day usually called lazy because of a habit he had of taking his time and others whom we shall meet in the near future  in those days daves greatest trouble was the cloud over his parentage and when he got what he thought was a clew to his identity he promptly followed it up by taking a trip far across the ocean as related in dave porter in the south seas after some stirring happenings on shipboard and among the natives he located his uncle dunston porter and learned much concerning his father david breslow porter and his sister laura then traveling in europe  after his trip to the south sea islands the lad returned to oak hall as related in the third volume called dave porters return to school here he was warmly received by his many friends and became more popular than ever much to the disgust of link merwell nick jasniff and also nat poole who had followed him to oak hall from crumville  dave porter puts up a big front but ill take him down a peg or two said nick jasniff and he forced a fight with the crumville lad much to his surprise he was knocked down and badly whipped and then in a sudden brutal rage he snatched up an indian club and might have inflicted serious injury to dave had not the latter seized him while others forced the weapon from his grasp then in alarm jasniff ran away from oak hall and having gotten himself mixed up with some men who were wanted for a robbery he left the country  during this term at the school dave was anxiously awaiting to hear from his father and his sister then came word through jasniff who tried to belittle dave that mr porter and laura were in europe and the youth determined to go in search of them roger accompanied him and what befell the pair was related in detail in dave porter in the far north in england dave ran across nick jasniff and compelled the fellow to tell what he knew of mr porter and then dave followed his parent to the upper part of norway where father and son at last met under conditions far out of the ordinary  laura porter not knowing anything of daves existence had gone from europe to the ranch home of her friends the endicotts she returned to crumville to meet her longlost brother and then dave again returned to oak hall as told of in dave porter and his classmates jasniff was gone but link merwell and nat poole remained and both did what they could to dim daves popularity link merwell was particularly obnoxious and in the end dave took matters in his own hands and gave the bully the thrashing he richly deserved then some of the fellows wrongdoings reached the ears of the master of the school and he was ordered to pack his trunk and leave which he did in a great rage  it is all dave porters doings said link merwell bitterly but waitill square up with him see if i dont  laura porter and belle endicott were great friends and through the latter laura and her brother received an invitation to visit the endicott ranch in the far west and this they did as related in the volume entitled dave porter at star ranch they took with them jessie wadsworth and also roger and phil on the way they met nat poole at niagara falls and poole attempted to play a mean trick on dave but the latter turned the tables on the moneylenders son and the latter went back home a wiser if not a better boy  the endicott ranch was located next to one owned by link merwells father and as was to be expected it was not long before there was a clash between dave and his party on one side and merwell and his followers on the other link merwell as usual did all in his power to injure dave and make the outing for the others a failure but he was caught in his own trap and it was proved that he had to a certain extent aided some horsethieves in their nefarious work mr merwell had to pay mr endicott for the animals that were missing and in order to hush the matter up he agreed to sell his ranch and move to some other part of the country  well i hope that is the last of link merwell so far as we are concerned said roger at the time  we can do very well without such chaps as merwell and nick jasniff dave had added with a grim smile  yes and without such fellows as nat poole too phil had put in although i must say i dont think nat is as bad as link and nick  nat is too much of a dude to be real bad said laura  nat lacks backbone explained dave he usually does what the others tell him to but jasniff and merwell are both wicked fellows and jasniff is brutal  the homecoming from the ranch had been a gala occasion at the wadsworth mansion and the young people had been warmly welcomed by jessies parents and by mr porter and caspar potts ben basswood had come over from his home to greet them and he brought with him sam day who was paying him a visit  i suppose you are all going back to oak hall remarked sam to the boys  of course answered dave you are going back arent you  sure thingand so are all of the others of our old crowd  we must make the best of what vacation is left before we get down to the grind again remarked the senators son and the next day the matter was talked over with the result that the automobile trip to shady glen falls was proposed and decided upon all had started out in the best of spirits never dreaming of the trouble that was in store for them  dave what are you going to do whispered ben as he too recognized the crowd coming toward the racing car  before dave could answer nat poole strode forward with a sickly smile on his face  hello there he cried and nodded curtly to the girls out for a ride i see  nat who was driving your car asked dave sharply  what business is that of yours dave porter questioned the dudish youth quickly  you came pretty close to running us down you were speeding altogether too fast  ho ho we scared you did we returned nat sorry for the girls im sure and his face took on a mean little grin  what are you finding fault about dave porter demanded pete barnaby the owner of the racing car coming closer his nose was very red and his breath smelt strongly of liquor  i am finding fault with the way your car was run if you want to know it answered dave stoutly  we are not asking you for advice  perhaps not but if you try any such trick again pete barnaby you may get yourself into trouble  you were exceeding the speed limit put in roger  and you came close to running us down added ben  oh you boys are a timid bunch grumbled the owner of the racing car i didnt come within ten feet of touching you  of course they are a timid crowd said nick jasniff loudly if they had any sand they wouldnt say anything about it  youre a nice one to talk about sand after what dave did to you at the school gym was phils sarcastic comment  look here phil lawrence i dont want any of your hot air cried nick jasniff in a sudden rage you keep your mouth shut  its a wonder you didnt stay in europe jasniff said dave i didnt think youd dare to come back to the united states  say you neednt began jasniff and then drew back looking much disturbed youeryou neednt rake up old times those things are all settled and ive got as much right to be here as you have  well you wont come back to oak hall said sam  dont want to come back im going to a better school  and so am i said link merwell as if he was anxious to make the fact known to his former schoolmates  i dont care where you go so long as you dont bother us any more rejoined dave  oh you havent seen the end of us yet has he nick said link merwell appealing to his crony  not much he hasnt retorted nick jasniff  we are going to rockville military academy continued link merwell mentioning a school which as my old readers know was located not a great distance from oak hall in the past there had been many contests between the students of the two seats of learning and the rivalry was very bitter  rockville cried the senators son i shouldnt think theyd want you there  say you take that back or illill blustered merwell and then stopped not knowing how to proceed  oh say come on you fellows broke in nat poole who was growing scared thinking there might be a fight you can talk this over some other time just remember what we started out to do hurry up lets do it and he motioned his companions towards the racing car  im ready to go ahead answered pete barnaby climbing into the drivers seat come on pile in if youre going  i dont want dave porter and his crowd to think i am afraid of them growled link merwell  well meet you after you get back to oak hall sang out nick jasniff and well settle old scores  well you look out that you dont get your fingers burnt trying to do it retorted dave and then the racing car started off and was speedily lost to view around a turn of the road     chapter iii  what happened at the falls   what horrid young fellows was jessies comment she was trembling from head to foot and her face was pale  dont mind what they say answered dave kindly he thought a great deal of the girl and it distressed him greatly to see her so worried  i shouldnt think theyd want jasniff and merwell at rockville was the comment of the senators son everybody in that town knows how jasniff was mixed up in that railroad station affair he referred to a robbery committed by some men the particulars of which were recorded in dave porters return to school nick jasniff had been in company with the evildoers but his share in the transaction had been smoothed over and hushed up by his family  well i heard that the military academy was rather hard up for pupils this term answered sam about a dozen of the sophs and juniors left and the enrollment of freshmen was rather slim i suppose on that account the authorities cant be overly particular as to who they take in  and of course merwell and jasniff had their sides of their stories to tell said dave you can be sure they didnt tell matters as doctor clay would have done  or as we might have donehad we been asked broke in sam  well i hope you boys keep away from them when you get to school said laura  what do you suppose they are up to now dave asked the shipowners son  i dont know phil but from the look on nat pooles face i should think and then dave stopped short  what  well never mind now i may be wrong and there is no use of worrying come on let us get to the fallsand try to forget that crowd and so speaking dave started up the touring car he was running and followed in the direction pete barnaby had taken and roger came after him  the meeting at the tavern had disturbed all of the girls and the boys had hard work trying to cheer them up and make them forget the unpleasant encounter everybody felt that there was something in the air but each person hated to mention it to the others  presently dave reached the point where they would have to take to a side road that was deep with dust and hemmed in on both sides by rocks and bushes here in the dust could plainly be seen the marks of another automobile  think they came this way dave questioned sam  yesalthough some other folks may be at the falls on an outing  oh i hope we dont meet them again said belle endicott the two machines were running slowly and close together  they passed on around a long curve and over a small hill and then came in sight of the river glistening in the sunshine between the trees from a distance came the roar of the falls where a fairly large body of water rushed steadily over the rocks  isnt it a shame that they are going to use the falls for a mill said one of the girls  well this is a commercial age and so one must expect those things answered dave but i shall hate to see the falls used for business they are so pretty  there was another turn just ahead and it was lucky for dave that he was running slowly for there across the road were placed several logs and dead limbs of trees as it was he ran directly on top of some of the tree limbs before he could come to a stop and roger so close behind had to turn into some bushes to avoid ramming the car in front  well of all things burst out phil while several of the girls screamed in fright  who did this demanded the senators son  it is easy to see who did it answered dave see the sign and he pointed to a big white card tacked to a post propped up among the logs and tree limbs on the card was painted in red the following      this road closed      by order of aaron poole     pres eureka paper co  this is some of nats work burst out phil that is why he was in such a hurry to get ahead of us  i believe you answered dave i was afraid he was up to some trick but i didnt want to say anything about it until i was sure  but if nat is guilty how did he know we were coming here asked roger  i guess i can explain that said ben i was talking to my cousin about it down at the drug store just as we were coming out after having some soda i saw nat behind one of the partitions he must have heard all we said and i suppose it made him mad to think we were going to have a good time and that he wouldnt be in it  exactly returned dave just as he was mad when he wasnt invited to the party and tried to spoil the icecream  do you suppose they have a right to close the road questioned roger  i dont know i always thought this was a public highway  so it is added ben the paper company bought the ground on one side of the road but not on the other i dont think they can stop us from going through even though they may stop us from going down to the falls  but if we cant go to the falls what is the use of keeping on this road asked laura  we can go above the falls laura answered her brother there is a beautiful spot there called lookout point where you can look out all over the valley  the matter was talked over for a few minutes and the boys decided to go ahead to show that they considered that they had a right to use the road even if they did not go down to the falls the roadway was cleared sufficiently to let the cars pass and the power was turned on once again  be careful dave that you dont run into more trouble sang out roger  ill be on the lookout was the answer and you be prepared to stop quick too so as not to run into me  ill drop back to a place of safety returned the senators son there is no use of keeping so close together anyway  the road wound in and out among the trees and in some spots was so narrow that the boys had to run with great care for fear of bumping into the stump of a tree or on the rocks or switching into some lowhanging branch dave had his foot on the brake ready to stop quickly should it become necessary to do so  hi there stop dont you dare to come any further  the call was an unexpected one coming just as the leading automobile hove in sight of the falls dave saw nat poole hurrying towards him followed by merwell and jasniff pete barnaby was nowhere in sight and the marks on the narrow road told that his racing car had gone on ahead  what do you want nat asked dave as coolly as he could having brought his machine to a standstill  cant you read dave porter fumed the son of the crumville moneylender  certainly i can read  well then what are you doing on this road you know it is closed you havent any right on it at allyou or anybody else you turn around and go back just as quick as you can  this is a public road nat poole cried ben you hadnt any right to put up that sign  humph a lot you know about it ben basswood this is my fathers land and i reckon he knows his rights you are not going down to the falls today to have your picnic and nats small eyes gleamed maliciously  we dont intend to go down to the fallsnow that we know how matters stand said dave but we are going through on this road  not much you aintnot another step roared nat  thats right nat make em keep off your property put in link merwell  show em that you wont allow a poorhouse nobody to dictate to you added nick jasniff but in such a low voice that dave did not catch all he said  i said we were going through on this roadand we are answered dave calmly and he started to turn on the power again as he did this nat poole leaped to the road directly in front of the touring car and jasniff and merwell followed suit  stop dont you dare to touch me or ill have the law on you screamed the moneylenders son  well fix em for you nat cried nick jasniff come on link get to work and leaping to one side of the roadway he dragged forth the dead limb of a tree and dropped it in front of the first car quick to understand merwell followed with another dead limb and then with some stones  thats the stuff cried nat poole his face brightening pile it up fellows and he too ran for some sticks and stones with which to make the barrier in the narrow roadway more complete  had dave elected so to do he might have gone ahead when first this work was done by the enemy but there was danger of injury both to the big touring car and to those in the roadway and he did not wish to take the risk besides there was no telling if roger could get through and he would not leave the crowd in the second automobile in the lurch  now i reckon youll have to turn back cried nat poole in triumph after so much had been piled in the roadway that passing was totally out of the question  nat poole i believe you are the meanest boy in the whole world cried jessie and there was a suspicion of tears in her eyes as she spoke  humph you people neednt think that you are going to have the best of me all the time growled nat  we are not doing this against any of the young ladies said link merwell with a smirk at laura that made daves sister turn away in disdain we are only doing it to square accounts with dave porter and his cronies we owe them a good dealand this is the first installment  with a good deal more to follow added nick jasniff with a wicked chuckle  to the best of my knowledge and belief this is a public highway said dave as calmly as he could you have no right to block the road and i want you to clear that stuff away just as fast as you put it there  hear him talk cried link merwell youd think he was governor of the state wouldnt you  dont you mind what he says nat said jasniff if they start to take the stuff away well put it back and then looking around he picked up a heavy stick which might be used for a club he was spoiling for a fight and only the presence of the girls and the fact that he and his cohorts were but three against five kept him from attacking dave  oh dave what shall we do whispered jessie she was becoming more frightened every minute  i dont see how we are going to turn around said one of the other girls the trees are too close to the sides of the road  we are not going to turn around answered dave and his face took on a stern look he turned to his chums how about it  ill fight them before i turn back answered roger  so will i added phil i dont believe they have any more right to this road than we have  oh you mustnt fight cried laura  do you want to let that crowd crow over us laura asked dave flatly  no no dave butbut and then laura stopped short not knowing what to say she did not wish to see an encounter nor did she wish her brother and his chums to give in to those who were so unjustly opposing them     chapter iv  an unexpected arrival   this is the time we get the best of dave porter whispered link merwell to his cronies i guess we have spoiled their picnic  iidont think ththeyll fight faltered nat as dave leaped to the ground followed by his chums  better arm yourselves with clubs suggested nick jasniff remember we are only three to five  maybe we had betterergo away returned the moneylenders son hesitatingly  no i am going to see the thing out answered jasniff  so am i added merwell dont go natthey wont dare to fightwith the girls looking on  whoa there whoa came a cry from behind the two touring cars and looking back the boys and girls saw a man drive up on a buckboard drawn by a spirited horse  why if it isnt jed sully cried ben  who is he questioned sam  sort of a roadmaster in these parts i suppose he is going around inspecting the roads and bridges  then he ought to be able to tell us about this road put in phil quickly  hello whats the meaning of this demanded jed sully after alighting and he strode forward and confronted the boys  how are you mr sully said dave for he had met the roadmaster before  oh so its you dave blocked up eh and the roadmaster looked first at dave and his chums and then at those standing on the other side of the barrier who did this  they did answered roger and pointed to the other crowd  what for and the roadmasters voice grew a bit hard  nat poole there claims that his father has a right to close this road explained dave he put up a barrier some distance back but we passed it now he and his friends have put up this  and we want to know if they have a right to do it added ben i had an idea the new paper company bought only one side of the road  so it did answered jed sully and even if it bought both sides it couldnt close off this road which is a public highway he turned to nat are you aaron pooles son  yeas faltered the youth addressed and he commenced to look worried  did your father give you orders to close off this road  whyerhethat is stammered nat what business is it of yours anyway he cried  it is a good deal of my business responded jed sully warmly i am the roadmaster for this district and i wont allow you or anybody else to close off this road or any other without special permission you had no right to put those logs across the road away back and put up that sign and i want you to take em away as soon as you can  well my father bought this land and  no he didnt buy it the paper company bought it corrected jed sully but that gave em no right to close the road you take that stuff out of the way and at once or ill have you locked up and walking around the barrier he caught nat by the arm  let godont you touch me screamed the moneylenders son trying to jerk away  you let my friend alone broke in nick jasniff and made a motion as if to use his club  here none of thator ill have you all in the lockup in jig time said the roadmaster so sternly that jasniff allowed the club to drop to his side he turned again to dave and his friends did you see these chaps put this stuff here  yes replied the others  then get to work and clear it away instantly or ill lock you all up and these fellows can testify against you continued the roadmaster to nat and his cronies  good thats the way to talk to em cried roger in a low voice  i guess nat didnt expect to meet the roadmaster returned sam  the moneylenders son and his cronies tried to argue the matter but jed sully would not listen to them he knew aaron poole and had no love for the man who had on more than one occasion foreclosed a mortgage and driven people out of house and home  ill give you ten minutes to clear the road he said taking out a big silver watch if it aint cleared by that time ill take you over to lumberdale and lock you up  i wont touch a stick cried jasniff defiantly  nor i added merwell  oh buteri dont want to be locked up whined nat  you said your dad had a right to the road said jasniff in disgust  i thought he did have buteri guess i was mistaken oh come on and help me pleaded nat and set to work without further delay to clear the road  jasniff and merwell were very angry but they did not care to let their crony do all the work and they were a bit afraid of jed sully so presently they took hold and aided the moneylenders son in clearing the highway  as soon as youve finished here youll come back with me and clear the other spot said the roadmaster and you can tear up that sign for it is no good  im going to put it up near the falls answered nat nobody can come down there any more  then youd better put up a fence to keep em out was the roadmasters comment  you dont want us to come back with you do you asked dave in a whisper we are off for a picnic and it is getting late  no you can go on if you want to answered jed sully i can manage them i reckon if they give me any trouble ill put em in the lockup and get you to testify to what they did on the road  oh dave let us go on cried jessie i dont want to stay here another minute  the others were all anxious to depart and as soon as the road was entirely clear the two touring cars were started up  hope you have a nice time clearing away that other stuff remarked phil to nat poole and his cronies as the machine passed on  dont you crowwe are not done with you yet shouted merwell and jasniff shook his fist at the departing cars nat poole felt so humiliated he turned his gaze in another direction  it was a lucky thing that that roadmaster came along when he did remarked sam when the scene of the encounter had been left behind if he hadnt showed up i dont know what we should have done  maybe we would have had a fight returned ben  oh i am glad it didnt come to that cried jessie and her face showed her relief  wonder what became of the racing car and pete barnaby questioned the shipowners son  perhaps barnaby went ahead to make more trouble for us said dave we had better be on our guard he called to roger  ill follow you at a safe distance as i did before answered the senators son  the falls were passed and then they commenced to ascend a long hill leading to lookout point just before the spot was reached they took to another side road and were glad to see that no other automobile had passed that way  well have the lookout all to ourselves said dave and that is just what we want  maybe im not getting hungry cried phil i really believe i could choke down a chicken sandwich if i was forced to do it  forced is good answered dave girls be sure to keep the hamper away from phil or he wont leave enough behind to feed a canary and this remark brought forth the first laugh since the trouble on the road  they drove as close to lookout point as the road allowed and then placed the two cars in a safe place under the trees  we must keep our eyes open whispered dave to the other boys that other crowd may sneak up and try to damage the machines so as to make us walk from here  well watch out answered roger and the others said the same  while the boys started a campfire over which to boil some coffee and obtained a bucket of fresh drinking water from a nearby spring the girls spread a tablecloth over some flat rocks and set around the dishes and the things to eat there was more than enough of everything to go around and it was particularly appetizing after that long ride in the fresh air  i tell you this is something like cried dave munching on a sandwich and a stalk of celery i shouldnt mind having a picnic like this once a week regularly  make it twice a week returned roger who was eating a sandwich from one hand and a hardboiled egg from the other  wholl have some coffee cried phil coming up with a pot of the steaming beverage ive got to strain it through the corner of a napkin but i guess that wont hurt it  napkin indeed cried jessie there is a strainer in the spout  oh is there i didnt look in to see well here goes coffee ten cents a cup or two cups for a nickel good for the complexion and warranted to cure the blues cried the shipowners son gayly and swung the pot around over his head  hi look out there roared sam clapping his hand to his ear i like coffee but i dont drink it that way and he wiped off a few drops that had reached him  phil is fined one horseshoe nail for spilling the coffee cried dave  dont nail me so soon answered the shipowners son gayly  shoo just to hear that murmured roger  im too hoarse to answer to that said ben  say do you know why a lawyer likes to drink coffee asked sam  why asked the girls in a chorus  because there is always a fee in it for him was the answer and then the joker had to dodge an olive and a pickle that dave and phil hurled at him while all the girls giggled  an hour was spent over the lunch the boys doing their best to entertain the girls and succeeding admirably of course a good many of the things that were said were silly but everybody was in good humor and out for a good time so what did it matter in their high spirits they forgot all about the unfortunate occurrence of the morning  after the lunch the boys helped the girls clean up and put away what was left and then all strolled about first to the edge of the lookout to view the scenery and then to the woods and the brook beyond dave naturally paired off with jessie while roger went with laura and phil with belle  well it wont be long now before ill be off again for oak hall said dave as he and jessie stood where the brook tumbled over a series of rocks making a murmur pleasant to hear  yes dave and ii shall be sorry to have you go said jessie looking him full in the eyes  youll write to me often wont you jessie he asked in a lower voice  ill answer every letter you send dave and now she cast down her eyes for a moment i always do  i know itand you cant imagine how much i treasure those letters he went on  well ii think a lot of your letters too she whispered  then you want me to write very often  yes  all right i will and jessie continued dave but just then a shout from sam interrupted him     chapter v  the boys and a bull   wonder what sam wants said dave as the shouting continued i guess ill have to go and see  he ran over the rocks in the direction of the cries and soon came in sight of his chum  hurry up cried sam i want you  what is it sam questioned dave  we are going to have trouble  what have jasniff and those others come here  no but maybe its just as bad dave just look toward the autos  dave did as requested and his face became a study he was half inclined to laugh yet having been brought up in the country he well knew the seriousness of the situation  the two automobiles stood side by side about three yards apart between them was a big and angrylooking bull tramping the ground and snorting viciously the bull had a chain around his neck and to the end of this was a smallsized tree stump which the animal had evidently pulled from the ground in his endeavor to get away from his pasture the tree stump had become entangled in the wheel of one of the automobiles and the bull was giving vicious jerks first one way and then another causing the machine to slew around in an alarming fashion  sam well have to get him out of there cried dave if we dont he may break that wheelor do worse  im afraid hell run off with the car gasped sam he was almost out of breath from running and calling  by this time the others were coming up at the sight of the savage bull several of the girls commenced to scream  oh well be killed  cant somebody drive him away  look look he is dragging one machine into the other  you girls had better keep back warned dave if he breaks loose he may come for you  oh dave do be careful cried jessie  yes yes dont go too close added his sister  what do you suppose we can do questioned the senators son as the boys gathered in a group at a little distance and the girls got behind them  if i had a hooked pole id soon fix him answered dave  how asked phil who knew little or nothing about bulls  see that ring in his nose id hook him in that and then keep him at the end of the pole that always brings em to terms  but we havent got any hook said ben we might make one though he added  a small hatchet had been brought alongwith which to chop firewoodand securing this the boys quickly cut two slender but strong saplings and trimmed them of their branches  there is a hook in our car said jessie if you could only get that  dont you try it said ben ive known a bull to leap into a wagon and this one might leap right into the auto and wreck everythingand hurt you in the bargain  ill use a tree root for a hook said dave and quickly found what he wanted and bound it fast to one of the poles by means of a fishing line he happened to be carrying  now ben you stand by to prod him if he gets too rambunctious went on dave as he handed the second pole to his chum  all right answered ben he too had been brought up on a farm and knew a little about bulls  the animal had quieted down for a moment and was grazing on some grass between the automobiles but as the lads approached he raised his head pawed with his hoof and gave a vicious snort  he means to fight dave cried ben weve got to be on our guard  oh do be careful cried belle to her this beast of the farm looked more terrifying than those she had seen on the ranch  with great caution dave approached the bull from one side while ben approached from the other the animal snorted again and lowered his horns all the girls began to scream  better be quiet called out dave youll only excite him more  oh be careful answered jessie in a horrified whisper  at that moment the bull backed up against one of the automobiles and then moved forward again this action released the tree stump so that the beast was now free to go where he pleased he started straight for ben  prod him yelled dave and ben promptly did as requested catching the bull in the mouth with his stick then as the animal turned aside dave jumped closer put out his stick and caught the improvised hook in the nose ring  good youve got him shouted phil can we help you any  i dont think sokeep quiet was the reply  the bull snorted wildly for a moment and dave had all he could do to keep the animal at the poles length but he knew how to twist the ring and this speedily brought the beast to terms the snorting ceased and the bull stood still glaring viciously at his captor but not daring to attempt an attack  come gee haw cried dave presently and with caution commenced to pull on the pole slowly the bull stepped after him dragging the chain and stump behind him  what are you going to do with him called out roger  tangle him up in the bushesif i can was the answer and dave turned in the direction of the brushwood lining the watercourse  at this point there were a good many sharp rocks and twisted roots of bushes and trees and it was not long before the loose stump caught on them  come on well fasten him good and hard cried phil dashing up behind the bull and as quickly as it could be done he and the others piled some loose rocks against the tree stump so that it would be next to impossible for the bull to work it free  now you can let him go dave said ben who had stood guard with his pole weve got him as fast as he ever was and then dave let loose from the ring much to the animals relief for he chanced to have a tender nose and the twisting of the ring hurt him a good deal  are you sure he wont get away and come for us questioned laura as all drew to a safe distance  he wont get away very soon answered ben but we ought to notify his owner of what we have done  whose bull is it asked one of the girls  i give upi never saw him before  i think the bull belongs to the hook stock farm said dave mentioning a farm located about a mile away i dont know of anybody else around here who would own a bull when we go home we can stop at the farm and tell them of what has happened  leaving the animal quietly grazing among the bushes the boys and girls walked over to the automobiles to learn if any damage had been done in his movements the bull had scratched some paint from the wheels and the mudguards but that was all for which they were thankful  well its about time to start for home said dave consulting his watch remember we are to go the long way aroundand stop at the hook place in the bargain  im ready to go answered jessie the presence of the bull still disturbed her  yet it was some little time before they started for the things had to be packed and several of the boys and girls wanted to get photographs of the picnic party then dave cranked up and roger did the same all piled in and the start for home was begun  ill wager that nat poole link merwell and nick jasniff are the maddest boys in this state was phils comment as the first car rolled on with he and dave on the front seat  i believe you phil answered the driver of the machine and if jasniff and merwell really do go to rockville academy you can make up your mind that they will cause us all the trouble possible  i dont believe the better class of fellows at the military academy will take to those chaps  neither do i but there are some mean boys at that schoolyou remember themand merwell and jasniff will flock with that bunch oh theyll try their best to down us you see if they dont declared dave  on the road beyond the picnic ground they came to a spot where some rocks and logs had been piled up and then taken away again all gazed at the spot with interest  i guess pete barnaby did thisunder directions from nat poole said ben  yes and jed sully made him or the poole crowd clear it away again answered dave theyll not close this road as long as sully is roadmaster  be on your guard dave sang out roger those rascals will play some trick on us if they can  im on the watch answered dave  as they bowled along all kept their eyes on the alert and it was well that they did so for at a turn they suddenly came upon some broken bottles thrown down just where the machines had to pass dave gave a yell of warning and turned off the power and applied the brakes just in time and as before roger had to turn into the bushes to avoid striking the turnout ahead  they thought theyd make us cut our tires said dave  right you are answered phil phew if we had gone over that glass we might have had some nasty punctures or blowouts  they ought to be arrested for this said sam wrathfully its against the law to put glass on a public highway  we cant prove they did it answered ben if we accused them of course they would deny it but it shows their meanness  the boys got out and picked up some of the glass and swept the rest aside as well as they could then the machines were started up once more and soon they came in sight of the hook stock farm and dave beckoned to a man who stood near the gateway  have you lost one of your bulls he asked  we sure have answered the man quickly what do you know about him  we know he tried to run off with our autos returned dave with a grin and then told the man the story and described where the animal could be found while he was speaking two other stock farm hands came up they had been looking for the bull since early morning  hes a valuable beast said one of the men i hope he aint hurt none  he isnt hurtand we are mighty glad he didnt hurt us said phil  oh he wont hurt nobodyif hes left alone said the man  how can he hurt anybody if he is left alone was rogers dry query but the man was too dull to see the joke  from the stock farm hands the boys found out which were the best roads to take and then passed on again up hill and down dale for a distance of six miles when they came out on a broad and wellkept highway  good this is what i like cried dave and turned on the power until the touring car was moving along at a lively rate roger hit her up as he called it also and before long they had covered an additional ten miles then they had to go over a hill beyond which lay the village of lester  let us stop at lester for some icecream soda whispered phil to dave and the latter agreed  at the foot of the hill there was a turn and dave slowed up to make this and roger did likewise then as they passed a deep and muddy ditch dave gave a cry and came to a stop  look there he called out pointing down into the ditch  all gazed to where he pointed there in the water and mud rested the racing car belonging to pete barnaby and standing in the mud up to his knees was the sporty man himself looking the picture of woeful despair     chapter vi  a talk with aaron poole   as the boys halted their touring cars and gazed at the racing car and its owner they could not help but smile and phil laughed outright  how did it happen asked dave in as kindly a tone as he could assume for he saw that pete barnaby was in serious trouble the turnout had landed in a particularly soft spot and was settling deeper and deeper every minute  none of your business growled the sporty man wrathfully  oh all right returned dave coldly i thought maybe you would want us to help you  precious little help id get from you chaps grumbled pete barnaby  you might get some if you would act half civil answered dave  humph i suppose you want me to ask you to help me so that you can have the pleasure of refusing me eh  no if i can aid you i will answered dave promptly  he doesnt deserve any help whispered phil  i know that phil answered dave but id hate to leave him in the lurch why that machine may sink so deep nobody could get it out  if youll haul me out ill pay you for your trouble said pete barnaby gruffly its an easy way to earn ten dollars  i dont want your money replied dave ill do what i can  so will i added roger the two machines together ought to be able to do the trick  do you really mean it asked the sporty man and now his voice had a ring of hope in it  yes said the senators son and dave nodded  the boys got out and from the three cars ropes were produced and tied together and the two touring cars were hooked one in front of the other and then made fast to the racing car  dont haul too hard at the start begged pete barnaby if you do you may pull my car apart  well be careful answered dave he turned to his chum remember roger weve got eighty horsepower hooked up here  ill be on my guard answered the senators son but remember he added to pete barnaby we are not to be responsible if the hauling breaks your car  ill run that riskonly go slow answered the man in trouble  the rope had been made as long as possible so that the stalled car could be drawn out of the ditch lengthwise instead of sidewise the two cars in the road started up on low speed and gradually the rope grew taut  look out everybody in case that rope snaps cried ben i once heard of a rope like that snapping and killing a housemover  you are cheerful i must say was sams dry comment nevertheless all were on their guard as the rope grew as tight as a string on a bow  she aint moving yet cried pete barnaby he stood by the side of his machine watching the rope closely  hardly had he spoken when there came a slow sucking sound as the wheels left their bed of soft mud then the racing machine moved forward slowly  hurrah shes coming cried sam put on a little more steam and youll have her  dave and roger turned on more power and the racing machine continued to move soon it was at the edge of the ditch and then with something of a jerk it came up on the roadway leaving a trail of dirty water and slimy mud behind it  say you did it all right enough cried pete barnaby in delight i was afraid she was too deep down to budge  she would have been too deep if you had left her there very much longer answered dave now if youll untie those ropes and clean them off for us well be on our way again  sure ill clean them off and the sporty man set to work with alacrity say dont you really want me to pay you for this and he made a move as if to draw a roll of bills from his pocket  i dont want a cent answered dave  its all right added roger only mr barnaby id advise you after this not to stand in with nat poole and his crowd  im sorry i did now honest i am was the sporty mans answer ieri only did it as a favor for nat because his father is holding one of my notes how did you make out after i went away i see you must have got through  we did replied dave and then mentioned how jed sully had come to their aid at this news pete barnaby began to grin  it was sure a neat way of turning the trick he said and seeing how you young gentlemen have helped me im glad you did it you can be sure ill never lay a straw in your way again never and then the ropes having been put away the two touring cars proceeded on their way once more leaving pete barnaby to clean up his machine and put it in running order again  dave that was a real nice thing to do declared jessie and gave him a bright look  he must have felt awfully small for you to be so generous after the way he acted was lauras comment  maybe it will be a lesson to him to do what is square in the future said belle  they were soon in the town of lester and there stopped at the main drug store where the boys treated the girls to icecream sundaes as they are sometimes called then they took a roundabout way back to crumville arriving there at sundown  oh what a nice day we have had in spite of the drawbacks cried jessie dancing into the mansion  drawbacks queried her mother did you get a puncture or a breakdown  oh no nothing happened to the cars answered the curlyhaired miss and then she turned to the boys to let them tell the story while they were doing this mr wadsworth came in followed by daves father and his uncle and caspar potts  that is just on a par with aaron pooles actions in general said mr wadsworth he would claim the earth if he dared i think the other property owners along that road will have something to say if he tries to close it up  i heard about the new paper company this morning said daves father some of the stockholders are not in sympathy with the way mr poole is managing affairs and they talk of putting him out  i hope they do put him out cried dave he tries to carry things with too high a hand altogether  i am glad people are finding out what sort of folks the pooles are said caspar potts he had not forgotten how in the past aaron poole had driven him to the wall and tried to get his little farm away from him  after the automobile outing phil roger and sam left crumville to pay their folks a brief visit before departing for oak hall this left dave and ben to get ready by themselves and to take out the girls which they did on several occasions they thought they might meet nick jasniff and link merwell but did not do so and later on heard that the pair had departed for rockville military academy they saw nat poole but he kept out of speaking distance  i wish nat was going to rockville too said ben hed never be missed at oak hall  oh i wouldnt say that ben returned dave nat spends considerable moneyalthough how he gets it from that miserly father of his i dont knowand that makes him some friends but i too wish he wasnt going back to our school  do you suppose hell take the same train we take  perhaps although i hope not  on the day before departing for oak hall dave and ben went down to the railroad station to purchase their tickets there they saw nat with a new dresssuit case and a new fall overcoat talking to his father  he must be going to take the train this afternoon said dave and he was right when the train came in nat got aboard along with a number of other passengers as he did this he espied the others and spoke a few words to his father in a whisper then the train rolled away and aaron poole strode over to where dave and ben were standing  see here young man i want to talk to you cried the moneylender gazing sourly at dave  what do you want mr poole asked dave as calmly as he could  you tried your best to get my son into trouble the other day  no i didntnat got himself into trouble  bah you neednt try to tell me i know all about it  i dont care to discuss the question went on dave a trifle sharply  nat was to blameif you dont believe it ask mr sully the roadmaster put in ben  dont you try to tell me fumed aaron poole i know both of you boys only too well you did your best to get my son and his friends into trouble now i want to warn you about something i understand both of you are going back to oak hall nat is going there too and i give you fair warning that you must treat him fairly if you dont ill come to the school and have it out with doctor clay understand that and the moneylender shook his long finger into the faces of the boys  mr poole just let me tell you something answered dave it is something you ought to know and i feel it is my duty to tell you even though you are not treating us as you should come out of the crowd please  i dont want to listen to your talk  well you had betterunless you want a lot of trouble later on  what do you want and rather unwillingly the moneylender followed dave and ben to a secluded corner of the railroad station  i want to warn you about the company nat is keeping the two boys he is going with nick jasniff and link merwell are bad characters you dont have to take my word for itwrite to doctor clay and see what he says nick jasniff ran away from school and he got hold of some money that didnt belong to him and used it link merwell got mixed up with some horsethieves on his fathers ranch out west and his father had to foot the bill to hush the matter up i feel it my duty to tell you this so that you can warn nat thats all and dave caught ben by the arm and started to walk away  humph so that is your game eh trying to blacken other boys characters sneered aaron poole well it wont work with me for i know you too well dave porter dont i know where you came fromthe crumville poorhouse i guess i can trust my son to pick out the right kind of friends you are jealous of him because those other boys wont go with the like of you dont talk to me only and aaron poole raised his forefinger again remember my warning when you get to oak hall and then he strode away his thin lips tightly drawn and his sharp chin held high in the air  well wouldnt that make you groan was bens comment after the man had disappeared dave you had your trouble for your pains  i dont care beni just felt i had to tell him its a shame to let nat cotton to fellows like jasniff and merwell they will drag him down as sure as fate  i believe you there but if nats father wont listenwhy id drop the matter besides you must remember that those fellows are going to another school situated quite some distance from oak hall nat wont see them excepting on special occasions  he can meet them whenever he goes to rockvillethe town i meanand jasniff and merwell will get him to drink and smoke and maybe gamble and worse nat is easily led at times  yes i know that ben drew a long breath well lets drop the subject dave we have our own battles to fight and then the boys separated each to finish the preparations for his departure     chapter vii  on the way to oak hall   swiftly the hours rolled away until it was time for dave to bid his family and his friends goodby and leave for oak hall the evening before his departure he took a walk with jessie to the end of the wadsworth garden but what was said between the pair was never known to anybody but themselves when they came back he was holding her hand and both of them looked as if they understood each other perfectly and were correspondingly happy  all of the girls as well as daves father went to the depot to see him off and there they met ben and some of his folks then the train came in and the youths climbed on board dresssuit cases in hand the girls waved their handkerchiefs  have a good time cried belle gayly  take good care of yourself dave added jessie  dont forget to write supplemented laura  well do everything you want us to do shouted dave with a smile and then he and ben waved their caps from the car window as the train rolled forward and crumville was left behind  well we are off at last observed ben as he and dave settled back in the seat for the run to the junction where they would have to change cars for oakdale the town nearest to the school and i am not sorry are you  not at all ben when it comes time to go to oak hall i am always glad to go and meet the other fellows when the term is over i am equally glad to get home and see the folks it is like the seasonsat the end of the summer i am glad winter is coming and at the end of winter i am just as pleased that summer is at hand  its the change i suppose ben stretched out and drew his knees high up in front of him my but when you come to look at it what changes have taken place at oak hall since we first went there dont you remember what a bully gus plum used to be and how chip macklin used to toady to him now plum has reformed completely and chip is as manly a little chap as any of em  its a pity that nat poole cant take a leaf from guss notebook and reform too answered dave  maybe he willafter he sees the error of his ways but dave what of athletics this season are you going in for them  i ambut not too strongly ben i want to get all the education i can  want to get through and leave oak hall  i dont want to be a schoolboy all my life i want to get out in the world and make something of myself  what are you going to become after you leave school  i dont know yet i was talking it over with father and my uncle but i havent reached any decision  at the junction the boys had to wait about half an hour for the train to oakdale dave suggested that they walk over to a candy store and have some soda water  may meet some of the other fellows there he added the train from the other way came in quarter of an hour ago and i saw a lot of dresssuit cases in the baggage room  as the two youths entered the candy store a shout went up from three boys who were drinking soda  there are dave porter and ben basswood  hello dave old man how are you  my look at bens new suit its almost loud enough to talk  hello fellows answered dave and striding forward he shook hands with the crowd one after the other  got any of those mountain lions with you queried joseph beggs a roundfaced fat lad heard you brought down about a dozen while you were on the ranch  yes buster ive got three in my trunk answered dave gayly want me to let em loose  heard you did up link merwell said luke watson another lad who was well liked because of his singing and playing abilities i was glad to hear it  so were all of us broke in the third boy a tall slim youth maurice hamilton by name but speaking of mountain lions puts me in mind of a story once three men  the same old shadow interrupted dave grabbing his hand and giving it a squeeze that made the storyteller of the school wince shadow i believe youd try to spin a yarn when you were proposing to your best girl  that sure would be a yarn cried ben as he too shook hands  i havent any best girl and you know it retorted shadow but i say he continued closing one eye tightly how is miss jessie wadsworth dave  very well was the answer and dave turned a bit red let us have something he added hastily to the clerk behind the soda fountain counter what shall it be ben  make it a true love frappé sang out buster beggs with a broad grin  but dont forget to put some ginger in it added shadow hamilton      my love how can i leave thee     one parting hug i give thee     and now when oak hall calls me     i go whateer befalls me  sang luke watson and put up his hands as if playing an imaginary guitar  say doesnt anybody want to hear that story about the mountain lions queried shadow reproachfully storytelling was his hobby and it had often been said by his friends that he would rather spin a yarn than eat  some other time shadow answered buster we want to hear about daves trip west and about what he did to link merwell  before i tell you about that let me give you a piece of news said dave and then he related how he and the others had met merwell and jasniff with nat poole and how the two former youths were going to rockville military academy as he had anticipated this created quite a sensation and a lively discussion followed which was kept up even after the crowd got aboard the train which would carry them to oakdale  well if rockville wants such fellows it can have em was buster beggss comment i for one am glad they are out of oak hall  i know one fellow who will be glad they are gone said shadow that is gus plum  yes indeed answered dave for he well remembered what influence merwell and even jasniff had exercised over plum when the youth had found his appetite for liquor almost too strong for him  of course dave had to go over many of his western adventures and the others listened with keen interest to all he had to tell when he mentioned the theft of the horses at the ranch and how link merwell had been mixed up with the thieves more than one shook his head  according to that link and nick are a team said luke watson dave you had better be on your guard they wont hesitate to play you some foul trick  oakdale a small but prosperous town was reached at last and the schoolboys piled out of the train along with a few other passengers  hello there is polly vane cried dave catching sight of a slender lad with a girlish face how are you polly  oh its dave porter answered bertram vane in a low but pleased voice he held out his slender hand i am delighted to see you back how tanned you are and how stronglooking  it was the mountain air did it polly by the way is horsehair around he continued with a glance beyond the depot platform  oh yes here he comes now and as polly spoke the big carryall of the school swung into view with jackson lemond commonly called horsehair on the drivers seat the boys made a rush for the carryall throwing their suitcases in the rack on top and piling inside one over the other  horsehair youre looking fine  hows the widow horsehair heard you were going to marry a widow with eight children  nine children busterdont drop any of the family like that  nothing like getting a readymade family while you are at it horsehair  i heard the widow was a suffragette horsehair is that right  if shes that horsehair shell make you mind the children and wash dishesbetter beware  oh dont worry about that horsehair is an expert at washing dishes and at minding babies he once took first prize at a county fair didnt you horsehair  say you roared the carryall driver his face as red as a beet you quit your knockin i aint gittin married to no widder nor nobody else an i aint washin dishes an mindin babies nuther such boys and with a crack of his whip he started up the turnout so suddenly that half the lads were pitched into the laps of the other half  it was certainly a jolly crowd that rolled over the wellkept highway toward oak hall they knew that many hard lessons awaited them and that once school opened discipline would be strict but just now all were in high spirits to the tune of auld lang syne luke watson started up the school song and the others joined in lustily      oak hall we never shall forget       no matter where we roam     it is the very best of schools       to us its just like home     then give three cheers and let them ring       throughout this world so wide     to let the people know that we       elect to here abide  thats the stuff cried ben slangily now then for the field cry and then came the oak hall cheer            baseball            football            oak hall            has the call     biff boom bang whoop  i think we ought to display the school colors cried dave anybody got a flag  here is one answered polly vane from his seat in front beside the driver but i havent got a stick for it  never mind shadows fishing rod will do answered dave shadow hand it over  all right but dont break the rod said shadow it cost me four bones  the rod was put together and the school colors fastened to the top then the rod was thrust out of a side window of the carryall and waved in the air first by one student and then another  look out that you dont hit nobody with that fishin pole warned the carryall driver as the turnout swung around a bend of the road  he had scarcely spoken when a buggy came into view driven by a tall seriouslooking individual wearing a high silk hat the buggy swung forward quickly directly in line with the fishing rod and before the boys could haul the colors in the rod hit the silk hat sending it whirling into the bushes beside the roadway     chapter viii  about some new students   hi hi whats the meaning of this outrage roared the individual in the buggy as he brought his horse to a standstill do you want to kill me  who is it is he hurt questioned dave quickly  i dont know answered ben the rod took off his hat but whether it struck his head or not remains to be seen  wots the trouble back there demanded jackson lemond as he succeeded in bringing his team to a halt  trouble is we hit that man with the rod answered buster  humph i told you to be careful grumbled the carryall driver it dont pay to act like a passel o wildcats nohow  its too bad it happened said dave and leaped to the ground and ran back to where the buggy stood with the driver glaring at them savagely the other students followed  are you hurt asked dave anxiously the man in the buggy was a total stranger to him  hurt i dont know whether i am or not what do you mean by knocking off my hat with that stick  it was an accident sir we had our school colors on the fishing rod and were waving them in the air we didnt expect to hit anybody  bah you are a lot of rowdies growled the man give me my hat and he pointed to where the head covering rested on some bushes  there you are said ben restoring the hat to its owner but we are not rowdiesit was purely an accident he added with a little flash out of his clear eyes  bah i know schoolboys they think it smart to be tough the man looked his silk hat over i ought to make you buy me a new hat  that doesnt seem to be damaged any said buster as he looked the tile over if it is of course well make it right he added hastily he and luke were holding the fishing rod at the time of the accident  do you boys belong at oak hall demanded the man smoothing down the roughedup silk hat with his forearm  yes answered dave  i thought so well if this hat is cracked or anything like that ill notify the master of the school and make you get me a new hat maybe it will be a lesson to you to be more careful  let me see the hat please said luke  what for  i wish to see if it is really damaged  if it is ill let you know quick enough dont fear  i want to see it now i am not going to pay for a new hat if this one is all right  ha so you dont want to take my word for it eh roared the man  i want to look the hat over answered luke stubbornly  so do i added buster  ill not give you the hatto play more tricks with i shall take it to a hat dealer and if he says it is injured ill call at the school about it and having thus delivered himself the man in the buggy put the silk hat on his head spoke to his horse and whirled on down the road in the direction of rockville  talk about a peppery individual cried ben he certainly is one  i dont think the hat was damaged at all said dave it will simply be a holdupif he tries to get a new one out of us that hat is quite old and rustylooking  he was a rustylooking fellow all the way through commented buster wonder who he is  hes some kind of a doctor answered the carryall driver who had left his turnout to join the boys he came to oakdale and rockville this summer and he gives lectures on how to git well and strong an then he sells medicine i know a feller got a bottle from him but it didnt do him no good he calls himself doctor montgomerybut i reckon he aint no real doctor at all  must be one of these quacks who go around the country trying to rope people in said dave if he is he ought to be run out of the neighborhood  maybe well never hear from him again said luke but the boys were destined to hear from hooker montgomery again and in a manner to surprise them  returning to the carryall the boys took in the colors so that they might do no further damage and then the journey to oak hall was resumed the encounter on the road had sobered them a little and this did not wear away until they came in sight of the school buildings  hurrah i see phil and roger cried dave as the carryall swung in between the large oak trees that gave the place its name hello he shouted here we are again  dave returned the senators son running forward while phil did the same how are you all he added waving his hand to the crowd in general  a number of other boys were present and soon dave was surrounded by his old friends all eager to shake hands they wanted to know all about his trip and he in return wanted to know what they had been doing so there was a perfect babble of voices as the crowd walked into the main school building where good old doctor hasmer clay the head of the institution stood to welcome each new arrival  glad to see you back porter he said kindly and i must thank you in person for the skin you sent from the ranch we have placed it on the floor of the reception room i am quite proud to think one of my pupils is such a good shot  roger and phil are good shots too answered dave anxious that his chums should have all the credit due them  so i understand doctor clay paused for a moment i believe you met lincoln merwell out west he eyed dave curiously as he mentioned the fact  yes i met himand we had some troublebut it is all over now but doctor clay dave motioned the master of the school to one side and lowered his voice do you know that merwell and nick jasniff are going to rockville military academy  is it possible  that is what they say it seems to me that the authorities of rockville ought to know what sort they are  that is true porter butahemi dont know what i can do you see to tell you the truth the management of the military academy has changed hands and the new master and i are not on speaking terms he wished to obtain certain pupils and they came to this school instead and that made him very angry he claimed that i treated him unfairly but i did not even if i were to warn him against jasniff and merwell it is not likely that he would take the warning in good part besides the military academy is not in a prosperous condition financially and i rather think the owners will take almost any pupils they can get  i see sir well if thats the case why we might as well drop the matter answered dave  i will think it over and perhaps ill send a letter to the master of rockville returned doctor clay seriously i dont want even an enemy to harbor such lads as jasniff and merwell without knowing what they are although it would be to rockvilles credit if it took those boys and made real men out of them  as my old readers know oak hall was a large building of brick and stone shaped in the form of a cross with the classrooms the private office the diningroom and the kitchen on the ground floor on the second floor were the majority of the school dormitories furnished to accommodate from four to eight pupils each the school was surrounded by a broad campus sloping in the rear to the leming river on the bank of which was located the school boathouse at one side of the campus was a neat gymnasium and at the other were some stables and sheds and also a newlybuilt garage for automobiles and motorcycles  dave and his chums had their quarters in dormitories nos 11 and 12 two large and welllighted apartments having a connecting door between not far away was dormitory no 13 occupied by nat poole and his cronies merwell and jasniff had had beds in that room but now those places were given to others  roger and phil had arrived the day before and were already settled and now they did what they could to make dave at home assisting him in unpacking his trunk and his suitcase and putting the things away in the bureau and the clothes closet of course dave had brought along some pictures and banners and these were hung up or set on the bureauthat is all but one photographone of jessie she had given him the day before that he kept to himself in his private drawer with a few other treasures under lock and key  hello dave can i help you came a voice from the doorway and gus plum appeared the former bully of the hall was a trifle thin and pale but his eyes were clear and his voice pleasant to hear  why gus how are you cried dave and shook hands warmly did you have a good time this summer  quite good answered plum you know i went up to maine with mr dale he took up half a dozen fellows and we went in for botany and geology while we were camping out  well i guess mr dale is good company answered dave he referred to andrew dale the first assistant teacher of the school a man well beloved by nearly all the students every summer this teacher took out some of the boys and there was always a rivalry as to who should go along  it was better than justerknocking around stammered gus plum he meant carousing around with fellows of the merwell and jasniff sort and dave understood he hesitated for a moment and looked around to see if anybody but phil and roger were in the rooms of course you know nat poole is back he continued in a low voice  yesi saw him leave crumville  dave you want to beware of him gus plum uttered the words very earnestly  oh i am not afraid of natnever was  yes but this is different dave i suppose you know there are a lot of new fellows at oak hall this year  there are new fellows every yearthe seniors go and the freshies come in  yes but this year we have more new fellows than ever a school in laverport broke up and sixteen of the students were transferred to oak hallsophs juniors and seniors so those fellows added to the freshies make quite a bunch  what has that got to do with poole and me  nat poole and one of the fellows from laverport a chap named guy frapley are very good friendsin fact i think they are related this frapley was a sort of leader at laverport and he has got a number of the other newcomers under his thumb last night i was down by the boathouse and i heard nat and frapley talking about you nat was very anxious to do something to make you take a back seat as he termed it and after a while frapley consented to take the matter up with him  what do you suppose theyll do questioned phil who had listened to plums words with interest  i dont know exactly but theyll do something you can be sure of that more than likely it will be something underhanded  i am not afraid of nat poolenor of this guy frapley either said dave  dave has so many friends here why should he be afraid asked roger  well i only thought id warn you thats all answered the former bully meekly i dont want dave to have any more trouble if i can help it  its kind of you gus to tell me of this answered dave heartily and ill be on my guard but i really dont think nat poole will cut much of a figure during this term of school he has lost too many of his old friends  but for once dave was mistaken nat poole did cut a figure although not quite in the manner expected and what he and his cronies did caused dave not a little trouble     chapter ix  the football meeting   in a few days dave felt as much at home as ever nearly all of his old friends had returned to oak hall and dormitories nos 11 and 12 were filled with as bright a crowd of lads as could well be found anywhere in the number were gus plum and chip macklin but the former was no longer the bully as of old and the latter had lost his toadying manner and was quite manly and the other students treated them as if all had always been the best of friends  it did daves heart good to see the change in plum and he was likewise pleased over the different way in which macklin acted  i never thought it was in gus and chip he said privately to roger it shows what a fellow can do if he sets his mind to it  its to your credit as much as to their own declared the senators son i dont believe gus would have reformed if you hadnt braced him up  i wish i could reform nat poole  youll never do it davebut you may scare him into behaving himself  have you met guy frapley rogeri mean to talk to  yes in the gym where phil and i were practicing with the indian clubs  what do you think of him  i think he is fairly aching to become the leader of the school he was leader at laverport and it breaks his heart to play second fiddle to anybody here he and nat are as thick as two peas they tell me he is a great football player so i suppose he will try to run the elevenif the fellows will let him  i dont think the old players will let a new crowd run our team  the trouble is some of the old players are gone and the new crowd may count up the largest number of votes in that case theyll be able to run things to suit themselves  dave had settled down to his studies in earnest for that winter he wished to make an extra good record for himself he loved sports but as he grew older he realized that he was at oak hall more for a mental than a physical training  when my time comes i shall have a good many business interests to look after was the way he expressed himself to phil who joked him about boning like a cart horse and i know if i havent the education ill be at the mercy of anybody who wishes to take advantage of my ignorance  well you are not going to give up football are you dave questioned the shipowners son  not if they want me on the eleven  well that depends we have a meeting monday afternoon in the gym  dave had noticed a good many whispered conversations taking place between some of the old students and all of the new ones and he had wondered what was going on a hint was dropped that the football meeting would wake things up whatever that might mean  i think i know what is in the wind said gus plum to dave during a recess on monday nat poole and guy frapley came to me last night and they wanted me to pledge myself to support frapley for captain of the eleven  well they had a right to do that gus  i told them i wouldnt do it they said if i didnt id get left i told em that wouldnt hurt me very much because i didnt care for playing anyway  i see answered dave thoughtfully  he at once sought out roger phil and sam daythose who had loved to play football in the past and who had hoped to be on the eleven the present seasonand talked the matter over with them then the shipowners son made a quiet canvass among all those interested in football  plum is right he declared later frapley aided by nat poole and his cronies is going to carry matters with a high hand  its an outrage cried sam a stranger running the oak hall eleven i shall protest  it wont do any goodif frapley gets the votes answered roger especially if he is a good player and they say he is  the news that there was going to be a lively time drew a large crowd to the meeting in the gymnasium this was called to order by the former manager of the eleven and a call was issued for nominations for a new manager  i nominate john rand cried nat poole mentioning one of the students from laverport  second the nomination added guy frapley promptly  i nominate henry fordham said roger putting up one of the old students who did not play but who was a good general manager and a youth well liked by his classmates  dave seconded rogers nomination and as there were no other names submitted the nominations were declared closed  mr chairman id like to say a few words before we hold an electioni mean before we vote said sam day mounting a chair  oh dry up and let us cast our ballots muttered nat poole  i wish to speak in favor of henry fordham whom all old students of oak hall know so well continued sam he knows  vote vote let us vote called out several new students loudly and it was seen that they were urged on by guy frapley  in a moment half a dozen students were speaking at once and it took several minutes for the chairman of the meeting to restore silence then sam was allowed to make a short speech and he was followed by dave both speaking in favor of fordham then a new student spoke in favor of rand and then the voting began  the result was a painful surprise for fordham and equally painful to dave and his chums so well had nat poole guy frapley and their cohorts laid their plans that john rand was elected manager of the coming eleven by a majority of five votes  it is all up with our crowd murmured roger to dave when the result was announced that crowd has got votes enough to ride over us roughshod and it is going to do it  and the senators son was right as later events speedily proved the new football team made up of a regular eleven and five substitutes counted but six old oak hall players dave roger phil and their close chums were utterly ignored guy frapley was chosen captain and quarterback and nat poole was made fullback it is needless to say that some of the old players who had worked so hard in the past to make oak hall victorious left the meeting in disgust  this is the worst i was ever up against murmured roger talk about ingratitude and just think that once phil nearly lost his life to help us win  and think of how hard dave and you worked put in a sympathizer its a burning shame thats what it is  well there is one satisfaction said dave as calmly as he could although he was as depressed as any one it is on their shoulders now to make good we havent anything on that score to worry about  ill tell you what lets do cried phil well organize a scrub eleven and wax em out of their shoes  i dont believe theyll play youthey are afraid said buster  never mind then well play somebody else we can challenge them anyway if they are afraid of us we want the whole school to know it  phils idea met with considerable favor and he easily persuaded dave roger sam gus plum and a number of others to join his scrub eleven which was named the old guard phil was manager as well as captain and played right halfback while dave was quarterback and roger was center the eleven went into practice with as much vigor as if they were training for some championship games  as had been anticipated the regular eleven tried to ignore the old guard when a challenge to play was issued john rand sent back word that he could fix up his own scrub eleven without any help from outsiders his scrub was made up of freshmen and of course the regular team beat them with ease  never mindthey are afraid of usand well let everybody know it declared roger and then the challenge from the old guard to the regular eleven was posted up in the gymnasium where all might see it it was torn down over night but a new copy was put up by the following noon  as was to be expected the challenge created much talk and phil and frapley almost came to blows about it phil and his chums were accused of trying to break up the good feeling of the school in general and in return the shipowners son very bluntly told the new captain of the school eleven that he would lead oak hall to defeat  its time enough to talk like that after we are beaten declared guy frapley grimly then it was announced that the regular oak hall football eleven would play the opening game of the season against an eleven from lemington on a saturday afternoon the contest to take place on the lemington athletic grounds  they ought to be waxed good and proper said chip macklin  who asked dave  our eleven dave oh i know what you will saythat that isnt the true school spirit and all thatbut just the same poole and frapley and that bunch dont deserve to win  ive got half a notion not to go to the game declared sam  i am going answered dave i dont like that crowd and i dont think we were treated fairly just the same for the honor of oak hall i am going to the game and root for our side  the same old dave murmured roger in admiration well if youre going i am going too  lemington was situated several miles up the river and while some of the boys decided to go to that town by the carryall and on their bicycles and motorcycles others decided to go up in boats  as my old readers know nat poole was the owner of a goodsized motorboat a craft he had had stored in the boathouse since the last summer in this boat the dudish student frequently went for a cruise up and down the river taking his cronies along the fact that he owned the craft and could give them a ride made nat quite popular with some of the students  ill take the eleven up to lemington in my motorboat said nat to the manager it will be a fine sail if the weather is good and so it was arranged  as the weather remained warm dave and his chums often went out on the river for a row and one afternoon they rowed as far as bush island about two miles away on the island were some chestnut trees and the boys walked over to see if the nuts were fit to gather  i see some other fellows here cried roger and pointed to some boys in military uniforms some distance away  they must be fellows from rockville academy answered dave i didnt think theyd come as far as this after school hours  well i suppose they have as much right here as we have was phils comment  they passed on and presently lost sight of the other crowd then quarter of an hour later they came out on the island shore to see the other lads in a rowboat just getting ready to leave the place  why there are link merwell and nick jasniff exclaimed roger  right you are answered dave then he gave another look where is our boat he questioned quickly  all looked around and saw that their rowboat was missing  they must have taken it cried phil he raised his voice i say merwell jasniff stop i want to talk to you  not much called back nick jasniff  we dont want to talk to you answered link merwell  what have you done with out boat questioned roger  thats for you to find out returned nick jasniff ta ta hope you have a nice time getting back to oak hall  and then he and link merwell and their companions took up their oars and rowed swiftly away from bush island     chapter x  looking for a missing rowboat   we are certainly in a pickle remarked roger as the rockville cadets rounded a point of the island and disappeared from view  i wonder what they did with our boat said phil i dont see it anywhere on the water  perhaps they took it to the other side of the island suggested dave  would they have time to do that  i dont know this is a total surprise to me phil  they did the trick on the impulse of the moment went on roger for they didnt know we were coming here  and we didnt know they were here added dave let us take a look around and see if we can spot the boat  all right ill go down the shore and you can go up cried phil and set off at as rapid a gait as the nature of the ground permitted  a hasty search did not bring the rowboat to light the boys met on the other side of the island and stared wonderingly at each other  see anything  not a thing  the boat must be somewhere  maybe they sunk her cried the senators son merwell and jasniff are just unprincipled enough to do it  if they did that they must have done it close to where we tied her up they wouldnt have time to take her away returned dave let us go back and see if we can find any trail in the mud and sand  they crossed the island passing the chestnut trees as they did so under one of the trees dave picked up a letter it was addressed to nicholas jasniff general delivery rockville  jasniff must have dropped this when he was nutting said dave as he and the others looked at the address  what is in it asked phil its open read it  would that be fair phil  i think so jasniff is an enemy not a friend it may contain some clew to his doings and if there is anything underhanded going on we can let the authorities know  dave took out the single sheet that the envelope contained on it was written in a sprawling heavy hand the following       my dear jasniff       i got your leter and i wil do all i can to help you pervided you      wil help me on that bussines i meantioned to you i know we both      can make money and hardly anny risks beter not come to the office      but meet me at dunns on the river       yours afectenately      dr h montgomery  why this letter was written by that doctor hooker montgomery the man whose silk hat we knocked off cried dave  his education seems to be extremely limited observed phil hed never stand at the top of the spelling class would he  i was asking about him and hes a regular fakir said roger he isnt a doctor at all although he calls himself one he puts up a number of medicines and calls them montgomerys wonderful cures i was told that he used to do quite a business among the ignorant country folks but lately hardly anybody patronizes him  and that is why he is willing to aid jasniff in some scheme i suppose said phil ill wager it is something underhanded when are they to meet  it doesnt say answered dave but the postmark is a week old so i presume the meeting is a thing of the past i guess ill not keep the letter he concluded and cast it on the ground where he had found it  arriving at where the rowboat had been tied up the three chums looked around carefully and soon saw footprints leading to a little cove shaded by tall elderberry bushes pushing some of the bushes aside dave looked into the water and gave a cry  here she is fellows  have you really found the boat dave questioned phil  yes shes at the bottom of the cove they piled her full of stones and sunk her they must have had quite a job doing it  and here are the oars exclaimed roger dragging them from the bushes say its going to be cold work getting that boat into shape for use he added for the sun was going down and the air was keen  ill do it if you dont care to answered dave a cold plunge will do me good  ill help if you say so volunteered phil  never mind phil i think i can do it alone no use in more than one undressing  the rowboat had been sunk in water three feet deep taking off most of his clothing and also his shoes and socks dave waded into the cove and set to work taking the stones out of the craft it was certainly cold and only the heavy labor served to keep his blood in circulation  they didnt pound a hole in her did they asked the senators son anxiously  i dont see any hole answered dave ill soon know there arent many more stones left  he had great difficulty in budging the bottom stone the largest of the lot but once this was removed the boat was quite buoyant and came close to the surface then dave shoved the craft close to shore and turned it over to empty it  as good as ever cried roger and his tones showed his relief now dave get into your clothes again and phil and i will row you back to the hall well be lateand you know what that means if job haskers catches us  weve got a good excuse said phil but maybe haskers wont accept it he added remembering only too well how harsh and unreasonable the second assistant teacher could be at times  i think ill do some of the rowing myself just to get warm said dave when they got into the craft and he took an oar and soon bush island was left behind  this is another mark against merwell and jasniff said the shipowners son as they pulled in the direction of the school i suppose they thought wed have to stay on the island all night  yes and maybe longer said dave i fancy they wouldnt care if we had to remain there until we were almost starved  well have to get back at them somehow came from roger  it was quite dark when they reached the boathouse at oak hall no students were in sight all having gone in to supper dave looked at his watch  supper is almost over he cried we had better hurry if we want anything to eat  eat rather i am as hungry as a bear cried phil  so am i added the senators son  putting the rowboat away the three boys started in the direction of the big school building as they did this they saw somebody approaching them from an angle of the east wing  its haskers whispered phil he is coming this way  lets run for it cried roger we can get in on the other side quick  boys boys stop called out job haskers as they started to run i know you porter morr lawrence stop i say and he came running after them  its no use he recognizes us groaned phil and came to a halt and so did the others  what is the meaning of this i demand to know where you have been cried job haskers sourly as he came up puffing from his unusual exertions  we are sorry mr haskers but we were out rowing and we were detained at bush island explained dave  did you have permission to stay away during the supper hour  no sir we didnt intend to do so we were  humph that is no excuse young man no excuse whatever you know the rule go to your rooms at onceand stay there until tomorrow morning and job haskers glared coldly at the three students he seemed always to take special delight in catching a student at some infringement of the rules and in meting out punishment  we havent had any supper yet said roger  that is not my fault morr the diningroom is now about to close and you cannot go in it will be a lesson to you to be on hand promptly in the future  we have got to have something to eat declared phil stubbornly  ha dont you dare to talk back to me lawrence if you do it again ill give you some extra lessons to learn  mr haskers wont you listen to us asked dave in a steady voice we have a good excuse to offer for being late  i dont want any excuses it was your duty to return to the hall in time for supper  we simply couldnt get here we were on bush island and our boat was taken away from us  i saw you come back here in a boat  we found our boat after a whileafter we had lost a good hour looking for it then we rowed back as fast as we could  pooh the usual story i want no such lame excuses some teachers might accept them but not i go to your rooms and at onceand dont dare to come downstairs until tomorrow morningor ill cut off all your holidays until christmas and job haskers folded his arms and stood like a judge before the boys  an angry remark arose to daves lips but he checked it and turned toward the school building and roger and phil followed job haskers marched after them  go upstairs at once he ordered no lingering in the lower hall for he was afraid the lads might slip him and try to get something to eat on the sly  mr haskers i wish to talk to doctor clay said dave  doctor clay has nothing to do with this affair i am in charge here for the present  do you mean to say that i cant see the doctor  doctor clay is away on business you may see him in the morning if you wish  i dont think hed send us to bed supperless  it is your own fault you boys have got to learn to obey the rules of this institution perhaps it will be a lesson well learned  i think its an outrage muttered phil  what is that lawrence cried the teacher harshly but phil did not repeat his statement  there seemed to be no help for it and slowly the three students passed up the stairs and entered their dormitory job haskers watched them out of sight and then stalked away his face as grim and hard as ever  well doesnt this beat the nation groaned roger as he plumped down on one of the beds  evidently old haskers hasnt forgotten what happened last term was phils comment he is going to make it just as hard as he can for us  im as hungry as can be i didnt have much dinner dave are you going to stand for this  what do you mean rogerstaying in the room until tomorrow  that and going without supper  i dont care so much about staying in the room was the reply but i can assure you of one thingi am not going without my supper  how are you going to get it  i dont know yet but i am going to get it somehow replied dave and his tone of voice showed that he meant what he said     chapter xi  a midnight feast   while the three students were discussing the situation the door of the dormitory opened and sam day and shadow hamilton entered  hello why werent you down to supper asked sam  we didnt get here in time answered roger and then he related what had occurred on bush island  it was just like jasniff and merwell said shadow and like old haskers too i suppose he is laughing to himself now because he made you go without your supper  but i am not going without it said dave that is not if you fellows will do me a favor  want me to get something from the pantry for you queried sam quickly ill do itif it can be done  you cant get in the pantry any more said phil with a wry face since dave and i did the trick some time ago they keep the doors locked  and that puts me in mind of a story cried shadow once a little boy  quit it shadow interrupted sam you dont expect dave and roger and phil to listen to your yarns when they are starving do you tell the story after they have filled up  well it was only a short yarn pleaded the storyteller of the school but of course if we can do anything  you cani think said dave but you must act quickly  whats to be done  since i have been here i have noticed a wagon going through on the main road every evening about this time it belongs to rousmann the delicatessen man of rockville i wish youd stop him and see what you can buy for us and as he finished dave took a twodollar bill from his pocket and held it out  by hookey ill do it cried sam readily come on shadow maybe we can get enough to have a little feast tonight  not on two dollars answered phil heres another fifty cents  oh ive got a little money of my own returned sam  so have ithirtyfive cents added shadow my allowance is behind time and that puts me in mind of another story two men wereoh but i forgot you are too hungry to listen to yarns well ill tell it some other time and away he went after sam out into the hallway and down the broad stairs  if only they get there before that wagon passes sighed the senators son  maybe the driver wont have anything to sell he may be sold out came from phil  let us hope for the best answered dave cheerfully he cant be sold out of everything even a loaf of bread and some sardines wouldnt go bad  or some frankfurters added roger  a few minutes passed and ben came up to the room and the story of the adventure on the island and with job haskers had to be told again ben was as indignant as sam and shadow had been  i wouldnt stand for it he cried why dont you report to doctor clay  because he is away answered dave but i may report to him tomorrow he continued thoughtfully  a halfhour passedto the hungry boys it seemed a long timeand then came a clatter of footsteps in the hallway the door was banged open and in came sam and shadow followed by gus plum and luke watson and each carrying a fairsized bundle under his coat  we got there just in the nick of time panted sam for he was somewhat out of breath fact is i had to run after the wagon to stop it  and we got a dandy lot of stuff continued shadow gus and luke helped us to buy it  we are in for a spread tonight explained gus plum but you fellows can eat all you wish right now  the door was closed and locked and one after another the bundles were opened the boys who had done the purchasing had certainly spread themselves as dave said they had obtained some fresh rolls and cake an apple and a pumpkin pie some cheese and some cold ham and tongue a bottle of pickles and five different kinds of crackers in boxes  this is certainly a spread and no mistake said dave as he and phil and roger viewed the eatables with keen satisfaction  chip macklin has gone off to a farmers house for two quarts of milk said shadow and i told him to bring some apples tooif he could get them  well have more than if we had been downstairs to supper said the shipowners son  whatever is left will do for our spread later explained sam  whatever is left repeated shadow say that puts me in mind of a storyand im going to tell this one he added as several of those present gave a groan a little boy was looking for his shoes he found one and looked at it thoughtfully and then said i dess you is the right one and your brovver is the left one but you is the left one and your brovver aint left tall cause hes gone and the story produced a smile all around  in a few minutes came a triple rap on the doora wellknown signaland sam opened the portal to admit chip macklin the small student carried two bottles of milk under his coat and his pockets were bulging with apples and pears  hurrah now we can have a square meal and no mistake cried dave as glasses were produced and the milk was poured out chip we owe you one for this  youre welcome answered the little lad with a smile he was glad to be of service in return for all dave had done for him in the past  the eatables were spread out on a studying table and dave and his chums proceeded to fill up as phil expressed it they made a hearty meal and yet when they had finished there was a considerable portion of the food left  well not touch the pies or the fruit said dave those can be saved for the spread later  the boys were just clearing away the crumbs of the meal when there came a hasty knock on the door  who is there asked roger going to the door but not opening it  it is i murphy came in the husky tones of big jim the monitor if anything is going on in there i want to warn you that mr haskers is coming upi heard him tell an under teacher  thanks jimwell be ready for him answered the senators son and passed out a pear and an apple and then the kindhearted monitor walked away again on his rounds  the students worked hastily and noiselessly and in less than three minutes the remainder of the food was stowed away in a closet out of sight and everything about the dormitory was cleaned up then the lads got out their books and writing materials  come in cried dave when a knock sounded sharply and the door was opened and job haskers presented himself his face showed his disappointment at finding everything as it should be  oh mr haskers you are just in time cried phil innocently will you kindly show me how to do this example in algebra  and will you please show me how to translate this latin asked roger catching his cue from phil  and ive got a problem in geometry that is bothering me said dave smoothly  i have no time for lessons now answered the teacher harshly i have other duties to perform if you will attend to the explanations given in the classrooms you will need no extra aid and thus delivering himself job haskers backed out of the dormitory as speedily as he had entered it  stung that time murmured ben as he closed the door once more ill wager an apple against a peanut that he thought he would catch dave roger and phil eating on the sly  or off the table added sam and then ben shied a book at his head  for over an hour the lads in the dormitory turned their attention to their lessons during that time some other occupants of nos 11 and 12 came in and all were informed of the spread to be given at midnight to make things more lively some boys from no 10 were also asked to participate  of course you are going to ask nat poole and guy frapley said roger with a grin  not on your collarbutton replied sam they can furnish their own spreadsthey and the whole crowd with em  we want to look out that they dont get wise to what we are doing said plum it would be just like nat to give us away if he knew  if he did that he ought to have his head punched murmured luke  say luke give us a little music before it gets past hours suggested dave and willingly enough luke got out a banjo tuned up and rendered several favorites while the playing was going on the door was left open and a small crowd congregated in the hallway to listen for luke was really a skillful performer all too soon the playing had to come to an end as the time for lights out arrived  it was exactly twelve oclock when sam arose from where he had been resting and made a light at once the others also got up all were dressed and it did not take long to bring the eatables from the closet and push two studying tables together for a banquet board as roger dubbed it he and dave and phil were not particularly hungry yet they entered with vim into the proceedings the door between nos 11 and 12 was open and those invited from no 10 came in as silently as shadows  soon the feast was in full swing the pies were large and were cut into just enough pieces to go around the fancy crackers were passed around in their boxes and the apples and pears were placed on a tennis racket and handed around like an oldfashioned contribution box according to plums way of describing it  we ought to have a speech cried ben i move dave porter be called upon to speak  second the motion cried several others  give us something on how to learn without studying suggested shadow  or how to do algebra while you sleep said ben  or how to make haskers reform suggested luke  dont ask him to speak on the impossible broke in plum youll never get jobey to reformit isnt in him  im too full to make a speech said dave with a smile besides we dont want any noise up here or well be spotted sure  i know what we ought to do cried phil  what asked a chorus  pay old haskers back for the mean way he treated us cant we do something to him while he is asleep  we sure can answered roger he looked at dave what shall it be  dave thought for a moment and then a broad grin overspread his features  i wonder if we can manage it he said half to himself  manage what dave asked several eagerly  i think we can do itif some of you fellows will furnish a stout line several fishing lines twisted together will do  but what do you intend to do dave  make job haskers think there is an earthquakethat is if he is in bed and asleep and we can get into his room  oh he must be asleep by this time said sam  and here is a stout cord i used it for flying my big kite added ben  then come on and well give job haskers a surprise but dont make any noise or we may get caught     chapter xii  an earthquake for job haskers   the door to the hall was cautiously opened and the boys looked out the coast appeared to be clear and dave tiptoed his way out followed by his chums a faint light was burning as required by the school regulations and this kept the students from bumping into anything  all knew the location of the apartment occupied by job haskers and it did not take them long to reach the door to it here they paused to listen intently  he is in there and asleep whispered dave  yes and snoring added roger that shows he wont wake up very easily  well wake him up dont fearif my plan works replied dave with grim humor  with great caution the door was tried and found to be unlocked then scarcely daring to breathe dave stepped into the apartment with roger and phil behind him clutching at his arms the light in the hallway was near by and dave motioned for it to be turned up so that he could see around the room  job haskerss bed had been turned around for this term so that the head was next to the wall beside the doorway it was a new brass bedstead ornamental but light  with deft fingers dave doubled the cord provided by ben and tied one end to the head railing of the brass bedstead the other end of the cord he carried to the doorway and threw up through the transom which swung upon side pivots  good i see your plan now murmured phil i reckon well give him an awakening all right enough  as soon as the boys in the hallway had secured the outer end of the doubled cord dave stepped out of the room again followed by roger and phil  why not lock the door whispered the senators son the key is here  just what i intended to do answered dave in an equally low voice  the door was closed and locked and the students all gathered in front of the portal each with his hand on the cord  i wish we could dump him out of bed muttered plum  well give him a little quiver first said dave he wont know what to make of it i dont think hell notice the cord it is just the color of the wall  they pulled the cord taut and then raised the head of the bed an inch or two then they let it drop  oherwho is that they heard job haskers murmur is it time to get up swingly he mentioned the name of the school janitor who had orders to rouse him when he was oversleeping  of course there was no answer to the teachers question he waited for a moment and then turned over in bed as if for another snooze  now well give him a sharp jerk whispered dave and the students caught hold of the cord with vigor up came the head of the bed about a foot and swayed violently towards the door  hi hi whats this roared job haskers sitting bolt upright and gazing about in bewilderment  its the end of the world came in a hollow voice through the keyhole the end of the world  mercy on me its an earthquake thats what it is burst from the befuddled teacher and then as the bed was jerked high in the air once more he rolled over in the blankets and slid down to the lower end where one foot got caught between the brass bars  get out of the building mr haskers came a cry through the keyhole it is going to shake to the ground  yes yes it must be an earthquake groaned the bewildered pedagogue oh will i ever get out alive i wonder  the top of the bedstead was bobbing up and down like a ship on an angry ocean in the darkness job haskers was completely bewildered and he firmly believed that an earthquake had struck oak hall and that the building was in danger of collapsing with a cry of fright he tumbled out on the floor and threw the covers in which he was wound up aside he tried to find the door but the top of the bedstead was now in the way  the fire escapeit is the only way out he muttered to himself and as the boys continued to jerk the bedstead around he ran to the window and threw out a rope fastened to a ring in the floor then out of the window he bounced and slid down the rope with a speed that blistered his hands  he has gone out of the window cried roger who had his eye glued to the keyhole wait a minute fellows  quick we must take away the cord said dave and in a trice the door of the bedroom was unlocked the bed shoved into place and the cord removed then the students scampered away turning down the light as before  once on the ground job haskers lost no time in getting away from the building each instant he expected another quake that would bring that noble pile of bricks stone and mortar to the ground but the quake did not come  queer he murmured presently didnt anybody else feel that awful shock  hi you throw up your hands or ill fill ye full o buckshot  the cry came from behind him and it caused job haskers to leap with a new fear he turned and in the gloom of the night saw a man approaching with a gun pointed full at him  dontdont shoshoot me he gasped  up with yer hands came from the man i cotches ye that time didnt i now wot are ye a ghost a burglar or a student on a lark  whwho are yoyou stammered job haskers did youerfeel the earthquake  instead of answering the questions the man came closer until the barrel of his shotgun was within a foot of the teachers head then he gave a cry of astonishment  why if it aint mr haskers wot in the world are you adoin out this time o night sir  lemond faltered the teacher as he recognized the driver for the hall did youerdid you feel the earthquake  earthquake no sir  it is strange  did you feel any of em sir horsehair had lowered his gun and was gazing fixedly at the teacher say you aint walking in your sleep are ye he questioned abruptly  no noieri am sure i am not stammered job haskers yet in secret he pinched himself to make certain i waserin bed and i thought i felt an earthquakethe bed swayed and i heard a cry the teacher stopped suddenly perhaps it was those rascally boys he cried abruptly  boys did they play a joke on yer they wouldnt be above it sirthey are as full of em this term as ever sir how did you git out o the buildingdown that rope  yeas you see the bed movedor i thought it didand blocked the doorway and ibut never mind lemond dont say anything about this ill go in and the teacher started rapidly across the campus he was of course in his bare feet and was finding his pajamas anything but warm in this frosty fall air  you cant get in that way less you have a key called out horsehair  i have no key and job haskers stopped abruptly  i can let ye in the back way  that will do come let us hurryi am getting cold  the back door was gained and job haskers entered and felt his way up the semidark stairs as he reached the upper hallway he found himself confronted by doctor clay who had come in rather late and who had been on the point of retiring when certain strange sounds had disturbed him and caused him to start an investigation  why mr haskers where have you been asked the doctor in astonishment i heard a noise but i did not know you were stirring  ieri imagined some of the students were skylarking faltered the assistant  did you catch anybody  no sirthey were too slick for me  this skylarking after hours must cease have you any idea who they were  noterexactly i had some trouble early in the evening with porter lawrence and morr and they may be the ones if you please ill take a look in their room  do so and if anything is wrong have them report to me in the morning said doctor clay and retired once more to his room  moving swiftly through the hallway job haskers reached his own room and threw open the door he made a light and gazed around in great perplexity everything was in perfect order excepting the bedclothes which were just as he had left them he walked slowly to the window and drew in the rope that was used for a fire escape  strange strange he murmured to himself as he scratched his head i was sure the bed moved can i have been dreaming after all i ate a rather heavy supper and my digestion is not as good as it used to be  he put on his slippers and donned a dressing gown and thus arrayed sallied forth once more this time in the direction of the dormitory occupied by dave and his chums he approached on tiptoe and opened the door quickly and noiselessly  but the students had had ample time in which to get to bed and every one was under covers and apparently sleeping soundly to make sure they were not shamming the teacher came in and gazed at one after another closely then with a face that was a study he left the dormitory again and walked slowly to his own room  is he gone asked a voice in the dormitory after a full minute of silence  yes phil answered dave but dont make any noisehe may come back  say that was the richest joke yet chuckled ben  how he must have looked sliding down that rope in his pajamas exclaimed sam  if i dared id really send in a theme tomorrow on earthquakes piped up polly vane  do it polly i dare you cried macklin  i willif youll let me sign your name to it answered the girlish student but at this chip shook his head vigorously  ill bet old haskers is as mad as a hornet was phils comment well it served him right for the way he treated us he added  i guess we neednt go to the doctor tomorrow with any complaint said the senators son we have squared up  id like to know what haskers really thinks of the shaking up said dave and then he turned over to go to sleep and the others did likewise  the feast and the fun had tired the boys out and the majority of them slept soundly until the rising bell rang out dave was the first to kick the covers aside and get up but ben followed immediately  grand day dave cried ben running to the window to gaze out what a fine day to go nutting if we could get away  nothing but lessons today ben answered dave he was bending down looking under the bed has anybody seen my shoes he continued looking from one to another  i havent seen them answered roger he bent down to get out his own foot coverings hello my shoes are gone too he cried  so are mine exclaimed plum  and mine came quickly from several of the other boys  did anybody put them in the closets asked dave  if they did they are not here now answered ben who had entered one of the closets to look  a hasty search was made the boys looking into every place they could think ofbut all to no purpose every shoe every boot and every slipper belonging to them had disappeared     chapter xiii  in which some shoes are missing   what do you think of it  who took them  we cant go downstairs in our bare feet  such were some of the remarks made as the lads of dormitories nos 11 and 12 looked at each other the closets had been searched thoroughly but without success  see here if anybody in these rooms hid those shoes i want to know it demanded sam gazing around sharply  i hardly think a fellow would hide his own shoes too answered luke  he mightjust to hide his own guilt  i believe this is the work of some outsider declared dave most likely nat poole and his crowd  by jove dave i believe you are right exclaimed phil it would be just like them to do it if they got the chance  did you say nat poole queried shadow scratching his head thoughtfully  i did most likely nat heard of our feast and it made him extra sore to think we were having a good time and he wasnt invited  that is true and i guess shadow stopped short and a curious look crossed his face  what is it shadow do you know anything of this asked roger  why ierthat is i had a dream last night stammered the storyteller of the school or maybe it wasnt a dream after all he went on in confusion  see here shadow have you been sleepwalking again and did you make off with our shoes demanded phil he remembered only too well how poor shadow was addicted to walking in his sleep and how he had once walked off with a valuable collection of rare postage stamps belonging to doctor clay  ii dont think so stammered shadow and got as red as a beet but i had a queer dream i forgot about it at first but now it comes back to me i somehow dreamed that somebody came into this room and bent over me while i was in bed and then picked up something i started to stop himand then i went sound asleep again  who was the person questioned polly vane  i dont know  see here shadow ill wager a new necktie that you walked off with our shoes declared sam and if you did please be kind enough to tell us where you put them  oh sam i reallyi dont think i did stammered the sleepwalker in much confusion  the feast must have been too much for you and it set you to sleepwalking said roger now just see if you cant remember where you went with the shoes  the whole bunch must have made quite a loadall one fellow could carry said luke  yes and hed have to put them in a box or a sheet at that added plum  try to think real hard suggested roger  if he did it it is funny that he took his own shoes too remarked dave  poor shadow was so confused he did not know what to say or do he sat on the edge of the bed the picture of despair  ii thought i was all over sleepwalking he murmured the doctor at home was treating me all summer  one thing is certainwe cant stay up here all morning burst out the senators son im going to borrow a pair of shoes somewhere  so am i added dave well hunt for the missing shoes later on  say burst out shadow half desperately youyou wont tell doctor clay about this will you  not if you did it without knowing it shadow answered dave promptly  i wont say a word answered plum  ii dont know if i did it or not went on shadow his face as red as ever i didnt know i took those postage stamps and those class pins that time but if i did take emand we dont find emill buy new shoes for all hands if it takes every dollar i can scrape up  the boys donned their clothing and then went on a tour of some of the other dormitories thus several borrowed shoes while the others had to be content with slippers and foot coverings usually worn on the athletic field  not very elegant remarked phil as he gazed at the slippers he had borrowed but any port in a storm as the sailors say i hope we get our shoes back  so do i phil returned dave but if shadow went off with them he may have gone a long distance remember he carried those postage stamps away up the river and used a rowboat to do it maybe he rowed off with our foot coverings  he doesnt act as if he was tiredand he would be tired if he went very far with the shoes why we didnt get to sleep until about one oclock or halfpast  i know that it certainly is a mystery  with several of the boys appearing at breakfast wearing slippers the secret of what had happened could not very well be kept and it soon was whispered around that nos 11 and 12 had been cleaned out of shoes boots and slippers during the night and that shadow was suspected of having walked again in his sleep his chums tried to hush the matter up yet enough was said to make the storyteller of the school thoroughly uncomfortable  id give ten dollars to locate those shoes said shadow to dave later on  so would i answered dave we can make a hunt after school  half a dozen of the students joined in the search for the missing foot coverings and the lads looked high and low but without success  only one place more that i know of said dave that is the old granary  i dont think they can be there but we can look said shadow  the old granary was a building located behind some of the carriage sheds it had once held grain but was now used for the storage of garden implements the lads found the door unlocked and pushing it open they entered and gazed around in the semidarkness  i dont see much that looks like shoes remarked roger  ill strike a light said dave and did so the match flared up and as it did so several uttered cries  there they are over in the corner  we have found them at last  light a lantern and see said phil and a stable lantern was quickly procured and lit then the boys worked their way around a mower and a harrow and some other farming implements to where they had seen the shoes  sold  these are a lot of old stuff thrown away long ago  it was truethe shoes they had located were worn out and covered with mildew shadow kicked them savagely  what a selland just after i was sure we had found them he muttered  heavy at heart the students left the granary and put away the lantern they had exhausted their resources and walked back to the school in a decidedly sober mood  well all i can offer is this said shadow at last each of you buy new shoes and slippers and turn the bills over to meand ill pay them as quickly as i can  dont you bother about my shoes shadow said dave kindly i can get others easily enough  so can i added roger and phil  but i would like to really know whether you walked off with them in your sleep or if this is some trick of our rivals continued dave  you dont want to know any more than i do declared the sleepwalker  there seemed no help for it and the next day all the boys paid a visit to oakdale and purchased new shoes they did not bother with slippers or boots thinking that sooner or later the missing foot coverings would turn up the shoe dealer was all attention for never before had he had such a rush of trade  dave phil and roger got fitted first and with their purchases under their arms they quitted the shoe shop and strolled up the main street of the town  there are some girls we know cried the senators son presently and pointed across the way coming in their direction were mary feversham and vera rockwell two girls who lived in that vicinity and who had come to the lads school entertainment the year before vera had a brother with whom the senators son was well acquainted  why how do you do cried mary as the boys crossed the street and tipped their caps so you are all back at school eh  i thought you must be back added vera giving all a warm smile  yes we are back answered dave how have you been since we saw you last  very well indeed answered vera and how did you like it on the ranch we heard you had turned into regular cowboys  hardly that said dave but we went in for broncobusting and roundingup and all that  somebody said you had some trouble with cattle thieves went on vera  oh vera dont mention that cried mary and blushed a little  why shouldnt we demanded the other girl i dont believe those stories and i think mr porter and his friends ought to know what is being said  what is being said repeated roger  yes  who is talking about us demanded phil  mr merwellthe young man who used to go to oak hall he goes to rockville military academy now  and what did he say questioned dave  oh he said a great many thingsnot to me but to some girls i know he said all of you had gotten mixed up with some cattle thieves and had tried to get out of the trouble by blaming him but that he and his father had made you stop talking about him  well if that doesnt take the cake exclaimed phil isnt that merwell to a t  the shoe was on the other foot explained roger merwell was the one who was mixed up in the affair and he and his father had to pay for a lot of horses thatwell disappeared we exposed him and that is what made him mad  did mr merwell steal some horses asked vera in alarm  not exactlyaccording to his story answered dave he says he took them in fun then the regular cattle thieves took them from himand let him have some money he claimed that he was going to return the horses but didnt get the chance  and he and his father had to pay for the horses in the end  yesthey paid mr endicott the owner of the ranch at which we were stopping  then i guess link merwell was guilty said mary and after this i dont want him to even speak to mehe or that friend of his mr nick jasniff  youll do well to steer clear of the pair warned roger  it is a shame that they are allowed to talk about you as they do said vera if they keep on they will give you a very bad name  i dont believe folks in rockville will believe much of what jasniff says said phil theyll remember his evildoings of the past  he and merwell seem to have made themselves popular at the academy was marys reply how they have done it i dont know but perhaps they have money or else  the girl did not finish for just then an automobile swung around the corner and came to a halt in front of a store near which the young people had halted the automobile contained merwell jasniff and two other students of the academy all attired in the cadet uniforms of that institution     chapter xiv  what the girls had to tell   one of the strange cadets was driving the automobile and hardly had it come to a stop when merwell and jasniff bounded out on the sidewalk directly in front of dave and his friends  whyerhello stammered jasniff and then recognizing the girls he grinned broadly and tipped his cap  how do you do said merwell to mary and vera and at the same time ignoring dave and his chums  the two girls stared in astonishment for they had not expected to see the very lads about whom they had been conversing but they quickly recovered and turned their backs on the newcomers  whats the matterdont you want to speak to me demanded jasniff a sickly look overspreading his face  i assuredly do not mr jasniff answered vera stiffly  and i suppose you dont want to speak to me either came sourly from link merwell  you are right mr merwelli do not  after this you will please us best by not recognizing us added mary coldly  oh i see how it isthese chaps have been filling you up with stories about us cried merwell roughly well if you want to believe them you can do it i dont care and he turned on his heel and entered a nearby store  some day youll wish you hadnt made such friends of porter  company said jasniff and he glared defiantly at dave and his chums maybe youll find that they are not just what you thought they were and having thus delivered himself he too entered the store in the meantime the automobile had gone on along the street to the postoffice where the two strange cadets went in to see about mail  say i think ill lay for merwell and jasniff and began phil when a warning pinch on his arm from dave caused him to break off  there was an awkward pause neither the boys nor the girls knowing exactly what to say or do  well we must be going said vera i promised to be home by dark  and i have some errands to do before i go back added mary so well say goodby  i hope we meet again remarked phil  maybe well come to some of your football games ventured vera i did so enjoy some of those other games  we are not playing on the eleven this season answered dave it gave him a little pang to make the admission  oh is that so both of the girls gave the boys a studied look well we must be going and then they hurried down the street around a corner and out of sight  fellows we ought to lay for those chaps cried roger as soon as the chums were alone  just what i was going to suggest broke in phil  what good will it do asked dave we cant make anything out of merwell and jasniff by talking and we dont want to start a fight  id like to duck em in a mud pond muttered the shipowners son it is what they deserve  they deserve tar and feathers was rogers comment why in some places theyd be run out of town how they ever got into rockville academy i cant understand  money sometimes goes a great way said dave they may have literally bought their way inthat is their parents may have done it for them  the three students had passed to the other side of the street now they looked down the highway and saw the automobile go around a corner in the direction of rockville but the machine soon came to a halt again although they did not know it  well i am going to lay them out for taking that boat anyway said the senators son  ditto here added phil  physically or mentally queried dave with something of a smile  bothif its necessary returned the shipowners son promptly it was easy to see he was spoiling for a fight  i am going to see what they are doing said roger after another minute had passed maybe they wont come out until they think we have gone away  he recrossed the street and peered through one of the show windows of the store then of a sudden he made a rapid motion for his chums to join him  they are going out by a back way he cried the sneaks they intend to give us the slip  they shant do it exclaimed phil come on and he set off on a run with the others at his heels they turned one corner and then another and soon reached an alleyway between two houses located on a street behind the store here they plumped squarely into merwell and jasniff each with a bundle under his arm  so this is the way you sneak away eh demanded phil  sneak away blustered merwell not at allwe were only taking a short cut aint that so nick  sure answered jasniff loudly we dont have to sneak away from anybody  weve a good mind to give you both a sound thrashing cried phil angrily you had no business to touch our boat  and you had no business to talk about us to miss feversham and miss rockwell added the senators son  see here you let us pass muttered merwell dont you dare to lay your fingers on us and he tried to edge to one side  see here both of you said dave sternly i want to give you a final warning you have been talking about us i know it and it is useless for you to deny it now i want you to understand this if you say another word against me or against phil or roger ill see to it that you are exposed to every student at rockville academy  you wont dare cried jasniff his voice trembled a little as he spoke  i will dare nick jasniff i know what you areand i know what link merwell isand i dont propose to stand any more of your underhanded work now you have your last warningand if you are wise youll heed it  say do you want to fight roared jasniff coming forward and sticking his chin close to daves face  i can defend myself jasniffeven when a fellow tried to take a foul advantage of me as you did that time in the gym  bah always ringing that in i only swung the indian club to scare you i can fight with my fists  well remember what i said jasniff its my last warning  oh come onthey make me sick cried link merwell a certain nervous tremor in his voice we dont want to listen to their hot air and plucking his crony by the arm he hurried out of the alleyway into the street  shall we let em go dave whispered phil id just as soon pound em good  if we did that phil theyd claim we were three to two and took an unfair advantage of them let them go they have their final warning and if they dont heed itwell they will have to take the consequences  i could hardly keep my hands off of merwell  i felt the same way said roger he deserves all we could give him  the three chums watched merwell and jasniff turn another corner they expected to see the pair walk to where the automobile was standing but instead noted that the two cadets entered the oakdale hotel  must be going to see somebody suggested phil  or else they have gone in to smoke and drink and play pool added roger youll remember merwell liked to drink he was the one who did his best to lead gus plum astray  yes i remember that answered dave i am mighty glad gus and he are keeping apart  the three students walked past the hotel and looking in at an open window saw jasniff and merwell talking to a man who sat in the reading room with a newspaper in his hands  why that is that hooker montgomery exclaimed roger the fake doctor who sells those patent medicines  wed better not let him see us or hell be wanting a new silk hat from us murmured phil and he grinned as he thought of what had occurred on the road on the day of their arrival at oak hall  i wonder if jasniff met him at dunns on the river said dave that is what the letter requested youll remember  wonder what business jasniff was to aid him in queried the shipowners son  maybe jasniff is going to help him to dispose of some of his marvelous remedies suggested roger i reckon he could give the ignorant farmers as good a talk about them as montgomery himself  more than likely since montgomery is a very ignorant man answered dave  the other fellows ought to be ready to go back to school by this time said the senators son after watching those in the hotel for a minute let us hunt them up and thus for the time being jasniff merwell and doctor montgomery were dismissed from their minds the meeting at the hotel was an important one to our friends as well as to those who participated but how important dave and his chums did not learn until long afterwards  it was a comical sight to see the boys of dormitories nos 11 and 12 walking back to the hall each with a shoe box under his arm sam day led the procession carrying his box up against his forearm like a sword  shoulder boxes he shouted gayly forward march and then he added boom boom boom boom boom in imitation of a bassdrum  weve got boxes enough to last us for a year of picnics cried ben for in crumville as in many other places shoe boxes were frequently used for packing up picnic lunches  say that puts me in mind of a story put in shadow eagerly a girl who was going to get married had a shower as they call em well a wag of the townmaybe he was sore because he couldnt marry the girl himselftold all his friends in private that she was very anxious to get a nice breadbox the shower was to be a surprise and it was too for when it came off the girl got exactly eleven breadboxes  oh came in a groan the worst yet  not so bad said dave dryly if she filled the boxes the married pair must have proved a wellbred couple  hark to that roared phil say dave go and take a roll  when it comes to a joke dave is the flower of this flock was lukes comment  anyway he takes the cake murmured ben  ben say something dont loaf on the job came from the senators son  a joke like that is pie for roger murmured polly vane  even so nobody has a right to get crusty murmured plum  or pious continued dave and then shadow made a pass for him with a shoe box then roger started to run and the others came after him and away they went in a merry bunch along the road leading to oak hall soon they came out at a point where the highway ran along the leming river and there halted to rest for the run had deprived some of them of their wind  i hear a motorboat said roger wonder if it is nat pooles craft  it is answered plum here he comes right close to shore  the river was a good fifteen feet below the level of the roadway and gazing down through the bushes lining the waters edge the students beheld nat pooles motorboat gliding along in a zigzag fashion nat was not in the craft which was evidently running without an occupant     chapter xv  a runaway motorboat   what do you make of that  the motorboat must have run away from nat  either that or nat has fallen overboard  maybe nat has been drowned  these and other remarks were made as the boys on the highway gazed down at the craft that was speeding along in such an erratic fashion over the surface of the river a closer look confirmed their first opinion that nobody was on board  im going to try to stop her shouted dave and ran back along the highway and disappeared into the bushes roger followed him closely and some of the others trailed behind  i am going up the riverto see if i can find nat shouted phil and away he sped and sam and ben went along  it was no easy matter for dave to work his way down the bank of the stream the bushes were thick and the footing uncertain and once his jacket caught on a root and he had to pause to free himself but at last he came out on a narrow strip of rocks and sand at a point where the leming river made a broad turn  the water at this point was quite shallow and here he thought the progress of the motorboat would be stayed his surmise was correct the craft bringing up between several smooth rocks the engine continued to work pounding the boat back and forth and threatening to sink her  fortunately dave had on a pair of gaiters he had borrowed and they were so big that he slipped them off with ease his socks followed and then he rolled up his trousers to his knees and waded into the stream  be careful or youll slip and hurt yourself on the rocks sang out the senators son  im watching out returned dave  he was leaping from one smooth stone to another keeping in the shallow spots as much as possible thus he managed to get within a few yards of the motorboat  as he came closer he saw that the craft was pounding on the rocks worse than before the pounding had in some way moved the gasoline control forward and also advanced the spark and the engine was practically running wild  i hope she isnt getting ready to blow up thought the youth and he gazed anxiously ahead smoke was issuing from the motorboat coming from some overheated oil  he leaped to the next high rock and then plunged boldly forward soon gaining the bow of the craft at the stern the propeller was churning the water into a white foam the craft was trembling violently and the hum of the machinery gave full evidence of the power it was exerting  fortunately daves knowledge of gasoline engines now stood him in good stead and without the loss of a second he turned off the supply of gasoline and the electric spark and thus allowed the engine to die as the propeller slowed up and stopped the water behind the craft calmed down and then the pounding on the rocks was reduced to a gentle rub that did little but scratch the paint  is she all right dave called out roger who stood on the rocks of the bank watching proceedings with great interest  i think so although it hasnt done the engine any good to run wild shes pretty well heated up and the cylinders may be carbonized or something like that  what are you going to dotry to run her in here  no ill not take the risk i only wanted to stop the engine and get rid of the risk of the boat blowing up  you ran a big risk doing it she looked to me as if she might go up any instant  she cant get out of herethe current holds her went on dave she will be perfectly safe until nat comes for her id like to know where he is  phil and some of the others went off to see  to save the boat as much as possible dave took two of the wooden gratings of the flooring and tied them to ropes hanging over the sides in this position they acted as fenders so that the rocks rubbed against the gratings instead of the boat proper  i am afraid hell have quite a job of it getting her out into the stream said dave on coming ashore and when he was putting on his socks and the gaiters shell have to back out against the current and do a lot of turning  maybe hell have to get somebody to tow him outwith a very long line returned roger  if only nat didnt fall overboard said dave  in the meantime phil and some of the others had run up the stream a distance as they turned a point where there were several small islands the shipowners son set up a shout  there is nat now  whatever is he doing queried ben  swimming ashore or trying to wade answered sam  the boys on the shore came down to the waters edge and watched nat poole with interest he was floundering around in water up to his waist sometimes he would come up on a rock and then slip and pitch headlong but he kept on until he was but a few yards away  hi nat whats the matter called out phil did you fall overboard  helhelp me chattered the unfortunate one and now the others realized that he was suffering greatly from the cold dondont let mmeggggo down  well help you answered phil promptly and ran out on some dry rocks to a point close to poor nat come give me your hand and ill pull you up  so will i added ben who had come behind the shipowners son  the suffering youth was only too glad to have somebody come to his aid and he put up both hands and those on the rocks hauled him up and then aided him to get to a safe spot on shore he was shivering from head to feet and his teeth chattered so that he could hardly speak  i wawant ttto get where it is wawawarm chattered nat that wawater is lilike iiiice  take off your wet coat said phil kindly here you can have mine ive got a sweater on and he passed over the garment  nat was glad enough to don something dry and the exchange was quickly made  if youll take my advice youll make a run of it to the nearest farmhouse and warm up said ben if you dont you may take your death of cold  ii wiwill answered nat  ill go with you there is a farmhouse just down the road a bit  well go back to where we left dave and the others said phil they were after your boat he explained  did ththey ststop hhher  i dont know we saw her in the river running wild how did it happen  i was fifixing the rudder liline at the stststern when all of a susudden we hit a rrrock or something and i wewent overboard answered nat before i cocould ggget back the bbboat got away from mmme  dave and some others went after the boat we saw it running by itself among the rocks  nat was too cold to pay attention just then to what had become of his property he ran as fast as he could to the farmhouse and there was taken in and allowed to dry himself in front of the fire and was given a cup of hot tea in the meantime phil rejoined dave and roger and told how the moneylenders son had been found  it was after the supperhour when all of the boys got back to oak hall and job haskers was on the point of reading them a lecture and forcing them to do without supper when doctor clay appeared to the master of the school the lads related their story and he at once excused them for their tardiness and told them to go directly to the diningroom while he ordered lemond to get out the school coach and go after nat  poole can be glad he was not drowned said the doctor it was nice of you to stop the engine of his boat but after this i want all of you to be more careful i do not want to lose any of my boys and the look he gave them went to the heart of every lad present  what a difference between him and old haskers murmured phil  id give as much as a dollar to have haskers leave added sam  i reckon every fellow in the school would chip in a dollar for that was plums comment  when nat got in he was sent at once to his room to change all of his clothes and was then given a hot supper which made him feel quite like himself later on he questioned dave about the motorboat and said he would try to get the craft from among the rocks the next day hiring a professional boatman to assist him he did not thank dave for his aid nor did he thank phil and the others  i guess it isnt in him to thank anybody was bens comment nat is one of the kind who thinks only of himself  he will have a hard time of it getting his boat said dave and so it proved it took half a day to get the craft from among the rocks and then it was found that she leaked so badly she had to be sent to a boatbuilder for repairs  that saturday was the day scheduled for the football game with lemington as nat could not take the eleven to that town in his motorboat as promised the school carryall was pressed into service this made some of the other students who had arranged to go in the carryall find other means of conveyance and there was considerable grumbling  poole said he would take em in the motorboat growled one student he ought to have seen to it that his boat was repaired on time  the old guard football eleven all had bicycles or motorcycles and they went to the lemington athletic grounds in a body on their wheels all carried the school colors and many also had horns and rattles  well show em that we can root for oak hall even if we are not on the eleven declared dave  job haskers took but little interest in athletics declaring he thought too much time was wasted over field sports but andrew dale was keenly alive to what was going on he knew all about the trouble in the football organization and he watched the departure of dave and his chums with interest  arent you going mr dale asked dave  oh yes i am going in the carriage with doctor clay do you think we shall win porter  well win if rooting can do it cried dave  then you intend to root as you call it  yes sirwe are going to root for all we are worth  i am glad to know it answered andrew dale and then he turned away to attend to some school duties later on when he and the doctor were on the way to the game he mentioned the trouble in the football club and told how dave and his chums had been left out in the cold and how dave and the others were now going to cheer for and encourage the school eleven  fine grand murmured the master of the school his eye lighting up with pleasure that is the proper school spirit it does porter morr and the others great credit  exactly what i think doctor answered the first assistant many players would have remained away altogether or gone to the game to throw cold water on the efforts of those on the gridiron it shows a manliness that cannot be excelled  yes yes murmured doctor clay a fine lot of boys truly a fine lot it seems a pity they were forced off the team  perhaps theyll be backbefore the football season is over answered andrew dale gravely  what do you mean dale  perhaps the football eleven will need them and be glad to get them back     chapter xvi  a struggle on the gridiron   when dave and his chums reached the athletic grounds they found the grandstand and the bleachers about half filled with people the lemington contingent had a good number of rooters and they were already filling the air with their cries of encouragement the boys looked around but saw nothing of vera rockwell or mary feversham  maybe they didnt think it worth while to come suggested the senators son  no rockville fellows here either said phil they play an eleven from elmwood this afternoon  the lemington players were already on the field and it was seen that they were rather light in weight only the fullback being of good size  our eleven has the advantage in weight said roger but i rather fancy those fellows are swift  yes and they may be tricky added ben  as soon as dave and his chums were seated dave gave the signal and the oak hall cheer was given then followed another cheer for the school eleven with a tooting of horns and a clacking of wooden rattles  mercy but those oak hall students can make a noise exclaimed one girl sitting close by  that is what they call rooting answered her friend isnt it lovely  perfectly delicious they ought to win if they shout like that  guy frapley heard the racket and walked over to the spot from whence it proceeded he was astonished beyond measure to see dave leading off yelling at the top of his lungs and waving a rattle in one hand and the school colors in the other  what do you think of that he asked of nat poole  oh porter and his crowd want to make out they dont feel stung over being out of it grumbled nat  but they are rooting harder than anybody  theyll be glad to see us lose  we are not going to lose  i didnt say we were answered nat and walked away somehow it made him angry to see dave and his chums cheering and in such an earnest manner he would have been better satisfied had dave acted grouchy or stayed away from the game  the game was to be of two halves of thirty minutes each with ten minutes intermission oak hall won the tossup and as there was no wind and no choice of goals they kept the ball and lemington took the south end of the gridiron  now then here is where oak hall wins cried dave loudly do your level best fellows  shove her over the line first thing added roger  oak hall oak hall yelled phil now then all together in the game  under the inspiration of the cheering oak hall made a fine kickoff and by some spirited work carried the pigskin well down into the lemington territory but then the ball was lost by nat poole and the opposing eleven brought it back to the center of the gridiron and then rushed it up to the thirtyyard line of the school  thats the way to do it yelled a lemington supporter youve got em going  send it back yelled dave all together for oak hall and this cry was taken up by a hundred throats  guy frapley got the ball a minute later and made a really fine run around the lemington left end this brought the pigskin again to center and there it remained for nearly five minutes the downs on both sides availing little or nothing a scrimmage followed in which one lemington player was injured and he accused one of the oak hall fellows a new player named bemis of foul play this protest was sustained and bemis was retired and another new player named cardell was substituted  five minutes more was the cry and again both elevens went at it dave suddenly saw the captain of the lemingtons make a certain sign to some of his men  they are up to some trick he cried to his chums and hardly had he spoken when the ball went into play through center and across to the left end it was picked up like a flash passed to the quarterback who was on the watch for it and carried toward the oak hall line with a rush  a touchdown for lemington  thats the way to do it  now higgins make it a goal  amid a wild cheering the pigskin was brought out for the kick and the goal was made  thats the way to do it  now for another touchdown  again the pigskin was brought into play but while it was still near the center of the field the whistle blew and the first half of the game came to an end  score lemington 6 oak hall 0  it must be confessed that it was a sorrylooking eleven that straggled into the oak hall dressingroom to discuss the situation  you want more snap cried john rand the manager  they put up a trick on us grumbled nat they got that touchdown by a fluke  well i wish we could make one in the same way retorted rand since being elected manager he had had anything but an easy task of it to make the eleven pull together some of the old players wanted dave roger phil and the others back and threatened to leave unless a change was made  this looks as if oak hall was out of it whispered phil to his chums during the intermission  oh i dont know returned dave a touchdown and a goal isnt such a wonderful lead  at the beginning of the second half it was seen that guy frapley and his fellowplayers were determined to do something if they could but they were excited and wild and the captain could do little to hold them in several times they got confused on the signals and once one of the new ends lost the ball on a fumble that looked almost childish inside of ten minutes amid a mad yelling from the lemington supporters the ball was forced over the oak hall line for another touchdown and another goal was kicked then five minutes later came a goal from the field  hurrah thats the way to do it yelled a lemington supporter  fifteen to nothing cried another thought oak hall knew how to play football  they ought to play some primary school kids  you shut up screamed nat poole in sudden rage we know what we are doing  you ought to be an icemanyoure slow enough retorted the lemingtonite and this brought forth a laugh and made nat madder than ever  again the ball was placed in play and this time oak hall did all it could to hold its own but it was of no avail lemington carried the air of victory with it and its confidence could not be withstood again the ball was shoved over the line for a touchdown and again the goal was kicked amid a cheering that was deafening  its a slaughter murmured roger  i am afraid so answered dave too bad i am sorry for the school  so am i said the senators son and phil and ben nodded gravely  the last five minutes of the game only served to rub it in as shadow expressed it for lemington scored again this time however failing to kick the goal when the whistle blew the pigskin was on the oak hall twentyfive yard line  final score lemington 26 oak hall 0  it is perhaps needless to state that the local supporters yelled and cheered and blew their horns and clacked their rattles until they were exhausted it was a great victory for in the past oak hall had been a formidable rival on the gridiron the eleven cheered for oak hall and were cheered in return and then the visitors got out of sight as quickly as possible  a bitter defeat truly said doctor clay while driving back to the school our boys did not seem to play together at all  it was very ragged work answered andrew dale but it is no more than i expected from what i saw in the practice games our eleven will be able to do but little unless it improves wonderfully  i believe you dale dont youahthink they would do better if porter and morr and lawrence were in the lineup  i certainly do but they have been voted out so i was told  ahem doctor clay grew thoughtful what does mr dodsworth think about it the party he mentioned was the gymnastic teacher who took quite an interest in football although not officially  he thinks porter morr lawrence and plum ought to be put back on the eleven he says it is a shame that they were put off in the first place  i believe our school is to play rockville academy next  yes and i just got a message over the telephone that rockville won from elmwood this afternoon twelve to four i know elmwood has a strong eleven so rockville must be extra good this season  exactly so and that means if our eleven is not greatly strengthened before we meet rockville we shall suffer another defeat responded the master of oak hall rubbing his chin reflectively  more than likely sir  too bad in these days some folks think football and baseball quite as importantahemasersome studies it is a wrong idea assuredlyyet iahemi think it would be a very good thing if we could show the world that our students can play football as well as do other things  football is a great thing at yale harvard and princeton doctor  yes indeed i remember well how i used to witness those stirring games and how i would yell with the rest why dale one year we had a quarterback that was a corker they couldnt stop him he got the pigskin and skinned down the field like a blue streak andbut ahem that is past history now finished the doctor bringing himself back to his usual dignity but i must look into this football matter more closely he added with a speculative sigh  poole frapley and their crowd had arranged for a banquet that night and many others of oak hall had gathered boxes and barrels for bonfires the banquet was a tame affair and not a single fire was lighted  we are having frost early this year said luke dryly  yes it came on suddenly this afternoon added shadow  ill wager you will hear something drop in the football team before long went on luke the school wont stand for such work as we had today  who is to blame  rand frapley bemis and nat poole  then they better resign  just what i say  during the evening the talk throughout the school was largely about the game and nearly every player was severely criticised it was agreed that bemis had acted in a thoroughly unsportsmanlike manner and he was told that he would have to resign and he agreed to do so it was also agreed by the students generally that of the new players guy frapley had done the best work  give him proper support and he would be all right said dave but in my opinion the eleven as it now stands will never win a victory  and that is what i think too added roger     chapter xvii  reorganizing the eleven   on monday morning the students of oak hall were treated to a surprise directly after chapel service doctor clay came forward to make an address he first spoke about the good work that the pupils were generally speaking doing and then branched off about the football game and the poor exhibition made on the gridiron  in the past i have not thought it proper for the head of this institution to take part in your football and baseball games contenting myself with giving you an instructor in the gymnasium alone he continued but i find that these sports now play a more or less prominent part in all boarding schools and colleges and that being so i have thought it wise to embrace all field sports in the gymnasium department consequently from today your football elevens your baseball nines and your track athletics and in fact all your sports will be held under the supervision and direction of mr dodsworth your gymnasium instructor he will be assisted by mr dale who as you all know was once a leading college football and baseball player these two gentlemen will aid you in reorganizing your football eleven and will do all in their power to give to oak hall the victories you all desire  this announcement came as a bombshell to rand frapley poole and their cohorts and it was equally surprising to all of the others who had played on the eleven  that means a shakingup for us all right said one of the players i can see somebody getting fired already  do you suppose they intend to take the management away from me and rand demanded frapley i dont think that is fair rand was made manager by a popular vote  if they want me to resign ill do it snapped the manager he had been so severely criticised that he was growing tired of it  its a shame that we cant run our club to suit ourselves grumbled nat poole if the teachers are going to do it maybe they had better do the playing too  well theyd play a heap sight better than you did nat was the remark of another student  doctor clays announcement created such a stir that the students could think of little else during the day all felt that from henceforth football baseball and track athletics would become a regular part of the institution  in the afternoon a notice was posted up in the hall and in the gymnasium calling a special meeting of all who were interested in the football organization the meeting was called for tuesday afternoon at four oclock and the call was signed by mr dodsworth and mr dale  they are not going to let any grass grow under their feet remarked the senators son as he and dave read the notice  shall you go to the meeting roger  of course and you must go too dave i know mr dale and mr dodsworth want all the fellows to be there  following the posting of the notice came word that rand had resigned the management of the eleven and then came another notice calling for the election of a new manager  let us put up henry fordham again suggested phil that is if he is willing to run  the football meeting was attended by nearly every student of oak hall the gymnasium meeting room being literally packed the only youth who was absent was john rand  mr dale called the meeting to order and made a neat speech in which he advised the lads to act soberly and accordingly to their best judgment he said the football game with lemington had proved a great disappointment and he sincerely trusted that the reorganized eleven would be able to lead the school to nothing but victories he added that as rand had resigned they would first proceed to the election of a new manager and then the rearranging of the eleven would be begun under the direction of mr dodsworth and himself  the teacher had scarcely finished his speech when guy frapley was on his feet  mr dale i wish to say something he almost shouted as everybody here knows i am the captain of the football eleven what i want to know is whether i am to be the captain of the eleven or not if i am to be nothing but a figurehead why id rather get out  it was an aggressive almost brutal manner of expressing himself and it produced an uproar  put him out  make him resign  tell him he has got to behave himself and make good  boys young gentlemen we must have quietness cried andrew dale raising his hand and then he rapped for order  ill resign shouted guy frapley when he could be heard i dont want anything more to do with the old team anyway and in a rage he forced his way out of the gymnasium several of his friends tried to get him to return but without avail  the departure of frapley brought about a semblance of order and presently the gymnasium instructor got up to talk what he said was directly to the point he said that he had prepared a list of names of former football players of oak hall with a record of the work of each individual this list would be used in making up the reorganized team  thats the talk cried one student thats the commonsense way of going at it  merit is what counts every time added another  when a vote was taken for a new manager henry fordham was elected almost unanimously in accepting the new manager stated that he was glad he was going to have the assistance of mr dale and mr dodsworth and he hoped that from now on the club would pull together and pile up nothing but victories this speech was well received and loudly applauded  then the list of football players of past seasons was read dave was placed at the top of the list with phil plum roger and sam following in the order named nat pooles name was sixteenth much to his disgust  i suppose that means that i cant play on the eleven he growled  you may become a substitute answered mr dodsworth  not much if i cant play on the eleven i know what ill doill pack my trunk and go home  do it right away shouted a voice from the rear of the room  youll never be missed poole added another  all right ill leave shouted poole purple with rage and then he left the meeting as abruptly as guy frapley had done at the door he shook his fist at the crowd you just waitill fix oak hall for this he added sourly  how foolish murmured luke nat will never make any friends by acting like that  do you think hell leave oak hall questioned another boy  perhapsif his father will let him  following the departure of nat poole came the reorganizing of the football eleven dave was placed in the position he had occupied the year before and phil roger sam and plum followed of those who had played against lemington only five were retainedthose who had been on the eleven one and two years previous all the other players were told they would have to enter the scrub team for a tryout for the substitute bench  it filled daves heart with pleasure to get back in his old position he was unanimously chosen as captain of the eleven and he called for some practice every afternoon that weeka call that was indorsed by mr dodsworth mr dale and the new manager  we have got to get right down to businessif we want to beat rockville said dave to the others i understand they put up a stiff game with elmwood if we are beaten all the fellows who were put off the eleven will have the laugh on us  well do our best cried the senators son  its a good thing we organized the old guard said phil that kept us in fine condition  practice commenced in earnest the next day and was kept up every afternoon under the supervision of mr dale and the gymnasium instructor mr dodsworth perfected the eleven in signal work and andrew dale showed them how to work several trick plays used effectively by the college he had attended  many of the students wondered what guy frapley nat poole and john rand would do on the day following the reorganization of the football eleven all three students sent telegrams to their parents and received replies the next day rand and frapley left oak hall and announced that they were going to rockville military academy nat poole had wanted to go too but aaron poole would not permit it for the reason that he had paid for nats board and tuition in advance and he was not the man to sacrifice one cent by such a move later on he wrote a letter stating that he didnt believe in any such foolishness as football anyway and nat had better settle down to his studies and get some good of the money that was being spent on him this letter angered nat exceedingly but he could do nothing without his parents consent and so he settled down as best he could  i shouldnt wonder if rand and frapley become cronies of merwell and jasniff said dave to phil and so it provedthe four became quite intimate and all of them vowed that sooner or later they would settle accounts with dave for the trouble he and his chums had caused them the ringleader of the four was nick jasniff and he resolved to do something that would put dave in the deepest kind of disgrace not to expose himself he matured his plans slowly and with great caution  although dave was doing all in his power to make the football eleven a good one he was not permitted to devote all his spare time to that organization oak hall as my old readers know boasted of a secret organization known as the gee eyes those words standing for the initials g and i which in their turn stood for the words guess it dave and his chums were all members of this society which was kept up mainly for the fun of initiating new members  the gee eyes meet tonight dave said buster beggs on friday morning big affairinitiation of six new members you must be on hand  i think i had better go to bedso as to be in good trim for the football game answered dave  oh no you must come pleaded buster phil and roger and all the old crowd have promised to be there  well ill be on hand if youll promise not to keep us out after twelve oclock buster the eleven has got to get its sleep remember that  all right well try to cut it short answered buster beggs who this term was the leader of the society or right honorable muckamuck as he was called  what are you going to do questioned dave  thats a secret dave but it will make you laugh we are going to initiate the whole six at one time  very well ill be there  one thing more dave went on buster in a low voice keep this from nat poole  but he is a member urged dave he has a right to know  if he knew hed tell on us surehe is down on the whole crowd we are going to drop him  i see well you are leader this term buster so do as you please answered dave and walked off to one of his recitations then buster hurried off in another direction  as soon as the two students were gone a third boy tiptoed his way from behind a coat rack where he had been in hiding the lad was nat poole  i thought something was in the wind murmured nat to himself i must find out just where they are going and what they are going to doand then ill let doctor clay know all about it maybe if porter and his crowd are caught redhanded theyll be put in disgrace and then they wont be able to play that game with rockville     chapter xviii  an initiation and what followed   are we all ready  we are  then forwardand make as little noise as possible until we are out of hearing of the school  the gee eyes had assembled at the boathouse under the leadership of buster beggs and ben basswood three of the number had gone ahead taking with them the six new students who were to be initiated  the members of the society had with them their robes and other paraphernalia consisting of boxlike headgear stuffed clubs wooden swords squirt guns and other articles too numerous to mention they hurried off into the woods and there donned the robes and headgear and lit their lanterns for the night promised to be dark  i hope nobody has found us out ventured roger we dont want to get caught at this he had received an inkling of what was coming  oh i guess we are safe enough answered dave murphy said he would let us in  say talking about being let in puts me in mind of a story came from shadow a man stayed out later nights than his wife liked one night he didnt come home until very late and he stood on the sidewalk afraid to let himself in along came a friend and asked him what he was doing please ring the bell and see if my wife is home said the man so the friend rang the bell and the next instant the door opened and he got a broom over his head is she in asked the man on the sidewalk sure she is answered his friend go right in and youll get a warm welcome and at this story there was a general snicker  a few minutes walk brought the members of the gee eyes to a clearing in the woods here several lanterns had been hung up casting a weird light of red blue and green those to be initiated were present and surrounding them in a big circle the members of the society commenced to chant      flabboola flabboola       see the victims see     flabboola flabboola       victim bend your knee     sinky panky flabboola       fall upon the ground     sinky panky flabboola       sing without a sound  and then came a wild dancing around the victims with a brandishing of clubs and swords  hi dont stab me roared one as a sword was thrust suddenly in the direction of his stomach  shut up murmured the victim next to him they wont hurt you  the right honorable lord of the reservoir will warm up the victims backbones sang out buster in a hoarse bass voice and then shadow hamilton in his disguise crept behind the nearest victim and sent a stream of icewater from a squirtgun down the fellows neck  wow wow yelled the student trying to break away from the pair who held him crimps but thats cold  tis for thy good we do this to thee said shadow solemnly and then the next victim was treated to a similar dose he submitted quietly and so did the next fellow but the fourth broke away and started off in the direction of the school  hi come back here yelled several dont you want to become a member  ii guess ive changed my mind stammered the youth ieri cant stand cold baths nohow if youhello whats this and of a sudden he pitched over some dark object and went headlong  ouch came in another voice ouch what do you mean by kicking me in the ribs and a groan of pain followed  who is behind those bushes asked dave  must be a spy returned phil  a spy a spy capture him  dont let him get back to the school  on the instant there was great excitement and fully a dozen members of the gee eyes rushed forward and caught hold of the escaping victim and the fellow over whom he had stumbled both were dragged forward and the light of a lantern was turned on the unknown  why its nat poole  he was spying on us  maybe he was going to report us  you lelet go of me stammered nat he put his hand to his side that fellow half killed me and he gave another groan  what were you doing in the bushes demanded ben sternly  me whyernothing  yes you were  ill wager a button he was going to report us exclaimed another student  it aint so whined nat aint i got a right to be here im a member  no you are notyouve been cast out answered a deep bass voice  if he wants to be one of us hes got to be initiated all over again said phil in a disguised voice what say boys shall we do it  yes yes put him with the others  sure thing nat you are just in time  well give you an initiation youll never forget a regular threeply dyed in the wool warranted stormproof initiation added ben in tragic tones  i dont want to be initiated again howled the moneylenders son ive had enough of this society you let me go  not tonight was the firm answer and much against his will nat was forced to go along with the crowd and thus his plan to find out what they were going to do and then carry the news to doctor clay was nipped in the bud  we were lucky to catch nat whispered dave to roger as the whole crowd proceeded through the woods led by buster and ben i am certain he was spying on us for no good purpose  exactly dave and we want to watch him right along returned the senators son first thing you know hell be giving our football signals and tricks away to rockville and the other schools we are going to play  nat had been forced to join the other victims and the seven were marched a distance of a quarter of a mile the crowd came out on the bank of the river at a spot where several icehouses had recently been erected  now well give you the famous slide for life cried buster and pointed to the upper portion of one of the icehouses where a big wooden slide led downward into the leming river  i cant stand cold water cried the victim who had previously tried to run away  twill do you a power of good answered sam in a deep voice  say you aint going to dump me into the river from that thing roared nat poole i wont stand it  then sit down to it nat came a voice from the rear  of a sudden the seven victims were blindfolded several protested weakly but the others kept silent for they knew it would do no good to attempt to hold back indeed it might make matters worse yet nobody in that crowd wanted a ducking for the water was cold and they were quite a distance from the school  some narrow stairs led to the upper portion of the icehouses and blindfolded as they were the victims were forced to mount these and were then taken to a room in the back of one of the buildings  now for number one sang out buster and one of the victims was rushed forward to a slide  hope you can swim carson said one of the hazers  the water isnt over ten feet deep said another  swim hard and then you wont take cold added a third  if you find yourself really drowning yell for help put in a fourth  ieri dont think this is quite fair commenced poor carson and then he was tripped flat on his back and sent downward with a plunge oh he screamed and then continued to go down with great rapidity for the slide had been looked over by the boys and made as smooth as possible he shut his mouth tightly expecting every instant to strike the chilling waters but of a sudden his feet struck a heap of sawdust and into this he slid up to his knees then eager hands seized him and the bandage was torn from his eyes in the semidarkness he saw that he had not come down the slide over the water but down another which ended in the sawdust pit of the icehouse he looked decidedly sheepish  have a fine swim carson asked one of his tormentors  what a sell muttered the victim but anyway its better than the river he added with much satisfaction  one after another the victims were sent down the wooden slide some came down silently like martyrs while others yelled in alarm nat poole was the last to be brought forward he was well blindfolded  be careful nat cried one student gravely dont hit your head when you go down  and dont scratch yourself on any of the nails added another  as soon as you hit the water somebody will haul you in with a boathook came from a third  ii dont want to slide into the water i tell you screamed the moneylenders son ill catch my death of cold  you run all the way back to school and get into bed and youll be all right said a fourth hazer  ii cant swim very well you let me go and now nat was fairly whining  cant do it nat here is where you get a firstclass a no 1 bath was the cry and then the victim was sent flat on his back on the wooden slide he let up a shriek of agony and another shriek as he commenced to slide down then he lost his nerve completely and uttered yell after yell only ending when he struck the sawdust with such force that he turned a complete somersault and got some sawdust in his mouth and nose  my but he certainly knows how to scream remarked dave as he and the others rushed below to join the crowd i hope he doesnt rouse the neighborhood  when the cloth was removed from nats eyes and he had a chance to see where he had landed he was the maddest lad present all the other victims were laughing at him and the club members almost doubled up in their mirth  think youre smart dont you he snarled but you just wait  want more of the initiation demanded buster  no i dont you let me go im going back to the school  so are we nat and youll go with us answered shadow dont let him get away from us he whispered to his friends  well this winds up the initiation said buster throwing off his headgear a movement that was followed by the others you fellows are now fullfledged members of the gee eyes  and im glad it is over answered one of the victims say but that was a dandy shoot the chutes he added half in admiration  it is not quite as firm as it might be said dave it needs more bracing up on the sides the carpenters arent done i suppose  i thought it was mighty shaky myself put in phil why once i thought it was going down with us  oh its as sound as a dollar cried shadow of course with such a crowd  shadow did not finish for from above the boys in the sawdust pit there came a sudden ominous cracking in the semidarkness of the night they saw a brace snap in twain another brace quickly followed and then the wooden slide commenced to sway from side to side  its coming down yelled roger hoarsely get out of here quickunless you want to be killed     chapter xix  sneak against sneak   it was a time of extreme peril for the boys in the sawdust pit at the bottom of the wooden slide and nobody realized this more thoroughly than did dave in some manner the wooden bracings had become loosened and the ponderous slide was in danger of coming down with a mighty crash on their heads if it did this more than likely some of the lads would be seriously injured if not killed  jump from the pit yelled dave and caught phil by one hand and roger by the other all made a wild scramble kicking the sawdust in all directions  let me get out of here  confound this robe im all tangled up in it  my foot is caught help me wont you  such were some of the cries that arose as in a bunch the boys tried to get out of the sawdust pit all succeeded but buster beggs who while on the rim of the pit slipped and fell backjust as another brace snapped and the ponderous wooden slide sagged still more  help me yelled buster dont leave me fellows  here give me your hand cried dave turning back and as the hand was thrust towards him he gave a jerk that brought buster out in a hurry by this time most of the boys had run to a safe distance and dave and buster lost no time in following  all here demanded ben the lanterns had been left behind so that they could see only with difficulty  a rapid count was made and it was learned that all were safe one student had scratched his face and another had wrenched his ankle but in the excitement these minor injuries were scarcely noticed  thank fortune we are out of that panted phil  im mighty glad i wasnt killed added luke  i wonder if the slide is really coming down after all remarked sam it doesnt seem to be moving any more  all peered forth in the semidarkness at the big wooden affair it had sagged in the middle and the top had twisted several feet to one side another brace looked as if it was on the point of breaking and letting it down still further  better get out of here said nat poole if the owner of the icehouses finds this out hell make you pay for the busted slide  well i think we ought to pay for it anyway answered dave quickly we broke it  huh i wouldnt pay a cent unless i had to grumbled the moneylenders son  what about our lanterns asked roger  thats so exclaimed ben they are all up in the icehouse or down in the sawdust pit  we cant leave them therethey may set fire to something said phil  well have to get them decided dave  oh but thats dangerous cried one of the students who had just been initiated why the slide might come down just as we were getting the lanterns  yes and i dont want to be killed for the sake of four or five lanterns added another  its not a question of the worth of the lanterns said dave we mustnt leave them here because of the danger of fire if we left them and the icehouses burnt down wed have a nice bill to pay  oh dont croak so much growled nat poole im going back to school its cold here  you stay where you are nat cried ben catching him by the arm youll go back with the rest of us and not before  with caution dave followed by phil and shadow approached the icehouse and climbed up one of the ladders nailed to the side of the building then they ventured out on a corner of the slide and secured two of the lanterns  well have to go down part of the slide for that other said the shipowners son  no dont do that for your weight may bring the slide down returned dave ill get a long stick and see if i cant get the lantern with that  a stick was handy and fixing a bent nail in the end dave reached down and after a little trouble secured the lantern then the boys went below and secured the lanterns in the sawdust pit  hi what are you boys doing here demanded an unexpected voice from out of the darkness and by the light of the lanterns the students saw a man approaching he had a stick in one hand and an oldfashioned horsepistol in the other  who are you questioned buster as leader of the gee eyes  who am i i am bill cameron the owner of these icehouses thats who i am and i know you in spite of them tomfoolery dresses youve got on youre boys from oak hall  youve hit the nail on the head mr cameron cried phil glad to see you and he walked forward and held out his hand  who be you demanded bill cameron and peered at the shipowners son curiously well i declare if it aint the young man as stopped the runaway hoss fer my wife glad to see you and the icehouse man shook hands cordially up to some secret fun i suppose  yes sir  i thought i heard a yellin around the icehouses and i told my wife id dress and come over and see what it meant hope you aint done no damage the man continued somewhat anxiously  we have done a little damage i am afraid answered phil but we are willing to pay for it  what did ye do  in as few words as possible phil and some of the others explained the situation they were afraid bill cameron would be angry but instead he broke into a laugh  aint it the greatest ever he cried you aint done no damage at all the carpenters put that wooden slide up wrong and i told em theyd have to take it down and they started today thats what made them bracins bust the hull thing is comin downso what you did dont hurt nohow  i am very glad to hear that cried phil and the others said practically the same then they bade goodnight to the icehouses owner and hurried in the direction of oak hall  its a good thing phil that you knew mr cameron said dave on the way but you never told me about stopping a runaway horse for mrs cameron  oh it wasnt much answered the shipowners son modestly it happened last june just before we started for star ranch the horse was running along the river road and i got hold of him and stopped him thats all mrs cameron was going to tell doctor clay about it but i got her to keep quiet  phil youre a hero and dave gave his chums arm a squeeze that made phil wince but with pleasure  murphy the monitor was on the watch for them and let them in by a back door all lost no time in getting to their dormitories and in undressing and going to bed everybody in the crowd was satisfied over the initiations but nat poole his plot to expose dave and his chums had failed and he was correspondingly sour  but ill fix them yet muttered the moneylenders son to himself just wait till they start to play rockville thats all and the thought of what he had in mind to do made him smile grimly  it must be confessed that some of the football players felt rather sleepy the next morning dave was sleepy himself and this alarmed him not a little  if we lose the game with rockville today it will be our own fault he said to the crowd that had participated in the gee eyes doings we should have gotten home at least an hour earlier than we did last nightor rather this morning and then he made each player take a good rubbing down and just enough exercise to limber up his muscles  dave had not forgotten what had been said about nat poole and directly after breakfast he called chip macklin to one side as my old readers know chip had once been the sneak of the school and he knew well how to hang around and take notice of what was going on  chip ive got some work for you said dave in a low voice i may be mistakenin fact i hope for the honor of the school that i am but i dont trust nat poole he is down on some of us because we have gotten back on the eleven and youll remember how chummy he used to be with jasniff and merwell who are now going to rockvilleand with rand and frapley and they are now going to the academy also i am afraid that nat  that nat will try to sell you out finished chip his little eyes snapping expectantly  yes he may give our signals away or something like that  i see and you want me to watchand report if i see anything wrong  yes  ill do it id like to catch himfor he never treats me decently added chip  it had been decided that some of the boys should go to rockville by boats and others by carriages and on their bicycles and motorcycles the eleven were to go in the school carryall and mr dodsworth and andrew dale were to go with them  owing to the change in the academy management but little had been done to the athletic field and when the oak hall club arrived they found the grounds rather uneven and poorly marked  bad for really good playing remarked dave  youll have to be on your guard warned andrew dale this field should have been rolled down after the last storm  the grandstand was rather a small affair and it speedily became filled with visitors for the annual football game between the two schools was always a great drawing card flags and banners were much in evidence and so were horns and rattles  i wonder if any outsiders we know are present remarked roger to his chums as they walked across the field  somebody is waving from the corner of the stand answered phil i think it is miss rockwell  it is and miss feversham is with her and so is mr rockwell answered dave and then the boys took off their caps in salutation and then they recognized a number of other friends  the eleven had just turned into its dressingroom to prepare for the game when chip macklin came running in all out of breath  i want to see dave he gasped and then as soon as the pair had walked to a corner he went on i caught nat  what doing demanded dave quickly  giving all of your signals away to merwell jasniff and one of the rockville football players he started to tell about your trick plays when he saw me standing near and shut up  where is he now  in the grandstand with some girl  i will attend to this at once chip come with me  dave led the small student out of the dressingroom and called andrew dale and mr dodsworth quickly the situation was explained the school teacher looked shocked and the gymnastic instructor was disgusted  i will take care of poole said mr dale in a strained voice mr dodsworth you had better arrange for a change of signals  i will answered the gymnastic instructor and then andrew dale hurried off and dave returned to the dressingroom accompanied by mr dodsworth the signals were rearranged and so were the signs for some of the new trick plays  now then boys let me give you a bit of advice said mr dodsworth when they were ready to go out on the field for practice from what i have heard rockville has good staying powers and will try to tire you out your move is to go at them with a jump and make your points early in the gameand then hold them down now do your bestand dont give in until the last whistle blows     chapter xx  the great game with rockville   dave i think i see a chance of catching rockville napping said roger just before the practice began  you mean if they try to take advantage of our signals  yes if they feel sure we are going to do one thing and we do another theyll get left  well theyll deserve to get leftif they try to profit by any such work  maybe the eleven wont stand for it  oh i dont know rockville is hungry for a victory over us and they may think all is fair in love and war and football broke in phil  as each eleven came on the gridiron it was roundly cheered the rockville supporters at once commenced their wellknown slogan         rockville        rockville     youll get your fill        of rockville  and immediately oak hall replied with its own wellknown cry            baseball           football           oak hall           has the call     biff boom bang whoop  and then from both sides arose a great din of horns and rattles in the rear of the field were several automobiles and they too let off their horns and screech whistles adding to the noise  the practice at an end the tossup followed and this was won by rockville and they elected to take the ball out on the gridiron spread the two elevens each player eager to do his best then the whistle blew there came a kicking of the pigskin and the great game was on  the play was fast and furious from the start and in a very few minutes dave and his chums understood that to gain a victory was going to be no easy thing rockville had the advantage in weight and long practice had put every man in the pink of condition  but the trick that nat poole had tried to play bore unexpected results the kickoff was a good one but the pigskin was caught by phil and he brought it back almost to the center of the gridiron being aided by clever interference on the part of roger and plum then the signal was given to carry the ball through the center the rockville players thought it was a signal to run around the left end and moved accordingly up the field came the pigskin and before rockville could recover from the error made plum had the ball within four yards of the goal line here however he was downed so heavily that the wind was knocked completely out of him  thats the way to do it hurrah for oak hall  now shove it over fellows  they didnt follow their signals at all whispered one player to the rockville captain  i know it was the low answer dont depend on the signals after this  but the damage had been done and two minutes later oak hall obtained a touchdown roger carrying the ball over the line dave made the kick and the pigskin sailed neatly between the posts then what a cheering went up and what a noise from the horns and rattles  thats the way to do it  first blood for oak hall now keep up the good work  as quickly as possible the ball was brought once more into play and now the contest waged fast and furious back and forth went the pigskin first in the possession of one eleven and then in the possession of the other there was a fine run around the right end by roger and another by a player for rockville then came a mixup and each side had to retire a player while rockville was penalized several yards for an offside play  five minutes more came the warning and then in a fury rockville tried to form a flying wedgesuch a move being permissible that year the shock was terrific and in spite of all their efforts to stand firm oak hall broke and the pigskin was carried over the line then the goal was kickedand the whistle blew and the first half of the great game came to an end  score oak hall 6 rockville 6  panting for breath for that last shock had been a telling one the oak hall players filed into the dressingroom there to rest and to receive such attention as they needed  well it is still our game as much as theirs said dave trying to cheer up his men but we want to go at em hammer and tongs in the second half  try that rightend trick as early as possible advised mr dodsworth i dont think theyll be looking for it that mixup on signals bothered them some  did mr dale see poole asked roger  yes and poole was sent back to the school in care of one of the carriage drivers answered the gymnastic instructor  down in the grandstand the supporters of rockville and of oak hall were having lively discussions over the merits of the two elevens among the rockville students were jasniff merwell and frapley  i hope we wax em in the second half said merwell to jasniff  how much money did you put up link asked jasniff  all i could scrape upthirtyfive dollars  and i put up forty dollars  with the oak hall fellows  no with some sports from the town  just what i did of course i hope we dont lose if we do ill be in a hole until my next remittance comes  oh rockville has got to win said jasniff loudly we cant help but do it  this is oak halls game cried a voice from the other end of the grandstand and then a cheer went up followed by another cheer from the local supporters  say when do we get back at dave porter asked merwell while the cheering was going on im getting tired of waiting  well get back at him very soon now answered jasniff if what doctor montgomery tells me is true everything will be ready about thanksgiving time  can you depend on the doctor  i think so he is almost down and out and will do anything for money answered nick jasniff and then the talk came to an end as the second half of the game began  both elevens had been urged to do their best and the play was as spirited as before rockville was unusually aggressive and one of the players tackled phil unfairly giving his shoulder a severe wrench a protest was at once made by both phil and dave and amid a general wrangle the rockville man was retired  never mind they are going to put ross in was the cry hell show em what he can do ross had been a favorite player in years gone by but had not been allowed to play before because he was behind in his studies now however it was seen that he was sorely needed and the rockville faculty gave the desired permission to fill the vacancy  ten minutes of play found the pigskin near the center of the field then for the first time dave saw a chance to use the rightend trick which mr dodsworth had suggested and gave the necessary signal at once the entire eleven was on the alert  the trick consisted in sending the ball over to the right back to center and then to the right again some players meanwhile rushing to the left as a blind the movements were made with rapidity and rockville was caught napping up came the pigskin in plums arms and he turned it over to another player who in turn passed it to dave then dave saw a clear space and dove for it he was followed and tackled but shook himself loose and dropped on the ball directly over the goal line  a roar went up  another touchdown for oak hall  now for another goal  amid a wild cheering the try for goal was made but a keen wind had sprung up and the goal was missed by a few inches  never mind that makes the score eleven to six in oak halls favor  once again the ball was brought into play there were but seven minutes of time left and rockville played like demons hurling themselves again and again at their opponents but dave felt that enough had been accomplished and gave the signal to be on the defensive and thus rockville was held back and the most it could do was to get the ball on oak halls thirtyfive yard line and then the fateful whistle sounded and the great game came to a close  final score oak hall 11 rockville academy 6  it was a wellearned victory and the oak hall eleven were warmly praised by their friends and the public in general while many condemned the military academy for the roughness shown  oh it was too lovely for anything said vera rockwell when phil and roger sauntered up waiting for the carryall to take the eleven back to oak hall  it was indeed added mary feversham we compliment you and we compliment mr porter too she added her eyes beaming brightly  a wellfought game was mr rockwells comment and then the boys passed on to join their fellows  of course the majority of the rockville supporters felt blue over the outcome of the game and they lost no time in leaving the grandstand and disappearing from view jasniff and merwell went also but in another direction  this leaves me high and dry growled merwell i wont have a cent to spend for two weeks  let us see if we cant borrow some money suggested jasniff  id like to know who from all the fellows who bet have lost their money  then well have to hit somebody who didnt betsome of the goodygoody fellows and he laughed bitterly  like porter eh  yes porter never bets nor drinks nor smokes i cant understand how he makes himself popular can you  its his smooth way but some day hell be found out and dropped answered merwell  hell be dropped when we work our little game against him returned jasniff with an evil look in his eyes  never had the carryall contained a happier crowd of students than those who rode back to oak hall after the game they sang cheered and whistled to their hearts content and nearly drove horsehair wild with their antics climbing out of the windows and over the roof of the turnout  bless my heart but you must be careful pleaded the driver i dont want to hurt nobuddy on this trip  oh horsehair we cant hold ourselves down answered phil such a victory isnt gained every day  yes sir i know sir but them hosses dont know nothin about football an fust thing you know theyll run away pleaded the carryall driver  well take a chance put in roger brightly now then all together and out on the air rolled the old school song to the tune of auld lang syne and then followed a cheering that could be heard for half a mile  bonfires tonight announced buster beggs the biggest yet  say that puts me in mind of a story began shadow but what he wanted to tell was lost in a tooting of horns and a clacking of rattles that lasted until oak hall was reached     chapter xxi  thanksgiving and a snowballing contest   the celebration that night was a grand affair and doctor clay allowed the students to remain out until midnight many bonfires were lighted and the boys danced around sang songs and played many practical jokes on each other and on horsehair and pop swingly shadow was in his element and was permitted to tell a dozen or more of his yarns much to his own satisfaction if not of his listeners  the only boys who felt blue were nat poole and the lads who had played against lemington and then been put off the eleven nat had received a sharp lecture from the doctor and then been sent to his room to remain there until the following morning he wanted to pack up and go home fearing the jeers of his fellowstudents when they learned of his meanness but he did not dare to make this move for his father had written him a sharp letter telling him to finish out the term at oak hall or otherwise to go to workand nat did not want to go to work  of course the victory over rockville made dave and his chums feel good the whole eleven were warmly congratulated by the doctor and by mr dale and mr dodsworth  the game with the military academy was followed by a number of other contests and the school made a fine record for itself winning six games out of eight the two games lost were with college boys and these players were all considerably heavier than the oak hall lads the last game took place on thanksgiving day and was witnessed by daves father and mr wadsworth and also by laura and jessie oak hall won this contest by a score of 18 to 11  oh it was grand dave cried jessie after the boys had left the gridiron that run you made was the best ever  you all did well said laura  it makes my blood tingle and i feel like getting into the game myself said oliver wadsworth it was a cleancut contest from start to finish  phil and some of the other boys were going home and soon said goodby mr porter and mr wadsworth went off with doctor clay and that left dave and roger with the two girls as senator morr was at home from washington it was decided that the young folks should pay rogers home a visit for the rest of the day mr porter and mr wadsworth coming there in the evening to take laura and jessie back to crumville  the young folks made a jolly party as they boarded the train they turned over one of the double seats and sat facing each other and laughed and chatted until hemson was reached here a carriage awaited them and they were driven to the morr mansion where they received a warm greeting from the senator and his wife  the girls had much to tell about themselves and then asked about matters at the school they were indignant to learn that nat poole had exposed the football signals  it is just like himthe sneak cried jessie oh dave i hope you dont have anything more to do with him  i am willing to let him alone if he will let me alone  do you hear anything from link merwell questioned laura  not much but i understand he and nick jasniff have it in for me  then dave you must be on your guard cautioned his sister i think merwell is a regular snake in the grasshis actions at the ranch prove itand jasniff is no better  jasniff is worse said roger he is a brute  the boys and girls spent a happy evening together and all too soon mr porter and mr wadsworth arrived to take laura and jessie back to crumville the boys hated to see them go and went to the depot with them there was some warm handshaking and then the train rolled away and the boys went back to the house  splendid girls both of them was rogers comment and dave quite agreed with him but he was thinking more about jessie than his sisterand it is quite likely roger was thinking more about laura  the boys remained at rogers home until saturday afternoon and then returned to oak hall the air was heavy and very cold and they were glad to get out of the carryall rush into the school and warm up  feels like snow to me said dave and he was right it started to snow that night and kept it up for the greater part of sunday so that by monday the ground was covered to the depth of a foot or more  hurrah for a snowballing match cried buster everybody in the line after school  let us choose sides suggested ben instead of having an army of the north and an army of the south we can have  an army of red and an army of blue finished dave what do you say to the red sweaters against the blue sweaters  as many lads of the school wore red sweaters and about an equal number wore blue the idea caught on instantly and at the noon recess the two armies of red and of blue were hastily organized each numbered twentyfive recruits and roger was made the leader on one side and sam day the leader on the other with roger went dave and phil while ben buster and shadow sided with sam rogers side was the army of red and they made themselves a big red flag with the initials o h on it not to be outdone sams army made a big blue flag also with the school initials  it was decided that the army of blue was to take a position in the woods and that the army of red was to try to dislodge them and force them to retreat if either army was driven back two hundred yards it must give up its flag and count itself beaten  after school half an hour was allowed for getting ready and most of that time was consumed in making snowballs and in fortifying the edge of the woods by throwing up a snowbank then a bugle belonging to one of the students sounded out and the great snowball battle began  it was certainly a hot contest and the snowballs flew in all directions and many a soldier received one in the body or in the head sam had placed his followers with care and try their best the army of red could not dislodge them  i have a scheme said phil after the battle had lasted for fully half an hour and while the boys were pausing to manufacture fresh ammunition in the shape of snowballs let us rush up and then pretend to retreat theyll think they have us on the run and as soon as they leave the woods and that snowbank we can turn on em again and wallop em  if you try that be sure of one thing said dave have plenty of snowballs on hand otherwise that fake retreat may become a real one  well make a lot of snowballs said roger pitch in everybody  in a little while the army of red was ready for the movement phil had suggested then roger explained just how it was to be carried out they were to advance on the left wing of the blues and then retreat in the direction of the road as soon as the blues came from cover they were to drive themif they could be drivento the upper edge of the woods and across the field beyond  now then all together cried the senators son and make them think you are really retreating at first  forward went the army of red throwing snowballs wildly then came a shower of balls in return and several of the reds were seen to fall as if knocked down then came a pause and several lads started to go back  stop dont run yelled roger dont run but as this was part of the deception those in retreat kept on backing away  hurrah weve got em on the run came from the woods and in a trice several of the army of blue appeared on the top of the snowbank come on let us chase em  over the snowbank came the army of blue carrying all the snowballs it could manage the army of red continued to retreat each boy loaded down with ammunition then just as the edge of the woods was cleared a loud whistle sounded out  it was the signal to turn and like one man the army of red faced about and let fly a heavy volley of snowballs directly in the face of the enemy the blues were taken completely by surprise and almost dazed then came another volley of snowballs and a dozen lads were struck in the head and elsewhere  wow yelled one boy say what are we up against  let em have it came the rallying yell of the reds down with em drive em to cover and on they came with a rush throwing their snowballs with all the accuracy possible the severe onslaught demoralized the other army for the time being and two boys broke and ranthen half a dozen moreand then the whole army  stop turn and face em yelled sam give it to em hot but this was not to be for the reason that the blues were out of ammunition they ran close to the woods but were driven from that cover by a flank movement and then took to the field trying to manufacture snowballs as they ran  weve got em goingdont let up cried dave and having stopped to make a few more snowballs he pushed on with roger and half a dozen others beside him phil carried the flag and all made for where the enemy had its flag of blue then came an exchange of snowballs at close range and poor phil was hit in the face he dropped the flag and dave picked it up  much hurt phil asked roger anxiously  i guess not was the plucky reply go on and wax em and then phil turned back for a moment to catch his breath  at the edge of the field was a ridge and back of this a deep hollow sam decided to take a stand behind the ridge and so directed his followers  but look out for the holes said one of the boys some nasty ones around here  the battle soon waged as fiercely as ever on came the army of red with a fresh supply of ammunition and snowballs flew in all directions poor sam was struck in the ear and the carrier of the flag was hit in the arm and in the mouth down went the flag and before the carrier could pick it up three of the enemy pounced upon him and while two held him the third captured the allimportant trophy  hurrah weve got their flag now drive em along was the cry  we must get the flag back called out sam now then all together and again the battle went on  now for a final rush said roger after the blue flag had been taken to the rear we are going to win come on and he led the way  near the top of the ridge the red and the blue fought fiercely for all the boys were now thoroughly warmed up back and forth surged the long lines and for several minutes it looked as if the blues might succeed in driving the reds back once dave came close to losing the flag and only saved it by sending two of the enemy sprawling headlong in the snow  at last the reds managed to reach the top of the ridge and from that point send down a fierce shower of snowballs the blues could not withstand this fire and broke and ran  hurrah the victory is ours yelled several of the reds  let us clinch it and make em cry for mercy shouted one of the victorious army and forward he went and nearly all of the others after him  be careful cried dave there are a lot of holes around here somebody may break a leg  his voice was drowned by the shouts of those who had won and over the ridge and towards the hollow poured the victors and vanquishedthe latter trying to dodge the fresh shower of snowballs  its all overlet up yelled one boy of the army of blue let up cant you  one last shower fellows cried roger now then all together  the snowballs were delivered and then came a pause as all realized that the battle was at an end then from the far end of the hollow came an unexpected yell  help help i am down in a hole and cant get out help     chapter xxii  in which the shoes come back   somebody is in trouble  who is it  where is he  it is tom hally cried roger mentioning one of the new boys at oak hall he must have fallen into one of the holes near the big hollow  come on and see what is the matter said dave and dropping the flag he sped in the direction of the cries and a dozen others followed  when they reached the spot from which the cries for help had proceeded they could see nothing of tom hally  he was here a minute agoi saw him declared a student named messmer he must have gone down out of sight  be careful that somebody doesnt go down on top of him cautioned roger  he had hardly spoken when there came a cry from messmer and looking in his direction the other boys were horrified to see him sink into the snow up to his waist  hi hi help me yelled messmer quick something has me by the foot  maybe its hally at the bottom of the hole burst out dave  let us make a chain and haul him out suggested phil  this suggestion was considered a good one and in a twinkling a long line was formed the boys taking hold of each others hands dave was at one end of the line and he approached messmer with caution  help me gasped messmer something is dragging me down  take hold of my hand answered dave hold tight  messmer did as requested and then dave gave the other boys the signal to haul away  but be careful he added otherwise the line may break and some more of us will go in the hole  the students hauled steadily and cautiously and slowly but surely messmer came out of the snowy hole as his feet came into view it was seen that a pair of hands were clasped around one of his ankles  tom hally is there shouted dave be extra careful or he may slip back  he had hardly spoken when messmers foot came up with a jerk the unfortunate boy below had let go being probably too exhausted to keep hold  oh dave what shall we do gasped roger he stood next in the life line  make two lines cried dave here you get hold of one of my feet and messmer can get hold of the other now dont let go whatever you do ill go down after hally  but the danger began ben  we cant leave hally to smother to death there ben now then hold tight answered dave  the two lines were formed each end boy holding tight to one of daves ankles then dave threw himself down in the snow and wormed his way to the edge of the hole several feet below he saw one of tom hallys hands sticking up the fingers working convulsively he made a clutch and got a firm grip of the wrist  haul away he called but be easy or the edge of the hole may cave in  under daves directions the boys hauled away with care and presently poor tom hally came to the surface of the snow and was dragged to a safe spot he was all but exhausted and too weak to stand  here well carry you to the school cried roger and he and some others made a chair and thus the unfortunate lad was carried to oak hall where he was placed in a rocking chair in front of a fire  i went down all of a sudden he explained when he could talk i yelled for all i was worth and i saw some of you running towards me then i went out of sight and the next i knew messmers feet were on my head i caught hold of one foot and was dragged almost to the surface then my strength gave outand i hardly know what i did after that  dave pulled you out answered phil he saw one of your hands sticking out of the snow and he got us fellows to form two lines with him on the end  i am very thankful said tom hally and he gave daves hand a warm squeeze i shall never go near that hollow again  its a dangerous place in the winter time said roger we should have known better than to have retreated in that direction  well the army of the red won cried one of the students say wasnt it a dandy battle  it certainly was answered several others  doctor clay was much alarmed to learn that hally and messmer had gone down in a hole in the snow and he came to see how the former was getting along then he praised dave and his chums for their bravery in effecting a rescue  in the past hally who was a rather silent student had had little to say to the other boys but now he spoke to dave and asked him quite a number of questions concerning himself and the other occupants of dormitories nos 11 and 12  id like to be in with your bunch said he wistfully i dont like our crowd very well  where are you asked dave  in no 13with nat poole and his crowd  they arent very much of nats crowd any more are they  oh several boys still stick to him but he makes me sick  well i am sorry hally but our rooms are filled up said dave  poole is down on you isnt he  yes  he told me you and he had had a lot of trouble  so we havebut i claim it was mostly nats fault he does some pretty mean things  so he does for a fact and tom hally nodded earnestly he is down on maurice hamilton too isnt he  yes but shadow never did him any harm its just nats mean disposition returned dave and there the conversation had to come to an end  but that talk coupled with the fact that dave and his chums had so bravely gone to tom hallys rescue produced an unexpected result two days later when the occupants of dormitories nos 11 and 12 got up they were surprised to find just inside of one of the doors a big pasteboard box securely tied with a heavy cord  why whats this asked phil who was the first to see the box  must be a christmas box cried dave and yet it is rather early in the season for that  is it addressed to anybody questioned ben  nothing on it announced roger after an inspection maybe the box was placed in this room by mistake  let us open it and see what is inside suggested polly vane  i second that motion added luke hope its got some nice christmas pies in it  maybe its a trick cautioned shadow go slow on opening it  the boys pushed the box to the center of the dormitory with care and then roger cut the cord with his pocketknife  you open it said phil to dave  i am not afraid answered dave and took off the cover  and then what a shout went up  our shoes and boots and slippers  where in the world did this come from  say i thought my shoes were gone for good  are they all here  i guess so let us sort em out and see  hastily the box was turned over and the contents dumped on the floor then began a general sorting out lasting for several minutes  one of my gym shoes is missing announced phil  perhaps one of the other fellows has it suggested dave and the shipowners son started a fresh search but it was of no avail every shoe slipper and boot that had been taken had been returned excepting one of phils foot coverings  well i dont care much said phil these shoes were about worn out anyway  where do you suppose this box came from asked ben and then he gazed curiously at shadow and the others did the same  ii suppose you thinkthat is you imagine ieri had something to do with this stammered the boy who had on several occasions walked in his sleep  do you know anything about it shadow asked dave  not the first thing  did you dream of anything last night  yes i dreamed about aera stammered the sleepwalker ieroh it wasnt about shoes or anything like that  well what was it demanded roger sternly  it was about a party if you must know i dreamt i took a girl and we had a nice time dancing and playing games there werent any shoes in it and poor shadow got redder than ever  dave looked the box over with care it was a common pasteboard box with nothing on it in the way of writing or advertising  this certainly is a mystery he said slowly first the shoes disappear and now they come back i give it up  somebody has been playing a trick on us declared roger the question is who  i dont know of anybody who would do such a thing excepting it was nat poole declared ben  well there is no use of taxing nat with it declared dave for he would deny it pointblank unless you could prove it against him  the boys talked the affair over until it was time to go down to breakfast but they could reach no conclusion regarding the mystery  maybe it will never be explained said buster  well even so i am glad to get my shoes and slippers back lisped polly vane  a few days after the restoration of the foot coverings there came a thaw and then a sudden cold snap ice began to form on the river and soon it was thick enough for skating much to the joy of the students for nearly all of them loved to skate some of the boys had iceboats and these were also brought out for use  i understand that rockville is going to put out a strong icehockey team this winter said roger to dave one day they are going to challenge us too  well well have to make up a team to beat em answered dave  that wont be so easy declared another student they have some great skaters and hockey players at the military academy this season theyve got one player who is a star  who is that  will mallory he came from down east and he is the slickest icehockey player you ever set eyes on  well if they challenge us well do our best declared dave and some others said the same  the next day after school dave had occasion to go to oakdale on an errand roger was going along but at the last minute had to stay behind so dave went alone  he had scarcely passed out of the school grounds when he noticed that he was being followed a tall thin man had stepped from behind some oak trees and was coming after him  i wonder what that chap was doing around the school the youth asked himself  he walked along rapidly and the man did the same then dave slackened his pace and the follower did likewise  he doesnt want to catch up to me thats sure thought the youth maybe he is afraid ill recognize him wonder who he is  he turned and looked back but the man had his overcoat pulled up and his soft hat pulled far down and dave could see little of his face  this is a mystery mused dave i am going to speak to him and he stopped short and waited for the mysterious individual to come up     chapter xxiii  hooker montgomerys strange request   the stranger approached slowly as if hoping dave would go on before he came up once he looked towards the fields on either side of the road as if thinking to turn off but no side road was at hand so he had to either come on or turn back  why it is doctor montgomery said the lad to himself as he recognized the man then as he got still closer dave saw that the sostyled doctor looked shabby and dissipated his nose was exceedingly red as if he had been drinking and his overcoat was much worn and so were his shoes  how do you do he said somewhat gruffly as he came up to where dave was standing  how are you returned dave coldly and stepped aside as if to let the doctor pass but instead of doing this the traveling physician came to a somewhat unsteady halt  your name is dave porter isnt it he queried trying hard to steady a voice that liquor had rendered nervous  it is  i guess you know me doctor montgomery  yes  going to oakdale  i am  so am i if you dont mind ill walk with you i want to talk to you  what do you wish demanded dave the road was rather a lonely one and he did not fancy the doctor for a companion  ive been wanting to see you for some time porter answered hooker montgomery hesitatingly as if not knowing how to begin fact is i went up to the school hoping to meet you  why didnt you call for me if you wanted to see me  wellerthe fact is doctor clay and i are not on good terms thats why to tell you the truth i once sold some of my medicines to some of his hired help and he didnt like it he thinks my medicines are noterreliable but they are sir they aremore reliable than those of most physicians and hooker montgomery tried to draw himself up and look dignified but to dave the effort was a failure he could read the fellow thoroughly and knew him to be what is commonly called a fakir pure and simple  what did you want of me asked dave as they walked on in the direction of oakdale  i wished to see you on an important business matter  business what business  i will come to that presently porter but it is important very important i can assure you i was going to ask you to call at a certain place in rockville and see me about it  what place  a boardinghouse at which i am stopping it is a very nice place located on the river and kept by a lady named dunnmrs margaret dunn  at once dave remembered the letter picked up on bush islandthe letter written by doctor montgomery and asking jasniff to meet him at dunns on the river in that communication the doctor had said he would aid jasniff all he could provided the rockville student would assist him in some transaction involving little riskwhich would mean that there must be something shady about it  cant you explain the business to me without my going to rockville he asked  i cannot i have some things at the boardinghousesome letters and documentsi wish to show you day after tomorrow is saturday cant you come to rockville in the afternoon and see me i can assure you sir it is very important very important indeed and doctor montgomery gave dave a mysterious look  do the letters and documents concern me personally  they concern you andshall i tell you yes i will they concern you and your sister but dont ask me to say more now i will explain all when you come to see me  dave began to think rapidly this fellow was friendly with jasniff and probably with merwell also once merwell had caused laura porter much annoyance by holding certain letters she had written was it possible merwell still had some of her letters and was he planning to make more trouble because of them  i dont understand this business doctor montgomery he said frankly if it was so important why didnt you write to me or telephone  i will explain this is important to you and your sister it would hurt your reputation to make anything public i want to do things on the quiet see acting entirely in your interests porter you will understand it all when you call andersee the letters and documents and the photographs especially the photographs  all right thenill comeif i can get off  about three oclock in the afternoon  between three and four  very good sir very good indeed you will not regret coming i can assure you sir but one thing more let me caution you to say nothing to your school friends of this visit i wish you to come entirely alone  why alone demanded dave suspiciously  because i wish to protect myself as well as you and your sister i want no witnesses to our meeting as i wish to avoid all trouble i shall be alone and i wish you to be alone also  this is a mighty strange proceeding  possibly porter but you will understand everything when you call you need not be afraid at present i am the only boarder mrs dunn has and she is old and somewhat deaf the house is on the river road the fourth place above the sawmill it is painted light yellow you cant miss it  and you wont tell me any more at present  i cannot but on saturday afternoon if you will come to me alone you shall know all  very well  and one thing more porter i am going to do you and your family a great favor  well  i am a poor man i could have made money out of my remedies had i charged as some physicians do but instead i wished to aid humanity and so sold my priceless medicines for a song yes i am poor sir and i need money if i aid you hooker montgomery paused suggestively  if you really do me a favor you shall be well paid for it doctor montgomery replied dave promptly  you mean that and now the doctors voice took on a sudden note of keen interest  i do  they tell me your folks are rich  we are well off  ah ahem very good then if i do a very great favor for you probably you willerappreciate it  yes sir  then it is settled porter and i shall look for you about three oclock on saturday sure and you are to come entirely alone  i understand but listen doctor montgomery went on dave and his voice grew stern there is to be no underhanded work in this if there iswell youll get the worst of it  oh no nothing of that sort i can assure you sir you have absolutely nothing to fear answered the man hurriedly but his eyes were rather shifty as he spoke  all right ill be on handif i can get away  they had now gained a crossroads and here the doctor halted he looked at dave as if on the point of speaking again then simply jerked his head in an attempted dignified fashion and hurried off around a bend and out of sight  it would be hard to analyze daves feelings as he proceeded on his errand to oakdale he wondered if doctor montgomery was acting on his own account or for merwell and jasniff and he also wondered what the mysterious letters and documents and photographs could be was it possible that laura had once given her photograph to merwell or had it taken when in that rascals company if the latter was true merwell would know that the porters would give a good deal to get the picture and have the negative destroyed  perhaps it is only a scheme to get me to rockville and to some place where jasniff and merwell can lay hands on me he mused theyd like nothing better than to black my eyes and pound me to a jelly if i go there alone ill have to keep my eyes wide open  then dave remembered what the doctor had said about being a poor man and needing money perhaps the fellow thought to bleed him not only in the interest of jasniff and merwell but also for himself  hell not get a cent out of me unless he has something of real value to turn over to me dave decided if its only a blackmailing scheme hell find me as sharp as himself he could make nothing of the fact that the doctor had at first tried to avoid him  he was half tempted to tell roger and phil about the affair but at last decided to see it through alone if there really was something in it about private letters and photographs he would prefer that his chums know nothing of it  all that evening and throughout friday dave was very thoughtful his chums noticed it and roger and phil both asked what was wrong  nothing wrong he answered with a faint smile  youve got something on your mind dave went on the senators son struck a new girl or has jessie struck a new fellow  not as bad as that roger i was just wondering if i should buy a red necktie or a blue one  rats its a girl ill wager a new hat  or else dave is thinking out some new essay with which to capture a prize suggested phil  dont you worry about me answered dave come on out and have a skate and thus the subject was dismissed for the time being  the leming river was in fine condition for skating and fully two score of students were out some cutting fancy figures and a few racing among the number was nat poole clad in a new crimson sweater and wearing a brand new pair of long hockey skates  nat is training for hockey said roger he says he is going to organize a team  well well organize one too answered dave i always did like field hockey and i know id like it on the ice  come on dave shouted ben circling up on his skates and doing a spread eagle  come on where  get into the race we want you and phil and roger too  what race is that  mr dodsworth wants all the big boys in it its a race up the river for a mile and back to the boathouse the winner gets a silver leadpencil sharpener  all right im in that cried the shipowners son i need a sharpener  so do i added roger how about it dave  ill go in although my skates are not as sharp as they might be  a crowd had gathered to see the race and in a few minutes the contestants were lined up by the gymnastic teacher the starters numbered fourteen and included nat poole dave roger phil shadow ben and plum  all ready asked mr dodsworth then go and away went the long line the skates flashing brightly in the clear sunlight and the onlookers cheering and uttering words of encouragement to their favorites     chapter xxiv  a race on skates   go it everybody  may the best skater win  dont try to skate too fast ben remember the race is two miles long  hello there goes one fellow down  its luke watson he has lost his skate  the last report was correct and as the skate could not be adjusted without the loss of some time luke gave up and watched the others  nat poole was exceedingly anxious to win the race and he had been partly instrumental in getting up the contest his new skates were of the best and it must be admitted that nat was no mean skater  phil had good skates and so had roger daves skates were only fair and were very much in need of sharpening  away went nat at top speed soon drawing half a dozen yards ahead of his competitors behind him came a student named powers and then followed ben roger phil dave and the others  i dont think i can win sang out dave to his chums these skates slip too much but ill do my best  come on you slowcoaches cried ben merrily and then he shot forward until he was abreast of nat seeing this the moneylenders son put on an extra burst of speed and went ahead again  say nat poole is certainly skating well cried one of the onlookers hell make a record if he keeps it up  i dont think he can keep it up answered another  in a very few minutes the turning point was gained and nat made a sharp curve and started back the turn brought him directly in front of dave  clear the track he roared clear the track i say  clear the track yourself answered dave nevertheless as nat came closer he swerved a little to one side so that the moneylenders son might pass as nat swept on he swung his arms freely and one fist took dave in the side  foul foul cried several who saw the move  it was his own fault nat retorted i told him to get out of the way and off he started for the finishing line  dave said nothing but kept on reaching the turning point a few seconds later phil and roger were just ahead of him and plum was beside him  go on and win he shouted i cant keep up with these skates  here goes for a finish yelled phil and darted ahead with roger at his heels then plum flashed forward and soon the three were side by side with dave about three yards to the rear followed by powers  coming down the homestretch nat poole thought he had it all to himself he was glad of it for he had set such a fast pace at the start that he was becoming winded and he had to fairly gasp for breath he looked over his shoulder and as nobody was near he slackened his speed a little  keep it up nat yelled one of his supporters go it old man  morr and lawrence are crawling up  so is plum  these last cries startled nat and he sought to strike out as he had at the start but his wind was now completely goneand the finishing line was still a quarter of a mile away  there goes morr to the front  lawrence is after him and so is plum  here comes basswood  whats the matter with porter he is dropping behind  he said his skates were dull  oh thats only an excuse sneered one of the students who had been put off of the football eleven that term  its true answered tom hally i saw the skates myself cant you see how he slips when he strikes out  on and on went the skaters nat was still ahead but now roger and phil came up on one side and gus plum on the other while ben came up close in the rear behind ben was dave determined to see the race out even if he did not win  with the finishing line but a hundred feet away phil roger and gus plum shot to the front then ben followed nat poole tried to keep up but could not then of a sudden dave went ahead also  nat is dropping behind  he put on too much steam at the start  there goes porter ahead of him  see morr lawrence and plum are even  yes and there comes ben basswood up to them  here they come clear the way everybody  with a rush the skaters came on for one brief instant roger was ahead but then the others put on a burst of speed and over the line they came amid a great yelling and cheering  a tie between morr plum and lawrence  and basswood and porter tied for second place  nat poole wasnt in it after all  my skate got loose grumbled nat as he came up slowly if it hadnt been for that i would have won  thats an old excuse nat shouted a boy in the rear of the crowd invent something new and a laugh went up that angered the moneylenders son greatly he took his defeat bitterly and lost no time in leaving the ice and disappearing from view  a fine race declared mr dodsworth but i dont know how i am to award the prize  cut it in three parts suggested buster  say that puts me in mind of a story came from shadow an old irishman was dying and wanted to make his will how do ye want to lave yer money pat asked his friend sure says pat i want to lave it all to me woif an me four childer equal loike so ivery wan gits a quarter  we might have another race suggested mr dodsworth that is if you are not too tiredi mean of course a race between those who were tied  oh let us cut sticks for it suggested phil  that will suit me said plum  me too said the senators son i am too tired to race again  so the three lads drew sticks for the prize and gus plum won  hello im in luck cried gus and looked much pleased the silver leadpencil sharpener was passed over to him and he thanked the gymnastic instructor warmly for it  i am glad he got it since it pleases him said phil to roger and the senators son nodded in agreement  the only boy who felt sore over the race was nat poole and he continued to declare that he would have won had his skate not come loose  but just wait he said to some of the students ill show em what i can do when we get to playing hockey and that very night he started in to organize an icehockey team he did not consult mr dodsworth or andrew dale fearing that they would not favor his selection of players  they have nothing to do with hockey nat explained to his friends all they have to look after is baseball and football and track athletics doctor clay didnt say a word about ice hockey or field hockey either this was true the master of the hall having probably forgotten all about those sports nevertheless it was understood by the majority of the students that all games and contests held with parties outside of oak hall were to come under the supervision of the gymnastic instructor and andrew dale  what are you going to do with yourself tomorrow afternoon asked roger of dave on going to bed friday  i have a little business to attend to in rockville roger  is that so want me to go along  this was a question dave had dreaded to have asked and he hardly knew how to answer he determined to be as frank as possible  no roger i am sorry but the party i am going to see asked me to come alone  oh all right i just thought id mention it  if it hadnt been for that i should like very much to have you and phil along continued dave earnestly but i cant take anybody  must be going to see a girl and the senators son looked at his chum quizzically  no it is not a girl now please dont ask me any more questions  just as you say dave answered roger and then began to get ready to go to bed he could not help but wonder what the business was and why dave was so secretive about it  in the morning dave had to go through the same kind of a scene with phil the shipowners son was as much mystified as roger and after dave had departed the pair walked into the warm gymnasium to talk the matter over  dave has something on his mind said roger i noticed it yesterday  so did i roger what is it do you suppose  i dont know excepting it may be about merwell and jasniff he said it wasnt about those girls  do you think he is going to meet merwell and jasniff in rockville  possibly i cant think of anything else  if dave got into trouble id like to be on hand to help him  so would i but i guess dave knows how to take care of himself and then the subject was dropped and the two students began to exercise with some indian clubs  in the meantime dave was on his way to rockville as the road was clear of snow he used his bicycle and soon covered the distance to the town he passed along the river road to the sawmill and then kept his eyes open for mrs dunns house  this must be the place he said to himself as he reached a dilapidated residence located in what had once been a fine flower garden but which was now a tangle of rank bushes and weeds the gate was off and leaping from his wheel he trundled his bicycle along the chokedup garden path to the front piazza then leaving his wheel against a tree he mounted the steps and rang the oldfashioned turn bell  dave had approached the house boldly thinking that possibly somebody might be watching him from behind the blinds of the windows all of which were closed yet he was on his guard and in the lining of his overcoat he carried a stout stick with which to defend himself should such a course be necessary  no one answered his first summons and he rang the rusty bell a second time then the front door was opened and doctor montgomery showed himself  ah how do you do he said with a bland smile walk right in mr porter i see you are on time  dave hesitated for a moment and then entered the broad hallway of the house in front of him was a long flight of stairs leading to the second floor and on either side were doors leading to the parlor and to a diningroom  mrs dunn isnt feeling very well so i had to come to the door myself explained hooker montgomery smoothly she used to take some drugstore medicine and it did her no good now she is taking my remedies and she will soon be herself he said this so naturally that dave was thrown a little off his guard as a matter of fact mrs dunn was not at home having gone away to visit a sister in albany it was because of her absence that the tricky doctor had invited dave to come to the house had she been at home his schemes would have necessitated meeting dave somewhere else  doctor i havent much time to spare so i hope you will get at the bottom of what you want without delay said dave after the door had been closed and locked by the physician it was so dark in the hall he could hardly see  ill not take much of your time sirnot over half an hour at the most was the reply from hooker montgomery but all of the documents and letters and photographs are in my room on the second floor kindly come up there and look at them and the man started up the stairs dave hesitated for a moment wondering if it would be best to go up and then followed     chapter xxv  in the hands of the enemy   at the head of the stairs the doctor paused and then opened a door leading to a back bedroom the apartment had two windows but the blinds were closed what little light there was coming in through the turneddown slats  i have to shut off a good deal of light on account of my eyes explained the doctor as he saw dave glance at the blinds my eyes are very weak and i am told that the sunlight is very bad for them  i am sorry to hear that answered dave  he hardly knew what to say or how to act his reception had not been what he had anticipated and he could not imagine what was coming next  here are some of the documents i wish you to look over firstand then well talk business said hooker montgomery pointing to a mass of legallooking papers lying on the bed you can take them to the window if you wish and he sank down in a rockingchair as if tired out and placed both hands over his eyes  curious to know what the documents might contain of importance to him dave took some of them up and stepped close to one of the windows the writing was poor and it was hard to make out what had been written  his face was bent closely over one of the pages when of a sudden he felt some unusual movement behind him he started to turn but before he could do so a big bag was thrown over his head and arms and tied around his waist at the same instant he was tackled around the legs and his ankles were tied together  of course he struggled and for several minutes his wouldbe captors had all they could do to hold him but he had been taken so completely off his guard that resistance proved useless soon a rope was passed around the bag and over his arms and further struggling was out of the question  who are you he demanded in a muffled tone for inside of the bag it was all he could do to breathe the covering was so heavy he could not see a thing  no answer was vouchsafed to his question he was backed up against the bed and made to sit down and then he heard his captors leave the room locking the door after them  dave was both chagrined and angrychagrined to think that he had been taken in so easily and angry to think that he was a prisoner and at his captors mercy  this must be the work of merwell and jasniff he thought they simply hired the doctor to get me here there is nothing in the story of documents letters and photographs what a fool i was to walk into the trap  and then he wondered when his captors would return and what they proposed to do with him  for fully a quarter of an hour dave waited straining his ears to catch every sound from below came a murmur of voices but what was said he could not learn once he thought he recognized jasniffs rough tones but he was not sure  tired of sitting on the edge of the bed dave got up and tried to move around then he made the discovery that his ankles were tied to a rope that was secured to the bed and that the latter was stationary  im a prisoner and no mistake he reasoned grimly i wonder how long they intend to keep me here  the room was cold and he was glad that he had his overcoat on his cap had fallen off inside the bag but his thick hair and the bag prevented his catching cold in the head  guess ill wake them up a bit he thought and so commenced to stamp on the floor then he stamped louder until he felt he must be knocking the plaster from the ceiling below he was in the midst of the stamping when the door of the room was thrown open and somebody came in  stop that noise or ill knock you down said a sharp voice and at the same instant a strong hand was placed on his shoulder and he was given a vigorous shake  dave was surprised for the voice was not that of doctor montgomery neither did it belong to merwell nor jasniff yet in some way the voice sounded familiar  what are you going to do with me demanded dave as he stopped his stamping  youll find that out later porter now keep quietif you know when you are well off  i want to know now you have no right to treat me in this fashion ill have you and doctor montgomery put in jail for it  you shut up cried the stranger and he gave dave a shove that sent him back on the bed you make any more noise and ill quiet you in a way you wont like and then the fellow left the room again and the door was locked as before  feeling that he might be attacked and seriously injured if he kept up the noise dave remained quiet and thus the remainder of the afternoon passed as night came on the room became dark and extra cold and he shivered in spite of himself  if they leave me here all night ill be frozen stiff he thought grimly oh why didnt i tell roger and phil where i was going they might come to the rescue  after another wait dave heard more talking below and then three persons came upstairs and into the room  now you keep real quiet and you wont get hurt said the person who had spoken before if you start to raise a rowwell youll wish you hadnt thats all  what are you going to do  keep quiet and youll find out before very long  do you know this is a very highhanded proceeding  shut up  the tone was extra sharp and dave received a rough shake of the shoulder not knowing but what he might be knocked down he relapsed into silence  presently his feet were unfastened and he was led out of the room and down the stairs then the party made its way to the rear of the house and went outside  now we are going to give you a little sleighride for your health said the person who had spoken before  as there was no snow on the ground dave felt this must mean a ride on the river and he was not mistaken a horse and a low boxsleigh were at hand and into the turnout dave was lifted the fellow who had spoken getting on one side of him and somebody else on the other then still another party took up the reins and started to drive off over the ice which was just thick enough to bear the weight of such an outfit  although daves arms were tied to his sides he could move his hands a little and he managed to get hold of a goodsized pin which had been fastened to a corner of his overcoat as the sleigh moved over the smooth surface of the river he resolved to make an effort to learn the identity of the silent fellow beside him and so moved the pin around and shoved it towards the individual as far as possible  ouch came the sudden exclamation as the point of the pin reached its mark and the fellow leaped partly to his feet what in thunder and then the speaker broke off short  i know you link merwell cried dave i thought all along it was you  im not merwell growled the fellow in a deep voice dont you dare to stick me with that pin again or ill mash you and then he refused to say any more but he gave daves arm such a pinch that it was black and blue for a long time afterwards  with the bag over his head dave could not hear very well yet he felt tolerably certain that the fellow was link merwell and if this was so then most likely the driver of the sleigh was nick jasniff but who the third party could be was still a mystery  some old enemy i have forgotten reasoned the captive and then he wondered where he was being taken and for what purpose  after a ride of half an hour the sleigh came to a halt and dave was ordered to get out then he was marched up a steep bank and up some steps a door was opened and all of the party entered a building of some sort he was placed in a room and tied fast to a ring fastened in the floor  now you behave yourself and youll soon be freed and treated to a hot supper said the man who appeared to be the spokesman for the crowd but if you make a row youll not be freed and youll not get a mouthful  then dave was left alone once more and all three of his captors apparently left the building  the room was warm and for this the captive was grateful a chair had been placed for him to sit upon so he was fairly comfortable an hour passed and during that time all was silent then somebody came in and started to release his arms and take the bag from his head  it was a man tall and muscular and dave felt sure he had seen him before but where he could not remember the man wore a mask made of a handkerchief with holes cut in it for his eyes  sorry i cant let you go just yet he said but here is something to eat and to drink and he pointed to a table upon which rested a lamp for it was now late in the evening and dark on the table was a cup of hot tea and several cheese sandwiches and a small bakers pie  well im hungry thats certain said dave grimly and if ive got to stay here i might as well eat  thats the sensible way to talk answered the man  when are you going to let me go  i cant say yetmost likely in the morning  why did you bring me here  just for fun  youve taken a lot of trouble for your fun said dave he did not believe the mans statement  eat your supper porter growled the man and sank down on a chair close to the door no funny work now mind you and he brandished the very stick dave had carried for selfprotection  there was no help for it and sitting down to the table dave began to eat and to drink the sandwiches were fresh and so was the pie and as the ride in the keen air had given him an appetite he disposed of them quickly the tea tasted rather bitter but he was dry and speedily drained the cup the man watched him drink with evident satisfaction  now you had better lie down and try and get a little rest said the fellow of the mask when i want you ill call you and so speaking he left the room locking the door after him  as soon as the man was gone dave tried to loosen the rope that bound his feet together it was a hard task and took some time and bending over seemed to make his head swim when he straightened up his head grew even more dizzy and almost before he knew it he was staggering around  what a queer sensation was his thought what in the world is the matter with me and then like a flash came the answer that tea it must have been drugged  the captive was right in his surmise the tea had been drugged and soon poor dave felt so dizzy he had to rest on the bed he tried several times to rouse up and then his senses forsook him completely  dave had been unconscious for about a quarter of an hour when the man came in looked at him and shook him then he went below  well weve got him he said to the others he is practically dead to the world  good was the answer better bring him down right away we want to get this job over     chapter xxvi  a dash for liberty   when dave regained his senses he found himself in the tonneau of a big automobile that was speeding swiftly over a dark country road on either side of him sat a person who was masked and in front were two persons whose faces he could not see his hands were tied behind him and his ankles were made fast to the footrest in the bottom of the tonneau  he wondered where he was being taken but knew it would be useless to ask any questions how long he had been unconscious he did not know but felt it must have been a considerable time for it was now night and whenever they passed a farmhouse it was without lights showing the occupants had gone to bed  dave fully realized that he was in a position of peril his enemies had treated him in an outrageous fashion and what they proposed to do next there was no telling he felt that he must escape if it could possibly be accomplished  he had roused up a little but now deemed it best to let the others think he was still unconscious accordingly he uttered a deep sigh and then slipped further down on the seat and let his head fall forward on his breast  pretty well dosed he heard one of the party murmur and now he was sure he recognized nick jasniffs voice  say shime i hope you didnt give him too much of the drug said another of the party and dave felt certain it was link merwell who was speaking if he shouldnt recover  oh hell come around all right enough growled the man called shime he was running the automobile and now dave was able to place him as a fellow who worked around a livery stable and garage in rockville shime was a drinking man and his reputation was far from an enviable one  how much further have we to go asked jasniff after a few minutes of silence  not far answered the driver of the automobile well take to the side road now hold fast its pretty rough and then the touring car turned off the main highway and began bumping over the rocks and ruts of a narrow wood road the way was uphill and the driver had to throw in his second speed to gain the top of the rise then the car made a sharp turn and halted in front of a stone building  is this the place asked jasniff  yes answered shime wait till i light a lantern and then you can bring him in  i shall have to care for him when we are in the house said the fourth person of the party who had carried dave off it was doctor montgomery and his breath was thick from liquor  still thinking he might get a chance to escape if he made out that he was unconscious dave hung limp in the automobile and allowed his captors to lift him out and place him on the ground then he was carried into the stone building and placed on a bench  you certainly dosed him strongly said hooker montgomery i had better make an examination loosen up his hands and feet  a little bit alarmed jasniff and merwell set to work and released dave from his bonds in the meantime shime had lit a lantern and placed it on a rough table doctor montgomery got out a medicine case and began to mix up a potion in a glass  this ought to bring him around he said in a thick unsteady voice  dave did not dare to look around but by the draught in the room he knew that the door must have been left open probably to give him more air he did not think the disreputable physician was in any condition to administer his medicines and he did not propose to swallow any if he could avoid it  i must escape he thought and with a moan as if in great pain he twisted around and opened his eyes for an instant  that instant was long enough for him to locate the doorway and beyond he made out a stretch of woodland lit up by the lamps of the automobile between him and the doorway stood merwell and jasniff with shime and the doctor on the other side  shall i hold his head doctor asked merwell maybe he wont be able to swallow if  merwell got no further for just then dave leaped to his feet with an agility that surprised even himself stiff though he was he ran at merwell hurling him flat then he bumped into jasniff who made a weak attempt to stop him the two swung around and jasniff was sent crashing into the table knocking over the lantern then dave leaped for the doorway  stop him  he must not get away  ouch dont step on me came from link merwell he was on his back and jasniffs foot had landed on his stomach  the four rascals had been taken completely by surprise as the lantern fell it went out and in his endeavor to get to the doorway shime bumped into jasniff the doctor ran into the bench and his glass of medicine went splashing into merwells face eliciting another protest from that bully  dave did not care about what happened in the building his one thought was to get away for he fully realized that in a handtohand encounter he would be no match for his four enemies  had he had time he might have jumped into the automobile and started up the machine but he was afraid to risk this and so ran down the wood road a short distance and then plunged into the bushes he did not stop there but kept on until he calculated that he was a full quarter of a mile from the stone building  i dont think they can follow me to here at least not in the darkness he told himself  he stopped to rest and to consider what he had best do next the effects of the drug were now entirely gone and he felt once more like himself  i ought to have the whole crowd locked up he reasoned but it would be the testimony of one against four and they would most likely deny everything  he went on again and presently came out on the main highway as he did this he saw the flash of some lamps in the distance he crouched down behind some bushes and a minute later saw the automobile whizz by with his enemies in it  they are going back he reasoned i suppose now i have gotten away from them merwell and jasniff will return to the academy as fast as they can and shime and the doctor will return to rockville and theyll all play the innocent  as he walked on dave wondered what the plot against him was he felt convinced that carrying him off was only the beginning of it  well whatever it was i nipped it in the bud he thought perhaps some day ill find out all about itsome day when i can corner one or another of that rascally bunch i take it that shime and montgomery are simply in the employ of jasniff and merwell both of them are hard drinkers and willing to do almost anything to get a few dollars  not far down the highway dave passed a signboard which told him that rockville was ten miles away  i cant walk ten miles he thought i had better see if i cant get accommodations at some farmhouse and then drive over to the school after breakfast  with this idea in view he kept on until he reached a spot where the railroad crossed the highway as he did this he saw a freight train standing near a siding where a milk car was to be taken on  does this train go to oakdale he asked of one of the hands  yes but it isnt a passenger train was the reply  cant you take me along questioned dave i wish to get to oakdale very much and without delay  the train hand looked dave over by the light of his lantern he saw that the youth was no tramp  all right get in the caboose he said but it will cost you a smoke  i havent any cigars but you can buy yourself some answered dave and passed over a quarter of a dollar which the train hand pocketed with satisfaction  soon the train was under way and in less than half an hour they reached the siding at oakdale and there dave jumped off by his watch the lad saw that it was three oclock sunday morning without delay he struck off on foot for the school  as he hurried on he wondered what he had best do on arriving at oak hall should he rouse up doctor clay and tell the master the whole story or would it be better to say nothing and await developments  if i say anything there will be a great hullabaloo but it wont prove anything he reasoned merwell and jasniff will deny everything and so will shime and that fake doctor might take it into his head to sue me for slander no ill fight my own battles and see if i cant corner them on my own hook but ill tell phil and roger  arriving at the school grounds dave wondered how he was going to get in without being observed he tried all the doors to find each locked  if i ring the bell ill have to explain matters he said to himself ill see if i cant rouse up some of the fellows  he walked around to the window of no 11 and threw several handsful of gravel up against the glass at first there was no response but presently the window was raised and rogers head appeared  is that you dave asked the senators son in a low voice  yes roger will you slip down and let me in  sure thing will the side door do  yes  no more was said and the window was closed dave hurried to the door mentioned and a moment later roger opened it and he entered then both hurried upstairs making as little noise as possible  what kept you so long asked the senators son while dave was undressing  ill tell you and phil in the morning was daves reply ive got a yarn to spin you will hardly believe and then he went to bed but it was a long time before he was able to drop asleep and then his dreams were little short of a nightmare  it was not until sunday afternoon that dave got a chance to tell his two chums the particulars of what had occurred they listened with keen attention to all he said and the face of each plainly expressed his amazement  thats the worst ever was rogers comment what were they going to do with you dave  i dont know  i believe it was some deeplaid plot said phil your getting away spoiled it all  for them yesbut not for me answered dave with something of a grin i dont know what i escaped but i am mighty glad i got away  what about your bicycle asked the senators son arent you going to try to get that back  certainlyand i am going to interview that doctor montgomery tooif i can catch him but i want you two to go along answered dave  he was glad to take it easy for the rest of the day on monday after school the three boys went to rockville on bicycles dave borrowing a wheel belonging to buster they rode straight to the dunn house to find it locked up tightly in the yard was daves machine standing against the tree as he had left it  i guess the doctor has come and gone said dave after trying all the doors most likely hell make himself scarce for a while  why not interview that fellow shime suggested phil  i will answered dave and taking the extra wheel along the three students rode around to the rockville livery stable and garage here dave asked the proprietor about shime  he has gone said the man sourly day before yesterday he took one of my best autos for a joy ride when he came back this morning i discharged him he took his things and got outand i dont know where he went to  this was as much as the garage owner could tell and with it dave had to be content he and his chums turned away and a little later set out on the return to oak hall     chapter xxvii  a game of ice hockey   i reckon you scared them pretty thoroughly dave  i am glad of it if i did answered dave i hope i scared them so much that they never bother me again  several days had passed and in that time dave had learned many things from rockville had come the news that doctor montgomery had left rather suddenly without stating where he was going and dave had likewise learned that shime had not shown himself since his discharge by the garage owner and now from the military academy came word that merwell and jasniff had obtained leave of absence for a week  they say doctor montgomery must have been getting ready to leave said phil who had been to rockville he owes a board bill at the hotel as well as at his boardinghouse mrs dunn is back and is very angry to think the doctor got away during her absence  i suppose merwell and jasniff think the affair will blow over by the time they return said roger well dave you can do as you please but if i were you id try to corner them  if i did that roger theyd try to squirm out of it somehow what id like to do best of all would be to give merwell and jasniff a good thrashing  well they deserve that dave  i believe they were going to place you in some kind of an awkward position came from phil maybe they were going to commit some crime and try to fasten it on you  well whatever it was they got left declared dave  by the way did you see the notice nat poole posted up in the gym asked roger during a pause  no what is it  he has lost a watchchain charm and he offers a dollar reward for its return  as if the fellows wouldnt return it without a reward if it was found exclaimed phil that just shows nats natural meanness of mind  nat is busy organizing his icehockey team said roger they are going out to practice this afternoon  which puts me in mind that we were going to organize a hockey team also returned dave i guess the sooner we get at it the better  the ice on the river was clear and smooth ideal for hockey playing and that season ice hockey was taken up in earnest at both oak hall and rockville nat poole had little difficulty in organizing a team he being the captain and playing rover the others on his team were made up of those who had played with him on the football eleven and some new students at the hall  dave had studied the play and the players with care and he finally made up a team as follows      goal sam day     point dave porter captain     cover point phil lawrence     center roger morr     rover gus plum     left wing maurice hamilton     right wing ben basswood     substitutes tom atwood luke watson and henry babcock  you have got to play as if you meant it if you want to win any games said dave to his fellowplayers and so much in earnest did he become that between ice hockey and his studies he completely forgot about the adventure which had followed his visit to doctor montgomery  nat poole could not help but boast of what his team could do and when a challenge came to oak hall from rockville to play a game he wanted to accept it without delay but before he could do so mr dodsworth interfered  we have two hockey teams in this school said the instructor your seven and that of which dave porter is captain i think it would be no more than fair that you play a game between you and that the winner be permitted to accept the rockville challenge  this did not suit nat at all as he wanted matters entirely his own way but nearly every boy in the school sided with mr dodsworth so at last the moneylenders son had to agree to play the game with daves team and it was decided that this game should take place weather permitting the following saturday and that the game with rockville should come off one week later  to hear nat poole talk you would think he had won the game already said roger to the others on daves seven he makes me sick  speaking of having it won already puts me in mind of a story came from shadow a little girl went in the pantry and stayed quite a while when she came out she asked her mother ma can i have a cruller yes my dear answered ma then she saw that the little girl wasnt eating anything so she asked why dont you take a cruller alice oh says alice i had that when i first went to the pantry  wow murmured sam that joke came from the ark  it was told to pharaoh by napoleon when they were hunting for the north pole added plum  well i dont think it hits nat pooles case was sams comment he wont get any cruller in this game  right you are cried plum  plum was as anxious as anybody to defeat the moneylenders son since the former bully had turned over a new leaf nat was constantly saying mean things about him and it was only guss grim determination to keep the peace that kept him from pitching into nat roughshod in keeping his hands off nat plum had a harder battle to fight than if he had attacked the moneylenders son bodily  it had to be admitted that as the day for the contest between the two oak hall sevens approached pooles team was in good shape nat had drilled them with care and had profited by the work of two of the players who had been on another boardingschool seven the winter previous one of these players knew several sharp tricks and it was hoped that these tricks would help to defeat daves seven  the game was to be played under the interscholastic rules of that year with two halves of twenty minutes each and an intermission of ten minutes mr dodsworth was the referee and the accustomed goal umpires and timekeepers were also selected the field had already been marked on the ice and the goal nets set so that everything was in readiness for the match each player had the regulation icehockey stick and wore regulation hockey skates well sharpened for the occasion  well weve got our work cut out for us said phil as he came out for practice  beware of offside plays warned dave dont give pooles crowd a chance to claim offplay or foulsand dont let them do anything unfair without a protest  just before the play was to start chip macklin beckoned to dave  look out for bolton he whispered as dave skated up  why do you say that chip  i heard him and nat whispering together bolton said their side must winhe had a bet on it with somebody then nat advised him to take chanceswhich means that they may club you or kick you with their skates  well be on the lookout answered dave and he immediately let the others know what poole and bolton had in mind to do  amid a cheering for both sides the puck was brought out and placed on the ice directly in the center of the field and between the sticks of two of the players then the whistle blew and the contest commenced  back and forth over the smooth ice flew the rubber disc first towards one goal and then towards the other dave got it and carried it far down the field and then turned it over to plum gus lost it to poole who knocked it over to a player named foss it came dangerously close to daves goal but was sent spinning forward again by sam and then followed a turning and twisting back and forth in the midst of which nat poole went flat on his back and phil went sprawling over him  foul foul yelled nat as he scrambled up you did that on purpose  i did not answered phil with flashing eyes i guess you fell on purpose  there was no foul decided mr dodsworth it was simply an accident all around and then the play was resumed  at the end of eight minutes of play daves team rushed the puck forward once more nats team tried its best to send the disc back but lost it by a bad fumble by bolton then straight into the goal net flew the puck  hurrah one goal for porters team  thats the way to do it  humph they got that by a fluke growled bolton  they got it because of your error answered one of the students at the side line  again the puck was placed in the center of the field and once more the struggle was renewed this time the disc was again forced close to the porter goal but without avail sam sent it back and dave shot it to phil who whizzed the puck over to shadow then came a mixup and the puck flew close to the poole goal  back with it was the cry dont let em score another goal  a player named gardener had the puck he was about to send it to bolton when phil interfered and sent the disc over to ben basswood as ben swept over the ice with the disc bolton rushed forward swinging his hockey stick viciously  look out yelled somebody and many saw a swing of the stick that came dangerously close to phils head  bolton you try that again and ill knock you down said phil his eyes flashing fire as he spoke  myermy stick slipped stammered bolton and turned away quickly before more could be said a cheer went up  another goal for the porter team  thats the way to play ice hockey  it was true ben had made the second goal with five minutes more of the half to play the puck was placed in position once again  say weve got to do something growled nat poole  all right do it answered one of the team who had seen nat make several errors and who was growing disgusted  both nat and bolton were ugly and showed it in every movement the puck was worked down into the porter territory but again without avail and as it commenced to move in the opposite direction nat and bolton grew furious nat gave his follower a meaning look and a minute later bolton swung his hockey stick around almost on a line with daves shoulder  had the blow landed as intended dave would have been seriously lamed and possibly his arm might have been broken but roger was close at hand and in a flash the senators son thrust out his hockey stick so that the blow glanced off doing little harm  time called roger and it was granted and both teams at once gathered around dave and bolton  bolton that was done on purpose you cant deny it cried roger you did your best to injure dave  i did not roared bolton growing red in the face  he did he did was the general cry put him out  there was a great hubbub in the midst of which mr dodsworth consulted with andrew dale who was assistant referee then mr dodsworth came forward  bolton he said clearly and coldly you are retired  cant i play any more growled the student  no your conduct is unworthy of a gentleman and you must leave the field the game will proceed     chapter xxviii  a discovery of interest   it was a stinging rebuke and everybody within hearing felt its effect there was a sudden hush and then bolton turned and skated away muttering savagely under his breath  once more the game proceeded but before the puck could be gotten within striking distance of either goal the whistle blew and the first half of the game came to an end  wonder what nat poole thinks of his team now remarked roger as the boys gathered in a group to discuss the plays made  he is as mad as hops reported plum he says bolton was not to blame and that it wasnt fair for mr dodsworth to rule him off  they ought to be satisfied said messmer who was close by langley the substitute is as good as bolton if not better  say we must keep them from scoring in the second half cried ben that will break nats heart he has been blowing constantly that he was going to do us up  look out for tricks cautioned dave they may have something up their sleeve they havent tried yetalthough i doubt it  promptly on time the second half of the game started as soon as the puck was put into action it was seen that nats team had adopted new tactics this was to worry the disc along close to the side line and in such a manner that daves seven had to either miss it or run the risk of offside plays  get it out fellows cried dave and then gave a signal to bring it back this was not expected by the poole players and before they realized what was occurring the porter seven had the puck nearly to the goal net here a fierce fight occurred and the disc went back and forth with astonishing rapidity but at last dave got it and made a goal so swiftly and so neatly it brought forth tremendous applause  another for porters side  say they are piling em up arent they  come nat get in the game and show us what you can do  with a glum face nat poole ordered his team to their places and again the try for a goal started but the seven was now thoroughly demoralized and another goal was made by the porters in less than four minutes then followed three minutes of ragged work near the middle of the field and then the whistle blew and it was all over  and a regular slaughter for nat pooles team was the comment of one of the students  it knocked us out to take bolton out of the game grumbled nat that wasnt fair  bolton wasnt any better than the rest answered phil nat you were beaten fairly and squarely and you know it  oh shut up growled the moneylenders son and hurried away out of sight as soon as possible  well young gentlemen said mr dodsworth to dave and his followers you did very well and i am proud of you  mr dodsworth do you think we stand any chance of beating rockville asked dave earnestly  i do yes but it will be no easy work  not as easy as today eh put in ben with a grin  by no means basswood i have seen the rockville seven play two games and they are very quick and clever no you must not look for any walkover if you win it will only be by good cleancut work  then i can send an acceptance of their challenge questioned dave  yes and you had better do it at once answered the instructor and the letter was sent by special messenger within the hour  that evening the boys celebrated their victory by lighting a number of bonfires along the river they were allowed to be out an hour later than usual and skated and had a good time generally nat poole and his cronies were not in evidence but nobody missed them  i hope we dont get snow remarked dave on retiring a heavy fall would knock out the game with rockville  oh they could clear the ice answered phil but id like to see it stay clear  but this was not to be all day sunday the sky was overcast and by monday morning it was snowing furiously blotting out the landscape on all sides  here is where we stay indoors and do some studying remarked roger making a wry face  good chance to catch up was bens comment ive got to bone at some latin anyway  and i have a theme to finish added dave let us do all the studying we can he went on then if it clears off well have so much more time outdoors  this proposal was accepted by the lads of nos 11 and 12 and soon nearly all of them were at work over their lessons the exception was luke watson who said he was ahead in his studies for once  i am going to put my clothing in order said luke my closet and my bureau drawers are something fierce i hardly know where to find a necktie or a shoe any more  you ought to follow pollys example suggested dave he has everything as neat as a pin  its easy enough said the girlish student all youve got to do is to put everything in its proper place at the start and then put it back after you have used it  say that puts me in mind of a story began shadow once two boys  drop it  we are studying not listening to stories  throw a book at him if he opens his mouth again  all right if you dont want to hear it murmured shadow and turned to his own lessons  luke arranged his bureau drawers to his satisfaction and then went to his clothing closet out came several suits of clothing some shoes and slippers and a quantity of other things  i dont see why i am keeping these old slippers he murmured half to himself i havent worn em this term guess ill turn em over to pop swingly he might get a little good out of em  did you speak to me luke asked dave looking up from his books  no i was musing over these old slippers i am going to give em away  maybe some poor person would be glad to get them  i dont know any poor person around here ill turn em over to pop swingly he canhello whats this  luke had turned the slippers over in his hand and from the toe of one of them had dropped a small shining object luke picked it up with interest  why its a watch charm exclaimed dave coming forward  so it is how did that get in my slipper  whats that cried shadow coming over while some of the other students did the same  luke just found this watch charm stuck in the toe of one of his old slippers explained dave  that is nat pooles charmthe one he lost from his watchchain cried ben  are you sure ben  pretty sure yes ive seen it often enough to know it  yes it looks like nats charm said roger  and was that charm in your slipper questioned shadow excitedly  yes it just dropped out  were those slippers taken at the time all our shoes and boots and slippers disappeared continued shadow  yes say shadow you dont think  yes i do shouted the lad who had the reputation of walking in his sleep i think nat poole took those shoes slippers and boots and then got scared in some way and returned them and when he boxed em up he caught his watch charm in the slipper and the charm dropped inside  it looks reasonable was daves comment  you let me have that charm and ill find out about this went on shadow ill show him he cant do such a thing and then shove it off on me and make folks believe i took the shoes while i was walking in my sleep  going after nat now asked buster  yes  do you want anybody along asked dave better have witnesses to this  all right dave you come alongand you too phil i guess you want to know what became of that missing gym shoe  so i do answered the shipowners son  where is nat asked roger  i dont know but ill soon find out answered shadow with determination he had been deeply chagrined over the disappearance of the shoes boots and slippers and had felt it keenly when he was suspected of having walked in his sleep once again and made off with the foot coverings  the three students left the dormitory and from another lad learned that nat was in the library they sent a small boy after him stating that he was wanted at once at the den a room where the students sometimes congregated but which just then was deserted  wondering what was coming the moneylenders son soon put in an appearance he had not been told who wished to see him and his face fell when he saw shadow dave and phil  what do you want he asked surlily i am busy this afternoon  nat is this your watch charm the one you lost questioned shadow holding out the piece in his hand  sure it is cried the moneylenders son where did you find it  found it just where you lost itin luke watsons slipper  eh and nat looked startled  nat we have found you out cried shadow sternly you neednt attempt to deny it you took those shoes boots and slippers  who says so  i do  ii did not  yes you did  dont you know you were seen asked phil with a wink at his chums  it was only a chance shot but it told in a most unexpected way  say has tom hally been talking about me roared nat in sudden rage if he has illill  now take it easy advised dave nat dont you realize that this is a serious matter  i dont care ill fix hally see if i dont  at that moment the door opened and the boy who had been rescued from the hole in the snowy hollow came in with several chums  hally come here called phil  say did you give me away after all demanded nat poole rushing forward and catching tom hally by the arm  let go of me returned hally i dont know what you are talking about  yes you do you sneak  im no sneak and tom hallys eyes flashed dangerously  hally tell me did nat poole take our shoes and boots and slippers that night demanded dave  he did hally grew red in the face i wasnt going to mention it but now you ask me a direct question ill not tell a falsehood he took the shoes and hid them in the trunk room i caught him doing it but i thought it was only a joke and so kept silent then after you fellows rescued me from the hole in the snow i made nat send the shoes back at first i was going to tell on him but somehow i didnt want to play the sneak  i understand answered dave he turned to shadow this clears you  so it does shadow and i am mighty glad of it put in phil  yes it clears me answered the student who was known as a sleepwalker or at least i will be clearedafter i am done with nat poole and shadow looked at the moneylenders son in a manner that was full of grim significance     chapter xxix  hooker montgomerys revelation   what do you want demanded nat and his voice trembled a little for he realized that he was cornered  in the first place i think youll have to restore phils missing gym shoe remarked dave dryly how about it phil  thats so answered the shipowners son  ive got the shoe in my closet growled nat it dropped out when i was packing the box ill get it now  no you dont cried shadow you can get the shoe any time we will settle the rest of this affair before you leave  ieri dont understand stammered the moneylenders son youve got your shoes back what more do you want cant you stand for a joke  not that kind of a joke nat you put me in a false lightmade everybody think i had walked off with the shoes in my sleepand you made the whole crowd buy new shoes we ought to make you pay that bill  i wont pay a cent youyouve got the new shoes  well youve got to settle with me anyway went on shadow firmly you can take your choice of two things if you wont explain to the whole crowd how the thing happened and wont apologize to me why im going to give you a sound thrashing thats all  humph  no humph about it you can take your choice  i wont apologize to you or to anybody  then youll get a sound thrashing nat poole  i am not afraid of you  you wont apologize  no  very well then remember i am going to give you the thrashing of your life the very first chance i get declared shadow and then without another word he left the den and dave and phil went with him  are you going to do what you just said shadow questioned phil  indeed i am ill teach him that he cant put off his dirty tricks on me declared the sleepwalker  when will you meet him  i dont know ill lay for him some day when he goes to town  hell keep out of your way most likely declared dave  never mind ill catch him some time declared shadow grimly  a little later the missing shoe was returned to phil nat poole showed himself only during class hours and it was plain to see that shadows threat had scared him he and bolton talked of squaring up with dave shadow and the others but nothing came of the discussion  you are not afraid of hamilton are you asked bolton of nat  of course i aint cried the moneylenders son  then why dont you challenge him to a regular fight  why ierthat is it wouldnt do stammered nat shadow would be just mean enough to let one of the teachers or the doctor hear about it and i might be expelled my father has been very strict lately so i dont dare do anything to worry him but if he attacks me ill defend myself dont you fear added nat boastfully it may be added here that nat and shadow met the very next afternoon back of the boathouse and though the moneylenders son tried to get away shadow pounced upon him and knocked him down and ended up by blackening nats left eye and making his nose bleed later on nat tried to square himself with his friends by stating that shadow had attacked him while he was feeling sick but it is doubtful if anybody believed this statement  by wednesday the storm cleared away and the air became clear and bracing word was sent in from rockville that unless another storm followed the ice on the river would be cleared off for the game of hockey as scheduled  well we must get into practice said dave and that very afternoon a portion of the river near the oak hall boathouse was scraped clear and the seven got to work under the eyes of mr dodsworth and andrew dale  rockville will do its best to win said roger if for no other reason than to wipe out the football defeat  and we must do our best to down em cried dave  i am going for a sleigh ride tomorrow announced phil ive hired a big sleigh from oakdale and i want the whole bunch to go  bully for phil cried ben a sleigh ride will suit me firstrate  where will you go asked shadow  i thought of going to hopperville and back that is about as far as we can go between four oclock and ten ill telephone to the hopperville hotel to have supper ready for us  phil youre a brick cried roger  will the doctor let us go asked ben  yes i asked him before i hired the sleigh  the thought of a sleigh ride was a pleasant one and phil had little difficulty in making up a party of eight including roger dave and ben  it will be moonlight said dave and that will make the riding extra fine  it was a merry crowd that climbed into the big sleigh on the following afternoon the turnout was filled with straw so that they might keep warm and was drawn by four good horses  now then let her go cried phil and the driver cracked his whip and they were off the envy of all the students who had been left behind  the road to hopperville lay through oakdale and rockville and as each town was passed the boys set up a cheer and blew the horns that had been brought along some folks cheered them in return and just as they were leaving the town where the military academy was located some cadets rushed from around a corner and pelted them with snowballs  never mind yelled roger as he dodged youll get yours next saturday  it was dark by the time hopperville was reached and all of the boys were glad enough to jump out of the sleigh and go into the hotel to warm up before sitting down to supper the horses and the turnout were taken around to the stables  the hotel was located on a corner and across the side street was another hotela resort that did not bear a particularly good reputation it had a bar attached to it and it was whispered that sporty men often went to the resort to gamble  the readingroom of one hotel faced the other and as dave roger and phil entered one apartment they noticed that the one across the way was lit up and that the window curtains had not been lowered then dave gave a sudden cry of surprise  look at that man over there phil  why it is doctor montgomery answered the shipowners son  montgomery cried roger i thought he had cleared out from these parts  i am going over to talk to him said dave  want us to go along came from both of the others  you might as well  say why dont you scare him suggested phil if you do that you may get him to tell all about the plot against you  oh ill do thatdont fear answered dave  as supper would not be ready for half an hour the three lads excused themselves and hurried across the street they found hooker montgomery still alone reading a sensational newspaper  well doctor how are you said dave coolly as he dropped in a chair beside the sostyled physician  whyahwhoahemwhere did you come from stammered hooker montgomery he was so taken back that he knew not what to say he had not dreamed that dave and his chums would visit hopperville which was somewhat out of the regular line of travel  i guess you didnt think id find you continued dave  were youahemlooking for me asked the doctor weakly and now the boys noticed that he looked more dissipated than ever and that his garments were decidedly shabby  see here doctor montgomery i am not going to beat around the bush with you said dave sternly you played me a mean trick and you know that i can put you in prison for it  why iahemithat is  you kidnapped me and that is a serious offense  no no i did nothing of the sort cried the man and his face showed actual misery oh porter dont blame me for it i made a big mistake i was a fool to listen to those others but i needed moneytimes were very hardand they said it was only a schoolboy trickthat is that is what they said first but afterwards the pretended doctor did not finish  who said it was a trick  those two young men merwell and jasniff they were angry at you because of something of which i know nothing they wanted to get you in their power for a larkthat was the story they first told they promised me twenty dollars if i would aid themand i never got a centnot a cent added hooker montgomery almost tearfully oh dont prosecute me i am down and out my practice has been ruinedsome folks even want me arrested for practicing without a state certificateand those rascals never came to my aid and after all i did for them  dave was a good judge of character and he saw at once that hooker montgomery was assuredly in a pitiable condition drink had made him lose his practice and his ability to induce people to buy his medicines and now he had relied upon merwell and jasniff to aid him and they had failed to do so evidently the man was not so much of a rascal as he was weakminded  so merwell and jasniff promised to pay you if you aided them said dave  yes  but you got me to come to your boardinghouse  so i did but it was those two fellows who put me up to it  where did shime come in  oh he only furnished the auto for a consideration he was under jasniffs thumband now he is down and out too  you say it was the plot of jasniff and merwell to get me in their power why did they want to do this  if i tell you mr porter will youahemwill you prosecute me asked hooker montgomery tremblingly  i may prosecute you if you dont tell me  as i said before i didnt understand their plot at first they said it was only a schoolboy trick but it was notas i found out later it was a villainous plan to get you into serious trouble  what trouble  i dont know all of the particulars but i know some from that old stone building you were to be taken to some town near by i heard them say something about breaking into a jewelry factory and you were to be drugged and left in the factory i think they were going to make it appear as if you had broken into the factory and that an explosion to blow open a safe had stunned you  can that be true burst from roger  what coldblooded plotting was phils comment  i cant give you any details for i wasahemsick at the time and did not quite understand went on hooker montgomery and dave reasoned and rightfully that he had been under the influence of liquor of course theyll deny the whole thing but that is what they plotted to do to you  where are merwell and jasniff now do you know  yes they are in this town that is why i came hereto see them and get some money if i could for i am dead broke but they wouldnt see me  here cried dave in astonishment where  at the residence of one of merwells relatives on the other side of town do you want to see them and a sudden look of interest dawned in hooker montgomerys fishy eyes  i do  going to have it out with them  yes  good for you sir ill show you where you can find them     chapter xxx  the enemy runs away   in a very few minutes dave and his chums were on the way to find merwell and jasniff as the party walked along hooker montgomery told more about his dealings with the rascally students it was plain to dave that the sostyled doctor had been nothing but a weak tool and in a way the youth had to pity the poor wretch whom dissipation had so dragged down  in less than five minutes the party arrived at a small residence set well back in a garden the walk was unshoveled and they had to pick their way through the snow when they rang the doorbell a tall thin elderly woman answered their summons  goodevening mrs slater said hooker montgomery id like to see mr merwell and mr jasniff  they have gone was the sharp answer and mrs slater looked as if she wished to shut the door in the faces of the callers  when will they be back  they wont be back  will you kindly tell me where they have gone questioned dave  who are you and the woman eyed dave suspiciously  my name is david porter and i wish to see merwell and jasniff very much  porter then you must be that young villain link told me aboutthe one who made so much trouble for him out on the ranch exclaimed mrs slater well you cant see link or his friend they have gone and they wont be back  have they gone to rockville academy  you can find that out for yourself cried mrs slater and then slammed the door shut and locked it  very accommodating lady i must say murmured phil sarcastically  very essence of politeness added roger  well if they have gone there is no use of our staying here declared dave come on and he led the way back to the hotel here they had another talk with hooker montgomery  if youll promise not to prosecute me ill appear against merwell and jasniff any time you want me said the socalled doctor and there the matter rested and the boys went back to join their companions and help to make way with the generous supper that was awaiting the whole party  what place do you suppose merwell and jasniff were going to rob asked roger of dave on the way back to oak hall  i am sure i dont know roger montgomery didnt say more than likely those rascals didnt tell him  what are you going to do next go up to rockville after link and nick  ive been thinking id go up there early next saturday before the hockey game want to go along  certainly if you wish it i guess phil will go tooif you ask him  ill do it i dont think i can manage the two alone  going to have them arrested  that depends on how they act one thing is certain i am not going to stand for any more of their underhanded work answered dave grimly  the day of the game dawned clear and bright the contest was scheduled for three oclock and dave phil and roger got permission to go to rockville in the morning they said they would meet their fellowplayers on the river later  arriving at rockville the three chums put up at the hotel where they rested from the long skate and then had dinner then they started in the direction of the military school  the street on which they were walking ran past the railroad station and as they passed the platform roger happened to look at the people assembled waiting for a train he gave a shout  there is merwell now  where asked dave and phil  just went into the waitingroom  the three lads quickened their pace and hurried into the waitingroom they saw merwell and jasniff at the ticket window just picking up some tickets and change  i want to see you fellows said dave coldly and placed a hand on a shoulder of each of the rascals  merwell and jasniff wheeled around and the face of each turned pale  whawhat do you want porter stammered merwell  ah dont talk to him blustered jasniff let go of me and he tore himself loose  jasniff youve got to talk to me answered dave if you wont talk ill call an officer  dont you do that cried merwell in increased alarm you let me go its aamistake i havent done anything and he commenced to back towards the door  merwell you and jasniff played me a dirty trick declared dave i dont know whether to have you arrested or to take it out of you i gave you a sound thrashing once but it doesnt seem to have done you much good  youyou let me alone porter  where are you going asked roger  dont you tell them burst out jasniff quickly its none of their business and he looked knowingly at merwell  i guess i had better call an officer suggested phil just by way of intimidating the rascally students  nonodont do it cried link merwell come on nick there is the train  he leaped past the others and out of a back door of the station as dave phil and roger went after him jasniff went out of the front door  a train had come to a stop and a number of passengers were getting off and on link merwell darted into the midst of the crowd and mounting one of the platforms entered the car  going after him asked phil  no whats the use  where is jasniff asked roger  there he goes cried dave and pointed to the end of the train which the student named had just boarded  the train was now moving and as it swept by the three lads on the platform saw link merwell peer anxiously out of a window at them then as the last car rolled by they beheld nick jasniff in the doorway he shook his fist at them  just wait dave porter he yelled defiantly just wait thats all and then the train disappeared swiftly from view  wonder if they are running away from the academy came from phil  it looks like it to me answered dave i guess they are pretty badly scared maybe they know that doctor montgomery had turned against them  well if they only stay away it wont be so bad said the senators son  i might telegraph ahead and have them held said dave but i guess it isnt worth while  do you know what i think said phil i think they were at that mrs slaters house the night we called and what we said scared them and in this surmise phil was correct  an hour later found the three chums down on the river where they were met by the other members of the hockey team a great crowd was assembling and in the number were vera rockwell mary feversham and a number of other people they knew  the boys from oak hall had come in sleighs and on skates and they had brought their horns rattles and banners with them the rockville cadets were also alive to the occasion and the combined din from both sides was deafening  here is where we do up oak hall  here is where rockville gets another defeat  remember this is for the championship of the leming river  so the cries rang on drowned ever and anon by the tooting of horns and the clacking of rattles soon came a short practice and then the two sevens lined up for the great contest  at a glance it was easy to see that the rockville team was a fine one every player was tall and thin and an exceptionally swift skater they had been well drilled into team work and sent the puck from one player to another in a manner that brought forth many favorable comments  we sure have our work cut out for us whispered ben to dave they are the swiftest bunch i have yet seen on skates  and their captain is certainly a star added shadow i never saw a fellow turn quicker or send the puck with more force  weve got to fight and fight hard cried dave i want every fellow on the job first last and all the time     chapter xxxi  another victoryconclusion   thats the way to do it  what did i tell you oak hall wont be in this game  this will wipe out that football defeat  so the cries rang out the great icehockey contest was but six minutes old and amid a wild yelling and cheering rockville had carried the puck down into the oak hall territory and mallory their star player had made a swift and safe goal  wasnt that going some  three cheers for mallory and the cheers were given with a will  oak hall oak hall came the answering cry and then the supporters of that school burst out into a new slogan             ice hockey             nice jockey             oak hall             has the call     wa wa wa wa whoop  oh what a shame that rockville scored sighed vera rockwell  never mind the game isnt ended yet returned mary feversham  no came from a rockville cadet sitting near when it is the score will be about forty to nothing in our favor and this remark caused some cadets to smile and made both of the girls turn very red  arent they horrid whispered mary  dont mind them answered her friend but oh i do so hope oak hall wins and then both girls waved their oak hall banners vigorously by way of encouragement to the team  once more the puck was put into play in the center of the field of ice and again rockville sent it flying near to the oak hall goal but this time it came back and now the fight was on for several minutes near the left side line there was a little rough play on both sides and the referee called time  i want no more such work he said almost sternly  i was hit in the side by somebody growled plum  i was hit in the back came from a rockville player  if there is any more such work ill call the game said the referee and then the whistle blew to start again  this time oak hall worked with vigor and presently had the rubber disc down close to the rockville goal but alas for their hopes just as ben was on the point of striking for the net a rockville player stole the puck from him rapped it to another player who sent it whirling to mallory and in a twinkling it was down at the other end of the field  another goal for rockville  what did i tell you boys this is a walkover for our school cried guy frapley who was on hand and as anxious as anybody to see oak hall defeated  oak hall may be able to play football but they dont know how to play ice hockey added john rand who was with him and equally anxious to see dave and his friends lose  the supporters of oak hall had little to say the only lad who felt happy was nat poole  here is where dave porter and his crowd get what is coming to them thought the moneylenders son it pleased him greatly to think his school might be beaten which shows how really meanspirited nat was  again the game proceeded and now the contest waged in earnest in a mixup near the center of the field one of the rockville players named devine crashed into plum and both went down in a heap with two other players on top the puck went sailing toward the oak hall goal and though dave did his best to stop it the goal was made an instant later  time time somebody is hurt  that goal ought not to count  a babble of voices sounded out and slowly the players untangled themselves then it was learned that plum had been hurt on the shoulder and one of the rockville players had gotten cut in the ankle and both had to retire luke watson took plums place it was decided that the goal had been made unfairly after time was called and allowed and so it was not counted  but even this did not help oak hall in the first half of the contest rockville went at it hammer and tongs again and soon scored a legitimate third goal amid a cheering that was tremendous then the whistle blew and the first half of the game became a thing of the past  we are up against it and no mistake remarked roger dolefully as he and the other players sat down on a bench in the boathouse to rest  we are too slow answered dave we simply must put more ginger in our playing  yes and weve got to take more chances added sam might as well do itwe cant lose anything he added bitterly  when the call sounded to start the second half of the game the oak hall seven came forward with a doordie look on their set faces rockville on the other hand wore a happy smile as if the victory was already a sure thing  for a minute the playing was uncertain then came a surprise for oak hall broke loose to use messmers way of expressing it the puck was fairly stolen from mallory himself by dave and sent forward and to the right and the left in a manner that was bewildering  send it back rockville  dont let them score  back with it back  go it oak hall whack it hamilton  now for the goal morr  there she goes  hurrah score one for oak hall  now then youve struck your gait fellows keep up the good work  it was true oak hall had scored on a beautiful strike by roger aided by shadow but dave had started the thing by getting the rubber away from mallory much to that star players chagrin  the goal warmed the hearts of the oak hall seven wonderfully and when the puck was again placed in position they went for it like hungry cats after a mouse the exchange of blows was rapid and the disc was stolen and recovered half a dozen times in as many seconds then came a long drive by ben and another by dave and then a rockville player sent it out of bounds bringing it back gave the lads time to recover their breath and again they went at it with a determination that was terrific  oh somebody will be killed cried vera as several came together with a crash  what a rough game murmured mary but look dave porter has the rubber  yes and he is carrying it to the rockville goal  oh look at the others after him  dave had the puck and with almost a clear field ahead of him he was worrying it along while the whole of the rockville team was following on his heels he waited until they were almost on him then made a half turn raised his stick and let drive with all his power  say look at that  what a beautiful drive  another goal for oak hall  three cheers for dave porter came from some of the oak hall supporters and the cheers went echoing far and wide across the river vera and mary cheered with the rest and so did a number of other girls  now then oak hall tie the score  we will murmured roger  thats the talk cried dave everybody in the game now and on the jump  fearing they were losing their hold on the game mallory spoke to the others of his team he gave the signal for a trick play on the left side but dave was on the alert and the trick was blocked and then dave gave a signal to try the same trick on rockville neither mallory nor his followers dreamed this would be done and they were so neatly caught that every old icehockey player who witnessed the play had to smile the trick took the puck halfway down into the rockville territory and though the cadets worked hard to send it back it was not to be and phil knocked the goal that tied the score  a tie a tie  now oak hall one more to win  rockville rockville one more one more  by this time everybody was thoroughly worked up over the contest all who had been seated were on their feet and cheering wildly for their favorites  whatever you do dont let them score again said dave to his players keep the rubber away from our goal  well send it down to their goal answered shadow  so we will cried ben  this is our gamewe have got to have it was phils response  its win or bust muttered roger  once more the puck was placed in position rockville now played as they had never played before and twice the disc came dangerously close to the oak hall goal but each time luke watson drove it back then it came forward swiftly to the other end of the field here there was a battleroyal between mallory and roger dave came whizzing up and managed to steal the rubber and sent it to ben he got it within three yards of the goal and then shadow took hold and landed it safely in the net  hurrah one more for oak hall  that makes the score four to three  wake up rockville six minutes more to play  now hold em cautioned dave as the puck was brought forth once more hold em i tell you  well do more answered roger grimly that is if we get the chance  of coursebut dont run any risks  back and forth flew the rubber disc rockville was wild to tie the score this made one of the players take a long chance roger saw it and in a twinkling he rushed forward and upset the fellows calculations and sent the puck again into the rockville territory then came a rush of players and back and forth swung the human mass then of a sudden the rubber disc flew up into the air to land almost at sam days feet  it was sams chance and like a flash he improved it down the icy field went the rubber with sam behind it  stop him  send it back  dave was behind sam and now he swept ahead then came a mixup with mallory but dave got the puck and sent it straight for the net  another goal for oak hall  two minutes more to play  rockville cant win now  with saddened faces rockville lined up once more and again the disc was put in action the fight was hot and the puck moved rapidly in the center of the field then the whistle blew and the wonderful contest came to an end  final score oak hall 5 rockville 3  it was assuredly a wellearned victory and dave and his team were warmly praised by all their followers even doctor clay came up to shake each player by the hand  i am proud of you he said this will be quite a feather in the oak hall cap  can we celebrate tonight doctor asked roger quickly  you canup to twelve oclock but please dont wreck the school building and the master of oak hall smiled indulgently  oh it was just too lovely for anything cried vera  the best ever added mary  i got a number of good snapshots of the game said polly vane who was quite an amateur photographer ill have the pictures developed and printed and give each of you copies to take home  that will be splendid polly answered dave later on dave received his set of pictures and took them to crumville where he showed them to jessie and the others with much pride  that contest was harder than the one on the gridiron remarked phil when they were returning to oak hall in one of the big sleighs  rockville meant to win said buster and it looked as if they would win at first  they have a star player in mallory said ben but one star doesnt make a team  say that puts me in mind of a story began shadow once three fellows but then he broke off short as a handful of soft snow thrown by roger took him full in the mouth  keep your stories for tonight shadow cried dave now for a song and then the crowd in the sleigh began singing at the top of their lungs  it was assuredly a grand victory and that evening the whole school celebrated with bonfires singing and dancing dave was called on for a speech plum took part in the celebration for he was not seriously injured  and now for the holidays and home said dave on the following monday morning just two weeks more of the grind boys  theyll soon slip by said phil  dave do you imagine that merwell and jasniff will return to rockville continued the shipowners son  i dont knowperhaps after a whilewhen they think i will drop the charge against them  perhaps they are too scared to come back said phil  they are bad eggs murmured dave but how bad he was still to learn he was to meet merwell and jasniff again and what that pair did to injure him and those he so dearly loved will be told in another volume of this series to be entitled dave porter on cave island or a schoolboys mysterious mission in that book we shall meet dave and many others of our characters again and learn the particulars of a happening at crumville that was as dismaying as it was perplexing  well let us forget merwell and jasniff said roger say that hockey victory has made me feel two years younger  that and a letter he got from laura murmured phil  humph as if i didnt see the letter you got from belle endicott retorted the senators son  dave got a letter toofrom jessie went on phil perhaps  hi you fellows get through grinding and come for a skate shouted ben bursting into the dormitory the ice was never better  thats the talk cried dave throwing down his latin grammar first fellow to get his skates on gets a ginger snap  and off he ran with the others at his heels and here for the present we will say goodby to dave porter his chums and his rivals   the end     dave porter series  by
