12046185	fighting the whales by rm ballantyne    chapter one  in trouble to begin with  there are few things in this world that have filled me with so much astonishment as the fact that man can kill a whale  that a fish more than sixty feet long and thirty feet round the body with the bulk of three hundred fat oxen rolled into one with the strength of many hundreds of horses able to swim at a rate that would carry it right round the world in twentythree days that can smash a boat to atoms with one slap of its tail and stave in the planks of a ship with one blow of its thick skullthat such a monster can be caught and killed by man is most wonderful to hear of but i can tell from experience that it is much more wonderful to see  there is a wise saying which i have often thought much upon  it is this knowledge is power  man is but a feeble creature and if he had to depend on his own bodily strength alone he could make no head against even the ordinary brutes in this world  but the knowledge which has been given to him by his maker has clothed man with great power so that he is more than a match for the fiercest beast in the forest or the largest fish in the sea  yet with all his knowledge with all his experience and all his power the killing of a great old sperm whale costs man a long tough battle sometimes it even costs him his life  it is a long time now since i took to fighting the whales  i have been at it man and boy for nigh forty years and many a wonderful sight have i seen many a desperate battle have i fought in the fisheries of the north and south seas  sometimes when i sit in the chimneycorner of a winter evening smoking my pipe with my old messmate tom lokins i stare into the fire and think of the days gone by till i forget where i am and go on thinking so hard that the flames seem to turn into melting fires and the bars of the grate into dead fish and the smoke into sails and rigging and i go to work cutting up the blubber and stirring the oilpots or pulling the bowoar and driving the harpoon at such a rate that i cant help giving a shout which causes tom to start and cry  hallo  bob my name is bob ledbury you see  hallo  bob wots the matter  to which i reply tom can it all be true  can wot be true says he with a stare of surprisefor tom is getting into his dotage now  and then i chuckle and tell him i was only thinking of old times and so he falls to smoking again and i to staring at the fire and thinking as hard as ever  the way in which i was first led to go after the whales was curious this is how it happened  about forty years ago when i was a boy of nearly fifteen years of age i lived with my mother in one of the seaport towns of england  there was great distress in the town at that time and many of the hands were out of work  my employer a blacksmith had just died and for more than six weeks i had not been able to get employment or to earn a farthing  this caused me great distress for my father had died without leaving a penny in the world and my mother depended on me entirely the money i had saved out of my wages was soon spent and one morning when i sat down to breakfast my mother looked across the table and said in a thoughtful voice  robert dear this meal has cost us our last halfpenny  my mother was old and frail and her voice very gentle she was the most trustful uncomplaining woman i ever knew  i looked up quickly into her face as she spoke  all the money gone mother  ay all  it will be hard for you to go without your dinner robert dear  it will be harder for you mother i cried striking the table with my fist then a lump rose in my throat and almost choked me  i could not utter another word  it was with difficulty i managed to eat the little food that was before me  after breakfast i rose hastily and rushed out of the house determined that i would get my mother her dinner even if i should have to beg for it  but i must confess that a sick feeling came over me when i thought of begging  hurrying along the crowded streets without knowing very well what i meant to do i at last came to an abrupt halt at the end of the pier here i went up to several people and offered my services in a wild sort of way  they must have thought that i was drunk for nearly all of them said gruffly that they did not want me  dinner time drew near but no one had given me a job and no wonder for the way in which i tried to get one was not likely to be successful  at last i resolved to beg  observing a fat redfaced old gentleman coming along the pier i made up to him boldly  he carried a cane with a large gold knob on the top of it  that gave me hope for of course thought i he must be rich  his nose which was exactly the colour and shape of the gold knob on his cane was stuck in the centre of a round goodnatured countenance the mouth of which was large and firm the eyes bright and blue  he frowned as i went forward hat in hand but i was not to be driven back the thought of my starving mother gave me power to crush down my rising shame  yet i had no reason to be ashamed i was willing to work if only i could have got employment  stopping in front of the old gentleman i was about to speak when i observed him quietly button up his breeches pocket  the blood rushed to my face and turning quickly on my heel i walked away without uttering a word  hallo shouted a gruff voice just as i was moving away  i turned and observed that the shout was uttered by a broad roughlooking jacktar a man of about two or three and thirty who had been sitting all the forenoon on an old cask smoking his pipe and basking in the sun  hallo said he again  well said i  wot dye mean youngster by goin on in that there fashion all the mornin abotherin everybody and makin a fool o yourself like that eh  whats that to you said i savagely for my heart was sore and heavy and i could not stand the interference of a stranger  oh its nothin to me of course said the sailor picking his pipe quietly with his claspknife but come here boy ive somethin to say to ye  well what is it said i going up to him somewhat sulkily  the man looked at me gravely through the smoke of his pipe and said youre in a passion my young buck thats all and in case you didnt know it i thought id tell ye  i burst into a fit of laughter  well i believe youre not far wrong but im better now  ah thats right said the sailor with an approving nod of his head always confess when youre in the wrong  now younker let me give you a bit of advice  never get into a passion if you can help it and if you cant help it get out of it as fast as possible and if you cant get out of it just give a great roar to let off the steam and turn about and run  theres nothing like that  passion hant got legs  it cant hold on to a feller when hes runnin  if you keep it up till you amost split your timbers passion has no chance  it must go astarn now lad ive been watchin ye all the mornin and i see theres a screw loose somewhere  if youll tell me wot it is see if i dont help you  the kind frank way in which this was said quite won my heart so i sat down on the old cask and told the sailor all my sorrows  boy said he when i had finished ill put you in the way o helpin your mother  i can get you a berth in my ship if youre willin to take a trip to the whalefishery of the south seas  and who will look after my mother when im away said i  the sailor looked perplexed at the question  ah thats a puzzler he replied knocking the ashes out of his pipe will you take me to your mothers house lad  willingly said i and jumping up i led the way  as we turned to go i observed that the old gentleman with the goldheaded cane was leaning over the rail of the pier at a short distance from us  a feeling of anger instantly rose within me and i exclaimed loud enough for him to hear  i do believe that stingy old chap has been listening to every word weve been saying  i thought i observed a frown on the sailors brow as i said this but he made no remark and in a few minutes we were walking rapidly through the streets  my companion stopped at one of those stores so common in seaport towns where one can buy almost anything from a tallow candle to a brass cannon  here he purchased a pound of tea a pound of sugar a pound of butter and a small loafall of which he thrust into the huge pockets of his coat  he had evidently no idea of proportion or of household affairs  it was a simple easy way of settling the matter to get a pound of everything  in a short time we reached our house a very old one in a poor neighbourhood and entered my mothers room  she was sitting at the table when we went in with a large bible before her and a pair of hornspectacles on her nose  i could see that she had been out gathering coals and cinders during my absence for a good fire burned in the grate and the kettle was singing cheerily thereon  ive brought a friend to see you mother said i  goodday mistress said the sailor bluntly sitting down on a stool near the fire  you seem to be goin to have your tea  i expect to have it soon replied my mother  indeed said i in surprise  have you anything in the kettle  nothing but water my son  has anybody brought you anything then since i went out  nobody  why then mistress broke in the seaman how can you expect to have your tea so soon  my mother took off her spectacles looked calmly in the mans face laid her hand on the bible and said because i have been a widow woman these three years and never once in all that time have i gone a single day without a meal  when the usual hour came i put on my kettle to boil for this word tells me that the lord will provide  i expect my tea tonight  the sailors face expressed puzzled astonishment at these words and he continued to regard my mother with a look of wonder as he drew forth his supplies of food and laid them on the table  in a short time we were all enjoying a cup of tea and talking about the whalefishery and the difficulty of my going away while my mother was dependent on me  at last the sailor rose to leave us  taking a fivepound note from his pocket he laid it on the table and said  mistress this is all i have in the world but ive got neither family nor friends and im bound for the south seas in six days so if youll take it youre welcome to it and if your son bob can manage to cast loose from you without leaving you to sink ill take him aboard the ship that i sail in  hell always find me at the bull and griffin in the high street or at the end o the pier  while the sailor was speaking i observed a figure standing in a dark corner of the room near the door and on looking more closely i found that it was the old gentleman with the nose like his caneknob  seeing that he was observed he came forward and said  i trust that you will forgive my coming here without invitation but i happened to overhear part of the conversation between your son and this seaman and i am willing to help you over your little difficulty if you will allow me  the old gentleman said this in a very quick abrupt way and looked as if he were afraid his offer might be refused  he was much heated with climbing our long stair no doubt and as he stood in the middle of the room puffing and wiping his bald head with a handkerchief my mother rose hastily and offered him a chair  you are very kind sir she said do sit down sir  im sure i dont know why you should take so much trouble  but dear me you are very warm will you take a cup of tea to cool you  thank you thank you  with much pleasure unless indeed your son objects to a stingy old chap sitting beside him  i blushed when he repeated my words and attempted to make some apology but the old gentleman stopped me by commencing to explain his intentions in short rapid sentences  to make a long story short he offered to look after my mother while i was away and to prove his sincerity laid down five shillings and said he would call with that sum every week as long as i was absent  my mother after some trouble agreed to let me go and before that evening closed everything was arranged and the gentleman leaving his address went away  the sailor had been so much filled with surprise at the suddenness of all this that he could scarcely speak  immediately after the departure of the old gentleman he said well goodbye mistress goodbye bob and throwing on his hat in a careless way left the room  stop i shouted after him when he had got about halfway down stair  hallo wots wrong now  nothing i only forgot to ask your name  tom lokins he bellowed in the hoarse voice of a regular boatswain wich wos my fathers name before me  so saying he departed whistling rule britannia with all his might  thus the matter was settled  six days afterwards i rigged myself out in a blue jacket white ducks and a straw hat and went to sea    chapter two  at sea  my first few days on the ocean were so miserable that i oftentimes repented of having left my native land  i was as my new friend tom lokins said as sick as a dog  but in course of time i grew well and began to rejoice in the cool fresh breezes and the great rolling billows of the sea  many and many a time i used to creep out to the end of the bowsprit when the weather was calm and sit with my legs dangling over the deep blue water and my eyes fixed on the great masses of rolling clouds in the sky thinking of the new course of life i had just begun  at such times the thought of my mother was sure to come into my mind and i thought of her parting words put your trust in the lord robert and read his word  i resolved to try to obey her but this i found was no easy matter for the sailors were a rough lot of fellows who cared little for the bible  but i must say they were a hearty goodnatured set and much better upon the whole than many a ships crew that i afterwards sailed with  we were fortunate in having fair winds this voyage and soon found ourselves on the other side of the line as we jacktars call the equator  of course the crew did not forget the old custom of shaving all the men who had never crossed the line before  our captain was a jolly old man and uncommonly fond of skylarking  he gave us leave to do what we liked the day we crossed the line so as there were a number of wild spirits among us we broke through all the ordinary rules or rather we added on new rules to them  the old hands had kept the matter quiet from us greenhorns so that although we knew they were going to do some sort of mischief we didnt exactly understand what it was to be  about noon of that day i was called on deck and told that old father neptune was coming aboard and we were to be ready to receive him  a minute after i saw a tremendous monster come up over the side of the ship and jump on the deck  he was crowned with seaweed and painted in a wonderful fashion his clothes were dripping wet as if he had just come from the bottom of the sea  after him came another monster with a petticoat made of sailcloth and a tippet of a bit of old tarpaulin this was neptunes wife and these two carried on the most remarkable antics i ever saw  i laughed heartily and soon discovered from the tones of their voices which of my shipmates neptune and his wife were but my mirth was quickly stopped when i was suddenly seized by several men and my face was covered over with a horrible mixture of tar and grease  six of us youngsters were treated in this way then the lather was scraped off with a piece of old hoopiron and after being thus shaved buckets of cold water were thrown over us  at last after a prosperous voyage we arrived at our fishingground in the south seas and a feeling of excitement and expectation began to show itself among the men insomuch that our very eyes seemed brighter than usual  one night those of us who had just been relieved from watch on deck were sitting on the lockers down below telling ghost stories  it was a dead calm and one of those intensely dark hot nights that cause sailors to feel uneasy they scarce know why  i began to feel so uncomfortable at last listening to the horrible tales which tom lokins was relating to the men that i slipt away from them with the intention of going on deck  i moved so quietly that no one observed me besides every eye was fixed earnestly on tom whose deep low voice was the only sound that broke the stillness of all around  as i was going very cautiously up the ladder leading to the deck tom had reached that part of his story where the ghost was just appearing in a dark churchyard dressed in white and coming slowly forward one step at a time towards the terrified man who saw it  the men held their breath and one or two of their faces turned pale as tom went on with his description lowering his voice to a hoarse whisper  just as i put my head up the hatchway the sheet of one of the sails which was hanging loose in the still air passed gently over my head and knocked my hat off  at any other time i would have thought nothing of this but toms story had thrown me into such an excited and nervous condition that i gave a start missed my footing uttered a loud cry and fell down the ladder right in among the men with a tremendous crash knocking over two or three oilcans and a tin breadbasket in my fall and upsetting the lantern so that the place was instantly pitch dark  i never heard such a howl of terror as these men gave vent to when this misfortune befell me  they rushed upon deck with their hearts in their mouths tumbling and peeling the skin off their shins and knuckles in their haste and it was not until they heard the laughter of the watch on deck that they breathed freely and joining in the laugh called themselves fools for being frightened by a ghost story  i noticed however that for all their pretended indifference there was not one man among themnot even tom lokins himselfwho would go down below to relight the lantern for at least a quarter of an hour afterwards  feeling none the worse for my fall i went forward and leaned over the bow of the ship where i was much astonished by the appearance of the sea  it seemed as if the water was on fire  every time the ships bow rose and fell the little belt of foam made in the water seemed like a belt of blue flame with bright sparkles in it like stars or diamonds i had seen this curious appearance before but never so bright as it was on that night  what is it tom said i as my friend came forward and leaned over the ships bulwark beside me  its blue fire bob replied tom as he smoked his pipe calmly  come you know i cant swallow that said i everybody knows that fire either blue or red cant burn in the water  maybe not returned tom but its blue fire for all that  leastwise if its not i dont know wot else it is  tom had often seen this light before no doubt but he had never given himself the trouble to find out what it could be  fortunately the captain came up just as i put the question and he enlightened me on the subject  it is caused by small animals said he leaning over the side  small animals said i in astonishment  ay many parts of the sea are full of creatures so small and so thin and colourless that you can hardly see them even in a clear glass tumbler  many of them are larger than others but the most of them are very small  but how do they shine like that sir  i asked  that i do not know boy  god has given them the power to shine just as he has given us the power to walk or speak and they do shine brightly as you see but how they do it is more than i can tell  i think myself it must be anger that makes them shine for they generally do it when they are stirred up or knocked about by oars or ships keels or tumbling waves  but i am not sure that thats the reason either because you know we often sail through them without seeing the light though of course they must be there  praps sir said tom lokins praps sir theyre sleepy sometimes an cant be bothered gettin angry  perhaps answered the captain laughing  but then again at other times i have seen them shining over the whole sea when it was quite calm making it like an ocean of milk and nothing was disturbing them at that time dye see  i don know that objected tom they might have bin afightin among theirselves  or playing may be said i  the captain laughed and looking up at the sky said i dont like the look of the weather tom lokins  youre a sharp fellow and have been in these seas before what say you  well have a breeze replied tom briefly  more than a breeze muttered the captain while a look of grave anxiety overspread his countenance ill go below and take a squint at the glass  what does he mean by that tom said i when the captain was gone i never saw a calmer or a finer night  surely there is no chance of a storm just now  ay that shows that youre a young feller and hant got much experience o them seas replied my companion  why boy sometimes the fiercest storm is brewin behind the greatest calm  an the worst o the thing is that it comes so sudden at times that the masts are torn out o the ship before you can say jack robinson  what and without any warning said i  ay almost without warnin but not altogether without it  you heerd the captain say hed go an take a squint at the glass  yes what is the glass  its not a glass o grog you may be sure nor yet a lookinglass its the weatherglass boy  shoregoin chaps call it a barometer  and whats the meaning of barometer  i inquired earnestly  tom lokins stared at me in stupid amazement  why boy said he youre too inquisitive  i once asked the doctor o a ship that question and says he to me tom says he a barometer is a glass tube filled with quicksilver or mercury which is a metal in a soft or fluid state like water you know and its meant for tellin the state o the weather  yes sir i answers i know that well enough  then why did you ask says he gettin into a passion  i asked what was the meanin o the word barometer sir said i  the doctor he looked grave at that and shook his head  tom says he if i was to go for to explain that word and all about the instrument in a scientific sort o way dye see id have to sit here an speak to you right on end for six hours or more  oh sir says i dont do it then  please dont do it  no more i will says he but itll serve your turn to know that a barometer is a glass for measurin the weight o the air and somehow or other that lets ye know wots acoming  if the mercury in the glass rises high alls right  if it falls uncommon low very sudden look out for squalls thats all  no matter how smooth the sea may be or how sweetly all natur may smile dont you believe it take in every inch o canvas at once  that was a queer explanation tom  ay but it was a true one as you shall see before long  as i looked out upon the calm sea which lay like a sheet of glass without a ripple on its surface i could scarcely believe what he had said  but before many minutes had passed i was convinced of my error  while i was standing talking to my messmate the captain rushed on deck and shouted  all hands tumble up  shorten sail  take in every rag  look alive boys look alive  i was quite stunned for a moment by this and by the sudden tumult that followed  the men who seemed never to take thought about anything and who had but one duty namely to obey orders ran upon deck and leaped up the rigging like cats the sheets of nearly all the principal sails were clewed up and ere long the canvas was made fast to the yards  a few of the smaller sails only were left exposed and even these were close reefed  before long a loud roar was heard and in another minute the storm burst upon us with terrific violence  the ship at first lay over so much that the masts were almost in the water and it was as impossible for any one to walk the deck as to walk along the side of a wall  at the same time the sea was lashed into white foam and the blinding spray flew over us in bitter fury  take in the topsails roared the captain  but his voice was drowned in the shriek of the gale  the men were saved the risk of going out on the yards however for in a few moments more all the sails except the stormtrysail were burst and blown to ribbons  we now tried to put the ships head to the wind and lay to by which landsmen will understand that we tried to face the storm and remain stationary  but the gale was so fierce that this was impossible  the last rag of sail was blown away and then there was nothing left for us but to show our stern to the gale and scud under bare poles  the great danger now was that we might be pooped which means that a huge wave might curl over our stern fall with terrible fury on our deck and sink us  many and many a good ship has gone down in this way but we were mercifully spared  as our safety depended very much on good steering the captain himself took the wheel and managed the ship so well that we weathered the gale without damage farther than the loss of a few sails and light spars  for two days the storm howled furiously the sky and sea were like ink with sheets of rain and foam driving through the air and raging billows tossing our ship about like a cork  during all this time my shipmates were quiet and grave but active and full of energy so that every order was at once obeyed without noise or confusion  every man watched the slightest motion of the captain  we all felt that everything depended on him  as for me i gave up all hope of being saved  it seemed impossible to me that anything that man could build could withstand so terrible a storm  i do not pretend to say that i was not afraid  the near prospect of a violent death caused my heart to sink more than once but my feelings did not unman me  i did my duty quietly but quickly like the rest and when i had no work to do i stood holding on to the weather stanchions looking at the raging sea and thinking of my mother and of the words of kindness and counsel she had so often bestowed upon me in vain  the storm ceased almost as quickly as it began and although the sea did not all at once stop the heavings of its angry bosom the wind fell entirely in the course of a few hours the dark clouds broke up into great masses that were piled up high into the sky and out of the midst of these the glorious sun shone in bright rays down on the ocean like comfort from heaven gladdening our hearts as we busily repaired the damage that we had suffered from the storm    chapter three  our first battle  i shall never forget the surprise i got the first time i saw a whale  it was in the forenoon of a most splendid day about a week after we arrived at that part of the ocean where we might expect to find fish  a light noreast breeze was blowing but it scarcely ruffled the sea as we crept slowly through the water with every stitch of canvas set  as we had been looking out for fish for some time past everything was in readiness for them  the boats were hanging over the side ready to lower tubs for coiling away the ropes harpoons lances etcetera all were ready to throw in and start away at a moments notice  the man in the crows nest as they call the cask fixed up at the masthead was looking anxiously out for whales and the crew were idling about the deck  tom lokins was seated on the windlass smoking his pipe and i was sitting beside him on an empty cask sharpening a blubberknife  tom said i what like is a whale  why its like nothin but itself replied tom looking puzzled why wot a queer feller you are to ax questions  im sure youve seen plenty of them  you might be able to tell what a whale is like  wot its like  well its like a tremendous big bolster with a head and a tail to it  and how big is it  theyre of all sizes lad  ive seen one that was exactly equal to three hundred fat bulls and its rate of goin would take it round the whole world in twentythree days  i dont believe you said i laughing  dont you cried tom its a fact notwithstandin for the captain himself said so and thats how i came to know it  just as tom finished speaking the man in the crows nest roared at the top of his voice there she blows  that was the signal that a whale was in sight and as it was the first time we had heard it that season every man in the ship was thrown into a state of tremendous excitement  there she blows roared the man again  where away shouted the captain  about two miles right ahead  in another moment the utmost excitement prevailed on board  suddenly while i was looking over the side straining my eyes to catch a sight of the whale which could not yet be seen by the men on deck i saw a brown object appear in the sea not twenty yards from the side of the ship before i had time to ask what it was a whales head rose to the surface and shot up out of the water  the part of the fish that was visible above water could not have been less than thirty feet in length it just looked as if our longboat had jumped out of the sea and he was so near that i could see his great mouth quite plainly  i could have tossed a biscuit on his back easily  sending two thick spouts of frothy water out of his blowholes forty feet into the air with tremendous noise he fell flat upon the sea with a clap like thunder tossed his flukes or tail high into the air and disappeared  i was so amazed at this sight that i could not speak  i could only stare at the place where the huge monster had gone down  stand by to lower shouted the captain  ay ay sir replied the men leaping to their appointed stations for every man in a whaleship has his post of duty appointed to him and knows what to do when an order is given  lower away cried the captain whose face was now blazing with excitement  in a moment more three boats were in the water the tubs harpoons etcetera were thrown in the men seized the oars and away they went with a cheer  i was in such a state of flutter that i scarce knew what i did but i managed somehow or other to get into a boat and as i was a strong fellow and a good rower i was allowed to pull  there she blows cried the man in the crows nest just as we shot from the side of the ship  there was no need to ask where away this time  another whale rose and spouted not more than three hundred yards off and before we could speak a third fish rose in another direction and we found ourselves in the middle of what is called a school of whales  now lads said the captain who steered the boat in which i rowed bend your backs my hearties that fish right ahead of us is a hundredbarrel whale for certain  give way boys we must have that fish  there was no need to urge the men for their backs were strained to the utmost their faces were flushed and the big veins in their necks swelled almost to bursting with the tremendous exertion  hold hard said the captain in a low voice for now that we were getting near our prey we made as little noise as possible  the men at once threw their oars apeak as they say that is raised them straight up in the air and waited for further orders  we expected the whale would rise near to where we were and thought it best to rest and look out  while we were waiting tom lokins who was harpooner of the boat sat just behind me with all his irons ready  he took this opportunity to explain to me that by a hundredbarrel fish is meant a fish that will yield a hundredbarrels of oil  he further informed me that such a fish was a big one though he had seen a few in the northwest seas that had produced upwards of two hundredbarrels  i now observed that the other boats had separated and each had gone after a different whale  in a few minutes the fish we were in chase of rose a short distance off and sent up two splendid waterspouts high into the air thus showing that he was what the whalers call a right whale  it is different from the sperm whale which has only one blowhole and that a little one  we rowed towards it with all our might and as we drew near the captain ordered tom lokins to stand up so he at once laid in his oar and took up the harpoon  the harpoon is an iron lance with a barbed point a whaleline is attached to it and this line is coiled away in a tub when we were within a few yards of the fish which was going slowly through the water all ignorant of the terrible foes who were pursuing him tom lokins raised the harpoon high above his head and darted it deep into its fat side just behind the left fin and next moment the boat ran aground on the whales back  stern all for your lives roared the captain who before his order was obeyed managed to give the creature two deep wounds with his lance the lance has no barbs to its point and is used only for wounding after the harpoon is fixed  the boat was backed off at once but it had scarcely got a few yards away when the astonished fish whirled its huge body half out of the water and coming down with a tremendous clap made off like lightning  the line was passed round a strong piece of wood called the loggerhead and in running out it began to smoke and nearly set the wood on fire  indeed it would have done so if a man had not kept constantly pouring water upon it  it was needful to be very cautious in managing the line for the duty is attended with great danger  if any hitch should take place the line is apt to catch the boat and drag it down bodily under the waves  sometimes a coil of it gets round a leg or an arm of the man who attends to it in which case his destruction is almost certain  many a poor fellow has lost his life in this way  the order was now given to hold on line  this was done and in a moment our boat was cleaving the blue water like an arrow while the white foam curled from her bows  i thought every moment we should be dragged under but whenever this seemed likely to happen the line was let run a bit and the strain eased  at last the fish grew tired of dragging us the line ceased to run out and tom hauled in the slack which another man coiled away in its tub  presently the fish rose to the surface a short distance off our weatherbow  give way boys spring your oars cried the captain another touch or two with the lance and that fish is ours  the boat shot ahead and we were about to dart a second harpoon into the whales side when it took to soundingwhich means that it went straight down head foremost into the depths of the sea  at that moment tom lokins uttered a cry of mingled anger and disappointment  we all turned round and saw our shipmate standing with the slack line in his hand and such an expression on his weatherbeaten face that i could scarce help laughing  the harpoon had not been well fixed it had lost its hold and the fish was now free  gone exclaimed the captain with a groan  i remember even yet the feeling of awful disappointment that came over me when i understood that we had lost the fish after all our trouble  i could almost have wept with bitter vexation  as for my comrades they sat staring at each other for some moments quite speechless  before we could recover from the state into which this misfortune had thrown us one of the men suddenly shouted hallo theres the mates boat in distress  we turned at once and truly there was no doubt of the truth of this for about half a mile off we beheld our first mates boat tearing over the sea like a small steamer  it was fast to a fish and two oars were set up on end to attract our attention  when a whale is struck it sometimes happens that the whole of the line in a boat is run out  when this is about to occur it becomes necessary to hold on as much as can be done without running the boat under the water and an oar is set up on end to show that assistance is required either from the ship or from the other boats  as the line grows less and less another and another oar is hoisted to show that help must be sent quickly  if no assistance can be sent the only thing that remains to be done is to cut the line and lose the fish but a whaleline with its harpoon is a very heavy loss in addition to that of the fish so that whalers are tempted to hold on a little too long sometimes  when we saw the mates boat dashing away in this style we forgot our grief at the loss of our whale in our anxiety to render assistance to our comrades and we rowed towards them as fast as we could fortunately the whale changed its course and came straight towards us so that we ceased pulling and waited till they came up  as the boat came on i saw the foam curling up on her bows as she leaped and flew over the sea  i could scarcely believe it possible that wood and iron could bear such a strain  in a few minutes they were almost abreast of us  youre holding too hard shouted the captain  lines all out roared the mate  they were past almost before these short sentences could be spoken  but they had not gone twenty yards ahead of us when the water rushed in over the bow and before we could utter a word the boat and crew were gone not a trace of them remained  the horror of the moment had not been fully felt however when the boat rose to the surface keel up and one after another the heads of the men appeared  the line had fortunately broken otherwise the boat would have been lost and the entire crew probably would have gone to the bottom with her  we instantly pulled to the rescue and were thankful to find that not a man was killed though some of them were a little hurt and all had received a terrible fright  we next set to work to right the upset boat an operation which was not accomplished without much labour and difficulty  now while we were thus employed our third boat which was in charge of the second mate had gone after the whale that had caused us so much trouble and when we had got the boat righted and began to look about us we found that she was fast to the fish about a mile to leeward  hurrah lads cried the captain luck has not left us yet  give way my hearties pull like britons well get that fish yet  we were all dreadfully done up by this time but the sight of a boat fast to a whale restored us at once and we pulled away as stoutly as if we had only begun the days work  the whale was heading in the direction of the ship and when we came up to the scene of action the second mate had just touched the life in other words he had driven the lance deep down into the whales vitals  this was quickly known by jets of blood being spouted up through the blowholes  soon after our victim went into its dying agonies or as whalemen say his flurry  this did not last long  in a short time he rolled over dead  we fastened a line to his tail the three boats took the carcass in tow and singing a lively song we rowed away to the ship  thus ended our first battle with the whales    chapter four  cuttingin the blubber and trying out the oil  the scene that took place on board ship after we caught our first fish was most wonderful  we commenced the operation of what is called cuttingin that is cutting up the whale and getting the fat or blubber hoisted in  the next thing we did was to try out the oil or melt down the fat in large iron pots brought with us for this purpose and the change that took place in the appearance of the ship and the men when this began was very remarkable  when we left port our decks were clean our sails white our masts well scraped the brasswork about the quarterdeck was well polished and the men looked tidy and clean  a few hours after our first whale had been secured alongside all this was changed  the cutting up of the huge carcass covered the decks with oil and blood making them so slippery that they had to be covered with sand to enable the men to walk about then the smoke of the great fires under the meltingpots begrimed the masts sails and cordage with soot  the faces and hands of the men got so covered with oil and soot that it would have puzzled any one to say whether they were white or black  their clothes too became so dirty that it was impossible to clean them  but indeed whalemen do not much mind this  in fact they take a pleasure in all the dirt that surrounds them because it is a sign of success in the main object of their voyage  the men in a clean whaleship are never happy  when everything is filthy and dirty and greasy and smoky and black decks rigging clothes and personit is then that the hearty laugh and jest and song are heard as the crew work busily night and day at their rough but profitable labour  the operations of cuttingin and trying out were matters of great interest to me the first time i saw them  after having towed our whale to the ship cuttingin was immediately begun  first the carcass was secured near the head and tail with chains and made fast to the ship then the great blocks and ropes fastened to the main and foremast for hoisting in the blubber were brought into play  when all was ready the captain and the two mates with tom lokins got upon the whales body with longhandled sharp spades or diggingknives  with these they fell to work cutting off the blubber  i was stationed at one of the hoisting ropes and while we were waiting for the signal to hoist away i peeped over the side and for the first time had a good look at the great fish  when we killed it so much of its body was down in the water that i could not see it very clearly but now that it was lashed at full length alongside the ship and i could look right down upon it i began to understand more clearly what a large creature it was  one thing surprised me much the top of its head which was rough and knotty like the bark of an old tree was swarming with little crabs and barnacles and other small creatures the whales head seemed to be their regular home  this fish was by no means one of the largest kind but being the first i had seen i fancied it must be the largest fish in the sea  its body was forty feet long and twenty feet round at the thickest part  its head which seemed to me a great blunt shapeless thing like a clumsy old boat was eight feet long from the tip to the blowholes or nostrils and these holes were situated on the back of the head which at that part was nearly four feet broad  the entire head measured about twentyone feet round  its ears were two small holes so small that it was difficult to discover them and the eyes were also very small for so large a body being about the same size as those of an ox  the mouth was very large and the under jaw had great ugly lips  when it was dying i saw these lips close in once or twice on its fat cheeks which it bulged out like the leather sides of a pair of gigantic bellows  it had two fins one on each side just behind the head  with these and with its tail the whale swims and fights  its tail is its most deadly weapon  the flukes of this one measured thirteen feet across and with one stroke of this it could have smashed our largest boat in pieces  many a boat has been sent to the bottom in this way  i remember hearing our first mate tell of a wonderful escape a comrade of his had in the greenland sea fishery  a whale had been struck and after its first run they hauled up to it again and rowed so hard that they ran the boat right against it  the harpooner was standing on the bow all ready and sent his iron cleverly into the blubber  in its agony the whale reared its tail high out of the water and the flukes whirled for a moment like a great fan just above the harpooners head one glance up was enough to show him that certain death was descending in an instant he dived over the side and disappeared  next moment the flukes came down on the part of the boat he had just left and cut it clean off the other part was driven into the waves and the men were left swimming in the water  they were all picked up however by another boat that was in company and the harpooner was recovered with the rest  his quick dive had been the saving of his life  i had not much time given me to study the appearance of this whale before the order was given to hoist away so we went to work with a will  the first part that came up was the huge lip fastened to a large iron hook called the blubber hook  it was lowered into the blubberroom between decks where a couple of men were stationed to stow the blubber away  then came the fins and after them the upperjaw with the whalebone attached to it  the right whale has no teeth like the sperm whale  in place of teeth it has the wellknown substance called whalebone which grows from the roof of its mouth in a number of broad thin plates extending from the back of the head to the snout the lower edges of these plates of whalebone are split into thousands of hairs like bristles so that the inside roof of a whales mouth resembles an enormous blacking brush  the object of this curious arrangement is to enable the whale to catch the little shrimps and small seablubbers called medusae on which it feeds  i have spoken before of these last as being the little creatures that gave out such a beautiful paleblue light at night  the whale feeds on them  when he desires a meal he opens his great mouth and rushes into the midst of a shoal of medusae the little things get entangled in thousands among the hairy ends of the whalebone and when the monster has got a large enough mouthful he shuts his lowerjaw and swallows what his net has caught  the wisdom as well as the necessity of this arrangement is very plain of course while dashing through the sea in this fashion with his mouth agape the whale must keep his throat closed else the water would rush down it and choke him  shutting his throat then as he does the water is obliged to flow out of his mouth as fast as it flows in it is also spouted up through his blowholes and this with such violence that many of the little creatures would be swept out along with it but for the hairyended whalebone which lets the seawater out but keeps the medusae in  well let us return to our cuttingin  after the upperjaw came the lowerjaw and throat with the tongue  this last was an enormous mass of fat about as large as an ox and it weighed fifteen hundred or two thousand pounds  after this was got in the rest of the work was simple  the blubber of the body was peeled off in great strips beginning at the neck and being cut spirally towards the tail  it was hoisted on board by the blocks the captain and mates cutting and the men at the windlass hoisting and the carcass slowly turning round until we got an unbroken piece of blubber reaching from the water to nearly as high as the mainyardarm  this mass was nearly a foot thick and it looked like fat pork  it was cut off close to the deck and lowered into the blubberroom where the two men stationed there attacked it with knives cut it into smaller pieces and stowed it away  then another piece was hoisted on board in the same fashion and so on we went till every bit of blubber was cut off and i heard the captain remark to the mate when the work was done that the fish was a good fat one and he wouldnt wonder if it turned out to be worth 300 pounds sterling  now when this process was going on a new point of interest arose which i had not thought of before although my messmate tom lokins had often spoken of it on the voyage out  this was the arrival of great numbers of seabirds  tom had often told me of the birds that always keep company with whalers but i had forgotten all about it until i saw an enormous albatross come sailing majestically through the air towards us  this was the largest bird i ever saw and no wonder for it is the largest bird that flies  soon after that another arrived and although we were more than a thousand miles from any shore we were speedily scented out and surrounded by hosts of gonies stinkards haglets gulls pigeons petrels and other seabirds which commenced to feed on pieces of the whales carcass with the most savage gluttony  these birds were dreadfully greedy  they had stuffed themselves so full in the course of a short time that they flew heavily and with great difficulty  no doubt they would have to take three or four days to digest that meal  sharks too came to get their share of what was going  but these savage monsters did not content themselves with what was thrown away they were so bold as to come before our faces and take bites out of the whales body  some of these sharks were eight and nine feet long and when i saw them open their horrid jaws armed with three rows of glistening white sharp teeth i could well understand how easily they could bite off the leg of a man as they often do when they get the chance  sometimes they would come right up on the whales body with a wave bite out great pieces of the flesh turn over on their bellies and roll off  while i was looking over the side during the early part of that day i saw a very large shark come rolling up in this way close to tom lokins legs  tom made a cut at him with his blubberspade but the shark rolled off in time to escape the blow  and after all it would not have done him much damage for it is not easy to frighten or take the life out of a shark  hand me an iron and line bob said tom looking up at me  ive got a spite agin that feller  hes been up twice already  ah hand it down here and two or three of ye stand by to hold on by the line  there he comes the big villain  the shark came close to the side of the whale at that moment and tom sent the harpoon right down his throat  hold on hard shouted tom  ay ay replied several of the men as they held on to the line their arms jerking violently as the savage fish tried to free itself  we quickly reeved a line through a block at the fore yardarm and hauled it on deck with much difficulty  the scene that followed was very horrible for there was no killing the brute  it threshed the deck with its tail and snapped so fiercely with its tremendous jaws that we had to keep a sharp look out lest it should catch hold of a leg  at last its tail was cut off the body cut open and all the entrails taken out yet even after this it continued to flap and thresh about the deck for some time and the heart continued to contract for twenty minutes after it was taken out and pierced with a knife  i would not have believed this had i not seen it with my own eyes  in case some of my readers may doubt its truth i would remind them how difficult it is to kill some of those creatures with which we are all familiar  the common worm for instance may be cut into a number of small pieces and yet each piece remains alive for some time after  the skin of the shark is valued by the whalemen because when cleaned and dry it is as good as sandpaper and is much used in polishing the various things they make out of whales bones and teeth  when the last piece of blubber had been cut off our whale the great chain that held it to the ships side was cast off and the now useless carcass sank like a stone much to the sorrow of some of the smaller birds which having been driven away by their bigger comrades had not fed so heartily as they wished perhaps  but what was loss to the gulls was gain to the sharks which could follow the carcass down into the deep and devour it at their leisure  now lads cried the mate when the remains had vanished rouse up the fires look alive my hearties  ay ay sir was the ready reply cheerfully given as every man sprang to his appointed duty  and so having cut in our whale we next proceeded to try out the oil    chapter five  a storm a man overboard and a rescue  the scenes in a whalemans life are varied and very stirring  sometimes he is floating on the calm ocean idling about the deck and whistling for a breeze when all of a sudden the loud cry is heard there she blows and in a moment the boats are in the water and he is engaged in all the toils of an exciting chase  then comes the battle with the great leviathan of the deep with all its risks and dangers  sometimes he is unfortunate the decks are clean he has nothing to do  at other times he is lucky cuttingin and trying out engage all his energies and attention  frequently storms toss him on the angry deep and show him if he will but learn the lesson how helpless a creature he is and how thoroughly dependent at all times for life safety and success upon the arm of god  trying out the oil although not so thrilling a scene as many a one in his career is nevertheless extremely interesting especially at night when the glare of the fires in the tryworks casts a deep red glow on the faces of the men on the masts and sails and even out upon the sea  the tryworks consisted of two huge meltingpots fixed upon brickwork fireplaces between the fore and main masts  while some of the men were down in the blubberroom cutting the blanketpieces as the largest masses are called others were pitching the smaller pieces on deck where they were seized by two men who stood near a block of wood called a horse with a mincing knife to slash the junks so as to make them melt easily  these were then thrown into the meltingpots by one of the mates who kept feeding the fires with such scraps of blubber as remain after the oil is taken out  once the fires were fairly set agoing no other kind of fuel was required than scraps of blubber  as the boiling oil rose it was baled into copper coolingtanks  it was the duty of two other men to dip it out of these tanks into casks which were then headed up by our cooper and stowed away in the hold  as the night advanced the fires became redder and brighter by contrast the light shone and glittered on the decks and as we plied our dirty work i could not help thinking what would my mother say if she could get a peep at me now  the ships crew worked and slept by watches for the fires were not allowed to go out all night  about midnight i sat down on the windlass to take a short rest and began talking to one of the men fred borders by name  he was one of the quietest and most active men in the ship and being quite a young man not more than nineteen he and i drew to one another and became very intimate  i think were goin to have a breeze bob said he as a sharp puff of wind crossed the deck driving the black smoke to leeward and making the fire flare up in the tryworks  i hope it wont be a storm then said i for it will oblige us to put out the fires  just then tom lokins came up ordered fred to go and attend to the fires sat down opposite to me on the windlass and began to lay down the law in regard to storms  you see bob ledbury said he beginning to fill his pipe young fellers like you dont know nothin about the weathercause why youve got no experience  now ill put you up to a dodge consarning this very thing  i never found out what was the dodge that tom in his wisdom was to have put me up to for at that moment the captain came on deck and gave orders to furl the topgallant sails  three or four of us ran up the rigging like monkeys and in a few minutes the sails were lashed to the yards  the wind now began to blow steadily from the norwest but not so hard as to stop our tryworks for more than an hour  after that it blew stiff enough to raise a heavy sea and we were compelled to slack the fires  this was all the harm it did to us however for although the breeze was stiffish it was nothing like a gale  as the captain and the first mate walked the quarterdeck together i heard the former say to the latter i think we had as well take in a reef in the topsails  all hereabouts the fishingground is good we dont need to carry on  the order was given to reduce sail and the men lay out on the topsail yards  i noticed that my friend fred borders was the first man to spring up the shrouds and lay out on the maintopsail yard  it was so dark that i could scarcely see the masts  while i was gazing up i thought i observed a dark object drop from the yard at the same moment there was a loud shriek followed by a plunge in the sea  this was succeeded by the sudden cry man overboard and instantly the whole ship was in an uproar  no one who has not heard that cry can understand the dreadful feelings that are raised in the human breast by it  my heart at first seemed to leap into my mouth and almost choke me  then a terrible fear which i cannot describe shot through me when i thought it might be my comrade fred borders  but these thoughts and feelings passed like lightningin a far shorter time than it takes to write them down  the shriek was still ringing in my ears when the captain roared  down your helm stand by to lower away the boats  at the same moment he seized a light hencoop and tossed it overboard and the mate did the same with an oar in the twinkling of an eye almost without knowing what i did or why i did it i seized a great mass of oakum and rubbish that lay on the deck saturated with oil i thrust it into the embers of the fire in the tryworks and hurled it blazing into the sea  the ships head was thrown into the wind and we were brought to as quickly as possible  a gleam of hope arose within me on observing that the mass i had thrown overboard continued still to burn but when i saw how quickly it went astern notwithstanding our vigorous efforts to stop the ship my heart began to sink and when a few moments after the light suddenly disappeared despair seized upon me and i gave my friend up for lost  at that moment strange to say thoughts of my mother came into my mind but there was no time to be lost and i threw myself with a good deal of energy into the first boat that was lowered and pulled at the oar as if my own life depended on it  a lantern had been fastened to the end of an oar and set up in the boat and by its faint light i could see that the men looked very grave  tom lokins was steering and i sat near him pulling the aft oar  do you think weve any chance tom said i  a shake of the head was his only reply  it must have been here away said the mate who stood up in the bow with a coil of rope at his feet and a boathook in his hand  hold on lads did any one hear a cry  no one answered  we all ceased pulling and listened intently but the noise of the waves and the whistling of the winds were all the sounds we heard  whats that floating on the water said one of the men suddenly  where away cried every one eagerly  right off the leebowthere dont you see it  at that moment a faint cry came floating over the black water and died away in the breeze  the single word hurrah burst from our throats with all the power of our lungs and we bent to our oars till we wellnigh tore the rollocks out of the boat  hold hard stern all roared the mate as we went flying down to leeward and almost ran over the hencoop to which a human form was seen to be clinging with the tenacity of a drowning man  we had swept down so quickly that we shot past it  in an agony of fear lest my friend should be again lost in the darkness i leaped up and sprang into the sea  tom lokins however had noticed what i was about he seized me by the collar of my jacket just as i reached the water and held me with a grip like a vice till one of the men came to his assistance and dragged me back into the boat  in a few moments more we reached the hencoop and fred was saved  he was half dead with cold and exhaustion poor fellow but in a few minutes he began to recover and before we reached the ship he could speak  his first words were to thank god for his deliverance  then he added  and thanks to the man that flung that light overboard  i should have gone down but for that  it showed me where the hencoop was  i cannot describe the feeling of joy that filled my heart when he said this  ay who wos it that throwd that fire overboard inquired one of the men  dont know replied another i think it wos the capn  youll find that out when we get aboard cried the mate pull away lads  in five minutes fred borders was passed up the side and taken down below  in two minutes more we had him stripped naked rubbed dry wrapped in hot blankets and set down on one of the lockers with a hot brick at his feet    chapter six  the whalefighting bulls etcetera  as the reader may perhaps have been asking a few questions about the whale in his own mind i shall try to answer them by telling a few things concerning that creature which i think are worth knowing  in the first place the whale is not a fish  i have applied that name to it no doubt because it is the custom to do so but there are great differences between the whales and the fishes  the mere fact that the whale lives in water is not sufficient to prove it to be a fish  the frog lives very much in waterhe is born in the water and when very young he lives in it altogetherwould die in fact if he were taken out of it yet a frog is not a fish  the following are some of the differences existing between a whale and a fish  the whale is a warmblooded animal the fish is coldblooded  the whale brings forth its young alive while most fishes lay eggs or spawn moreover the fish lives entirely under water but the whale cannot do so  he breathes air through enormous lungs not gills  if you were to hold a whales head under water for much longer than an hour it would certainly be drowned and this is the reason why it comes so frequently to the surface of the sea to take breath  whales seldom stay more than an hour under water and when they come up to breathe they discharge the last breath they took through their nostrils or blowholes mixed with large quantities of water which they have taken in while feeding but the most remarkable point of difference between the whale and fishes of all kinds is that it suckles its young  the calf of one kind of whale is about fourteen feet long when it is born and it weighs about a ton  the cowwhale usually has only one calf at a time and the manner in which she behaves to her gigantic baby shows that she is affected by feelings of anxiety and affection such as are never seen in fishes which heartless creatures forsake their eggs when they are laid and i am pretty sure they would not know their own children if they happened to meet with them  the whale on the contrary takes care of her little one gives it suck and sports playfully with it in the waves its enormous heart throbbing all the while no doubt with satisfaction  i have heard of a whale which was once driven into shoal water with its calf and nearly stranded  the huge dam seemed to become anxious for the safety of her child for she was seen to swim eagerly round it embrace it with her fins and roll it over in the waves trying to make it follow her into deep water  but the calf was obstinate it would not go and the result was that the boat of a whaler pulled up and harpooned it  the poor little whale darted away like lightning on receiving the terrible iron and ran out a hundred fathoms of line but it was soon overhauled and killed  all this time the dam kept close to the side of its calf and not until a harpoon was plunged into her own side would she move away  two boats were after her  with a single rap of her tail she cut one of the boats in two and then darted off  but in a short time she turned and came back  her feelings of anxiety had returned no doubt after the first sting of pain was over and she died at last close to the side of her young one  there are various kinds of whales but the two sorts that are most sought after are the common whale of the greenland seas which is called the right whale and the sperm whale of the south sea  both kinds are found in the south but the sperm whale never goes to the north seas both kinds grow to an enormous sizesometimes to seventy feet in length but there is considerable difference in their appearance especially about the head  in a former chapter i have partly described the head of a right whale which has whalebone instead of teeth with its blowholes on the back of the head  the sperm whale has large white teeth in its lowerjaw and none at all in the upper  it has only one blowhole and that a little one much farther forward on its head so that sailors can tell at a great distance what kind of whales they see simply by their manner of spouting  the most remarkable feature about the sperm whale is the bluntness of its clumsy head which looks somewhat like a big log with the end sawn square off and this head is about onethird of its entire body  the sperm whale feeds differently from the right whale  he seizes his prey with his powerful teeth and lives to a great extent on large cuttlefish  some of them have been seen to vomit lumps of these cuttlefish as long as a whaleboat  he is much fiercer too than the right whale which almost always takes to flight when struck but the sperm whale will sometimes turn on its foes and smash their boat with a blow of his blunt head or tail  fightingwhales as they are called are not uncommon  these are generally old bulls which have become wise from experience and give the whalers great troublesometimes carrying away several harpoons and lines  the lowerjaw of one old bull of this kind was found to be sixteen feet long and it had fortyeight teeth some of them a foot long  a number of scars about his head showed that this fellow had been in the wars  when two bullwhales take to fighting their great effort is to catch each other by the lowerjaw and when locked together they struggle with a degree of fury that cannot be described  it is not often that the sperm whale actually attacks a ship but there are a few cases of this kind which cannot be doubted  the following story is certainly true and while it shows how powerful a creature the whale is it also shows what terrible risk and sufferings the whaleman has frequently to encounter  in the month of august 1819 the american whaleship essex sailed from nantucket for the pacific ocean  she was commanded by captain pollard late in the autumn of the same year when in latitude 40 degrees of the south pacific a shoal or school of sperm whales was discovered and three boats were immediately lowered and sent in pursuit  the mates boat was struck by one of the fish during the chase and it was found necessary to return to the ship to repair damages  while the men were employed at this an enormous whale suddenly rose quite close to the ship  he was going at nearly the same rate with the shipabout three miles an hour and the men who were good judges of the size of whales thought that it could not have been less than eightyfive feet long  all at once he ran against the ship striking her bows and causing her to tremble like a leaf  the whale immediately dived and passed under the ship and grazed her keel in doing so  this evidently hurt his back for he suddenly rose to the surface about fifty yards off and commenced lashing the sea with his tail and fins as if suffering great agony  it was truly an awful sight to behold that great monster lashing the sea into foam at so short a distance  in a short time he seemed to recover and started off at great speed to windward  meanwhile the men discovered that the blow received by the ship had done her so much damage that she began to fill and settle down at the bows so they rigged the pumps as quickly as possible  while working them one of the men cried out  god have mercy he comes again  this was too true  the whale had turned and was now bearing down on them at full speed leaving a white track of foam behind him  rushing at the ship like a batteringram he hit her fair on the weather bow and stove it in after which he dived and disappeared  the horrified men took to their boats at once and in ten minutes the ship went down  the condition of the men thus left in three open boats far out upon the sea without provisions or shelter was terrible indeed  some of them perished and the rest after suffering the severest hardships reached a low island called ducies on the 20th of december  it was a mere sandbank which supplied them only with water and seafowl  still even this was a mercy for which they had reason to thank god for in cases of this kind one of the evils that seamen have most cause to dread is the want of water  three of the men resolved to remain on this sandbank for dreary and uninhabited though it was they preferred to take their chance of being picked up by a passing ship rather than run the risks of crossing the wide ocean in open boats so their companions bade them a sorrowful farewell and left them  but this island is far out of the usual track of ships  the poor fellows have never since been heard of  it was the 27th of december when the three boats left the sandbank with the remainder of the men and began a voyage of two thousand miles towards the island of juan fernandez  the mates boat was picked up about three months after by the ship indian of london with only three living men in it  about the same time the captains boat was discovered by the dauphin of nantucket with only two men living and these unhappy beings had only sustained life by feeding on the flesh of their dead comrades  the third boat must have been lost for it was never heard of and out of the whole crew of twenty men only five returned home to tell their eventful story  before resuming the thread of my narrative i must not omit to mention that in the head of the sperm whale there is a large cavity or hole called the case which contains pure oil that does not require to be melted but can be bailed at once into casks and stowed away  this is the valuable spermaceti from which the finest candles are made  one whale will sometimes yield fifteen barrels of spermaceti oil from the case of its head  a large fish will produce from eighty to a hundredbarrels of oil altogether sometimes much more and when whalemen converse with each other about the size of whales they speak of eightybarrel fish and so on  although i have written much about the fighting powers of the sperm whale it must not be supposed that whales are by nature fond of fighting  on the contrary the right whale is a timid creature and never shows fight except in defence of its young  and the sperm whale generally takes to flight when pursued  in fact most of the accidents that happen to whalemen occur when the wounded monster is lashing the water in blind terror and agony  the whale has three bitter enemies much smaller but much bolder than himself and of these he is terribly afraid  they are the swordfish the thrasher and the killer  the first of these the swordfish has a strong straight horn or sword projecting from his snout with which he boldly attacks and pierces the whale  the thrasher is a strong fish twenty feet long and of great weight  its method of attack is to leap out of the water on the whales back and deal it a tremendous blow with its powerful tail  the swordfish and thrasher sometimes act together in the attack the first stabbing him below and the second belabouring him above while the whale unable or too frightened to fight rushes through the water and even leaps its whole gigantic length into the air in its endeavours to escape  when a whale thus leaps his whole length out of the water the sailors say he breaches and breaching is a common practice  they seem to do it often for amusement as well as from terror  but the most deadly of the three enemies is the killer  this is itself a kind of small whale but it is wonderfully strong swift and bold when one of the killers gets into the middle of a school of whales the frightened creatures are seen flying in all directions  his mode of attack is to seize his big enemy by the jaw and hold on until he is exhausted and dies    chapter seven  toms wisdomanother great battle  one day i was standing beside the windlass listening to the conversation of five or six of the men who were busy sharpening harpoons and cuttingknives or making all kinds of toys and things out of whales bones  we had just finished cuttingin and trying out our third whale and as it was not long since we reached the fishingground we were in high hopes of making a good thing of it that season so that every one was in good spirits from the captain down to the youngest man in the ship  tom lokins was smoking his pipe and toms pipe was an uncommonly black one for he smoked it very often  moreover toms pipe was uncommonly short so short that i always wondered how he escaped burning the end of his nose  indeed some of the men said that the redness of the end of toms nose was owing to its being baked like a brick by the heat of his pipe  tom took this pipe from his mouth and while he was pushing down the tobacco with the end of his little finger he said  dye know lads ive been thinkin  no have ye cried one of the men interrupting him with a look of pretended surprise  well now i do think messmates that we should ax the mate to make a note o that in the log for its not often that tom lokins takes to thinkin  there was a laugh at this but tom turning with a look of contempt to the man who interrupted him replied  ill tell you wot it is bill blunt if all the thoughts that you think and especially the jokes that you utter wos put down in the log theyd be so heavy that i do believe they would sink the ship  well well cried bill joining in the laugh against himself if they did your jokes would be so light and triflin that i do believe theyd float her again  but what have you been athinkin of tom  ive been thinkin said tom slowly that if a whale makes his breakfast entirely off them little things that you can hardly see when you get em into a tumbleri forget how the captain calls emwot a treemendous heap of em he must eat in the course of a year  thousands of em i suppose said one of the men  thousands cried tom i should rather say billions of them  how much is billions mate inquired bill  i dont know answered tom  never could find out  you see its heaps upon heaps of thousands for the thousands come first and the billions afterwards but when ive thought uncommon hard for a long spell at a time i always get confused because millions comes in between dye see and thats puzzlin  i think i could give you some notion about these things said fred borders who had been quietly listening all the time but never putting in a word for as i have said fred was a modest bashful man and seldom spoke much  but we had all come to notice that when fred spoke he had always something to say worth hearing and when he did speak he spoke out boldly enough  we had come to have feelings of respect for our young shipmate for he was a kindhearted lad and we saw by his conversation that he had been better educated than the most of us so all our tongues stopped as the eyes of the party turned on him  come fred lets hear it then said tom  its not much i have to tell began fred but it may help to make your minds clearer on this subject  on my first voyage to the whalefishery you know lads this is my second voyage i went to the greenland seas  we had a young doctor aboard with usquite a youth indeed he had not finished his studies at college but he was cleverer for all that than many an older man that had gone through his whole course  i do believe that the reason of his being so clever was that he was for ever observing things and studying them and making notes and trying to find out reasons  he was never satisfied with knowing a thing he must always find out why it was  one day i heard him ask the captain what it was that made the sea so green in some parts of those seas  our captain was an awfully stupid man  so long as he got plenty of oil he didnt care two straws for the reason of anything  the young doctor had been bothering him that morning with a good many questions so when he asked him what made the sea green he answered sharply i suppose it makes itself green young man and then he turned from him with a fling  the doctor laughed and came forward among the men and began to tell us stories and ask questions  ah he was a real hearty fellow he would tell you all kinds of queer things and would pump you dry of all you knew in no time  well but the thing i was going to tell you was this one of the men said to him he had heard that the greenness of the greenland sea was caused by the little things like small bits of jelly on which the whales feed  as soon as he heard this he got a bucket and hauled some seawater aboard and for the next ten days he was never done working away with the seawater pouring it into tumblers and glasses looking through it by daylight and by lamplight tasting it and boiling it and examining it with a microscope  whats a microscope inquired one of the men  dont you know said tom lokins why its a glass that makes little things seem big when ye look through it  ive heerd say that beasts that are so uncommon small that you cant see them at all are made to come into sight and look quite big by means o this glass  but i cant myself say that its true  but i can said fred for i have seen it with my own eyes  well after a good while i made bold to ask the young doctor what he had found out  ive found said he that the greenness of these seas is in truth caused by uncountable numbers of medusae  ha thats the word shouted tom lokins medoosy thats wot the captain calls em  heave ahead fred  well then continued fred the young doctor went on to tell me that he had been counting the matter to himself very carefully and he found that in every square mile of seawater there were living about eleven quadrillions nine hundred and ninetynine trillions of these little creatures  oh hallo come now we all cried opening our eyes very wide indeed  but i say how much is that inquired tom lokins  ah thats just what i said to the young doctor and he said to me ill tell you what fred borders no man alive understands how much that is and whats more no man ever will but ill give you some notion of what it means and so he told me how long it would take forty thousand men to count that number of eleven quadrillions nine hundred and ninetynine trillions each man of the forty thousand beginning one two three and going on till the sum of the whole added together would make it up  now how long dye think it would take themguess  fred borders smiled as he said this and looked round the circle of men  i know cried one it would take the whole forty thousand a week to do it  oh nonsense they could do it easy in two days said another  that shows how little you know about big numbers observed tom lokins knocking the ashes out of his pipe  im pretty sure it couldnt be done in much less than six months workin hard all day and makin allowance for only one hour off for dinner  youre all wrong shipmates said fred borders  that young doctor told me that if theyd begun work at the day of creation they would only have just finished the job last year  oh gammon youre jokin cried bill blunt  no im not said fred for i was told afterwards by an old clergyman that the young doctor was quite right and that any one who was good at rithmetic could work the thing out for himself in less than halfanhour  just as fred said this there came a loud cry from the masthead that made us all spring to our feet like lightning  there she blows  there she breaches  the captain was on deck in a moment  where away he cried  on the lee beam sir  sperm whale about two miles off  there she blows  every man was at his station in a moment for after being some months out we became so used to the work that we acted together like a piece of machinery  but our excitement never abated in the least  sing out when the ship heads for her  ay ay sir  keep her away said the captain to the man at the helm  bob ledbury hand me the spyglass  steady from the masthead  steady it is answered the man at the helm  while we were all looking eagerly out ahead we heard a thundering snore behind us followed by a heavy splash  turning quickly round we saw the flukes of an enormous whale sweeping through the air not more than six hundred yards astern of us  down your helm roared the captain haul up the mainsail and square the yards  call all hands  all hands ahoy roared bill blunt in a voice of thunder and in another moment every man in the ship was on deck  hoist and swing the boats cried the captain  lower away  down went the boats into the water the men were into their places almost before you could wink and we pulled away from the ship just as the whale rose the second time about half a mile away to leeward  from the appearance of this whale we felt certain that it was one of the largest we had yet seen so we pulled after it with right good will  i occupied my usual place in the captains boat next the bowoar just beside tom lokins who was ready with his harpoons in the bow  young borders pulled the oar directly in front of me  the captain himself steered and as our crew was a picked one we soon left the other two boats behind us  presently a small whale rose close beside us and sending a shower of spray over the boat went down in a pool of foam  before we had time to speak another whale rose on the opposite side of the boat and then another on our starboard bow  we had got into the middle of a shoal of whales which commenced leaping and spouting all round us little aware of the dangerous enemy that was so near  in a few minutes more up comes the big one again that we had first seen  he seemed very active and wild  after blowing on the surface once or twice about a quarter of a mile off he peaked his flukes and pitched down head foremost  now then lads hes down for a long dive said the captain spring your oars like men well get that fish for certain if youll only pull  the captain was mistaken the whale had only gone down deep in order to come up and breach or spring out of the water for the next minute he came up not a hundred yards from us and leaped his whole length into the air  a shout of surprise broke from the men and no wonder for this was the largest fish i ever saw or heard of and he came up so clear of the water that we could see him from head to tail as he turned over in the air exposing his white belly to view and came down on his great side with a crash like thunder that might have been heard six miles off  a splendid mass of pure white spray burst from the spot where he fell and in another moment he was gone  i do believe its new zealand tom cried bill blunt referring to an old bull whale that had become famous among the men who frequented these seas for its immense size and fierceness and for the great trouble it had given them smashing some of their boats and carrying away many of their harpoons  i dont know whether its new zealand tom or not said the captain but its pretty clear that hes an old sperm bull  give way lads we must get that whale whatever it should cost us  we did not need a second bidding the size of the fish was so great that we felt more excited than we had yet been during the voyage so we bent our oars till we almost pulled the boat out of the water  the other boats had got separated chasing the little whales so we had this one all to ourselves  there she blows said tom lokins in a low voice as the fish came up a short distance astern of us  we had overshot our mark so turning about we made for the whale which kept for a considerable time near the top of the water spouting now and then and going slowly to windward  we at last got within a few feet of the monster and the captain suddenly gave the word stand up  this was to our harpooner tom lokins who jumped up on the instant and buried two harpoons deep in the blubber  stern all was the next word and we backed off with all our might it was just in time for in his agony the whale tossed his tail right over our heads the flukes were so big that they could have completely covered the boat and he brought them down flat on the sea with a clap that made our ears tingle while a shower of spray drenched us to the skin  for one moment i thought it was all over with us but we were soon out of immediate danger and lay on our oars watching the writhings of the wounded monster as he lashed the ocean into foam  the water all round us soon became white like milk and the foam near the whale was red with blood  suddenly this ceased and before we could pull up to lance him he went down taking the line out at such a rate that the boat spun round and sparks of fire flew from the loggerhead from the chafing of the rope  hold on cried the captain and next moment we were tearing over the sea at a fearful rate with a bank of white foam rolling before us high above our bows and away on each side of us like the track of a steamer so that we expected it every moment to rush inboard and swamp us  i had never seen anything like this before  from the first i had a kind of feeling that some evil would befall us  while we were tearing over the water in this way we saw the other whales coming up every now and then and blowing quite near to us and presently we passed close enough to the first mates boat to see that he was fast to a fish and unable therefore to render us help if we should need it  in a short time the line began to slack so we hauled it in hand over hand and tom lokins coiled it away in the tub in the stern of the boat while the captain took his place in the bow to be ready with the lance the whale soon came up and we pulled with all our might towards him instead of making off again however he turned round and made straight at the boat  i now thought that destruction was certain for when i saw his great blunt forehead coming down on us like a steamboat i felt that we could not escape  i was mistaken  the captain received him on the point of his lance and the whale has such a dislike to pain that even a small prick will sometimes turn him  for some time we kept dodging round this fellow but he was so old and wise that he always turned his head to us and prevented us from getting a chance to lance him  at last he turned a little to one side and the captain plunged the lance deep into his vitals  ha thats touched his life cried tom as a stream of blood flew up from his blowholes a sure sign that he was mortally wounded  but he was not yet conquered  after receiving the cruel stab with the lance he pitched right down head foremost and once more the line began to fly out over the bow  we tried to hold on but he was going so straight down that the boat was almost swamped and we had to slack off to prevent our being pulled under water  before many yards of the line had run out one of the coils in the tub became entangled  look out lads cried tom and at once throwing the turn off the loggerhead he made an attempt to clear it  the captain in trying to do the same thing slipped and fell  seeing this i sprang up and grasping the coil as it flew past tried to clear it  before i could think a turn whipped round my left wrist  i felt a wrench as if my arm had been torn out of the socket and in a moment i was overboard see frontispiece going down with almost lightning speed into the depths of the sea  strange to say i did not lose my presence of mind  i knew exactly what had happened  i felt myself rushing down down down with terrific speed a stream of fire seemed to be whizzing past my eyes there was a dreadful pressure on my brain and a roaring as if of thunder in my ears  yet even in that dread moment thoughts of eternity of my sins and of meeting with my god flashed into my mind for thought is quicker than the lightning flash  of a sudden the roaring ceased and i felt myself buffeting the water fiercely in my efforts to reach the surface  i know not how i got free but i suppose the turn of the line must have slackened off somehow  all this happened within the space of a few brief moments but oh they seemed fearfully long to me  i do not think i could have held my breath a second longer  when i came to the surface and tried to look about me i saw the boat not more than fifty yards off and being a good swimmer i struck out for it although i felt terribly exhausted  in a few minutes my comrades saw me and with a cheer put out the oars and began to row towards me  i saw that the line was slack and that they were hauling it ina sign that the whale had ceased running and would soon come to the surface again  before they had pulled halfadozen strokes i saw the water open close beside the boat and the monstrous head of the whale shot up like a great rock rising out of the deep  he was not more than three feet from the boat and he came up with such force that more than half his gigantic length came out of the water right over the boat  i heard the captains loud crystern all but it was too late the whole weight of the monsters body fell upon the boat there was a crash and a terrible cry as the whale and boat went down together  for a few moments he continued to lash the sea in his fury and the fragments of the boat floated all round him  i thought that every man of course had been killed but one after another their heads appeared in the midst of blood and foam and they struck out for oars and pieces of the wreck  providentially the whale in his tossings had shot a little away from the spot else every man must certainly have been killed  a feeling of horror filled my heart as i beheld all this and thought upon my position  fortunately i had succeeded in reaching a broken plank for my strength was now so much exhausted that i could not have kept my head above water any longer without its assistance  just then i heard a cheer and the next time i rose on the swell i looked quickly round and saw the mates boat making for the scene of action as fast as a stout and willing crew could pull  in a few minutes more i was clutched by the arm and hauled into it  my comrades were next rescued and we thanked god when we found that none were killed although one of them had got a leg broken and another an arm twisted out of joint they all however seemed to think that my escape was much more wonderful than theirs but i cannot say that i agreed with them in this  we now turned our attention to the whale which had dived again  as it was now loose we did not know of course where it would come up so we lay still awhile  very soon up he came not far from us and as fierce as ever  now lads we must get that whale cried the mate give way with a will  the order was obeyed  the boat almost leaped over the swell and before long another harpoon was in the whales back  fast again hurrah shouted the mate now for the lance  he gave the monster two deep stabs while he spoke and spouting the red stream of life it rolled on the sea in agony obliging us to keep well out of its way  i could not look upon the dying struggles of this enormous fish without feelings of regret and selfreproach for helping to destroy it  i felt almost as if i were a murderer and that the creator would call me to account for taking part in the destruction of one of his grandest living creatures  but the thought passed quickly from my mind as the whale became more violent and went into its flurry  it began to lash the sea with such astonishing violence that all the previous struggles seemed as nothing  the water all round became white like milk with great streaks of red blood running through it and the sound of the quick blows of its tail and fins resembled that of dull hollow thunder  we gazed at this scene in deep silence and with beating hearts  all at once the struggles ceased  the great carcass rolled over belly up and lay extended on the sea in death  to me it seemed as if a dead calm had suddenly fallen around us after a long and furious storm so great was the change when that whale at length parted with its huge life  the silence was suddenly broken by three hearty cheers and then fastening a rope to our prize we commenced towing it to the ship which operation occupied us the greater part of the night for we had no fewer than eight miles to pull    chapter eight  death on the sea  the whale which we had taken as i have related in the last chapter was our largest fish of that season  it produced ninety barrels of oil and was worth about 500 pounds sterling so that we did not grieve much over the loss of our boat  but our next loss was of a kind that could not be made up for by oil or money for it was the loss of a human life  in the whalefishery men must like soldiers expect to risk their lives frequently and they have too often alas to mourn over the loss of a shipmate or friend up to this time our voyage had gone prosperously  we had caught so many fish that nearly half our cargo was already completed and if we should be as lucky the remainder of the voyage we should be able to return home to old england much sooner than we had expected  of course during all this time we had met with some disappointments for i am not describing everything that happened on that voyage  it would require a much thicker volume than this to tell the half of our adventures  we lost five or six fish by their sinking before we could get them made fast to the ship and one or two bolted so fast that they broke loose and carried away a number of harpoons and many a fathom of line  but such misfortunes were what we had to look for  every whaler meets with similar changes of luck and we did not expect to fare differently from our neighbours  these things did not cause us much regret beyond the time of their occurrence  but it was far otherwise with the loss that now befell us  it happened one forenoon  i was standing close to the starboard gangway early that morning looking over the side into the calm water for there was not a breath of wind and talking to the first mate who was a gruff surly man but a good officer and kind enough in his way when everything went smooth with him  but things dont go very smooth generally in whaling life so the mate was oftener gruff than sweet  bob ledbury said he have you got your cuttingin gear in order ive got a notion that well raise the oil this day  all right sir said i you might shave yourself with the blubberspades  that was a good fish we got last sir wasnt it  pretty good though ive seen bigger  he gave us a deal of trouble too said i  not so much as ive seen others give said he  when i was fishing in the greenland seas we made fast to a whale that cost us i dont know how many hundred dollars  you must know the first mate was a yankee and he reckoned everything in dollars  how was that sir asked i  well it was something in this fashion  we were floating about in the north atlantic one calm hot day just something like this only it was the afternoon not the morning  we were doing nothing and whistling for a breeze when all of a sudden up comes five or six whales all round the ship as if they had spied her from the bottom of the sea and had come up to have a squint at her  of course the boats were manned at once and in less than no time we were tearing after them like all alive  but them whales were pretty wildish i guess  they kept us pullin the best part of five hours before we got a chance at them  my boat was out of sight of the ship before we made fast to a regular snorer a hundredbarreller at the least  the moment he felt the iron away he went like the shot out of a gun but he didnt keep it up long for soon after another of our boats came up and made fast  well for some two or three hours we held fast but could not haul on to him to use the lance for the moment we came close up alongside of his tail he peaked flukes and dived then up again and away as fast as ever  it was about noon before we touched him again but by that time two more harpoons were made fast and two other boats cast towlines aboard of us and were hauled along  that was four boats and more than sixteen hundred fathoms of line besides four harpoons that was fast to that whale and yet for all that he went ahead as fast as we could have rowed takin us along with him quite easy  a breeze having sprung up our ship overhauled us in the course of the afternoon and towards evening we sent a line on board to see if that would stop the big fish and the topsails were lowered so as to throw some of the ships weight on him but the irons drew out with the strain  however we determined to try it again  another line was sent aboard about eight oclock and the topsails were lowered but the line snapped immediately  well we held on to that whale the whole of that night and at four oclock next morning just thirtysix hours after he was first struck two fast lines were taken aboard the ship  the breeze was fresh and against us so the topgallant sails were taken in the courses hauled up and the topsails clewed down yet i assure you that whale towed the ship dead against the wind for an hour and a half at the rate of two miles an hour and all the while beating the water with his fins and tail so that the sea was in a continual foam  we did not kill that fish till after forty hours of the hardest work i ever went through  some of my shipmates seemed to doubt the truth of this story but for my part i believed it because the mate was a grave truthful man though he was gruff and never told lies as far as i knew  moreover a case of the same kind happened some years afterwards to a messmate of mine while he was serving aboard the royal bounty on the 28th of may 1817  i know that some of the stories which i now tell must seem very wild and unlikely to landsmen but those who have been to the whalefishery will admit that i tell nothing but the truth and if there are any of my readers who are still doubtful i would say go and read the works of captain scoresby  it is well known that this whaling captain was a truly religious man who gave up the fishing though it turned him in plenty of money and became a minister of the gospel with a small income so it is not likely that he would have told what was untrue well in his works we find stories that are quite as remarkable as the one i have just told some of them more so  for instance he tells us of one whale in the greenland seas which was not killed till it had drawn out ten thousand four hundred and forty yards or about six miles of line fastened to fifteen harpoons besides taking one of the boats entirely under water which boat was never seen again  the mate told us two or three more stories and a lot of us were gathered round him listening eagerly for there is nothing jack likes so much as a good yarn when all of a sudden the man at the masthead sang out that a large sperm whale was spouting away two points off the leebow  of course we were at our posts in a moment  there she blows there she breaches sung the lookout  lower away roared the captain  the boats were in the water and the men on their seats in a moment  the whale we were after was a very large one we could see that for after two hours hard pulling we got near enough to throw a harpoon and after it was fixed he jumped clean out of the water  then there was the usual battle  it was fierce and long so long that i began to fear we would have to return empty handed to the ship  we put ten harpoons into him one after another and had a stiff run between the fixing of each  it is astonishing the difference between the fish  one will give you no trouble at all  i have often seen a good big fellow killed in half an hour  another will take you half a day and perhaps you may lose him after all  the whale we were now after at last took to showing fight he made two or three runs at the boat but the mate who was in command pricked him off with the lance cleverly  at last we gave him a severe wound and immediately he dived  that was into his life remarked tom lokins as we sat waiting for him to come up again  the captains boat was close to ours about ten yards off  we had not to wait long  the sudden stoppage and slacking off of all the lines showed that the whale was coming up  all at once i saw a dark object rising directly under the captains boat  before i could make out what it was almost before i could think the boat flew up into the air as if a powder magazine had exploded beneath it  the whale had come up and hit it with his head right on the keel so that it was knocked into pieces and the men oars harpoons lances and tackle shot up in confusion into the air  immediately after that the whale went into his flurry but we paid no attention to him in our anxiety to pick up our companions  they all came to the surface quickly enough but while some made for the boats vigorously others swam slowly and with pain showing that they were hurt while one or two floated as if dead upon the water  most of the men had escaped with only a few cuts and bruises but one poor fellow was hauled out of the water with a leg broken and another was so badly knocked about the head that it was a long time before he was again fit for duty  the worst case however was that of poor fred borders  he had a leg broken and a severe wound in the side from a harpoon which had been forced into the flesh over the barbs so that we could hardly get it drawn out  we laid him in the stern of the boat where he lay for some time insensible but in a short time he revived and spoke to us in a faint voice  his first words wereim dying messmates  dont say that fred said i while my heart sank within me  cheer up my boy youll live to be the death of many a whale yet  see put your lips to this canit will do you good  he shook his head gently being too weak to reply  we had killed a big fish that day and we knew that when he was tried in we should have completed our cargo but there was no cheer given when the monster turned over on his side and the pull to the ship that evening seemed to us the longest and heaviest we ever had for our hearts were very sad  next day fred was worse and we all saw that his words would come truehe was dying  i was permitted to nurse my poor messmate and i spent much of my time in reading the bible to him at his own request  he lived about a week after the accident and then he died  we buried our shipmate in the usual sailor fashion  we wrapped him in his hammock with a cannonball at his feet to sink him  the captain read the burialservice at the gangway and then in deep silence we committed his corpse to the deep    chapter nine  news from homea gam  the death of poor fred borders cast a gloom over the ship for many days every one had respected and many of us had loved the lad so that we mourned for him long and truly  but a sailors life is such a rough one requiring so much energy and hearty goodwill to his work that he cannot afford to allow the sorrows of his heart to sit long on his countenance  in a day or two after no one would have supposed we had lost one of our best men  whales appeared in great numbers around us the old cry of there she blows ran out frequently from the masthead and the answering cry from the captain where away was followed by the stand by to lowerlower away  then came the chase with all its dangers and excitementthe driving of the harpoon the sudden rush of the struck fish the smoke and sparks of fire from the loggerhead the plunging of the lance the spouting blood the flurry at the end and the wild cheer as we beheld our prize floating calmly on the sea  and in the midst of such work we forgot for a time the solemn scene we had so recently witnessed  but our hearts were not so light as before and although we did not show it i knew full well that many a joke was checked and many a laugh repressed for the memory of our dead shipmate  the man who was most affected by his death was the captain but we were not prepared for the great change that soon appeared in his manner and conduct  after a time he laughed with the rest of us at a good joke and cheered as loud as the best when a big fish turned belly up but his behaviour to us became more gentle and kind and he entirely gave up the habit of swearing  he also forbade working on sunday  many a whale have i seen sporting and spouting near us on that day but never did we lower a boat or touch a harpoon on sunday  some of the men grumbled at this and complained of it to each other but they never spoke so as to let the captain hear and they soon gave up their grumbling for the most of us were well pleased with the change and all of us had agreed to it  the first sunday after freds death the captain assembled the crew on the quarterdeck and spoke to us about it  my lads said he ive called you aft to make a proposal that may perhaps surprise some of you  up to this time you know very well there has been little difference aboard this ship between saturday and sunday  since our poor shipmate died i have been thinkin much on this matter and ive come to the conclusion that we shall rest from all work on sunday except such as must be done to work the ship  now lads you know me well enough by this time  i have never been a religious man all my life and i dont pretend to say that im one now  im not very learned on this matter and cant explain myself very well but what think you lads shall we give the whales a rest on sundays  we all agreed to this at once for the effect of the captains speech was great upon us  it was not so much what he said as the way in which he said it  he was by nature a bold determined man who never flinched from danger or duty and when we heard him talking in that way we could scarcely believe our ears  this was all that was said about the matter between us and the captain but we had many a hot discussion in the forecastle amongst ourselves after that  some were in favour of the new move and said stoutly that the captain was a sensible fellow  others said he was becoming an old wife and that no luck would follow the ship  in the course of time however we found the benefit of the change in every way and the grumblers were silenced because in spite of their wise shakings of the head we filled the ship with oil as full as she could hold much sooner than we had expected  shoregoing people have but little notion of the ease with which the heart of a jacktar is made to rejoice when he is out on a long voyage his pleasures and amusements are so few that he is thankful to make the most of whatever is thrown in his way  in the whalefisheries no doubt he has more than enough of excitement but after a time he gets used to this and begins to long for a little varietyand of all the pleasures that fall to his lot that which delights him most is to have a gam with another ship  now a gam is the meeting of two or more whaleships their keeping company for a time and the exchanging of visits by the crews  it is neither more nor less than a jollification on the seathe inviting of your friends to feast and make merry in your floating house  there is this difference however between a gam at sea and a party on land that your friends on the ocean are men whom you perhaps never saw before and whom you will likely never meet again  there is also another differencethere are no ladies at a gam  this is a great want for man is but a rugged creature when away from the refining influence of woman but in the circumstances of course it cant be helped  we had a gam one day on this voyage with a yankee whaleship and a firstrate gam it was for as the yankee had gammed three days before with another english ship we got a lot of news secondhand and as we had not seen a new face for many months we felt towards those yankees like brothers and swallowed all they had to tell us like men starving for news  it was on a fine calm morning just after breakfast that we fell in with this ship  we had seen no whales for a day or two but we did not mind that for our hold was almost full of oilbarrels  tom lokins and i were leaning over the starboard bulwarks watching the small fish that every now and then darted through the clearblue water like arrows and smoking our pipes in silence  tom looked uncommonly grave and i knew that he was having some deep and knowing thoughts of his own which would leak out in time  all at once he took his pipe from his mouth and stared earnestly at the horizon  bob said he speaking very slowly if there aint a ship right off the starboard beam im a dutchman  you dont mean it said i starting with a feeling of excitement  before another word could be uttered the cry of sail ho came ringing down from the masthead  instantly the quiet of the morning was broken sleepers sprang up and rubbed their eyes the men below rushed wildly up the hatchway the cook came tearing out of his own private den flourishing a soupladle in one hand and his tormentors in the other the steward came tumbling up with a lump of dough in his fist that he had forgot to throw down in his haste and the captain bolted up from the cabin without his hat  where away cried he with more than his usual energy  right off the starboard beam sir  square the yards  look alive my hearties was the next order for although the calm sea was like a sheet of glass a light air just sufficient to fill our topgallant sails enabled us to creep through the water  hurrah shouted the men as we sprang to obey  what does she look like roared the captain  a big ship sir i think replied the lookout but i can only just make out the top of her main tgallan slsailors scorn to speak of topgallant sails  gradually one by one the white sails of the stranger rose up like cloudlets out of the sea and our hearts beat high with hope and expectation as we beheld the towering canvas of a fullrigged ship rise slowly into view  show our colours said the captain  in a moment the union jack of old england was waving at the masthead in the gentle breeze and we watched anxiously for a reply  the stranger was polite his colours flew up a moment after and displayed the stripes and stars of america  a yankee exclaimed some of the men in a tone of slight disappointment  i may remark that our disappointment arose simply from the fact that there was no chance as we supposed of getting news from home out of a ship that must have sailed last from america  for the rest we cared not whether they were yankees or britonsthey were men who could speak the english tongue that was enough for us  never mind boys cried one well have a jolly gam thats a fact  so we will said another and ill get news of my mad irish cousin terrence oflannagan who went out to seek his fortin in ameriky with two shillins and a broken knife in his pocket and its been said hes got into a government situation o some sort connected with the jails whether as captain or leftenant o police or turnkey im not rightly sure  more likely as a lifetenant of one of the cells observed bill blunt laughing  dont speak ill of a better man than yerself behind his back retorted the owner of the irish cousin  stand by to lower the jollyboat cried the captain  ay ay sir  lower away  in a few minutes we were leaping over the calm sea in the direction of the strange ship for the breeze had died down and we were too eager to meet with new faces and to hear the sound of new voices to wait for the wind  to our joy we found that the yankee had had a gam as i have already said with an english ship a few days before so we returned to our vessel loaded with old newspapers from england having invited the captain and crew of the yankee to come aboard of us and spend the day  while preparation was being made for the reception of our friends we got hold of two of the old newspapers and tom lokins seized one while bill blunt got the other and both men sat down on the windlass to retail the news to a crowd of eager men who tried hard to listen to both at once and so could make nothing out of either  hold hard tom lokins cried one  whats that you say about the emperor bill  the emperor of roosia said bill blunt reading slowly and with difficulty isstop a bit messmates wot can this word bethe emperor of roosia is  blowed up with gunpowder and shattered to a thousand pieces said tom lokins raising his voice with excitement as he read from his paper an account of the blowing up of a mountain fortress in india  oh come i say one at a time if you please cried a harpooner a feller cant git a word of sense out of sich a jumble  come messmates cried two or three voices as tom stopped suddenly and looked hard at the paper go ahead wot have ye got there that makes ye look as wise as an owl  has war been and broke out with the french  i do believe hes readin the births marriages and deaths said one of the men peeping over toms shoulder  read em out then cant ye cried another  i say bill blunt i think this consarns you cried tom isnt your sweethearts name susan croft  thats a fact said bill looking up from his paper and who has got a word to say agin the prettiest lass in all liverpool  nobodys got a word to say against her replied tom but shes married thats all  bill blunt leaped up as if he had been shot and the blood rushed to his face as he seized the paper and tried to find the place  where is it tom let me see it with my own two eyes  oh here it is  the poor mans face grew paler and paler as he read the following words  married at liverpool on the 5th inst by the reverend charles manson edward gordon esquire to susan youngest daughter of admiral croft  a perfect roar of laughter drowned the remainder of the sentence  well done bill bluntmister blunt well have to call him hereafter said tom with a grim smile i had no notion you thought so much o yourself as to aim at an admirals daughter  all right my hearties chaff away said bill fetching a deep sigh of relief while a broad grin played on his weatherbeaten visage theres two susan crofts thats all but i wouldnt give my susan for all the admirals daughters that ever walked in shoeleather  hallo here come the yankees cried the captain coming on deck at that moment  our newspapers were thrown down at once and we prepared to receive our guests who we could see had just put off from their ship in two boats  but before they had come within a mile of us their attention as well as ours was riveted on a most extraordinary sight  not more than a hundred yards ahead of our ship a whale came suddenly to the surface of the water seeming by its wild motions to be in a state of terror  it continued for some time to struggle and lash the whole sea around it into a white foam  at once the boats were lowered from both ships and we went after this fish but his motions were so violent that we found it utterly impossible to get near enough to throw a harpoon  when we had approached somewhat closely we discovered that it had been attacked by a killer fish which was fully twenty feet long and stuck to it like a leech  the monsters struggles were made in trying to shake itself free of this tremendous enemy but it could not accomplish this  the killer held him by the under jaw and hung on there while the whale threw himself out of the water in his agony with his great mouth open like a huge cavern and the blood flowing so fast from the wound that the sea was dyed for a long distance round  the killer fought like a bulldog it held on until the whale was exhausted but they passed away from us in such a confused struggle that a harpoon could not be fixed for an hour after we first saw them  on this being done the killer let go and the whale being already half dead was soon killed  the yankee boats were the first to come up with this fish so the prize belonged to them  we were well pleased at this as we could afford to let them have it seeing that we could scarcely have found room to stow away the oil in our hold  it was the yankees first fish too so they were in great spirits about it and towed it to their ship singing yankeedoodle with all their might  as they passed our boat the captain hailed them  i wish you joy of your first fish sir said he to the yankee captain  thank you stranger  i guess were in luck though it aint a big one i say what sort o brute was that that had hold of him  never seed sich a crittur in all my life  hes a killer said our captain  a killer  guess he just is and no mistake if we hadnt helped him hed have done the job for himself  what does he kill him for  to eat him but im told he only eats the tongue  youll not forget that youve promised to gam with us tonight cried our captain as they were about to commence pulling again  all right stranger one half will come tonight before sundown tother half tomorrow if the calm holds  goodday  give way lads  the men dipped their oars and resumed their song while we pulled back to our ship  we did not offer to help them because the fish was a small one and the distance they had to go not great  it was near sunset when according to promise the yankees came on board and spent a long evening with us  they were a free openhearted boastful conceited goodhumoured set of fellows and a jolly night we had of it in the forecastle while the mates and captains were enjoying themselves and spinning their yarns in the cabin  of course we began with demands for home news and when we had pumped out of them every drop they had we began to sing songs and to spin yarns  and it was now that my friend tom lokins came out strong and went on at such a rate that he quite won the hearts of our guests  tom was not noisy and he was slow in his talk but he had the knack of telling a good story he never used a wrong word or a word too many and having a great deal of humour men could not help listening when he began to talk  after this we had a dance and here i became useful being able to play scotch reels and irish jigs on the fiddle  then we had songs and yarns again  some could tell of furious fights with whales that made our blood boil others could talk of the green fields at home until we almost fancied we were boys again and some could not tell stories at all  they had little to say and that little they said ill and i noticed that many of those who were perfect bores would cry loudest to be heard though none of us wanted to hear them  we used to quench such fellows by calling loudly for a song with a rousing chorus  it was not till the night was far spent and the silver moon was sailing through the starry sky that the yankees left us and rowed away with a parting cheer    chapter ten  return home  six months after our gam with the yankees tom lokins and i found ourselves seated once more in the little garret beside my dear old mother  deary me robert how changed ye are  changed mother  i should think so  if youd gone through all that ive done and seen since we last sat together in this room youd be changed too  and have ye really seen the whales my boy continued my mother stroking my face with her old hand  seen them ay and killed them toomany of them  youve been in danger my son said my mother earnestly but god has preserved you safe through it all  ay mother he has preserved my life in the midst of many dangers said i for which i am most thankful  there was a short silence after this during which my mother and i gazed earnestly at each other and tom lokins smoked his pipe and stared at the fire  robert how big is a whale inquired my mother suddenly  how big why its as big as a small ship only its longer and not quite so fat  robert replied my mother gravely ye didnt used to tell untruths ye must be jokin  joking mother i was never more in earnest in my life  why i tell you that ive seen ay and helped to cut up whales that were more than sixty feet long with heads so big that their mouths could have taken in a boat  why mother i declare to you that you could put this room into a whales mouth and you and tom and i could sit round this table and take our tea upon his tongue quite comfortable  isnt that true tom  my mother looked at tom who removed his pipe puffed a cloud of smoke and nodded his head twice very decidedly  moreover said i a whale is so big and strong that it can knock a boat right up into the air and break in the sides of a ship  one day a whale fell right on top of one of our boats and smashed it all to bits now thats a real truth  again my mother looked at tom lokins and again that worthy man puffed an immense cloud of smoke and nodded his head more decidedly than before  being anxious to put to flight all her doubts at once he said solemnly old ooman thats a fact  robert said my mother tell me something about the whales  just as she said this the door opened and in came the good old gentleman with the nose like his caneknob and with as kind a heart as ever beat in a human breast  my mother had already told me that he came to see her regularly once a week ever since i went to sea except in summer when he was away in the country and that he had never allowed her to want for anything  i need scarcely say that there was a hearty meeting between us three and that we had much to say to each other  but in the midst of it all my mother turned to the old gentleman and said  robert was just going to tell me something about his adventures with the whales  thats capital cried the old gentleman rubbing his hands  come bob my boy lets hear about em  being thus invited i consented to spin them a yarn  the old gentleman settled himself in his chair my mother smoothed her apron folded her hands and looked meekly into my face  tom lokins filled his pipe stretched out his foot to poke the fire with the toe of his shoe and began to smoke like a steamengine then i cleared my throat and began my tale and before i had done talking that night i had told them all that i have told in this little book almost word for word  thus ended my first voyage to the south seas  many and many a trip have i made since then and many a wonderful sight have i seen both in the south and in the north  but if i were to write an account of all my adventures my little book would grow into a big one i must therefore come to a close  the profits of this voyage were so great that i was enabled to place my mother in a position of comfort for the rest of her life which alas was very short  she died about six months after my return  i nursed her to the end and when i laid her dear head in the grave my heart seemed to die within me for i felt that i had lost one of gods most precious giftsan honest gentle pious mother  im getting to be a old man now but i am comfortable and happy and as i have more than enough of this worlds goods and no family to care for my chief occupation is to look after the poor and particularly the old women who live in my neighbourhood  after the work of the day is done i generally go and spend the evening with tom lokins who lives near by and is stout and hearty still or he comes and spends it with me and while we smoke our pipes together we often fall to talking about those stirring days when in the strength and hope of youth we sailed together to the south seas and took tofighting the whales  the end
