67696039	miscellaneous pieces by john bunyan     contents     of the trinity and a christian    of the law and a christian    bunyans last sermon    bunyans dying sayings     of the trinity and a christian    how a young or shaken christian should demean himself under the weighty thoughts of the doctrine of the trinity or plurality of persons in the eternal godhead   the reason why i say a young or shaken christian is because some that are not young but of an ancient standing may not only be assaulted with violent temptations concerning gospelprinciples but a second time may become a child a babe a shallow man in the things of god especially either when by backsliding he hath provoked god to leave him or when some new unexpected and as to present strength over weighty objection doth fall upon the spirit by means of which great shakings of mind do commonly attend such a soul in the most weighty matters of the concerns of faith of which this is one that i have supposed in the abovementioned question  wherefore passing other things i will come directly to that and briefly propose some helps to a soul in such a case  i  the first preparative  first then be sure thou keep close to the word of god for that is the revelation of the mind and will of god both as to the truth of what is either in himself or ways and also as to what he requireth and expecteth of thee either concerning faith in or obedience to what he hath so revealed  now for thy better performing of this i shall give thee in brief these following directions  1  suffer thyself by the authority of the word to be persuaded that the scripture indeed is the word of god the scriptures of truth the words of the holy one and that they therefore must be every one true pure and for ever settled in heaven  2  conclude therefore from the former doctrine that that god whose words they are is able to make a reconciliation and most sweet and harmonious agreement with all the sayings therein how obscure cross dark and contradictory soever they seem to thee  to understand all mysteries to have all knowledge to be able to comprehend with all saints is a great work enough to crush the spirit and to stretch the strings of the most capacious widened soul that breatheth on this side glory be they notwithstanding exceedingly enlarged by revelation paul when he was caught up to heaven saw that which was unlawful because impossible for man to utter  and saith christ to the reasoning pharisee if i have told you earthly things and ye believe not how shall you believe if i tell you of heavenly things  it is great lewdness and also insufferable arrogancy to come to the word of god as conceiting already that whatever thou readest must either by thee be understood or of itself fall to the ground as a senseless error  but god is wiser than man wherefore fear thou him and tremble at his word saying still with godly suspicion of thine own infirmity what i see not teach thou me and thou art god only wise but as for me i am as a beast before thee  3  take heed of taking a part of the word only lest thou thereby go away with the truth as mangled in pieces  for instance where thou readest the lord our god is one lord there take heed that thou dost not thence conclude then there are not three persons in the godhead when thou readest of the father the son and the holy spirit then take heed of concluding there must therefore either be three gods or else that jesus christ and the holy ghost are not true god but the father only  wherefore to help thee here observe  ii  the second preparative  1  that the christian religion requireth credit concerning every doctrine contained in the word credit i say according to the true relation of every sentence that the holy ghost hath revealed for the asserting maintaining or vindicating that same truth  2  and therefore hence it is that a christian is not called a doer a reasoner an objector and perverse disputer but a believer  be thou an example to the believers and believers were added to the church c  3  therefore know again that the word if it saith and expresseth that this or that is so and so as to the matter in hand thou art bound and obliged both by the name profession and the truth unto which thou hast joined thyself to assent to confess and acknowledge the same even then when thy carnal reason will not stoop thereto righteous art thou o god saith jeremiah yet let me plead with thee wherefore do the wicked live  mark first he acknowledgeth that gods way with the wicked is just and right even then when yet he could not see the reason of his actions and dispensations towards them the same reason is good as to our present case  and hence it is that the apostle saith the spiritual armour of christians should be much exercised against those high towering and selfexalting imaginations that within our own bosoms do exalt themselves against the knowledge of god that every thought or carnal reasoning may be not only taken but brought a captive into obedience to christ that is be made to stoop to the word of god and to give way and place to the doctrine therein contained how cross soever our thoughts and the word lie to each other  and it is observable that he here saith they exalt themselves against the knowledge of god which cannot be understood that our carnal natural reason doth exalt itself against an eternal deity simply considered for that nature itself doth gather from the very things that are made even his eternal power and godhead  it must be then that they exalt themselves against that god as thus and thus revealed in the word to wit against the knowledge of one god consisting of three persons father son and spirit for this is the doctrine of the scriptures of truth  and therefore it is observable these thoughts must be brought captive and be made subject in particular to the lord jesus christ as to the second person in the godhead  for the father is ever acknowledged by all that profess the least of religion but the son is that stumblingstone and rock of offence against which thousands dash themselves in pieces though in him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge and in him dwells the fulness of the godhead bodily    of the law and a christian    the law was given twice upon mount sinai but the appearance of the lord when he gave it the second time was wonderfully different from that of his when at the first he delivered it to israel  1  when he gave it the first time he caused his terror and severity to appear before moses to the shaking of his soul and the dismaying of israel but when he gave it the second time he caused all his goodness to pass before moses to the comfort of his conscience and the bowing of his heart  2  when he gave it the first time it was with thunderings and lightnings with blackness and darkness with flame and smoke and a tearing sound of the trumpet but when he gave it the second time it was with a proclamation of his name to be merciful gracious long suffering and abundant in goodness and truth keeping mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity transgressions and sins  3  when he gave it the first time moses was called to go up to receive it through the fire which made him exceedingly fear and quake but when he went to receive it the second time he was laid in a clift of the rock  4  from all which i gather that though as to the matter of the law both as to its being given the first time and the second it binds the unbeliever under the pains of eternal damnation if he close not with christ by faith yet as to the manner of its giving at these two times i think the first doth more principally intend its force as a covenant of works not at all respecting the lord jesus but this second time not at least in the manner of its being given respecting such a covenant but rather as a rule or directory to those who already are found in the clift of the rock christ for the saint himself though he be without law to god as it is considered the first or old covenant yet even he is not without law to him as considered under grace not without law to god but under the law to christ  5  though therefore it be sad with the unbeliever because he only and wholly standeth under the law as it is given in fire in smoke in blackness and darkness and thunder all which threaten him with eternal ruin if he fulfil not the utmost tittle thereof yet the believer stands to the law under no such consideration neither is he so at all to hear or regard it for he is now removed from thence to the blessed mountain of zionto grace and forgiveness of sins he is now i say by faith in the lord jesus shrouded under so perfect and blessed a righteousness that this thundering law of mount sinai cannot find the least fault or diminution therein but rather approveth and alloweth thereof either when or wherever it find it  this is called the righteousness of god without the law and also said to be witnessed by both the law and the prophets even the righteousness of god which is by faith in jesus christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference  6  wherefore whenever thou who believest in jesus dost hear the law in its thundering and lightning fits as if it would burn up heaven and earth then say thou i am freed from this law these thunderings have nothing to do with my soul nay even this law while it thus thunders and roars it doth both allow and approve of my righteousness  i know that hagar would sometimes be domineering and high even in sarahs house and against her but this she is not to be suffered to do nay though sarah herself be barren wherefore serve it also as sarah served her and expel her out from thy house  my meaning is when this law with its thundering threatenings doth attempt to lay hold on thy conscience shut it out with a promise of grace cry the inn is taken up already the lord jesus is here entertained and here is no room for the law  indeed if it will be content with being my informer and so lovingly leave off to judge me i will be content it shall be in my sight i will also delight therein but otherwise i being now made upright without it and that too with that righteousness which this law speaks well of and approveth i may not will not cannot dare not make it my saviour and judge nor suffer it to set up its government in my conscience for by so doing i fall from grace and christ jesus doth profit me nothing  7  thus therefore the soul that is married to him that is raised up from the dead both may and ought to deal with this law of god yea it doth greatly dishonour its lord and refuse its gospel privileges if it at any time otherwise doth whatever it seeth or feels  the law hath power over the wife so long as her husband liveth but if her husband be dead she is freed from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man  indeed so long as thou art alive to sin and to thy righteousness which is of the law so long thou hast them for thy husband and they must reign over thee but when once they are become dead unto theeas they then most certainly will when thou closest with the lord jesus christthen i say thy former husbands have no more to meddle with thee thou art freed from their law  set the case  a woman be cast into prison for a debt of hundreds of pounds if after this she marry yea though while she is in the jailors hand in the same day that she is joined to her husband her debt is all become his yea and the law also that arrested and imprisoned this woman as freely tells her go  she is freed saith paul from that and so saith the law of this land  the sum then of what hath been said is thisthe christian hath now nothing to do with the law as it thundereth and burneth on sinai or as it bindeth the conscience to wrath and the displeasure of god for sin for from its thus appearing it is freed by faith in christ  yet it is to have regard thereto and is to count it holy just and good which that it may do it is always whenever it seeth or regards it to remember that he who giveth it to us is merciful gracious long suffering and abundant in goodness and truth c     bunyans last sermonpreached july 1688    which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god john i 13  the words have a dependence on what goes before and therefore i must direct you to them for the right understanding of it  you have it thushe came to his own but his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them which believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh but of god  in the words before you have two things   first some of his own rejecting him when he offered himself to them  secondly others of his own receiving him and making him welcome those that reject him he also passes by but those that receive him he gives them power to become the sons of god  now lest any one should look upon it as good luck or fortune says he they were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god  they that did not receive him they were only born of flesh and blood but those that receive him they have god to their father they receive the doctrine of christ with a vehement desire  first i will shew you what he means by blood  they that believe are born to it as an heir is to an inheritance they are born of god not of flesh nor of the will of man but of god not of bloodthat is not by generation not born to the kingdom of heaven by the flesh not because i am the son of a godly man or woman  that is meant by blood acts xvii 26 he has made of one blood all nations  but when he says here not of blood he rejects all carnal privileges they did boast of  they boasted they were abrahams seed  no no says he it is not of blood think not to say you have abraham to your father you must be born of god if you go to the kingdom of heaven  secondly nor of the will of the flesh  what must we understand by that  it is taken for those vehement inclinations that are in man to all manner of looseness fulfilling the desires of the flesh  that must not be understood here men are made the children of god by fulfilling their lustful desires it must be understood here in the best sense there is not only in carnal men a will to be vile but there is in them a will to be saved alsoa will to go to heaven also  but this it will not do it will not privilege a man in the things of the kingdom of god  natural desires after the things of another world they are not an argument to prove a man shall go to heaven whenever he dies  i am not a free willer i do abhor it yet there is not the wickedest man but he desires some time or other to be saved  he will read some time or other or it may be pray but this will not doit is not in him that wills nor in him that runs but in god that shews mercy there is willing and running and yet to no purpose rom ix 16 israel which followed after the law of righteousness have not obtained it here i do not understand as if the apostle had denied a virtuous course of life to be the way to heaven but that a man without grace though he have natural gifts yet he shall not obtain privilege to go to heaven and be the son of god  though a man without grace may have a will to be saved yet he cannot have that will gods way  nature it cannot know anything but the things of nature the things of god knows no man but by the spirit of god unless the spirit of god be in you it will leave you on this side the gates of heavennot of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god  it may be some may have a will a desire that ishmael may be saved know this it will not save thy child  if it were our will i would have you all go to heaven  how many are there in the world that pray for their children and cry for them and ready to die and this will not do gods will is the rule of all it is only through jesus christ which were born not of flesh nor of the will of man but of god  now i come to the doctrine  men that believe in jesus christ to the effectual receiving of jesus christ they are born to it  he does not say they shall be born to it but they are born to it born of god unto god and the things of god before they receive god to eternal salvation  except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god  now unless he be born of god he cannot see it  suppose the kingdom of god be what it will he cannot see it before he be begotten of god suppose it be the gospel he cannot see it before he be brought into a state of regeneration believing is the consequence of the new birth not of blood nor of the will of man but of god  first i will give you a clear description of it under one similitude or two  a child before it be born into the world is in the dark dungeon of its mothers womb so a child of god before he be born again is in the dark dungeon of sin sees nothing of the kingdom of god therefore it is called a new birth the same soul has love one way in its carnal condition another way when it is born again  secondly as it is compared to a birth resembling a child in his mothers womb so it is compared to a man being raised out of the grave and to be born again is to be raised out of the grave of sin awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee life  to be raised from the grave of sin is to be begotten and born rev i 5  there is a famous instance of christhe is the firstbegotten from the dead he is the firstborn from the dead unto which our regeneration alludeththat is if you be born again by seeking those things that are above then there is a similitude betwixt christs resurrection and the new birth which were born which were restored out of this dark world and translated out of the kingdom of this dark world into the kingdom of his dear son and made us live a new life this is to be born again and he that is delivered from the mothers womb it is the help of the mother so he that is born of god it is by the spirit of god  i must give you a few consequences of new birth  first of all a child you know is incident to cry as soon as it comes into the world for if there be no noise they say it is dead  you that are born of god and christians if you be not criers there is no spiritual life in you if you be born of god you are crying ones as soon as he has raised you out of the dark dungeon of sin you cannot but cry to god what must i do to be saved  as soon as ever god had touched the jailor he cries out men and brethren what must i do to be saved  oh how many prayerless professors are there in london that never pray  coffeehouses will not let you pray trades will not let you pray lookingglasses will not let you pray but if you were born of god you would  secondly it is not only natural for a child to cry but it must crave the breast it cannot live without the breast therefore peter makes it the true trial of a newborn babe the newborn babe desires the sincere milk of the word that he may grow thereby  if you be born of god make it manifest by desiring the breast of god  do you long for the milk of promises  a man lives one way when he is in the world another way when he is brought unto jesus christ isa lxvi they shall suck and be satisfied  if you be born again there is no satisfaction till you get the milk of gods word into your souls isa lxvi 11 to suck and be satisfied with the breasts of consolation o what is a promise to a carnal man a whorehouse it may be is more sweet to him but if you be born again you cannot live without the milk of gods word  what is a womans breast to a horse  but what is it to a child  there is its comfort night and day there is its succour night and day  o how loath is he it should be taken from him minding heavenly things says a carnal man is but vanity but to a child of god there is his comfort  thirdly a child that is newly born if it have not other comforts to keep it warm than it had in its mothers womb it dies  it must have something got for its succour so christ had swaddling clothes prepared for him so those that are born again they must have some promise of christ to keep them alive  those that are in a carnal state they warm themselves with other things but those that are born again they cannot live without some promise of christ to keep them alive as he did to the poor infant in ezekiel xvii i covered thee with embroidered gold  and when women are with child what fine things will they prepare for their child  o but what fine things has christ prepared to wrap all in that are born again  o what wrappings of gold has christ prepared for all that are born again  women will dress their children that every one may see them how fine they are so he in ezekiel xvi 11i decked thee also with ornaments and i also put bracelets upon thine hands and a chain on thy neck  and i put a jewel on thy forehead and earrings in thine ears and a beautiful crown upon thine head and says he in the 13th verse thou didst prosper to a kingdom  this is to set out nothing in the world but the righteousness of christ and the graces of the spirit without which a newborn babe cannot live unless he have the golden righteousness of christ  fourthly a child when it is in its mothers lap the mother takes great delight to have that which will he for its comfort so it is with gods children they shall he kept on his knee isaiah lxvi 11 they shall stick and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolation ver 13 as one whom his mother comforteth so will i comfort you there is a similitude in these things that nobody knows of but those that are born again  fifthly there is usually some similitude betwixt the father and the child it may be the child looks like its father so those that are born again they have a new similitude they have the image of jesus christ gal iv every one that is born of god has something of the features of heaven upon him  men love those children that are likest them most usually so does god his children therefore they are called the children of god  but others do not look like him therefore they are called sodomites  christ describes children of the devil by their features the children of the devil his works they will do all works of unrighteousness they are the devils works  if you are earthly you have borne the image of the earthly if heavenly you have borne the image of the heavenly  sixthly when a man has a child he trains him up to his own liking he learns the custom of his fathers house so are those that are born of god they have learned the custom of the true church of god there they learn to cry my father and my god they are brought up in gods house they learn the method and form of gods house for regulating their lives in this world  seventhly children it is natural for them to depend upon their father for what they want  if they want a pair of shoes they go and tell him if they want bread they go and tell him so should the children of god do  do you want spiritual bread go tell god of it  do you want strength of grace ask it of god  do you want strength against satans temptations go and tell god of it  when the devil tempts you run home and tell your heavenly father go pour out your complaints to god  this is natural to children if any wrong them they go and tell their father so do those that are born of god when they meet with temptations go and tell god of them  the first use is this to make a strict inquiry whether you be born of god or not  examine by those things i laid down before of a child of nature and a child of grace  are you brought out of the dark dungeon of this world into christ have you learned to cry my father jer iii 16 and i said thou shalt call me thy father  all gods children are criers  can you be quiet without you have a bellyful of the milk of gods word  can you be satisfied without you have peace with god  pray you consider it and be serious with yourselves  if you have not these marks you will fall short of the kingdom of god you shall never have an interest there there is no intruding  they will say lord lord open to us and he will say i know you not no child of god no heavenly inheritance  we sometimes give something to those that are not our children but not our lands  o do not flatter yourselves with a portion among the sons unless you live like sons  when we see a kings son play with a beggar this is unbecoming so if you be the kings children live like the kings children  if you be risen with christ set your affections on things above and not on things below  when you come together talk of what your father promised you you should all love your fathers will and be content and pleased with the exercises you meet with in the world  if you are the children of god live together lovingly  if the world quarrel with you it is no matter but it is sad if you quarrel together  if this be amongst you it is a sign of illbreeding it is not according to rules you have in the word of god  dost thou see a soul that has the image of god in him  love him love him say this man and i must go to heaven one day  serve one another do good for one another and if any wrong you pray to god to right you and love the brotherhood  lastly if you be the children of god learn that lesson  gird up the loins of your mind as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to your former conversation but be ye holy in all manner of conversation  consider that the holy god is your father and let this oblige you to live like the children of god that you may look your father in the face with comfort another day    bunyans dying sayings    of sin  sin is the great block and bar to our happiness the procurer of all miseries to man both here and hereafter take away sin and nothing can hurt us for death temporal spiritual and eternal is the wages of it  sin and man for sin is the object of the wrath of god  how dreadful therefore must his case be who continues in sin for who can bear and grapple with the wrath of god  no sin against god can be little because it is against the great god of heaven and earth but if the sinner can find out a little god it may be easy to find out little sins  sin turns all gods grace into wantonness  it is the dare of his justice the rape of his mercy the jeer of his patience the slight of his power and the contempt of his love  take heed of giving thyself liberty of committing one sin for that will lead thee to another till by an ill custom it become natural  to begin sin is to lay a foundation for a continuance this continuance is the mother of custom and impudence at last the issue  the death of christ giveth us the best discovery of ourselves in what condition we were so that nothing could help us but that and the most clear discovery of the dreadful nature of our sins  for if sin be such a dreadful thing as to wring the heart of the son of god how shall a poor wretched sinner be able to bear it  of affliction  nothing can render affliction so heavy as the load of sin would you therefore be fitted for afflictions be sure to get the burden of your sins laid aside and then what afflictions soever you meet with will be very easy to you  if thou canst hear and bear the rod of affliction which god shall lay upon thee remember this lesson thou art beaten that thou mayst be better  the lord useth his flail of tribulation to separate the chaff from the wheat  the school of the cross is the school of light it discovers the worlds vanity baseness and wickedness and lets us see more of gods mind  out of dark affliction comes a spiritual light  in times of affliction we commonly meet with the sweetest experiences of the love of god  did we heartily renounce the pleasures of this world we should be very little troubled for our afflictions that which renders an afflicted state so insupportable to many is because they are too much addicted to the pleasures of this life and so cannot endure that which makes a separation between them  of repentance and coming to christ  the end of affliction is the discovery of sin and of that to bring us to the saviour let us therefore with the prodigal return unto him and we shall find ease and rest  a returning penitent though formerly bad as the worst of men may by grace become as good as the best  to be truly sensible of sin is to sorrow for displeasing of god  to be afflicted that he is displeased by us more than that he is displeased with us  your intentions to repentance and the neglect of that soulsaving duty will rise up in judgment against you  repentance carries with it a divine rhetoric and persuades christ to forgive multitudes of sins committed against him  say not to thyself tomorrow i will repent for it is thy duty to do it daily  the gospel of grace and salvation is above all doctrine the most dangerous if it be received in word only by graceless men if it be not attended with a sensible need of a saviour and bring them to him for such men only as have the notion of it are of all men most miserable for by reason of their knowing more than heathens this shall only be their final portion that they shall have greater stripes  of prayer  before you enter into prayer ask thy soul these questions 1  to what end o my soul art thou retired into this place  art thou come to converse with the lord in prayer  is he present will he hear thee is he merciful will he help thee  is thy business slight is it not concerning the welfare of thy soul  what words wilt thou use to move him to compassion  to make thy preparation complete consider that thou art but dust and ashes and he the great god father of our lord jesus christ that clothes himself with light as with a garment that thou art a vile sinner and he a holy god that thou art but a poor crawling worm and he the omnipotent creator  in all your prayers forget not to thank the lord for his mercies  when thou prayest rather let thy heart be without words than thy words without heart  prayer will make a man cease from sin or sin will entice a man to cease from prayer  the spirit of prayer is more precious than thousands of gold and silver  pray often for prayer is a shield to the soul a sacrifice to god and a scourge for satan  of the lordsdays sermons and weekdays  have a special care to sanctify the lordsday for as thou keepest it so will it be with thee all the week long  make the lordsday the market for thy soul let the whole day be spent in prayer repetitions or meditations lay aside the affairs of the other parts of the week let the sermon thou hast heard be converted into prayer  shall god allow thee six days and wilt thou not afford him one  in the church be careful to serve god for thou art in his eyes and not in mans  thou mayst hear sermons often and do well in practising what thou hearest but thou must not expect to be told in a pulpit all that thou oughtest to do but be studious in reading the scriptures and other good books what thou hearest may be forgotten but what thou readest may better be retained  forsake not the public worship of god lest god forsake thee not only in public but in private  on the weekday when thou risest in the morning consider 1  thou must die 2  thou mayst die that minute 3  what will become of thy soul  pray often  at night consider 1  what sins thou hast committed 2  how often thou hast prayed 3  what hath thy mind been bent upon 4  what hath been thy dealing 5  what thy conversation 6  if thou callest to mind the errors of the day sleep not without a confession to god and a hope of pardon  thus every morning and evening make up thy account with almighty god and thy reckoning will be the less at last  of the love of the world  nothing more hinders a soul from coming to christ than a vain love of the world and till a soul is freed from it it can never have a true love for god  what are the honours and riches of this world when compared to the glories of a crown of life  love not the world for it is a moth in a christians life  to despise the world is the way to enjoy heaven and blessed are they who delight to converse with god by prayer  what folly can be greater than to labour for the meat that perisheth and neglect the food of eternal life  god or the world must be neglected at parting time for then is the time of trial  to seek yourself in this life is to be lost and to be humble is to be exalted  the epicure that delighteth in the dainties of this world little thinketh that those very creatures will one day witness against him  on suffering  it is not every suffering that makes a man a martyr but suffering for the word of god after a right manner that is not only for righteousness but for righteousness sake not only for truth but out of love to truth not only for gods word but according to it  to wit in that holy humble meek manner as the word of god requireth  it is a rare thing to suffer aright and to have my spirit in suffering bent against gods enemy sin  sin in doctrine sin in worship sin in life and sin in conversation  neither the devil nor men of the world can kill thy righteousness or love to it but by thy own hand or separate that and thee asunder without thy own act  nor will he that doth indeed suffer for the sake of it or out of love he bears thereto be tempted to exchange it for the good will of the whole world  i have often thought that the best of christians are found in the worst times  and i have thought again that one reason why we are not better is because god purges us no more  noah and lot who so holy as they in the time of their afflictions and yet who so idle as they in the time of their prosperity  of death and judgment  as the devil labours by all means to keep out other things that are good so to keep out of the heart as much as in him lies the thoughts of passing out of this life into another world for he knows if he can but keep them from the serious thoughts of death he shall the more easily keep them in their sins  nothing will make us more earnest in working out the work of our salvation than a frequent meditation of mortality nothing hath a greater influence for the taking off our hearts from vanities and for the begetting in us desires for holiness  o sinner what a condition wilt thou fall into when thou departest the world if thou depart unconverted thou hadst better have been smothered the first hour thou wast born thou hadst better have been plucked one limb from the other thou hadst better have been made a dog a toad a serpent than to die unconverted and this thou wilt find true if thou repent not  a man would be counted a fool to slight a judge before whom he is to have a trial of his whole estate  the trial we are to have before god is of otherwise importance it concerns our eternal happiness or misery and yet dare we affront him  the only way for us to escape that terrible judgment is to be often passing a sentence of condemnation upon ourselves here  when the sound of the trumpet shall be heard which shall summon the dead to appear before the tribunal of god the righteous shall hasten out of their graves with joy to meet their redeemer in the clouds others shall call to the mountains and hills to fall upon them to cover them from the sight of their judge let us therefore in time be posing ourselves which of the two we shall be  of the joys of heaven  there is no good in this life but what is mingled with some evil honours perplex riches disquiet and pleasures ruin health  but in heaven we shall find blessings in their purity without any ingredient to imbitter with everything to sweeten it  o who is able to conceive the inexpressible inconceivable joys that are there  none but they who have tasted of them  lord help us to put such a value upon them here that in order to prepare ourselves for them we may be willing to forego the loss of all those deluding pleasures here  how will the heavens echo for joy when the bride the lambs wife shall come to dwell with her husband for ever  christ is the desire of nations the joy of angels the delight of the father what solace then must the soul be filled with that hath the possession of him to all eternity  o what acclamations of joy will there be when all the children of god shall meet together without fear of being disturbed by the anti christian and cainish brood  is there not a time coming when the godly may ask the wicked what profit they have in their pleasure what comfort in their greatness and what fruit in all their labour  if you would be better satisfied what the beatifical vision means my request is that you would live holily and go and see  of the torments of hell  heaven and salvation is not surely more promised to the godly than hell and damnation is threatened to and shall be executed on the wicked  oh who knows the power of gods wrath  none but damned ones  sinners company are the devil and his angels tormented in everlasting fire with a curse  hell would be a kind of paradise if it were no worse than the worst of this world  as different as grief is from joy as torment from rest as terror from peace so different is the state of sinners from that of saints in the world to come
