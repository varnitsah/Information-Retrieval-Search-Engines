70001074	the club of queer trades  by g k chesterton     chapter 1 the tremendous adventures of major brown  rabelais or his wild illustrator gustave dore must have had something to do with the designing of the things called flats in england and america there is something entirely gargantuan in the idea of economising space by piling houses on top of each other front doors and all and in the chaos and complexity of those perpendicular streets anything may dwell or happen and it is in one of them i believe that the inquirer may find the offices of the club of queer trades it may be thought at the first glance that the name would attract and startle the passerby but nothing attracts or startles in these dim immense hives the passerby is only looking for his own melancholy destination the montenegro shipping agency or the london office of the rutland sentinel and passes through the twilight passages as one passes through the twilight corridors of a dream if the thugs set up a strangers assassination company in one of the great buildings in norfolk street and sent in a mild man in spectacles to answer inquiries no inquiries would be made and the club of queer trades reigns in a great edifice hidden like a fossil in a mighty cliff of fossils  the nature of this society such as we afterwards discovered it to be is soon and simply told it is an eccentric and bohemian club of which the absolute condition of membership lies in this that the candidate must have invented the method by which he earns his living it must be an entirely new trade the exact definition of this requirement is given in the two principal rules first it must not be a mere application or variation of an existing trade thus for instance the club would not admit an insurance agent simply because instead of insuring mens furniture against being burnt in a fire he insured let us say their trousers against being torn by a mad dog the principle as sir bradcock burnabybradcock in the extraordinarily eloquent and soaring speech to the club on the occasion of the question being raised in the stormby smith affair said wittily and keenly is the same secondly the trade must be a genuine commercial source of income the support of its inventor thus the club would not receive a man simply because he chose to pass his days collecting broken sardine tins unless he could drive a roaring trade in them professor chick made that quite clear and when one remembers what professor chicks own new trade was one doesnt know whether to laugh or cry  the discovery of this strange society was a curiously refreshing thing to realize that there were ten new trades in the world was like looking at the first ship or the first plough it made a man feel what he should feel that he was still in the childhood of the world that i should have come at last upon so singular a body was i may say without vanity not altogether singular for i have a mania for belonging to as many societies as possible i may be said to collect clubs and i have accumulated a vast and fantastic variety of specimens ever since in my audacious youth i collected the athenaeum at some future day perhaps i may tell tales of some of the other bodies to which i have belonged i will recount the doings of the dead mans shoes society that superficially immoral but darkly justifiable communion i will explain the curious origin of the cat and christian the name of which has been so shamefully misinterpreted and the world shall know at last why the institute of typewriters coalesced with the red tulip league of the ten teacups of course i dare not say a word the first of my revelations at any rate shall be concerned with the club of queer trades which as i have said was one of this class one which i was almost bound to come across sooner or later because of my singular hobby the wild youth of the metropolis call me facetiously the king of clubs they also call me the cherub in allusion to the roseate and youthful appearance i have presented in my declining years i only hope the spirits in the better world have as good dinners as i have but the finding of the club of queer trades has one very curious thing about it the most curious thing about it is that it was not discovered by me it was discovered by my friend basil grant a stargazer a mystic and a man who scarcely stirred out of his attic  very few people knew anything of basil not because he was in the least unsociable for if a man out of the street had walked into his rooms he would have kept him talking till morning few people knew him because like all poets he could do without them he welcomed a human face as he might welcome a sudden blend of colour in a sunset but he no more felt the need of going out to parties than he felt the need of altering the sunset clouds he lived in a queer and comfortable garret in the roofs of lambeth he was surrounded by a chaos of things that were in odd contrast to the slums around him old fantastic books swords armourthe whole dusthole of romanticism but his face amid all these quixotic relics appeared curiously keen and moderna powerful legal face and no one but i knew who he was  long ago as it is everyone remembers the terrible and grotesque scene that occurred in when one of the most acute and forcible of the english judges suddenly went mad on the bench i had my own view of that occurrence but about the facts themselves there is no question at all for some months indeed for some years people had detected something curious in the judges conduct he seemed to have lost interest in the law in which he had been beyond expression brilliant and terrible as a kc and to be occupied in giving personal and moral advice to the people concerned he talked more like a priest or a doctor and a very outspoken one at that the first thrill was probably given when he said to a man who had attempted a crime of passion i sentence you to three years imprisonment under the firm and solemn and godgiven conviction that what you require is three months at the seaside he accused criminals from the bench not so much of their obvious legal crimes but of things that had never been heard of in a court of justice monstrous egoism lack of humour and morbidity deliberately encouraged things came to a head in that celebrated diamond case in which the prime minister himself that brilliant patrician had to come forward gracefully and reluctantly to give evidence against his valet after the detailed life of the household had been thoroughly exhibited the judge requested the premier again to step forward which he did with quiet dignity the judge then said in a sudden grating voice get a new soul that things not fit for a dog get a new soul all this of course in the eyes of the sagacious was premonitory of that melancholy and farcical day when his wits actually deserted him in open court it was a libel case between two very eminent and powerful financiers against both of whom charges of considerable defalcation were brought the case was long and complex the advocates were long and eloquent but at last after weeks of work and rhetoric the time came for the great judge to give a summingup and one of his celebrated masterpieces of lucidity and pulverizing logic was eagerly looked for he had spoken very little during the prolonged affair and he looked sad and lowering at the end of it he was silent for a few moments and then burst into a stentorian song his remarks as reported were as follows  o rowtyowty tiddlyowty tiddlyowty tiddlyowty hightyighty tiddlyighty tiddlyighty ow  he then retired from public life and took the garret in lambeth  i was sitting there one evening about six oclock over a glass of that gorgeous burgundy which he kept behind a pile of blackletter folios he was striding about the room fingering after a habit of his one of the great swords in his collection the red glare of the strong fire struck his square features and his fierce grey hair his blue eyes were even unusually full of dreams and he had opened his mouth to speak dreamily when the door was flung open and a pale fiery man with red hair and a huge furred overcoat swung himself panting into the room  sorry to bother you basil he gasped i took a libertymade an appointment here with a mana clientin five minutesi beg your pardon sir and he gave me a bow of apology  basil smiled at me you didnt know he said that i had a practical brother this is rupert grant esquire who can and does all there is to be done just as i was a failure at one thing he is a success at everything i remember him as a journalist a houseagent a naturalist an inventor a publisher a schoolmaster awhat are you now rupert  i am and have been for some time said rupert with some dignity a private detective and theres my client  a loud rap at the door had cut him short and on permission being given the door was thrown sharply open and a stout dapper man walked swiftly into the room set his silk hat with a clap on the table and said good evening gentlemen with a stress on the last syllable that somehow marked him out as a martinet military literary and social he had a large head streaked with black and grey and an abrupt black moustache which gave him a look of fierceness which was contradicted by his sad seablue eyes  basil immediately said to me let us come into the next room gully and was moving towards the door but the stranger said  not at all friends remain assistance possibly  the moment i heard him speak i remembered who he was a certain major brown i had met years before in basils society i had forgotten altogether the black dandified figure and the large solemn head but i remembered the peculiar speech which consisted of only saying about a quarter of each sentence and that sharply like the crack of a gun i do not know it may have come from giving orders to troops  major brown was a vc and an able and distinguished soldier but he was anything but a warlike person like many among the iron men who recovered british india he was a man with the natural beliefs and tastes of an old maid in his dress he was dapper and yet demure in his habits he was precise to the point of the exact adjustment of a teacup one enthusiasm he had which was of the nature of a religionthe cultivation of pansies and when he talked about his collection his blue eyes glittered like a childs at a new toy the eyes that had remained untroubled when the troops were roaring victory round roberts at candahar  well major said rupert grant with a lordly heartiness flinging himself into a chair what is the matter with you  yellow pansies coalcellar p g northover said the major with righteous indignation  we glanced at each other with inquisitiveness basil who had his eyes shut in his abstracted way said simply  i beg your pardon  fact is street you know man pansies on wall death to me something preposterous  we shook our heads gently bit by bit and mainly by the seemingly sleepy assistance of basil grant we pieced together the majors fragmentary but excited narration it would be infamous to submit the reader to what we endured therefore i will tell the story of major brown in my own words but the reader must imagine the scene the eyes of basil closed as in a trance after his habit and the eyes of rupert and myself getting rounder and rounder as we listened to one of the most astounding stories in the world from the lips of the little man in black sitting bolt upright in his chair and talking like a telegram  major brown was i have said a successful soldier but by no means an enthusiastic one so far from regretting his retirement on halfpay it was with delight that he took a small neat villa very like a dolls house and devoted the rest of his life to pansies and weak tea the thought that battles were over when he had once hung up his sword in the little front hall along with two patent stewpots and a bad watercolour and betaken himself instead to wielding the rake in his little sunlit garden was to him like having come into a harbour in heaven he was dutchlike and precise in his taste in gardening and had perhaps some tendency to drill his flowers like soldiers he was one of those men who are capable of putting four umbrellas in the stand rather than three so that two may lean one way and two another he saw life like a pattern in a freehand drawingbook and assuredly he would not have believed or even understood any one who had told him that within a few yards of his brick paradise he was destined to be caught in a whirlpool of incredible adventure such as he had never seen or dreamed of in the horrible jungle or the heat of battle  one certain bright and windy afternoon the major attired in his usual faultless manner had set out for his usual constitutional in crossing from one great residential thoroughfare to another he happened to pass along one of those aimlesslooking lanes which lie along the backgarden walls of a row of mansions and which in their empty and discoloured appearance give one an odd sensation as of being behind the scenes of a theatre but mean and sulky as the scene might be in the eyes of most of us it was not altogether so in the majors for along the coarse gravel footway was coming a thing which was to him what the passing of a religious procession is to a devout person a large heavy man with fishblue eyes and a ring of irradiating red beard was pushing before him a barrow which was ablaze with incomparable flowers there were splendid specimens of almost every order but the majors own favourite pansies predominated the major stopped and fell into conversation and then into bargaining he treated the man after the manner of collectors and other mad men that is to say he carefully and with a sort of anguish selected the best roots from the less excellent praised some disparaged others made a subtle scale ranging from a thrilling worth and rarity to a degraded insignificance and then bought them all the man was just pushing off his barrow when he stopped and came close to the major  ill tell you what sir he said if youre interested in them things you just get on to that wall  on the wall cried the scandalised major whose conventional soul quailed within him at the thought of such fantastic trespass  finest show of yellow pansies in england in that there garden sir hissed the tempter ill help you up sir  how it happened no one will ever know but that positive enthusiasm of the majors life triumphed over all its negative traditions and with an easy leap and swing that showed that he was in no need of physical assistance he stood on the wall at the end of the strange garden the second after the flapping of the frockcoat at his knees made him feel inexpressibly a fool but the next instant all such trifling sentiments were swallowed up by the most appalling shock of surprise the old soldier had ever felt in all his bold and wandering existence his eyes fell upon the garden and there across a large bed in the centre of the lawn was a vast pattern of pansies they were splendid flowers but for once it was not their horticultural aspects that major brown beheld for the pansies were arranged in gigantic capital letters so as to form the sentence  death to major brown  a kindly looking old man with white whiskers was watering them brown looked sharply back at the road behind him the man with the barrow had suddenly vanished then he looked again at the lawn with its incredible inscription another man might have thought he had gone mad but brown did not when romantic ladies gushed over his vc and his military exploits he sometimes felt himself to be a painfully prosaic person but by the same token he knew he was incurably sane another man again might have thought himself a victim of a passing practical joke but brown could not easily believe this he knew from his own quaint learning that the garden arrangement was an elaborate and expensive one he thought it extravagantly improbable that any one would pour out money like water for a joke against him having no explanation whatever to offer he admitted the fact to himself like a clearheaded man and waited as he would have done in the presence of a man with six legs  at this moment the stout old man with white whiskers looked up and the watering can fell from his hand shooting a swirl of water down the gravel path  who on earth are you he gasped trembling violently  i am major brown said that individual who was always cool in the hour of action  the old man gaped helplessly like some monstrous fish at last he stammered wildly come downcome down here  at your service said the major and alighted at a bound on the grass beside him without disarranging his silk hat  the old man turned his broad back and set off at a sort of waddling run towards the house followed with swift steps by the major his guide led him through the back passages of a gloomy but gorgeously appointed house until they reached the door of the front room then the old man turned with a face of apoplectic terror dimly showing in the twilight  for heavens sake he said dont mention jackals  then he threw open the door releasing a burst of red lamplight and ran downstairs with a clatter  the major stepped into a rich glowing room full of red copper and peacock and purple hangings hat in hand he had the finest manners in the world and though mystified was not in the least embarrassed to see that the only occupant was a lady sitting by the window looking out  madam he said bowing simply i am major brown  sit down said the lady but she did not turn her head  she was a graceful greenclad figure with fiery red hair and a flavour of bedford park you have come i suppose she said mournfully to tax me about the hateful titledeeds  i have come madam he said to know what is the matter to know why my name is written across your garden not amicably either  he spoke grimly for the thing had hit him it is impossible to describe the effect produced on the mind by that quiet and sunny garden scene the frame for a stunning and brutal personality the evening air was still and the grass was golden in the place where the little flowers he studied cried to heaven for his blood  you know i must not turn round said the lady every afternoon till the stroke of six i must keep my face turned to the street  some queer and unusual inspiration made the prosaic soldier resolute to accept these outrageous riddles without surprise  it is almost six he said and even as he spoke the barbaric copper clock upon the wall clanged the first stroke of the hour at the sixth the lady sprang up and turned on the major one of the queerest and yet most attractive faces he had ever seen in his life open and yet tantalising the face of an elf  that makes the third year i have waited she cried this is an anniversary the waiting almost makes one wish the frightful thing would happen once and for all  and even as she spoke a sudden rending cry broke the stillness from low down on the pavement of the dim street it was already twilight a voice cried out with a raucous and merciless distinctness  major brown major brown where does the jackal dwell  brown was decisive and silent in action he strode to the front door and looked out there was no sign of life in the blue gloaming of the street where one or two lamps were beginning to light their lemon sparks on returning he found the lady in green trembling  it is the end she cried with shaking lips it may be death for both of us whenever  but even as she spoke her speech was cloven by another hoarse proclamation from the dark street again horribly articulate  major brown major brown how did the jackal die  brown dashed out of the door and down the steps but again he was frustrated there was no figure in sight and the street was far too long and empty for the shouter to have run away even the rational major was a little shaken as he returned in a certain time to the drawingroom scarcely had he done so than the terrific voice came  major brown major brown where did  brown was in the street almost at a bound and he was in timein time to see something which at first glance froze the blood the cries appeared to come from a decapitated head resting on the pavement  the next moment the pale major understood it was the head of a man thrust through the coalhole in the street the next moment again it had vanished and major brown turned to the lady wheres your coalcellar he said and stepped out into the passage  she looked at him with wild grey eyes you will not go down she cried alone into the dark hole with that beast  is this the way replied brown and descended the kitchen stairs three at a time he flung open the door of a black cavity and stepped in feeling in his pocket for matches as his right hand was thus occupied a pair of great slimy hands came out of the darkness hands clearly belonging to a man of gigantic stature and seized him by the back of the head they forced him down down in the suffocating darkness a brutal image of destiny but the majors head though upside down was perfectly clear and intellectual he gave quietly under the pressure until he had slid down almost to his hands and knees then finding the knees of the invisible monster within a foot of him he simply put out one of his long bony and skilful hands and gripping the leg by a muscle pulled it off the ground and laid the huge living man with a crash along the floor he strove to rise but brown was on top like a cat they rolled over and over big as the man was he had evidently now no desire but to escape he made sprawls hither and thither to get past the major to the door but that tenacious person had him hard by the coat collar and hung with the other hand to a beam at length there came a strain in holding back this human bull a strain under which brown expected his hand to rend and part from the arm but something else rent and parted and the dim fat figure of the giant vanished out of the cellar leaving the torn coat in the majors hand the only fruit of his adventure and the only clue to the mystery for when he went up and out at the front door the lady the rich hangings and the whole equipment of the house had disappeared it had only bare boards and whitewashed walls  the lady was in the conspiracy of course said rupert nodding major brown turned brick red i beg your pardon he said i think not  rupert raised his eyebrows and looked at him for a moment but said nothing when next he spoke he asked  was there anything in the pockets of the coat  there was sevenpence halfpenny in coppers and a threepennybit said the major carefully there was a cigaretteholder a piece of string and this letter and he laid it on the table it ran as follows  dear mr plover  i am annoyed to hear that some delay has occurred in the arrangements re major brown please see that he is attacked as per arrangement tomorrow the coalcellar of course  yours faithfully p g northover  rupert grant was leaning forward listening with hawklike eyes he cut in  is it dated from anywhere  nooh yes replied brown glancing upon the paper 14 tanners court north  rupert sprang up and struck his hands together  then why are we hanging here lets get along basil lend me your revolver  basil was staring into the embers like a man in a trance and it was some time before he answered  i dont think youll need it  perhaps not said rupert getting into his fur coat one never knows but going down a dark court to see criminals  do you think they are criminals asked his brother  rupert laughed stoutly giving orders to a subordinate to strangle a harmless stranger in a coalcellar may strike you as a very blameless experiment but  do you think they wanted to strangle the major asked basil in the same distant and monotonous voice  my dear fellow youve been asleep look at the letter  i am looking at the letter said the mad judge calmly though as a matter of fact he was looking at the fire i dont think its the sort of letter one criminal would write to another  my dear boy you are glorious cried rupert turning round with laughter in his blue bright eyes your methods amaze me why there is the letter it is written and it does give orders for a crime you might as well say that the nelson column was not at all the sort of thing that was likely to be set up in trafalgar square  basil grant shook all over with a sort of silent laughter but did not otherwise move  thats rather good he said but of course logic like thats not what is really wanted its a question of spiritual atmosphere its not a criminal letter  it is its a matter of fact cried the other in an agony of reasonableness  facts murmured basil like one mentioning some strange faroff animals how facts obscure the truth i may be sillyin fact im off my headbut i never could believe in that manwhats his name in those capital storiessherlock holmes every detail points to something certainly but generally to the wrong thing facts point in all directions it seems to me like the thousands of twigs on a tree its only the life of the tree that has unity and goes uponly the green blood that springs like a fountain at the stars  but what the deuce else can the letter be but criminal  we have eternity to stretch our legs in replied the mystic it can be an infinity of things i havent seen any of themive only seen the letter i look at that and say its not criminal  then whats the origin of it  i havent the vaguest idea  then why dont you accept the ordinary explanation  basil continued for a little to glare at the coals and seemed collecting his thoughts in a humble and even painful way then he said  suppose you went out into the moonlight suppose you passed through silent silvery streets and squares until you came into an open and deserted space set with a few monuments and you beheld one dressed as a ballet girl dancing in the argent glimmer and suppose you looked and saw it was a man disguised and suppose you looked again and saw it was lord kitchener what would you think  he paused a moment and went on  you could not adopt the ordinary explanation the ordinary explanation of putting on singular clothes is that you look nice in them you would not think that lord kitchener dressed up like a ballet girl out of ordinary personal vanity you would think it much more likely that he inherited a dancing madness from a great grandmother or had been hypnotised at a seance or threatened by a secret society with death if he refused the ordeal with badenpowell say it might be a betbut not with kitchener i should know all that because in my public days i knew him quite well so i know that letter quite well and criminals quite well its not a criminals letter its all atmospheres and he closed his eyes and passed his hand over his forehead  rupert and the major were regarding him with a mixture of respect and pity the former said  well im going anyhow and shall continue to thinkuntil your spiritual mystery turns upthat a man who sends a note recommending a crime that is actually a crime that is actually carried out at least tentatively is in all probability a little casual in his moral tastes can i have that revolver  certainly said basil getting up but i am coming with you and he flung an old cape or cloak round him and took a swordstick from the corner  you said rupert with some surprise you scarcely ever leave your hole to look at anything on the face of the earth  basil fitted on a formidable old white hat  i scarcely ever he said with an unconscious and colossal arrogance hear of anything on the face of the earth that i do not understand at once without going to see it  and he led the way out into the purple night  we four swung along the flaring lambeth streets across westminster bridge and along the embankment in the direction of that part of fleet street which contained tanners court the erect black figure of major brown seen from behind was a quaint contrast to the houndlike stoop and flapping mantle of young rupert grant who adopted with childlike delight all the dramatic poses of the detective of fiction the finest among his many fine qualities was his boyish appetite for the colour and poetry of london basil who walked behind with his face turned blindly to the stars had the look of a somnambulist  rupert paused at the corner of tanners court with a quiver of delight at danger and gripped basils revolver in his greatcoat pocket  shall we go in now he asked  not get police asked major brown glancing sharply up and down the street  i am not sure answered rupert knitting his brows of course its quite clear the things all crooked but there are three of us and  i shouldnt get the police said basil in a queer voice rupert glanced at him and stared hard  basil he cried youre trembling whats the matterare you afraid  cold perhaps said the major eyeing him there was no doubt that he was shaking  at last after a few moments scrutiny rupert broke into a curse  youre laughing he cried i know that confounded silent shaky laugh of yours what the deuce is the amusement basil here we are all three of us within a yard of a den of ruffians  but i shouldnt call the police said basil we four heroes are quite equal to a host and he continued to quake with his mysterious mirth  rupert turned with impatience and strode swiftly down the court the rest of us following when he reached the door of no 14 he turned abruptly the revolver glittering in his hand  stand close he said in the voice of a commander the scoundrel may be attempting an escape at this moment we must fling open the door and rush in  the four of us cowered instantly under the archway rigid except for the old judge and his convulsion of merriment  now hissed rupert grant turning his pale face and burning eyes suddenly over his shoulder when i say four follow me with a rush if i say hold him pin the fellows down whoever they are if i say stop stop i shall say that if there are more than three if they attack us i shall empty my revolver on them basil have your swordstick ready nowone two three four  with the sound of the word the door burst open and we fell into the room like an invasion only to stop dead  the room which was an ordinary and neatly appointed office appeared at the first glance to be empty but on a second and more careful glance we saw seated behind a very large desk with pigeonholes and drawers of bewildering multiplicity a small man with a black waxed moustache and the air of a very average clerk writing hard he looked up as we came to a standstill  did you knock he asked pleasantly i am sorry if i did not hear what can i do for you  there was a doubtful pause and then by general consent the major himself the victim of the outrage stepped forward  the letter was in his hand and he looked unusually grim  is your name p g northover he asked  that is my name replied the other smiling  i think said major brown with an increase in the dark glow of his face that this letter was written by you and with a loud clap he struck open the letter on the desk with his clenched fist the man called northover looked at it with unaffected interest and merely nodded  well sir said the major breathing hard what about that  what about it precisely said the man with the moustache  i am major brown said that gentleman sternly  northover bowed pleased to meet you sir what have you to say to me  say cried the major loosing a sudden tempest why i want this confounded thing settled i want  certainly sir said northover jumping up with a slight elevation of the eyebrows will you take a chair for a moment and he pressed an electric bell just above him which thrilled and tinkled in a room beyond the major put his hand on the back of the chair offered him but stood chafing and beating the floor with his polished boot  the next moment an inner glass door was opened and a fair weedy young man in a frockcoat entered from within  mr hopson said northover this is major brown will you please finish that thing for him i gave you this morning and bring it in  yes sir said mr hopson and vanished like lightning  you will excuse me gentlemen said the egregious northover with his radiant smile if i continue to work until mr hopson is ready i have some books that must be cleared up before i get away on my holiday tomorrow and we all like a whiff of the country dont we ha ha  the criminal took up his pen with a childlike laugh and a silence ensued a placid and busy silence on the part of mr p g northover a raging silence on the part of everybody else  at length the scratching of northovers pen in the stillness was mingled with a knock at the door almost simultaneous with the turning of the handle and mr hopson came in again with the same silent rapidity placed a paper before his principal and disappeared again  the man at the desk pulled and twisted his spiky moustache for a few moments as he ran his eye up and down the paper presented to him he took up his pen with a slight instantaneous frown and altered something mutteringcareless then he read it again with the same impenetrable reflectiveness and finally handed it to the frantic brown whose hand was beating the devils tattoo on the back of the chair  i think you will find that all right major he said briefly  the major looked at it whether he found it all right or not will appear later but he found it like this    major brown to p g northover

oblige  what said brown after a dead pause and with eyes that seemed slowly rising out of his head what in heavens name is this  what is it repeated northover cocking his eyebrow with amusement its your account of course  my account the majors ideas appeared to be in a vague stampede my account and what have i got to do with it  well said northover laughing outright naturally i prefer you to pay it  the majors hand was still resting on the back of the chair as the words came he scarcely stirred otherwise but he lifted the chair bodily into the air with one hand and hurled it at northovers head  the legs crashed against the desk so that northover only got a blow on the elbow as he sprang up with clenched fists only to be seized by the united rush of the rest of us the chair had fallen clattering on the empty floor  let me go you scamps he shouted let me  stand still cried rupert authoritatively major browns action is excusable the abominable crime you have attempted  a customer has a perfect right said northover hotly to question an alleged overcharge but confound it all not to throw furniture  what in gods name do you mean by your customers and overcharges shrieked major brown whose keen feminine nature steady in pain or danger became almost hysterical in the presence of a long and exasperating mystery who are you ive never seen you or your insolent tomfool bills i know one of your cursed brutes tried to choke me  mad said northover gazing blankly round all of them mad i didnt know they travelled in quartettes  enough of this prevarication said rupert your crimes are discovered a policeman is stationed at the corner of the court though only a private detective myself i will take the responsibility of telling you that anything you say  mad repeated northover with a weary air  and at this moment for the first time there struck in among them the strange sleepy voice of basil grant  major brown he said may i ask you a question  the major turned his head with an increased bewilderment  you he cried certainly mr grant  can you tell me said the mystic with sunken head and lowering brow as he traced a pattern in the dust with his swordstick can you tell me what was the name of the man who lived in your house before you  the unhappy major was only faintly more disturbed by this last and futile irrelevancy and he answered vaguely  yes i think so a man named gurney somethinga name with a hyphengurneybrown that was it  and when did the house change hands said basil looking up sharply his strange eyes were burning brilliantly  i came in last month said the major  and at the mere word the criminal northover suddenly fell into his great office chair and shouted with a volleying laughter  oh its too perfectits too exquisite he gasped beating the arms with his fists he was laughing deafeningly basil grant was laughing voicelessly and the rest of us only felt that our heads were like weathercocks in a whirlwind  confound it basil said rupert stamping if you dont want me to go mad and blow your metaphysical brains out tell me what all this means  northover rose  permit me sir to explain he said and first of all permit me to apologize to you major brown for a most abominable and unpardonable blunder which has caused you menace and inconvenience in which if you will allow me to say so you have behaved with astonishing courage and dignity of course you need not trouble about the bill we will stand the loss and tearing the paper across he flung the halves into the wastepaper basket and bowed  poor browns face was still a picture of distraction but i dont even begin to understand he cried what bill what blunder what loss  mr p g northover advanced in the centre of the room thoughtfully and with a great deal of unconscious dignity on closer consideration there were apparent about him other things beside a screwed moustache especially a lean sallow face hawklike and not without a careworn intelligence then he looked up abruptly  do you know where you are major he said  god knows i dont said the warrior with fervour  you are standing replied northover in the office of the adventure and romance agency limited  and whats that blankly inquired brown  the man of business leaned over the back of the chair and fixed his dark eyes on the others face  major said he did you ever as you walked along the empty street upon some idle afternoon feel the utter hunger for something to happensomething in the splendid words of walt whitman something pernicious and dread something far removed from a puny and pious life something unproved something in a trance something loosed from its anchorage and driving free did you ever feel that  certainly not said the major shortly  then i must explain with more elaboration said mr northover with a sigh the adventure and romance agency has been started to meet a great modern desire on every side in conversation and in literature we hear of the desire for a larger theatre of events for something to waylay us and lead us splendidly astray now the man who feels this desire for a varied life pays a yearly or a quarterly sum to the adventure and romance agency in return the adventure and romance agency undertakes to surround him with startling and weird events as a man is leaving his front door an excited sweep approaches him and assures him of a plot against his life he gets into a cab and is driven to an opium den he receives a mysterious telegram or a dramatic visit and is immediately in a vortex of incidents a very picturesque and moving story is first written by one of the staff of distinguished novelists who are at present hard at work in the adjoining room yours major brown designed by our mr grigsby i consider peculiarly forcible and pointed it is almost a pity you did not see the end of it i need scarcely explain further the monstrous mistake your predecessor in your present house mr gurneybrown was a subscriber to our agency and our foolish clerks ignoring alike the dignity of the hyphen and the glory of military rank positively imagined that major brown and mr gurneybrown were the same person thus you were suddenly hurled into the middle of another mans story  how on earth does the thing work asked rupert grant with bright and fascinated eyes  we believe that we are doing a noble work said northover warmly it has continually struck us that there is no element in modern life that is more lamentable than the fact that the modern man has to seek all artistic existence in a sedentary state if he wishes to float into fairyland he reads a book if he wishes to dash into the thick of battle he reads a book if he wishes to soar into heaven he reads a book if he wishes to slide down the banisters he reads a book we give him these visions but we give him exercise at the same time the necessity of leaping from wall to wall of fighting strange gentlemen of running down long streets from pursuersall healthy and pleasant exercises we give him a glimpse of that great morning world of robin hood or the knights errant when one great game was played under the splendid sky we give him back his childhood that godlike time when we can act stories be our own heroes and at the same instant dance and dream  basil gazed at him curiously the most singular psychological discovery had been reserved to the end for as the little business man ceased speaking he had the blazing eyes of a fanatic  major brown received the explanation with complete simplicity and good humour  of course awfully dense sir he said no doubt at all the scheme excellent but i dont think he paused a moment and looked dreamily out of the window i dont think you will find me in it somehow when ones seenseen the thing itself you knowblood and men screaming one feels about having a little house and a little hobby in the bible you know there remaineth a rest  northover bowed then after a pause he said  gentlemen may i offer you my card if any of the rest of you desire at any time to communicate with me despite major browns view of the matter  i should be obliged for your card sir said the major in his abrupt but courteous voice pay for chair  the agent of romance and adventure handed his card laughing  it ran p g northover ba cqt adventure and romance agency 14 tanners court fleet street  what on earth is cqt asked rupert grant looking over the majors shoulder  dont you know returned northover havent you ever heard of the club of queer trades  there seems to be a confounded lot of funny things we havent heard of said the little major reflectively whats this one  the club of queer trades is a society consisting exclusively of people who have invented some new and curious way of making money i was one of the earliest members  you deserve to be said basil taking up his great white hat with a smile and speaking for the last time that evening  when they had passed out the adventure and romance agent wore a queer smile as he trod down the fire and locked up his desk a fine chap that major when one hasnt a touch of the poet one stands some chance of being a poem but to think of such a clockwork little creature of all people getting into the nets of one of grigsbys tales and he laughed out aloud in the silence  just as the laugh echoed away there came a sharp knock at the door an owlish head with dark moustaches was thrust in with deprecating and somewhat absurd inquiry  what back again major cried northover in surprise what can i do for you  the major shuffled feverishly into the room  its horribly absurd he said something must have got started in me that i never knew before but upon my soul i feel the most desperate desire to know the end of it all  the end of it all  yes said the major jackals and the titledeeds and death to major brown  the agents face grew grave but his eyes were amused  i am terribly sorry major said he but what you ask is impossible i dont know any one i would sooner oblige than you but the rules of the agency are strict the adventures are confidential you are an outsider i am not allowed to let you know an inch more than i can help i do hope you understand  there is no one said brown who understands discipline better than i do thank you very much good night  and the little man withdrew for the last time  he married miss jameson the lady with the red hair and the green garments she was an actress employed with many others by the romance agency and her marriage with the prim old veteran caused some stir in her languid and intellectualized set she always replied very quietly that she had met scores of men who acted splendidly in the charades provided for them by northover but that she had only met one man who went down into a coalcellar when he really thought it contained a murderer  the major and she are living as happily as birds in an absurd villa and the former has taken to smoking otherwise he is unchangedexcept perhaps there are moments when alert and full of feminine unselfishness as the major is by nature he falls into a trance of abstraction then his wife recognizes with a concealed smile by the blind look in his blue eyes that he is wondering what were the titledeeds and why he was not allowed to mention jackals but like so many old soldiers brown is religious and believes that he will realize the rest of those purple adventures in a better world    chapter 2 the painful fall of a great reputation  basil grant and i were talking one day in what is perhaps the most perfect place for talking on earththe top of a tolerably deserted tramcar to talk on the top of a hill is superb but to talk on the top of a flying hill is a fairy tale  the vast blank space of north london was flying by the very pace gave us a sense of its immensity and its meanness it was as it were a base infinitude a squalid eternity and we felt the real horror of the poor parts of london the horror that is so totally missed and misrepresented by the sensational novelists who depict it as being a matter of narrow streets filthy houses criminals and maniacs and dens of vice in a narrow street in a den of vice you do not expect civilization you do not expect order but the horror of this was the fact that there was civilization that there was order but that civilisation only showed its morbidity and order only its monotony no one would say in going through a criminal slum i see no statues i notice no cathedrals but here there were public buildings only they were mostly lunatic asylums here there were statues only they were mostly statues of railway engineers and philanthropiststwo dingy classes of men united by their common contempt for the people here there were churches only they were the churches of dim and erratic sects agapemonites or irvingites here above all there were broad roads and vast crossings and tramway lines and hospitals and all the real marks of civilization but though one never knew in one sense what one would see next there was one thing we knew we should not seeanything really great central of the first class anything that humanity had adored and with revulsion indescribable our emotions returned i think to those really close and crooked entries to those really mean streets to those genuine slums which lie round the thames and the city in which nevertheless a real possibility remains that at any chance corner the great cross of the great cathedral of wren may strike down the street like a thunderbolt  but you must always remember also said grant to me in his heavy abstracted way when i had urged this view that the very vileness of the life of these ordered plebeian places bears witness to the victory of the human soul i agree with you i agree that they have to live in something worse than barbarism they have to live in a fourthrate civilization but yet i am practically certain that the majority of people here are good people and being good is an adventure far more violent and daring than sailing round the world besides  go on i said  no answer came  go on i said looking up  the big blue eyes of basil grant were standing out of his head and he was paying no attention to me he was staring over the side of the tram  what is the matter i asked peering over also  it is very odd said grant at last grimly that i should have been caught out like this at the very moment of my optimism i said all these people were good and there is the wickedest man in england  where i asked leaning over further where  oh i was right enough he went on in that strange continuous and sleepy tone which always angered his hearers at acute moments i was right enough when i said all these people were good they are heroes they are saints now and then they may perhaps steal a spoon or two they may beat a wife or two with the poker but they are saints all the same they are angels they are robed in white they are clad with wings and haloesat any rate compared to that man  which man i cried again and then my eye caught the figure at which basils bulls eyes were glaring  he was a slim smooth person passing very quickly among the quickly passing crowd but though there was nothing about him sufficient to attract a startled notice there was quite enough to demand a curious consideration when once that notice was attracted he wore a black tophat but there was enough in it of those strange curves whereby the decadent artist of the eighties tried to turn the tophat into something as rhythmic as an etruscan vase his hair which was largely grey was curled with the instinct of one who appreciated the gradual beauty of grey and silver the rest of his face was oval and i thought rather oriental he had two black tufts of moustache  what has he done i asked  i am not sure of the details said grant but his besetting sin is a desire to intrigue to the disadvantage of others probably he has adopted some imposture or other to effect his plan  what plan i asked if you know all about him why dont you tell me why he is the wickedest man in england what is his name  basil grant stared at me for some moments  i think youve made a mistake in my meaning he said i dont know his name i never saw him before in my life  never saw him before i cried with a kind of anger then what in heavens name do you mean by saying that he is the wickedest man in england  i meant what i said said basil grant calmly the moment i saw that man i saw all these people stricken with a sudden and splendid innocence i saw that while all ordinary poor men in the streets were being themselves he was not being himself i saw that all the men in these slums cadgers pickpockets hooligans are all in the deepest sense trying to be good and i saw that that man was trying to be evil  but if you never saw him before i began  in gods name look at his face cried out basil in a voice that startled the driver look at the eyebrows they mean that infernal pride which made satan so proud that he sneered even at heaven when he was one of the first angels in it look at his moustaches they are so grown as to insult humanity in the name of the sacred heavens look at his hair in the name of god and the stars look at his hat  i stirred uncomfortably  but after all i said this is very fancifulperfectly absurd look at the mere facts you have never seen the man before you  oh the mere facts he cried out in a kind of despair the mere facts do you really admitare you still so sunk in superstitions so clinging to dim and prehistoric altars that you believe in facts do you not trust an immediate impression  well an immediate impression may be i said a little less practical than facts  bosh he said on what else is the whole world run but immediate impressions what is more practical my friend the philosophy of this world may be founded on facts its business is run on spiritual impressions and atmospheres why do you refuse or accept a clerk do you measure his skull do you read up his physiological state in a handbook do you go upon facts at all not a scrap you accept a clerk who may save your businessyou refuse a clerk that may rob your till entirely upon those immediate mystical impressions under the pressure of which i pronounce with a perfect sense of certainty and sincerity that that man walking in that street beside us is a humbug and a villain of some kind  you always put things well i said but of course such things cannot immediately be put to the test  basil sprang up straight and swayed with the swaying car  let us get off and follow him he said i bet you five pounds it will turn out as i say  and with a scuttle a jump and a run we were off the car  the man with the curved silver hair and the curved eastern face walked along for some time his long splendid frockcoat flying behind him then he swung sharply out of the great glaring road and disappeared down an illlit alley we swung silently after him  this is an odd turning for a man of that kind to take i said  a man of what kind asked my friend  well i said a man with that kind of expression and those boots i thought it rather odd to tell the truth that he should be in this part of the world at all  ah yes said basil and said no more  we tramped on looking steadily in front of us the elegant figure like the figure of a black swan was silhouetted suddenly against the glare of intermittent gaslight and then swallowed again in night the intervals between the lights were long and a fog was thickening the whole city our pace therefore had become swift and mechanical between the lampposts but basil came to a standstill suddenly like a reined horse i stopped also we had almost run into the man a great part of the solid darkness in front of us was the darkness of his body  at first i thought he had turned to face us but though we were hardly a yard off he did not realize that we were there he tapped four times on a very low and dirty door in the dark crabbed street a gleam of gas cut the darkness as it opened slowly we listened intently but the interview was short and simple and inexplicable as an interview could be our exquisite friend handed in what looked like a paper or a card and said  at once take a cab  a heavy deep voice from inside said  right you are  and with a click we were in the blackness again and striding after the striding stranger through a labyrinth of london lanes the lights just helping us it was only five oclock but winter and the fog had made it like midnight  this is really an extraordinary walk for the patentleather boots i repeated  i dont know said basil humbly it leads to berkeley square  as i tramped on i strained my eyes through the dusky atmosphere and tried to make out the direction described for some ten minutes i wondered and doubted at the end of that i saw that my friend was right we were coming to the great dreary spaces of fashionable londonmore dreary one must admit even than the dreary plebeian spaces  this is very extraordinary said basil grant as we turned into berkeley square  what is extraordinary i asked i thought you said it was quite natural  i do not wonder answered basil at his walking through nasty streets i do not wonder at his going to berkeley square but i do wonder at his going to the house of a very good man  what very good man i asked with exasperation  the operation of time is a singular one he said with his imperturbable irrelevancy it is not a true statement of the case to say that i have forgotten my career when i was a judge and a public man i remember it all vividly but it is like remembering some novel but fifteen years ago i knew this square as well as lord rosebery does and a confounded long sight better than that man who is going up the steps of old beaumonts house  who is old beaumont i asked irritably  a perfectly good fellow lord beaumont of foxwooddont you know his name he is a man of transparent sincerity a nobleman who does more work than a navvy a socialist an anarchist i dont know what anyhow hes a philosopher and philanthropist i admit he has the slight disadvantage of being beyond all question off his head he has that real disadvantage which has arisen out of the modern worship of progress and novelty and he thinks anything odd and new must be an advance if you went to him and proposed to eat your grandmother he would agree with you so long as you put it on hygienic and public grounds as a cheap alternative to cremation so long as you progress fast enough it seems a matter of indifference to him whether you are progressing to the stars or the devil so his house is filled with an endless succession of literary and political fashions men who wear long hair because it is romantic men who wear short hair because it is medical men who walk on their feet only to exercise their hands and men who walk on their hands for fear of tiring their feet but though the inhabitants of his salons are generally fools like himself they are almost always like himself good men i am really surprised to see a criminal enter there  my good fellow i said firmly striking my foot on the pavement the truth of this affair is very simple to use your own eloquent language you have the slight disadvantage of being off your head you see a total stranger in a public street you choose to start certain theories about his eyebrows you then treat him as a burglar because he enters an honest mans door the thing is too monstrous admit that it is basil and come home with me though these people are still having tea yet with the distance we have to go we shall be late for dinner  basils eyes were shining in the twilight like lamps  i thought he said that i had outlived vanity  what do you want now i cried  i want he cried out what a girl wants when she wears her new frock i want what a boy wants when he goes in for a clanging match with a monitori want to show somebody what a fine fellow i am i am as right about that man as i am about your having a hat on your head you say it cannot be tested i say it can i will take you to see my old friend beaumont he is a delightful man to know  do you really mean i began  i will apologize he said calmly for our not being dressed for a call and walking across the vast misty square he walked up the dark stone steps and rang at the bell  a severe servant in black and white opened the door to us on receiving my friends name his manner passed in a flash from astonishment to respect we were ushered into the house very quickly but not so quickly but that our host a whitehaired man with a fiery face came out quickly to meet us  my dear fellow he cried shaking basils hand again and again i have not seen you for years have you beener he said rather wildly have you been in the country  not for all that time answered basil smiling i have long given up my official position my dear philip and have been living in a deliberate retirement i hope i do not come at an inopportune moment  an inopportune moment cried the ardent gentleman you come at the most opportune moment i could imagine do you know who is here  i do not answered grant with gravity even as he spoke a roar of laughter came from the inner room  basil said lord beaumont solemnly i have wimpole here  and who is wimpole  basil cried the other you must have been in the country you must have been in the antipodes you must have been in the moon who is wimpole who was shakespeare  as to who shakespeare was answered my friend placidly my views go no further than thinking that he was not bacon more probably he was mary queen of scots but as to who wimpole is and his speech also was cloven with a roar of laughter from within  wimpole cried lord beaumont in a sort of ecstasy havent you heard of the great modern wit my dear fellow he has turned conversation i do not say into an artfor that perhaps it always was but into a great art like the statuary of michael angeloan art of masterpieces his repartees my good friend startle one like a man shot dead they are final they are  again there came the hilarious roar from the room and almost with the very noise of it a big panting apoplectic old gentleman came out of the inner house into the hall where we were standing  now my dear chap began lord beaumont hastily  i tell you beaumont i wont stand it exploded the large old gentleman i wont be made game of by a twopenny literary adventurer like that i wont be made a guy i wont  come come said beaumont feverishly let me introduce you this is mr justice grantthat is mr grant basil i am sure you have heard of sir walter cholmondeliegh  who has not asked grant and bowed to the worthy old baronet eyeing him with some curiosity he was hot and heavy in his momentary anger but even that could not conceal the noble though opulent outline of his face and body the florid white hair the roman nose the body stalwart though corpulent the chin aristocratic though double he was a magnificent courtly gentleman so much of a gentleman that he could show an unquestionable weakness of anger without altogether losing dignity so much of a gentleman that even his faux pas were wellbred  i am distressed beyond expression beaumont he said gruffly to fail in respect to these gentlemen and even more especially to fail in it in your house but it is not you or they that are in any way concerned but that flashy halfcaste jackanapes  at this moment a young man with a twist of red moustache and a sombre air came out of the inner room he also did not seem to be greatly enjoying the intellectual banquet within  i think you remember my friend and secretary mr drummond said lord beaumont turning to grant even if you only remember him as a schoolboy  perfectly said the other mr drummond shook hands pleasantly and respectfully but the cloud was still on his brow turning to sir walter cholmondeliegh he said  i was sent by lady beaumont to express her hope that you were not going yet sir walter she says she has scarcely seen anything of you  the old gentleman still red in the face had a temporary internal struggle then his good manners triumphed and with a gesture of obeisance and a vague utterance of if lady beaumont a lady of course he followed the young man back into the salon he had scarcely been deposited there half a minute before another peal of laughter told that he had in all probability been scored off again  of course i can excuse dear old cholmondeliegh said beaumont as he helped us off with our coats he has not the modern mind  what is the modern mind asked grant  oh its enlightened you know and progressiveand faces the facts of life seriously at this moment another roar of laughter came from within  i only ask said basil because of the last two friends of yours who had the modern mind one thought it wrong to eat fishes and the other thought it right to eat men i beg your pardonthis way if i remember right  do you know said lord beaumont with a sort of feverish entertainment as he trotted after us towards the interior i can never quite make out which side you are on sometimes you seem so liberal and sometimes so reactionary are you a modern basil  no said basil loudly and cheerfully as he entered the crowded drawingroom  this caused a slight diversion and some eyes were turned away from our slim friend with the oriental face for the first time that afternoon two people however still looked at him one was the daughter of the house muriel beaumont who gazed at him with great violet eyes and with the intense and awful thirst of the female upper class for verbal amusement and stimulus the other was sir walter cholmondeliegh who looked at him with a still and sullen but unmistakable desire to throw him out of the window  he sat there coiled rather than seated on the easy chair everything from the curves of his smooth limbs to the coils of his silvered hair suggesting the circles of a serpent more than the straight limbs of a manthe unmistakable splendid serpentine gentleman we had seen walking in north london his eyes shining with repeated victory  what i cant understand mr wimpole said muriel beaumont eagerly is how you contrive to treat all this so easily you say things quite philosophical and yet so wildly funny if i thought of such things im sure i should laugh outright when the thought first came  i agree with miss beaumont said sir walter suddenly exploding with indignation if i had thought of anything so futile i should find it difficult to keep my countenance  difficult to keep your countenance cried mr wimpole with an air of alarm oh do keep your countenance keep it in the british museum  every one laughed uproariously as they always do at an already admitted readiness and sir walter turning suddenly purple shouted out  do you know who you are talking to with your confounded tomfooleries  i never talk tomfooleries said the other without first knowing my audience  grant walked across the room and tapped the redmoustached secretary on the shoulder that gentleman was leaning against the wall regarding the whole scene with a great deal of gloom but i fancied with very particular gloom when his eyes fell on the young lady of the house rapturously listening to wimpole  may i have a word with you outside drummond asked grant it is about business lady beaumont will excuse us  i followed my friend at his own request greatly wondering to this strange external interview we passed abruptly into a kind of side room out of the hall  drummond said basil sharply there are a great many good people and a great many sane people here this afternoon unfortunately by a kind of coincidence all the good people are mad and all the sane people are wicked you are the only person i know of here who is honest and has also some common sense what do you make of wimpole  mr secretary drummond had a pale face and red hair but at this his face became suddenly as red as his moustache  i am not a fair judge of him he said  why not asked grant  because i hate him like hell said the other after a long pause and violently  neither grant nor i needed to ask the reason his glances towards miss beaumont and the stranger were sufficiently illuminating grant said quietly  but beforebefore you came to hate him what did you really think of him  i am in a terrible difficulty said the young man and his voice told us like a clear bell that he was an honest man if i spoke about him as i feel about him now i could not trust myself and i should like to be able to say that when i first saw him i thought he was charming but again the fact is i didnt i hate him that is my private affair but i also disapprove of himreally i do believe i disapprove of him quite apart from my private feelings when first he came i admit he was much quieter but i did not like so to speak the moral swell of him then that jolly old sir walter cholmondeliegh got introduced to us and this fellow with his cheapjack wit began to score off the old man in the way he does now then i felt that he must be a bad lot it must be bad to fight the old and the kindly and he fights the poor old chap savagely unceasingly as if he hated old age and kindliness take if you want it the evidence of a prejudiced witness i admit that i hate the man because a certain person admires him but i believe that apart from that i should hate the man because old sir walter hates him  this speech affected me with a genuine sense of esteem and pity for the young man that is of pity for him because of his obviously hopeless worship of miss beaumont and of esteem for him because of the direct realistic account of the history of wimpole which he had given still i was sorry that he seemed so steadily set against the man and could not help referring it to an instinct of his personal relations however nobly disguised from himself  in the middle of these meditations grant whispered in my ear what was perhaps the most startling of all interruptions  in the name of god lets get away  i have never known exactly in how odd a way this odd old man affected me i only know that for some reason or other he so affected me that i was within a few minutes in the street outside  this he said is a beastly but amusing affair  what is i asked baldly enough  this affair listen to me my old friend lord and lady beaumont have just invited you and me to a grand dinnerparty this very night at which mr wimpole will be in all his glory well there is nothing very extraordinary about that the extraordinary thing is that we are not going  well really i said it is already six oclock and i doubt if we could get home and dress i see nothing extraordinary in the fact that we are not going  dont you said grant ill bet youll see something extraordinary in what were doing instead  i looked at him blankly  doing instead i asked what are we doing instead  why said he we are waiting for one or two hours outside this house on a winter evening you must forgive me it is all my vanity it is only to show you that i am right can you with the assistance of this cigar wait until both sir walter cholmondeliegh and the mystic wimpole have left this house  certainly i said but i do not know which is likely to leave first have you any notion  no he said sir walter may leave first in a glow of rage or again mr wimpole may leave first feeling that his last epigram is a thing to be flung behind him like a firework and sir walter may remain some time to analyse mr wimpoles character but they will both have to leave within reasonable time for they will both have to get dressed and come back to dinner here tonight  as he spoke the shrill double whistle from the porch of the great house drew a dark cab to the dark portal and then a thing happened that we really had not expected mr wimpole and sir walter cholmondeliegh came out at the same moment  they paused for a second or two opposite each other in a natural doubt then a certain geniality fundamental perhaps in both of them made sir walter smile and say the night is foggy pray take my cab  before i could count twenty the cab had gone rattling up the street with both of them and before i could count twentythree grant had hissed in my ear  run after the cab run as if you were running from a mad dogrun  we pelted on steadily keeping the cab in sight through dark mazy streets god only i thought knows why we are running at all but we are running hard fortunately we did not run far the cab pulled up at the fork of two streets and sir walter paid the cabman who drove away rejoicing having just come in contact with the more generous among the rich then the two men talked together as men do talk together after giving and receiving great insults the talk which leads either to forgiveness or a duelat least so it seemed as we watched it from ten yards off then the two men shook hands heartily and one went down one fork of the road and one down another  basil with one of his rare gestures flung his arms forward  run after that scoundrel he cried let us catch him now  we dashed across the open space and reached the juncture of two paths  stop i shouted wildly to grant thats the wrong turning  he ran on  idiot i howled sir walters gone down there wimpole has slipped us hes half a mile down the other road youre wrong are you deaf youre wrong  i dont think i am he panted and ran on  but i saw him i cried look in front of you is that wimpole its the old man what are you doing what are we to do  keep running said grant  running soon brought us up to the broad back of the pompous old baronet whose white whiskers shone silver in the fitful lamplight my brain was utterly bewildered i grasped nothing  charlie said basil hoarsely can you believe in my common sense for four minutes  of course i said panting  then help me to catch that man in front and hold him down do it at once when i say now now  we sprang on sir walter cholmondeliegh and rolled that portly old gentleman on his back he fought with a commendable valour but we got him tight i had not the remotest notion why he had a splendid and fullblooded vigour when he could not box he kicked and we bound him when he could not kick he shouted and we gagged him then by basils arrangement we dragged him into a small court by the street side and waited as i say i had no notion why  i am sorry to incommode you said basil calmly out of the darkness but i have made an appointment here  an appointment i said blankly  yes he said glancing calmly at the apoplectic old aristocrat gagged on the ground whose eyes were starting impotently from his head i have made an appointment here with a thoroughly nice young fellow an old friend jasper drummond his name isyou may have met him this afternoon at the beaumonts he can scarcely come though till the beaumonts dinner is over  for i do not know how many hours we stood there calmly in the darkness by the time those hours were over i had thoroughly made up my mind that the same thing had happened which had happened long ago on the bench of a british court of justice basil grant had gone mad i could imagine no other explanation of the facts with the portly purplefaced old country gentleman flung there strangled on the floor like a bundle of wood  after about four hours a lean figure in evening dress rushed into the court a glimpse of gaslight showed the red moustache and white face of jasper drummond  mr grant he said blankly the thing is incredible you were right but what did you mean all through this dinnerparty where dukes and duchesses and editors of quarterlies had come especially to hear him that extraordinary wimpole kept perfectly silent he didnt say a funny thing he didnt say anything at all what does it mean  grant pointed to the portly old gentleman on the ground  that is what it means he said  drummond on observing a fat gentleman lying so calmly about the place jumped back as from a mouse  what he said weakly  what  basil bent suddenly down and tore a paper out of sir walters breastpocket a paper which the baronet even in his hampered state seemed to make some effort to retain  it was a large loose piece of white wrapping paper which mr jasper drummond read with a vacant eye and undisguised astonishment as far as he could make out it consisted of a series of questions and answers or at least of remarks and replies arranged in the manner of a catechism the greater part of the document had been torn and obliterated in the struggle but the termination remained it ran as follows  c says keep countenance  w keep british museum  c know whom talk absurdities  w never talk absurdities without  what is it cried drummond flinging the paper down in a sort of final fury  what is it replied grant his voice rising into a kind of splendid chant what is it it is a great new profession a great new trade a trifle immoral i admit but still great like piracy  a new profession said the young man with the red moustache vaguely a new trade  a new trade repeated grant with a strange exultation a new profession what a pity it is immoral  but what the deuce is it cried drummond and i in a breath of blasphemy  it is said grant calmly the great new trade of the organizer of repartee this fat old gentleman lying on the ground strikes you as i have no doubt as very stupid and very rich let me clear his character he is like ourselves very clever and very poor he is also not really at all fat all that is stuffing he is not particularly old and his name is not cholmondeliegh he is a swindler and a swindler of a perfectly delightful and novel kind he hires himself out at dinnerparties to lead up to other peoples repartees according to a preconcerted scheme which you may find on that piece of paper he says the stupid things he has arranged for himself and his client says the clever things arranged for him in short he allows himself to be scored off for a guinea a night  and this fellow wimpole began drummond with indignation  this fellow wimpole said basil grant smiling will not be an intellectual rival in the future he had some fine things elegance and silvered hair and so on but the intellect is with our friend on the floor  that fellow cried drummond furiously that fellow ought to be in gaol  not at all said basil indulgently he ought to be in the club of queer trades    chapter 3 the awful reason of the vicars visit  the revolt of matter against man which i believe to exist has now been reduced to a singular condition it is the small things rather than the large things which make war against us and i may add beat us the bones of the last mammoth have long ago decayed a mighty wreck the tempests no longer devour our navies nor the mountains with hearts of fire heap hell over our cities but we are engaged in a bitter and eternal war with small things chiefly with microbes and with collar studs the stud with which i was engaged on fierce and equal terms as i made the above reflections was one which i was trying to introduce into my shirt collar when a loud knock came at the door  my first thought was as to whether basil grant had called to fetch me he and i were to turn up at the same dinnerparty for which i was in the act of dressing and it might be that he had taken it into his head to come my way though we had arranged to go separately it was a small and confidential affair at the table of a good but unconventional political lady an old friend of his she had asked us both to meet a third guest a captain fraser who had made something of a name and was an authority on chimpanzees as basil was an old friend of the hostess and i had never seen her i felt that it was quite possible that he with his usual social sagacity might have decided to take me along in order to break the ice the theory like all my theories was complete but as a fact it was not basil  i was handed a visiting card inscribed rev ellis shorter and underneath was written in pencil but in a hand in which even hurry could not conceal a depressing and gentlemanly excellence asking the favour of a few moments conversation on a most urgent matter  i had already subdued the stud thereby proclaiming that the image of god has supremacy over all matters a valuable truth and throwing on my dresscoat and waistcoat hurried into the drawingroom he rose at my entrance flapping like a seal i can use no other description he flapped a plaid shawl over his right arm he flapped a pair of pathetic black gloves he flapped his clothes i may say without exaggeration that he flapped his eyelids as he rose he was a baldbrowed whitehaired whitewhiskered old clergyman of a flappy and floppy type he said  i am so sorry i am so very sorry i am so extremely sorry i comei can only sayi can only say in my defence that i comeupon an important matter pray forgive me  i told him i forgave perfectly and waited  what i have to say he said brokenly is so dreadfulit is so dreadfuli have lived a quiet life  i was burning to get away for it was already doubtful if i should be in time for dinner but there was something about the old mans honest air of bitterness that seemed to open to me the possibilities of life larger and more tragic than my own  i said gently pray go on  nevertheless the old gentleman being a gentleman as well as old noticed my secret impatience and seemed still more unmanned  im so sorry he said meekly i wouldnt have comebut foryour friend major brown recommended me to come here  major brown i said with some interest  yes said the reverend mr shorter feverishly flapping his plaid shawl about he told me you helped him in a great difficultyand my difficulty oh my dear sir its a matter of life and death  i rose abruptly in an acute perplexity will it take long mr shorter i asked i have to go out to dinner almost at once  he rose also trembling from head to foot and yet somehow with all his moral palsy he rose to the dignity of his age and his office  i have no right mr swinburnei have no right at all he said if you have to go out to dinner you have of coursea perfect rightof course a perfect right but when you come backa man will be dead  and he sat down quaking like a jelly  the triviality of the dinner had been in those two minutes dwarfed and drowned in my mind i did not want to go and see a political widow and a captain who collected apes i wanted to hear what had brought this dear doddering old vicar into relation with immediate perils  will you have a cigar i said  no thank you he said with indescribable embarrassment as if not smoking cigars was a social disgrace  a glass of wine i said  no thank you no thank you not just now he repeated with that hysterical eagerness with which people who do not drink at all often try to convey that on any other night of the week they would sit up all night drinking rumpunch not just now thank you  nothing else i can get for you i said feeling genuinely sorry for the wellmannered old donkey a cup of tea  i saw a struggle in his eye and i conquered when the cup of tea came he drank it like a dipsomaniac gulping brandy then he fell back and said  i have had such a time mr swinburne i am not used to these excitements as vicar of chuntsey in essexhe threw this in with an indescribable airiness of vanityi have never known such things happen  what things happen i asked  he straightened himself with sudden dignity  as vicar of chuntsey in essex he said i have never been forcibly dressed up as an old woman and made to take part in a crime in the character of an old woman never once my experience may be small it may be insufficient but it has never occurred to me before  i have never heard of it i said as among the duties of a clergyman but i am not well up in church matters excuse me if perhaps i failed to follow you correctly dressed upas what  as an old woman said the vicar solemnly as an old woman  i thought in my heart that it required no great transformation to make an old woman of him but the thing was evidently more tragic than comic and i said respectfully  may i ask how it occurred  i will begin at the beginning said mr shorter and i will tell my story with the utmost possible precision at seventeen minutes past eleven this morning i left the vicarage to keep certain appointments and pay certain visits in the village my first visit was to mr jervis the treasurer of our league of christian amusements with whom i concluded some business touching the claim made by parkes the gardener in the matter of the rolling of our tennis lawn i then visited mrs arnett a very earnest churchwoman but permanently bedridden she is the author of several small works of devotion and of a book of verse entitled unless my memory misleads me eglantine  he uttered all this not only with deliberation but with something that can only be called by a contradictory phrase eager deliberation he had i think a vague memory in his head of the detectives in the detective stories who always sternly require that nothing should be kept back  i then proceeded he went on with the same maddening conscientiousness of manner to mr carr not mr james carr of course mr robert carr who is temporarily assisting our organist and having consulted with him on the subject of a choir boy who is accused i cannot as yet say whether justly or not of cutting holes in the organ pipes i finally dropped in upon a dorcas meeting at the house of miss brett the dorcas meetings are usually held at the vicarage but my wife being unwell miss brett a newcomer in our village but very active in church work had very kindly consented to hold them the dorcas society is entirely under my wifes management as a rule and except for miss brett who as i say is very active i scarcely know any members of it i had however promised to drop in on them and i did so  when i arrived there were only four other maiden ladies with miss brett but they were sewing very busily it is very difficult of course for any person however strongly impressed with the necessity in these matters of full and exact exposition of the facts to remember and repeat the actual details of a conversation particularly a conversation which though inspired with a most worthy and admirable zeal for good work was one which did not greatly impress the hearers mind at the time and was in factermostly about socks i can however remember distinctly that one of the spinster ladies she was a thin person with a woollen shawl who appeared to feel the cold and i am almost sure she was introduced to me as miss james remarked that the weather was very changeable miss brett then offered me a cup of tea which i accepted i cannot recall in what words miss brett is a short and stout lady with white hair the only other figure in the group that caught my attention was a miss mowbray a small and neat lady of aristocratic manners silver hair and a high voice and colour she was the most emphatic member of the party and her views on the subject of pinafores though expressed with a natural deference to myself were in themselves strong and advanced beside her although all five ladies were dressed simply in black it could not be denied that the others looked in some way what you men of the world would call dowdy  after about ten minutes conversation i rose to go and as i did so i heard something whichi cannot describe itsomething which seemed tobut i really cannot describe it  what did you hear i asked with some impatience  i heard said the vicar solemnly i heard miss mowbray the lady with the silver hair say to miss james the lady with the woollen shawl the following extraordinary words i committed them to memory on the spot and as soon as circumstances set me free to do so i noted them down on a piece of paper i believe i have it here he fumbled in his breastpocket bringing out mild things notebooks circulars and programmes of village concerts i heard miss mowbray say to miss james the following words nows your time bill  he gazed at me for a few moments after making this announcement gravely and unflinchingly as if conscious that here he was unshaken about his facts then he resumed turning his bald head more towards the fire  this appeared to me remarkable i could not by any means understand it it seemed to me first of all peculiar that one maiden lady should address another maiden lady as bill my experience as i have said may be incomplete maiden ladies may have among themselves and in exclusively spinster circles wilder customs than i am aware of but it seemed to me odd and i could almost have sworn if you will not misunderstand the phrase i should have been strongly impelled to maintain at the time that the words nows your time bill were by no means pronounced with that upperclass intonation which as i have already said had up to now characterized miss mowbrays conversation in fact the words nows your time bill would have been i fancy unsuitable if pronounced with that upperclass intonation  i was surprised i repeat then at the remark but i was still more surprised when looking round me in bewilderment my hat and umbrella in hand i saw the lean lady with the woollen shawl leaning upright against the door out of which i was just about to make my exit she was still knitting and i supposed that this erect posture against the door was only an eccentricity of spinsterhood and an oblivion of my intended departure  i said genially i am so sorry to disturb you miss james but i must really be going i haveer i stopped here for the words she had uttered in reply though singularly brief and in tone extremely businesslike were such as to render that arrest of my remarks i think natural and excusable i have these words also noted down i have not the least idea of their meaning so i have only been able to render them phonetically but she said and mr shorter peered shortsightedly at his papers she said chuck it fat ead and she added something that sounded like its a kop or possibly a kopt and then the last cord either of my sanity or the sanity of the universe snapped suddenly my esteemed friend and helper miss brett standing by the mantelpiece said put is old ead in a bag sam and tie im up before you start jawin youll be kopt yourselves some o these days with this way of coin things har lar theater  my head went round and round was it really true as i had suddenly fancied a moment before that unmarried ladies had some dreadful riotous society of their own from which all others were excluded i remembered dimly in my classical days i was a scholar in a small way once but now alas rusty i remembered the mysteries of the bona dea and their strange female freemasonry i remembered the witches sabbaths i was just in my absurd lightheadedness trying to remember a line of verse about dianas nymphs when miss mowbray threw her arm round me from behind the moment it held me i knew it was not a womans arm  miss brettor what i had called miss brettwas standing in front of me with a big revolver in her hand and a broad grin on her face miss james was still leaning against the door but had fallen into an attitude so totally new and so totally unfeminine that it gave one a shock she was kicking her heels with her hands in her pockets and her cap on one side she was a man i mean he was a wono that is i saw that instead of being a woman shehe i meanthat is it was a man  mr shorter became indescribably flurried and flapping in endeavouring to arrange these genders and his plaid shawl at the same time he resumed with a higher fever of nervousness  as for miss mowbray shehe held me in a ring of iron he had her armthat is she had his armround her neckmy neck i meanand i could not cry out miss brettthat is mr brett at least mr something who was not miss bretthad the revolver pointed at me the other two ladiesor ergentlemen were rummaging in some bag in the background it was all clear at last they were criminals dressed up as women to kidnap me to kidnap the vicar of chuntsey in essex but why was it to be nonconformists  the brute leaning against the door called out carelessly urry up arry show the old bloke what the game is and lets get off  curse is eyes said miss bretti mean the man with the revolverwhy should we show im the game  if you take my advice you bloomin well will said the man at the door whom they called bill a man wot knows wet es doin is worth ten wot dont even if es a potty old parson  bills right enough said the coarse voice of the man who held me it had been miss mowbrays bring out the picture arry  the man with the revolver walked across the room to where the other two womeni mean menwere turning over baggage and asked them for something which they gave him he came back with it across the room and held it out in front of me and compared to the surprise of that display all the previous surprises of this awful day shrank suddenly  it was a portrait of myself that such a picture should be in the hands of these scoundrels might in any case have caused a mild surprise but no more it was no mild surprise that i felt the likeness was an extremely good one worked up with all the accessories of the conventional photographic studio i was leaning my head on my hand and was relieved against a painted landscape of woodland it was obvious that it was no snapshot it was clear that i had sat for this photograph and the truth was that i had never sat for such a photograph it was a photograph that i had never had taken  i stared at it again and again it seemed to me to be touched up a good deal it was glazed as well as framed and the glass blurred some of the details but there unmistakably was my face my eyes my nose and mouth my head and hand posed for a professional photographer and i had never posed so for any photographer  beold the bloomin miracle said the man with the revolver with illtimed facetiousness parson prepare to meet your god and with this he slid the glass out of the frame as the glass moved i saw that part of the picture was painted on it in chinese white notably a pair of white whiskers and a clerical collar and underneath was a portrait of an old lady in a quiet black dress leaning her head on her hand against the woodland landscape the old lady was as like me as one pin is like another it had required only the whiskers and the collar to make it me in every hair  entertainin aint it said the man described as arry as he shot the glass back again remarkable resemblance parson gratifyin to the lady gratifyin to you and hi may hadd particlery gratifyin to us as bein the probable source of a very tolerable haul you know colonel hawker the man whos come to live in these parts dont you  i nodded  well said the man arry pointing to the picture thats is mother oo ran to catch im when e fell she did and he flung his fingers in a general gesture towards the photograph of the old lady who was exactly like me  tell the old gent wot es got to do and be done with it broke out bill from the door look ere reverend shorter we aint goin to do you no arm well give you a sov for your trouble if you like and as for the old womans clotheswhy youll look lovely in em  you aint much of a and at a description bill said the man behind me mr shorter its like this weve got to see this man hawker tonight maybe ell kiss us all and ave up the champagne when e sees us maybe on the other ande wont maybe ell be dead when we goes away maybe not but weve got to see im now as you know e shuts isself up and never opens the door to a soul only you dont know why and we does the only one as can ever get at im is is mother well its a confounded funny coincidence he said accenting the penultimate its a very unusual piece of good luck but youre is mother  when first i saw er picture said the man bill shaking his head in a ruminant manner when i first saw it i saidold shorter those were my exact wordsold shorter  what do you mean you wild creatures i gasped what am i to do  thats easy said your oldness said the man with the revolver goodhumouredly youve got to put on those clothes and he pointed to a pokebonnet and a heap of female clothes in the corner of the room  i will not dwell mr swinburne upon the details of what followed i had no choice i could not fight five men to say nothing of a loaded pistol in five minutes sir the vicar of chuntsey was dressed as an old womanas somebody elses mother if you pleaseand was dragged out of the house to take part in a crime  it was already late in the afternoon and the nights of winter were closing in fast on a dark road in a blowing wind we set out towards the lonely house of colonel hawker perhaps the queerest cortege that ever straggled up that or any other road to every human eye in every external we were six very respectable old ladies of small means in black dresses and refined but antiquated bonnets and we were really five criminals and a clergyman  i will cut a long story short my brain was whirling like a windmill as i walked trying to think of some manner of escape to cry out so long as we were far from houses would be suicidal for it would be easy for the ruffians to knife me or to gag me and fling me into a ditch on the other hand to attempt to stop strangers and explain the situation was impossible because of the frantic folly of the situation itself long before i had persuaded the chance postman or carrier of so absurd a story my companions would certainly have got off themselves and in all probability would have carried me off as a friend of theirs who had the misfortune to be mad or drunk the last thought however was an inspiration though a very terrible one had it come to this that the vicar of chuntsey must pretend to be mad or drunk it had come to this  i walked along with the rest up the deserted road imitating and keeping pace as far as i could with their rapid and yet ladylike step until at length i saw a lamppost and a policeman standing under it i had made up my mind until we reached them we were all equally demure and silent and swift when we reached them i suddenly flung myself against the railings and roared out hooray hooray hooray rule britannia get your air cut hoopla boo it was a condition of no little novelty for a man in my position  the constable instantly flashed his lantern on me or the draggled drunken old woman that was my travesty now then mum he began gruffly  come along quiet or ill eat your heart cried sam in my ear hoarsely stop or ill flay you it was frightful to hear the words and see the neatly shawled old spinster who whispered them  i yelled and yelledi was in for it now i screamed comic refrains that vulgar young men had sung to my regret at our village concerts i rolled to and fro like a ninepin about to fall  if you cant get your friend on quiet ladies said the policeman i shall have to take er up drunk and disorderly she is right enough  i redoubled my efforts i had not been brought up to this sort of thing but i believe i eclipsed myself words that i did not know i had ever heard of seemed to come pouring out of my open mouth  when we get you past whispered bill youll howl louder youll howl louder when were burning your feet off  i screamed in my terror those awful songs of joy in all the nightmares that men have ever dreamed there has never been anything so blighting and horrible as the faces of those five men looking out of their pokebonnets the figures of district visitors with the faces of devils i cannot think there is anything so heartbreaking in hell  for a sickening instant i thought that the bustle of my companions and the perfect respectability of all our dresses would overcome the policeman and induce him to let us pass he wavered so far as one can describe anything so solid as a policeman as wavering i lurched suddenly forward and ran my head into his chest calling out if i remember correctly oh crikey blimey bill it was at that moment that i remembered most dearly that i was the vicar of chuntsey in essex  my desperate coup saved me the policeman had me hard by the back of the neck  you come along with me he began but bill cut in with his perfect imitation of a ladys finnicking voice  oh pray constable dont make a disturbance with our poor friend we will get her quietly home she does drink too much but she is quite a ladyonly eccentric  she butted me in the stomach said the policeman briefly  eccentricities of genius said sam earnestly  pray let me take her home reiterated bill in the resumed character of miss james she wants looking after she does said the policeman but ill look after her  thats no good cried bill feverishly she wants her friends she wants a particular medicine weve got  yes assented miss mowbray with excitement no other medicine any good constable complaint quite unique  im all righ cutchy cutchy coo remarked to his eternal shame the vicar of chuntsey  look here ladies said the constable sternly i dont like the eccentricity of your friend and i dont like er songs or er ead in my stomach and now i come to think of it i dont like the looks of you ive seen many as quiet dressed as you as was wrong uns who are you  weve not our cards with us said miss mowbray with indescribable dignity nor do we see why we should be insulted by any jackinoffice who chooses to be rude to ladies when he is paid to protect them if you choose to take advantage of the weakness of our unfortunate friend no doubt you are legally entitled to take her but if you fancy you have any legal right to bully us you will find yourself in the wrong box  the truth and dignity of this staggered the policeman for a moment under cover of their advantage my five persecutors turned for an instant on me faces like faces of the damned and then swished off into the darkness when the constable first turned his lantern and his suspicions on to them i had seen the telegraphic look flash from face to face saying that only retreat was possible now  by this time i was sinking slowly to the pavement in a state of acute reflection so long as the ruffians were with me i dared not quit the role of drunkard for if i had begun to talk reasonably and explain the real case the officer would merely have thought that i was slightly recovered and would have put me in charge of my friends now however if i liked i might safely undeceive him  but i confess i did not like the chances of life are many and it may doubtless sometimes lie in the narrow path of duty for a clergyman of the church of england to pretend to be a drunken old woman but such necessities are i imagine sufficiently rare to appear to many improbable suppose the story got about that i had pretended to be drunk suppose people did not all think it was pretence  i lurched up the policeman halflifting me i went along weakly and quietly for about a hundred yards the officer evidently thought that i was too sleepy and feeble to effect an escape and so held me lightly and easily enough past one turning two turnings three turnings four turnings he trailed me with him a limp and slow and reluctant figure at the fourth turning i suddenly broke from his hand and tore down the street like a maddened stag he was unprepared he was heavy and it was dark i ran and ran and ran and in five minutes running found i was gaining in half an hour i was out in the fields under the holy and blessed stars where i tore off my accursed shawl and bonnet and buried them in clean earth  the old gentleman had finished his story and leant back in his chair both the matter and the manner of his narration had as time went on impressed me favourably he was an old duffer and pedant but behind these things he was a countrybred man and gentleman and had showed courage and a sporting instinct in the hour of desperation he had told his story with many quaint formalities of diction but also with a very convincing realism  and now i began  and now said shorter leaning forward again with something like servile energy and now mr swinburne what about that unhappy man hawker i cannot tell what those men meant or how far what they said was real but surely there is danger i cannot go to the police for reasons that you perceive among other things they wouldnt believe me what is to be done  i took out my watch it was already half past twelve  my friend basil grant i said is the best man we can go to he and i were to have gone to the same dinner tonight but he will just have come back by now have you any objection to taking a cab  not at all he replied rising politely and gathering up his absurd plaid shawl  a rattle in a hansom brought us underneath the sombre pile of workmens flats in lambeth which grant inhabited a climb up a wearisome wooden staircase brought us to his garret when i entered that wooden and scrappy interior the white gleam of basils shirtfront and the lustre of his fur coat flung on the wooden settle struck me as a contrast he was drinking a glass of wine before retiring i was right he had come back from the dinnerparty  he listened to the repetition of the story of the rev ellis shorter with the genuine simplicity and respect which he never failed to exhibit in dealing with any human being when it was over he said simply  do you know a man named captain fraser  i was so startled at this totally irrelevant reference to the worthy collector of chimpanzees with whom i ought to have dined that evening that i glanced sharply at grant the result was that i did not look at mr shorter i only heard him answer in his most nervous tone no  basil however seemed to find something very curious about his answer or his demeanour generally for he kept his big blue eyes fixed on the old clergyman and though the eyes were quite quiet they stood out more and more from his head  you are quite sure mr shorter he repeated that you dont know captain fraser  quite answered the vicar and i was certainly puzzled to find him returning so much to the timidity not to say the demoralization of his tone when he first entered my presence  basil sprang smartly to his feet  then our course is clear he said you have not even begun your investigation my dear mr shorter the first thing for us to do is to go together to see captain fraser  when asked the clergyman stammering  now said basil putting one arm in his fur coat  the old clergyman rose to his feet quaking all over  i really do not think that it is necessary he said  basil took his arm out of the fur coat threw it over the chair again and put his hands in his pockets  oh he said with emphasis ohyou dont think it necessary then and he added the words with great clearness and deliberation then mr ellis shorter i can only say that i would like to see you without your whiskers  and at these words i also rose to my feet for the great tragedy of my life had come splendid and exciting as life was in continual contact with an intellect like basils i had always the feeling that that splendour and excitement were on the borderland of sanity he lived perpetually near the vision of the reason of things which makes men lose their reason and i felt of his insanity as men feel of the death of friends with heart disease it might come anywhere in a field in a hansom cab looking at a sunset smoking a cigarette it had come now at the very moment of delivering a judgement for the salvation of a fellow creature basil grant had gone mad  your whiskers he cried advancing with blazing eyes give me your whiskers and your bald head  the old vicar naturally retreated a step or two i stepped between  sit down basil i implored youre a little excited finish your wine  whiskers he answered sternly whiskers  and with that he made a dash at the old gentleman who made a dash for the door but was intercepted and then before i knew where i was the quiet room was turned into something between a pantomime and a pandemonium by those two chairs were flung over with a crash tables were vaulted with a noise like thunder screens were smashed crockery scattered in smithereens and still basil grant bounded and bellowed after the rev ellis shorter  and now i began to perceive something else which added the last halfwitted touch to my mystification the rev ellis shorter of chuntsey in essex was by no means behaving as i had previously noticed him to behave or as considering his age and station i should have expected him to behave his power of dodging leaping and fighting would have been amazing in a lad of seventeen and in this doddering old vicar looked like a sort of farcical fairytale moreover he did not seem to be so much astonished as i had thought there was even a look of something like enjoyment in his eyes so there was in the eye of basil in fact the unintelligible truth must be told they were both laughing  at length shorter was cornered  come come mr grant he panted you cant do anything to me its quite legal and it doesnt do any one the least harm its only a social fiction a result of our complex society mr grant  i dont blame you my man said basil coolly but i want your whiskers and your bald head do they belong to captain fraser  no no said mr shorter laughing we provide them ourselves they dont belong to captain fraser  what the deuce does all this mean i almost screamed are you all in an infernal nightmare why should mr shorters bald head belong to captain fraser how could it what the deuce has captain fraser to do with the affair what is the matter with him you dined with him basil  no said grant i didnt  didnt you go to mrs thorntons dinnerparty i asked staring why not  well said basil with a slow and singular smile the fact is i was detained by a visitor i have him as a point of fact in my bedroom  in your bedroom i repeated but my imagination had reached that point when he might have said in his coal scuttle or his waistcoat pocket  grant stepped to the door of an inner room flung it open and walked in then he came out again with the last of the bodily wonders of that wild night he introduced into the sittingroom in an apologetic manner and by the nape of the neck a limp clergyman with a bald head white whiskers and a plaid shawl  sit down gentlemen cried grant striking his hands heartily sit down all of you and have a glass of wine as you say there is no harm in it and if captain fraser had simply dropped me a hint i could have saved him from dropping a good sum of money not that you would have liked that eh  the two duplicate clergymen who were sipping their burgundy with two duplicate grins laughed heartily at this and one of them carelessly pulled off his whiskers and laid them on the table  basil i said if you are my friend save me what is all this  he laughed again  only another addition cherub to your collection of queer trades these two gentlemen whose health i have now the pleasure of drinking are professional detainers  and what on earths that i asked  its really very simple mr swinburne began he who had once been the rev ellis shorter of chuntsey in essex and it gave me a shock indescribable to hear out of that pompous and familiar form come no longer its own pompous and familiar voice but the brisk sharp tones of a young city man it is really nothing very important we are paid by our clients to detain in conversation on some harmless pretext people whom they want out of the way for a few hours and captain fraser and with that he hesitated and smiled  basil smiled also he intervened  the fact is that captain fraser who is one of my best friends wanted us both out of the way very much he is sailing tonight for east africa and the lady with whom we were all to have dined iserwhat is i believe described as the romance of his life he wanted that two hours with her and employed these two reverend gentlemen to detain us at our houses so as to let him have the field to himself  and of course said the late mr shorter apologetically to me as i had to keep a gentleman at home from keeping an appointment with a lady i had to come with something rather hot and strongrather urgent it wouldnt have done to be tame  oh i said i acquit you of tameness  thank you sir said the man respectfully always very grateful for any recommendation sir  the other man idly pushed back his artificial bald head revealing close red hair and spoke dreamily perhaps under the influence of basils admirable burgundy  its wonderful how common its getting gentlemen our office is busy from morning till night ive no doubt youve often knocked up against us before you just take notice when an old bachelor goes on boring you with hunting stories when youre burning to be introduced to somebody hes from our bureau when a lady calls on parish work and stops hours just when you wanted to go to the robinsons shes from our bureau the robinson hand sir may be darkly seen  there is one thing i dont understand i said why you are both vicars  a shade crossed the brow of the temporary incumbent of chuntsey in essex  that may have been a mistake sir he said but it was not our fault it was all the munificence of captain fraser he requested that the highest price and talent on our tariff should be employed to detain you gentlemen now the highest payment in our office goes to those who impersonate vicars as being the most respectable and more of a strain we are paid five guineas a visit we have had the good fortune to satisfy the firm with our work and we are now permanently vicars before that we had two years as colonels the next in our scale colonels are four guineas    chapter 4 the singular speculation of the houseagent  lieutenant drummond keith was a man about whom conversation always burst like a thunderstorm the moment he left the room this arose from many separate touches about him he was a light loose person who wore light loose clothes generally white as if he were in the tropics he was lean and graceful like a panther and he had restless black eyes  he was very impecunious he had one of the habits of the poor in a degree so exaggerated as immeasurably to eclipse the most miserable of the unemployed i mean the habit of continual change of lodgings there are inland tracts of london where in the very heart of artificial civilization humanity has almost become nomadic once more but in that restless interior there was no ragged tramp so restless as the elegant officer in the loose white clothes he had shot a great many things in his time to judge from his conversation from partridges to elephants but his slangier acquaintances were of opinion that the moon had been not unfrequently amid the victims of his victorious rifle the phrase is a fine one and suggests a mystic elvish nocturnal hunting  he carried from house to house and from parish to parish a kit which consisted practically of five articles two oddlooking largebladed spears tied together the weapons i suppose of some savage tribe a green umbrella a huge and tattered copy of the pickwick papers a big game rifle and a large sealed jar of some unholy oriental wine these always went into every new lodging even for one night and they went in quite undisguised tied up in wisps of string or straw to the delight of the poetic gutter boys in the little grey streets  i had forgotten to mention that he always carried also his old regimental sword but this raised another odd question about him slim and active as he was he was no longer very young his hair indeed was quite grey though his rather wild almost italian moustache retained its blackness and his face was careworn under its almost italian gaiety to find a middleaged man who has left the army at the primitive rank of lieutenant is unusual and not necessarily encouraging with the more cautious and solid this fact like his endless flitting did the mysterious gentleman no good  lastly he was a man who told the kind of adventures which win a man admiration but not respect they came out of queer places where a good man would scarcely find himself out of opium dens and gambling hells they had the heat of the thieves kitchens or smelled of a strange smoke from cannibal incantations these are the kind of stories which discredit a person almost equally whether they are believed or no if keiths tales were false he was a liar if they were true he had had at any rate every opportunity of being a scamp  he had just left the room in which i sat with basil grant and his brother rupert the voluble amateur detective and as i say was invariably the case we were all talking about him rupert grant was a clever young fellow but he had that tendency which youth and cleverness when sharply combined so often produce a somewhat extravagant scepticism he saw doubt and guilt everywhere and it was meat and drink to him i had often got irritated with this boyish incredulity of his but on this particular occasion i am bound to say that i thought him so obviously right that i was astounded at basils opposing him however banteringly  i could swallow a good deal being naturally of a simple turn but i could not swallow lieutenant keiths autobiography  you dont seriously mean basil i said that you think that that fellow really did go as a stowaway with nansen and pretend to be the mad mullah and  he has one fault said basil thoughtfully or virtue as you may happen to regard it he tells the truth in too exact and bald a style he is too veracious  oh if you are going to be paradoxical said rupert contemptuously be a bit funnier than that say for instance that he has lived all his life in one ancestral manor  no hes extremely fond of change of scene replied basil dispassionately and of living in odd places that doesnt prevent his chief trait being verbal exactitude what you people dont understand is that telling a thing crudely and coarsely as it happened makes it sound frightfully strange the sort of things keith recounts are not the sort of things that a man would make up to cover himself with honour they are too absurd but they are the sort of things that a man would do if he were sufficiently filled with the soul of skylarking  so far from paradox said his brother with something rather like a sneer you seem to be going in for journalese proverbs do you believe that truth is stranger than fiction  truth must of necessity be stranger than fiction said basil placidly for fiction is the creation of the human mind and therefore is congenial to it  well your lieutenants truth is stranger if it is truth than anything i ever heard of said rupert relapsing into flippancy do you on your soul believe in all that about the shark and the camera  i believe keiths words answered the other he is an honest man  i should like to question a regiment of his landladies said rupert cynically  i must say i think you can hardly regard him as unimpeachable merely in himself i said mildly his mode of life  before i could complete the sentence the door was flung open and drummond keith appeared again on the threshold his white panama on his head  i say grant he said knocking off his cigarette ash against the door ive got no money in the world till next april could you lend me a hundred pounds theres a good chap  rupert and i looked at each other in an ironical silence basil who was sitting by his desk swung the chair round idly on its screw and picked up a quillpen  shall i cross it he asked opening a chequebook  really began rupert with a rather nervous loudness since lieutenant keith has seen fit to make this suggestion to basil before his family i  here you are ugly said basil fluttering a cheque in the direction of the quite nonchalant officer are you in a hurry  yes replied keith in a rather abrupt way as a matter of fact i want it now i want to see myerbusiness man  rupert was eyeing him sarcastically and i could see that it was on the tip of his tongue to say inquiringly receiver of stolen goods perhaps what he did say was  a business man thats rather a general description lieutenant keith  keith looked at him sharply and then said with something rather like illtemper  hes a thingummybob a houseagent say im going to see him  oh youre going to see a houseagent are you said rupert grant grimly do you know mr keith i think i should very much like to go with you  basil shook with his soundless laughter lieutenant keith started a little his brow blackened sharply  i beg your pardon he said what did you say  ruperts face had been growing from stage to stage of ferocious irony and he answered  i was saying that i wondered whether you would mind our strolling along with you to this houseagents  the visitor swung his stick with a sudden whirling violence  oh in gods name come to my houseagents come to my bedroom look under my bed examine my dustbin come along and with a furious energy which took away our breath he banged his way out of the room  rupert grant his restless blue eyes dancing with his detective excitement soon shouldered alongside him talking to him with that transparent camaraderie which he imagined to be appropriate from the disguised policeman to the disguised criminal his interpretation was certainly corroborated by one particular detail the unmistakable unrest annoyance and nervousness of the man with whom he walked basil and i tramped behind and it was not necessary for us to tell each other that we had both noticed this  lieutenant drummond keith led us through very extraordinary and unpromising neighbourhoods in the search for his remarkable houseagent neither of the brothers grant failed to notice this fact as the streets grew closer and more crooked and the roofs lower and the gutters grosser with mud a darker curiosity deepened on the brows of basil and the figure of rupert seen from behind seemed to fill the street with a gigantic swagger of success at length at the end of the fourth or fifth lean grey street in that sterile district we came suddenly to a halt the mysterious lieutenant looking once more about him with a sort of sulky desperation above a row of shutters and a door all indescribably dingy in appearance and in size scarce sufficient even for a penny toyshop ran the inscription p montmorency houseagent  this is the office of which i spoke said keith in a cutting voice will you wait here a moment or does your astonishing tenderness about my welfare lead you to wish to overhear everything i have to say to my business adviser  ruperts face was white and shaking with excitement nothing on earth would have induced him now to have abandoned his prey  if you will excuse me he said clenching his hands behind his back i think i should feel myself justified in  oh come along in exploded the lieutenant he made the same gesture of savage surrender and he slammed into the office the rest of us at his heels  p montmorency houseagent was a solitary old gentleman sitting behind a bare brown counter he had an egglike head froglike jaws and a grey hairy fringe of aureole round the lower part of his face the whole combined with a reddish aquiline nose he wore a shabby black frockcoat a sort of semiclerical tie worn at a very unclerical angle and looked generally speaking about as unlike a houseagent as anything could look short of something like a sandwich man or a scotch highlander  we stood inside the room for fully forty seconds and the odd old gentleman did not look at us neither to tell the truth odd as he was did we look at him our eyes were fixed where his were fixed upon something that was crawling about on the counter in front of him it was a ferret  the silence was broken by rupert grant he spoke in that sweet and steely voice which he reserved for great occasions and practised for hours together in his bedroom he said  mr montmorency i think  the old gentleman started lifted his eyes with a bland bewilderment picked up the ferret by the neck stuffed it alive into his trousers pocket smiled apologetically and said  sir  you are a houseagent are you not asked rupert  to the delight of that criminal investigator mr montmorencys eyes wandered unquietly towards lieutenant keith the only man present that he knew  a houseagent cried rupert again bringing out the word as if it were burglar  yes oh yes said the man with a quavering and almost coquettish smile i am a houseagent oh yes  well i think said rupert with a sardonic sleekness that lieutenant keith wants to speak to you we have come in by his request  lieutenant keith was lowering gloomily and now he spoke  i have come mr montmorency about that house of mine  yes sir said montmorency spreading his fingers on the flat counter its all ready sir ive attended to all your suggestions erabout the br  right cried keith cutting the word short with the startling neatness of a gunshot we neednt bother about all that if youve done what i told you all right  and he turned sharply towards the door  mr montmorency houseagent presented a picture of pathos after stammering a moment he said excuse me mr keith there was another matter about which i wasnt quite sure i tried to get all the heating apparatus possible under the circumstances  but in winter at that elevation  cant expect much eh said the lieutenant cutting in with the same sudden skill no of course not thats all right montmorency there cant be any more difficulties and he put his hand on the handle of the door  i think said rupert grant with a satanic suavity that mr montmorency has something further to say to you lieutenant  only said the houseagent in desperation what about the birds  i beg your pardon said rupert in a general blank  what about the birds said the houseagent doggedly  basil who had remained throughout the proceedings in a state of napoleonic calm which might be more accurately described as a state of napoleonic stupidity suddenly lifted his leonine head  before you go lieutenant keith he said come now really what about the birds  ill take care of them said lieutenant keith still with his long back turned to us they shant suffer  thank you sir thank you cried the incomprehensible houseagent with an air of ecstasy youll excuse my concern sir you know im wild on wild animals im as wild as any of them on that thank you sir but theres another thing  the lieutenant with his back turned to us exploded with an indescribable laugh and swung round to face us it was a laugh the purport of which was direct and essential and yet which one cannot exactly express as near as it said anything verbally speaking it said well if you must spoil it you must but you dont know what youre spoiling  there is another thing continued mr montmorency weakly of course if you dont want to be visited youll paint the house green but  green shouted keith green let it be green or nothing i wont have a house of another colour green and before we could realize anything the door had banged between us and the street  rupert grant seemed to take a little time to collect himself but he spoke before the echoes of the door died away  your client lieutenant keith appears somewhat excited he said what is the matter with him is he unwell  oh i should think not said mr montmorency in some confusion the negotiations have been somewhat difficultthe house is rather  green said rupert calmly that appears to be a very important point it must be rather green may i ask you mr montmorency before i rejoin my companion outside whether in your business it is usual to ask for houses by their colour do clients write to a houseagent asking for a pink house or a blue house or to take another instance for a green house  only said montmorency trembling only to be inconspicuous  rupert had his ruthless smile can you tell me any place on earth in which a green house would be inconspicuous  the houseagent was fidgeting nervously in his pocket slowly drawing out a couple of lizards and leaving them to run on the counter he said  no i cant  you cant suggest an explanation  no said mr montmorency rising slowly and yet in such a way as to suggest a sudden situation i cant and may i as a busy man be excused if i ask you gentlemen if you have any demand to make of me in connection with my business what kind of house would you desire me to get for you sir  he opened his blank blue eyes on rupert who seemed for the second staggered then he recovered himself with perfect common sense and answered  i am sorry mr montmorency the fascination of your remarks has unduly delayed us from joining our friend outside pray excuse my apparent impertinence  not at all sir said the houseagent taking a south american spider idly from his waistcoat pocket and letting it climb up the slope of his desk not at all sir i hope you will favour me again  rupert grant dashed out of the office in a gust of anger anxious to face lieutenant keith he was gone the dull starlit street was deserted  what do you say now cried rupert to his brother his brother said nothing now  we all three strode down the street in silence rupert feverish myself dazed basil to all appearance merely dull we walked through grey street after grey street turning corners traversing squares scarcely meeting anyone except occasional drunken knots of two or three  in one small street however the knots of two or three began abruptly to thicken into knots of five or six and then into great groups and then into a crowd the crowd was stirring very slightly but anyone with a knowledge of the eternal populace knows that if the outside rim of a crowd stirs ever so slightly it means that there is madness in the heart and core of the mob it soon became evident that something really important had happened in the centre of this excitement we wormed our way to the front with the cunning which is known only to cockneys and once there we soon learned the nature of the difficulty there had been a brawl concerned with some six men and one of them lay almost dead on the stones of the street of the other four all interesting matters were as far as we were concerned swallowed up in one stupendous fact one of the four survivors of the brutal and perhaps fatal scuffle was the immaculate lieutenant keith his clothes torn to ribbons his eyes blazing blood on his knuckles one other thing however pointed at him in a worse manner a short sword or very long knife had been drawn out of his elegant walkingstick and lay in front of him upon the stones it did not however appear to be bloody  the police had already pushed into the centre with their ponderous omnipotence and even as they did so rupert grant sprang forward with his incontrollable and intolerable secret  that is the man constable he shouted pointing at the battered lieutenant he is a suspicious character he did the murder  theres been no murder done sir said the policeman with his automatic civility the poor mans only hurt i shall only be able to take the names and addresses of the men in the scuffle and have a good eye kept on them  have a good eye kept on that one said rupert pale to the lips and pointing to the ragged keith  all right sir said the policeman unemotionally and went the round of the people present collecting the addresses when he had completed his task the dusk had fallen and most of the people not immediately connected with the examination had gone away he still found however one eagerfaced stranger lingering on the outskirts of the affair it was rupert grant  constable he said i have a very particular reason for asking you a question would you mind telling me whether that military fellow who dropped his swordstick in the row gave you an address or not  yes sir said the policeman after a reflective pause yes he gave me his address  my name is rupert grant said that individual with some pomp i have assisted the police on more than one occasion i wonder whether you would tell me as a special favour what address  the constable looked at him  yes he said slowly if you like his address is the elms buxton common near purley surrey  thank you said rupert and ran home through the gathering night as fast as his legs could carry him repeating the address to himself  rupert grant generally came down late in a rather lordly way to breakfast he contrived i dont know how to achieve always the attitude of the indulged younger brother next morning however when basil and i came down we found him ready and restless  well he said sharply to his brother almost before we sat down to the meal what do you think of your drummond keith now  what do i think of him inquired basil slowly i dont think anything of him  im glad to hear it said rupert buttering his toast with an energy that was somewhat exultant i thought youd come round to my view but i own i was startled at your not seeing it from the beginning the man is a translucent liar and knave  i think said basil in the same heavy monotone as before that i did not make myself clear when i said that i thought nothing of him i meant grammatically what i said i meant that i did not think about him that he did not occupy my mind you however seem to me to think a lot of him since you think him a knave i should say he was glaringly good myself  i sometimes think you talk paradox for its own sake said rupert breaking an egg with unnecessary sharpness what the deuce is the sense of it heres a man whose original position was by our common agreement dubious hes a wanderer a teller of tall tales a man who doesnt conceal his acquaintance with all the blackest and bloodiest scenes on earth we take the trouble to follow him to one of his appointments and if ever two human beings were plotting together and lying to every one else he and that impossible houseagent were doing it we followed him home and the very same night he is in the thick of a fatal or nearly fatal brawl in which he is the only man armed really if this is being glaringly good i must confess that the glare does not dazzle me  basil was quite unmoved i admit his moral goodness is of a certain kind a quaint perhaps a casual kind he is very fond of change and experiment but all the points you so ingeniously make against him are mere coincidence or special pleading its true he didnt want to talk about his house business in front of us no man would its true that he carries a swordstick any man might its true he drew it in the shock of a street fight any man would but theres nothing really dubious in all this theres nothing to confirm  as he spoke a knock came at the door  if you please sir said the landlady with an alarmed air theres a policeman wants to see you  show him in said basil amid the blank silence  the heavy handsome constable who appeared at the door spoke almost as soon as he appeared there  i think one of you gentlemen he said curtly but respectfully was present at the affair in copper street last night and drew my attention very strongly to a particular man  rupert half rose from his chair with eyes like diamonds but the constable went on calmly referring to a paper  a young man with grey hair had light grey clothes very good but torn in the struggle gave his name as drummond keith  this is amusing said basil laughing i was in the very act of clearing that poor officers character of rather fanciful aspersions what about him  well sir said the constable i took all the mens addresses and had them all watched it wasnt serious enough to do more than that all the other addresses are all right but this man keith gave a false address the place doesnt exist  the breakfast table was nearly flung over as rupert sprang up slapping both his thighs  well by all thats good he cried this is a sign from heaven  its certainly very extraordinary said basil quietly with knitted brows its odd the fellow should have given a false address considering he was perfectly innocent in the  oh you jolly old early christian duffer cried rupert in a sort of rapture i dont wonder you couldnt be a judge you think every one as good as yourself isnt the thing plain enough now a doubtful acquaintance rowdy stories a most suspicious conversation mean streets a concealed knife a man nearly killed and finally a false address thats what we call glaring goodness  its certainly very extraordinary repeated basil and he strolled moodily about the room then he said you are quite sure constable that theres no mistake you got the address right and the police have really gone to it and found it was a fraud  it was very simple sir said the policeman chuckling the place he named was a wellknown common quite near london and our people were down there this morning before any of you were awake and theres no such house in fact there are hardly any houses at all though it is so near london its a blank moor with hardly five trees on it to say nothing of christians oh no sir the address was a fraud right enough he was a clever rascal and chose one of those scraps of lost england that people know nothing about nobody could say offhand that there was not a particular house dropped somewhere about the heath but as a fact there isnt  basils face during this sensible speech had been growing darker and darker with a sort of desperate sagacity he was cornered almost for the first time since i had known him and to tell the truth i rather wondered at the almost childish obstinacy which kept him so close to his original prejudice in favour of the wildly questionable lieutenant at length he said  you really searched the common and the address was really not known in the districtby the way what was the address  the constable selected one of his slips of paper and consulted it but before he could speak rupert grant who was leaning in the window in a perfect posture of the quiet and triumphant detective struck in with the sharp and suave voice he loved so much to use  why i can tell you that basil he said graciously as he idly plucked leaves from a plant in the window i took the precaution to get this mans address from the constable last night  and what was it asked his brother gruffly  the constable will correct me if i am wrong said rupert looking sweetly at the ceiling it was the elms buxton common near purley surrey  right sir said the policeman laughing and folding up his papers  there was a silence and the blue eyes of basil looked blindly for a few seconds into the void then his head fell back in his chair so suddenly that i started up thinking him ill but before i could move further his lips had flown apart i can use no other phrase and a peal of gigantic laughter struck and shook the ceilinglaughter that shook the laughter laughter redoubled laughter incurable laughter that could not stop  two whole minutes afterwards it was still unended basil was ill with laughter but still he laughed the rest of us were by this time ill almost with terror  excuse me said the insane creature getting at last to his feet i am awfully sorry it is horribly rude and stupid too and also unpractical because we have not much time to lose if were to get down to that place the train service is confoundedly bad as i happen to know its quite out of proportion to the comparatively small distance  get down to that place i repeated blankly get down to what place  i have forgotten its name said basil vaguely putting his hands in his pockets as he rose something common near purley has any one got a timetable  you dont seriously mean cried rupert who had been staring in a sort of confusion of emotions you dont mean that you want to go to buxton common do you you cant mean that  why shouldnt i go to buxton common asked basil smiling  why should you said his brother catching hold again restlessly of the plant in the window and staring at the speaker  to find our friend the lieutenant of course said basil grant i thought you wanted to find him  rupert broke a branch brutally from the plant and flung it impatiently on the floor and in order to find him he said you suggest the admirable expedient of going to the only place on the habitable earth where we know he cant be  the constable and i could not avoid breaking into a kind of assenting laugh and rupert who had family eloquence was encouraged to go on with a reiterated gesture  he may be in buckingham palace he may be sitting astride the cross of st pauls he may be in jail which i think most likely he may be in the great wheel he may be in my pantry he may be in your store cupboard but out of all the innumerable points of space there is only one where he has just been systematically looked for and where we know that he is not to be foundand that if i understand you rightly is where you want us to go  exactly said basil calmly getting into his greatcoat i thought you might care to accompany me if not of course make yourselves jolly here till i come back  it is our nature always to follow vanishing things and value them if they really show a resolution to depart we all followed basil and i cannot say why except that he was a vanishing thing that he vanished decisively with his greatcoat and his stick rupert ran after him with a considerable flurry of rationality  my dear chap he cried do you really mean that you see any good in going down to this ridiculous scrub where there is nothing but beaten tracks and a few twisted trees simply because it was the first place that came into a rowdy lieutenants head when he wanted to give a lying reference in a scrape  yes said basil taking out his watch and whats worse weve lost the train  he paused a moment and then added as a matter of fact i think we may just as well go down later in the day i have some writing to do and i think you told me rupert that you thought of going to the dulwich gallery i was rather too impetuous very likely he wouldnt be in but if we get down by the 515 which gets to purley about 6 i expect we shall just catch him  catch him cried his brother in a kind of final anger i wish we could where the deuce shall we catch him now  i keep forgetting the name of the common said basil as he buttoned up his coat the elmswhat is it buxton common near purley thats where we shall find him  but there is no such place groaned rupert but he followed his brother downstairs  we all followed him we snatched our hats from the hatstand and our sticks from the umbrellastand and why we followed him we did not and do not know but we always followed him whatever was the meaning of the fact whatever was the nature of his mastery and the strange thing was that we followed him the more completely the more nonsensical appeared the thing which he said at bottom i believe if he had risen from our breakfast table and said i am going to find the holy pig with ten tails we should have followed him to the end of the world  i dont know whether this mystical feeling of mine about basil on this occasion has got any of the dark and cloudy colour so to speak of the strange journey that we made the same evening it was already very dense twilight when we struck southward from purley suburbs and things on the london border may be in most cases commonplace and comfortable but if ever by any chance they really are empty solitudes they are to the human spirit more desolate and dehumanized than any yorkshire moors or highland hills because the suddenness with which the traveller drops into that silence has something about it as of evil elfland it seems to be one of the ragged suburbs of the cosmos halfforgotten by godsuch a place was buxton common near purley  there was certainly a sort of grey futility in the landscape itself but it was enormously increased by the sense of grey futility in our expedition the tracts of grey turf looked useless the occasional windstricken trees looked useless but we the human beings more useless than the hopeless turf or the idle trees we were maniacs akin to the foolish landscape for we were come to chase the wild goose which has led men and left men in bogs from the beginning we were three dazed men under the captaincy of a madman going to look for a man whom we knew was not there in a house that had no existence a livid sunset seemed to look at us with a sort of sickly smile before it died  basil went on in front with his coat collar turned up looking in the gloom rather like a grotesque napoleon we crossed swell after swell of the windy common in increasing darkness and entire silence suddenly basil stopped and turned to us his hands in his pockets through the dusk i could just detect that he wore a broad grin as of comfortable success  well he cried taking his heavily gloved hands out of his pockets and slapping them together here we are at last  the wind swirled sadly over the homeless heath two desolate elms rocked above us in the sky like shapeless clouds of grey there was not a sign of man or beast to the sullen circle of the horizon and in the midst of that wilderness basil grant stood rubbing his hands with the air of an innkeeper standing at an open door  how jolly it is he cried to get back to civilization that notion that civilization isnt poetical is a civilised delusion wait till youve really lost yourself in nature among the devilish woodlands and the cruel flowers then youll know that theres no star like the red star of man that he lights on his hearthstone no river like the red river of man the good red wine which you mr rupert grant if i have any knowledge of you will be drinking in two or three minutes in enormous quantities  rupert and i exchanged glances of fear basil went on heartily as the wind died in the dreary trees  youll find our host a much more simple kind of fellow in his own house i did when i visited him when he lived in the cabin at yarmouth and again in the loft at the city warehouse hes really a very good fellow but his greatest virtue remains what i said originally  what do you mean i asked finding his speech straying towards a sort of sanity what is his greatest virtue  his greatest virtue replied basil is that he always tells the literal truth  well really cried rupert stamping about between cold and anger and slapping himself like a cabman he doesnt seem to have been very literal or truthful in this case nor you either why the deuce may i ask have you brought us out to this infernal place  he was too truthful i confess said basil leaning against the tree too hardly veracious too severely accurate he should have indulged in a little more suggestiveness and legitimate romance but come its time we went in we shall be late for dinner  rupert whispered to me with a white face  is it a hallucination do you think does he really fancy he sees a house  i suppose so i said then i added aloud in what was meant to be a cheery and sensible voice but which sounded in my ears almost as strange as the wind  come come basil my dear fellow where do you want us to go  why up here cried basil and with a bound and a swing he was above our heads swarming up the grey column of the colossal tree  come up all of you he shouted out of the darkness with the voice of a schoolboy come up youll be late for dinner  the two great elms stood so close together that there was scarcely a yard anywhere and in some places not more than a foot between them thus occasional branches and even bosses and boles formed a series of footholds that almost amounted to a rude natural ladder they must i supposed have been some sport of growth siamese twins of vegetation  why we did it i cannot think perhaps as i have said the mystery of the waste and dark had brought out and made primary something wholly mystical in basils supremacy but we only felt that there was a giants staircase going somewhere perhaps to the stars and the victorious voice above called to us out of heaven we hoisted ourselves up after him  halfway up some cold tongue of the night air struck and sobered me suddenly the hypnotism of the madman above fell from me and i saw the whole map of our silly actions as clearly as if it were printed i saw three modern men in black coats who had begun with a perfectly sensible suspicion of a doubtful adventurer and who had ended god knows how halfway up a naked tree on a naked moorland far from that adventurer and all his works that adventurer who was at that moment in all probability laughing at us in some dirty soho restaurant he had plenty to laugh at us about and no doubt he was laughing his loudest but when i thought what his laughter would be if he knew where we were at that moment i nearly let go of the tree and fell  swinburne said rupert suddenly from above what are we doing lets get down again and by the mere sound of his voice i knew that he too felt the shock of wakening to reality  we cant leave poor basil i said cant you call to him or get hold of him by the leg  hes too far ahead answered rupert hes nearly at the top of the beastly thing looking for lieutenant keith in the rooks nests i suppose  we were ourselves by this time far on our frantic vertical journey the mighty trunks were beginning to sway and shake slightly in the wind then i looked down and saw something which made me feel that we were far from the world in a sense and to a degree that i cannot easily describe i saw that the almost straight lines of the tall elm trees diminished a little in perspective as they fell i was used to seeing parallel lines taper towards the sky but to see them taper towards the earth made me feel lost in space like a falling star  can nothing be done to stop basil i called out  no answered my fellow climber hes too far up he must get to the top and when he finds nothing but wind and leaves he may go sane again hark at him above there you can just hear him talking to himself  perhaps hes talking to us i said  no said rupert hed shout if he was ive never known him to talk to himself before im afraid he really is bad tonight its a known sign of the brain going  yes i said sadly and listened basils voice certainly was sounding above us and not by any means in the rich and riotous tones in which he had hailed us before he was speaking quietly and laughing every now and then up there among the leaves and stars  after a silence mingled with this murmur rupert grant suddenly said my god with a violent voice  whats the matterare you hurt i cried alarmed  no listen to basil said the other in a very strange voice hes not talking to himself  then he is talking to us i cried  no said rupert simply hes talking to somebody else  great branches of the elm loaded with leaves swung about us in a sudden burst of wind but when it died down i could still hear the conversational voice above i could hear two voices  suddenly from aloft came basils boisterous hailing voice as before come up you fellows heres lieutenant keith  and a second afterwards came the halfamerican voice we had heard in our chambers more than once it called out  happy to see you gentlemen pray come in  out of a hole in an enormous dark eggshaped thing pendent in the branches like a wasps nest was protruding the pale face and fierce moustache of the lieutenant his teeth shining with that slightly southern air that belonged to him  somehow or other stunned and speechless we lifted ourselves heavily into the opening we fell into the full glow of a lamplit cushioned tiny room with a circular wall lined with books a circular table and a circular seat around it at this table sat three people one was basil who in the instant after alighting there had fallen into an attitude of marmoreal ease as if he had been there from boyhood he was smoking a cigar with a slow pleasure the second was lieutenant drummond keith who looked happy also but feverish and doubtful compared with his granite guest the third was the little baldheaded houseagent with the wild whiskers who called himself montmorency the spears the green umbrella and the cavalry sword hung in parallels on the wall the sealed jar of strange wine was on the mantelpiece the enormous rifle in the corner in the middle of the table was a magnum of champagne glasses were already set for us  the wind of the night roared far below us like an ocean at the foot of a lighthouse the room stirred slightly as a cabin might in a mild sea  our glasses were filled and we still sat there dazed and dumb then basil spoke  you seem still a little doubtful rupert surely there is no further question about the cold veracity of our injured host  i dont quite grasp it all said rupert blinking still in the sudden glare lieutenant keith said his address was  its really quite right sir said keith with an open smile the bobby asked me where i lived and i said quite truthfully that i lived in the elms on buxton common near purley so i do this gentleman mr montmorency whom i think you have met before is an agent for houses of this kind he has a special line in arboreal villas its being kept rather quiet at present because the people who want these houses dont want them to get too common but its just the sort of thing a fellow like myself racketing about in all sorts of queer corners of london naturally knocks up against  are you really an agent for arboreal villas asked rupert eagerly recovering his ease with the romance of reality  mr montmorency in his embarrassment fingered one of his pockets and nervously pulled out a snake which crawled about the table  wwell yes sir he said the fact wasermy people wanted me very much to go into the houseagency business but i never cared myself for anything but natural history and botany and things like that my poor parents have been dead some years now butnaturally i like to respect their wishes and i thought somehow that an arboreal villa agency was a sort ofof compromise between being a botanist and being a houseagent  rupert could not help laughing do you have much custom he asked  nnot much replied mr montmorency and then he glanced at keith who was i am convinced his only client but what there isvery select  my dear friends said basil puffing his cigar always remember two facts the first is that though when you are guessing about any one who is sane the sanest thing is the most likely when you are guessing about any one who is like our host insane the maddest thing is the most likely the second is to remember that very plain literal fact always seems fantastic if keith had taken a little brick box of a house in clapham with nothing but railings in front of it and had written the elms over it you wouldnt have thought there was anything fantastic about that simply because it was a great blaring swaggering lie you would have believed it  drink your wine gentlemen said keith laughing for this confounded wind will upset it  we drank and as we did so although the hanging house by a cunning mechanism swung only slightly we knew that the great head of the elm tree swayed in the sky like a stricken thistle    chapter 5 the noticeable conduct of professor chadd  basil grant had comparatively few friends besides myself yet he was the reverse of an unsociable man he would talk to any one anywhere and talk not only well but with perfectly genuine concern and enthusiasm for that persons affairs he went through the world as it were as if he were always on the top of an omnibus or waiting for a train most of these chance acquaintances of course vanished into darkness out of his life a few here and there got hooked on to him so to speak and became his lifelong intimates but there was an accidental look about all of them as if they were windfalls samples taken at random goods fallen from a goods train or presents fished out of a branpie one would be let us say a veterinary surgeon with the appearance of a jockey another a mild prebendary with a white beard and vague views another a young captain in the lancers seemingly exactly like other captains in the lancers another a small dentist from fulham in all reasonable certainty precisely like every other dentist from fulham major brown small dry and dapper was one of these basil had made his acquaintance over a discussion in a hotel cloakroom about the right hat a discussion which reduced the little major almost to a kind of masculine hysterics the compound of the selfishness of an old bachelor and the scrupulosity of an old maid they had gone home in a cab together and then dined with each other twice a week until they died i myself was another i had met grant while he was still a judge on the balcony of the national liberal club and exchanged a few words about the weather then we had talked for about an hour about politics and god for men always talk about the most important things to total strangers it is because in the total stranger we perceive man himself the image of god is not disguised by resemblances to an uncle or doubts of the wisdom of a moustache  one of the most interesting of basils motley group of acquaintances was professor chadd he was known to the ethnological world which is a very interesting world but a long way off this one as the second greatest if not the greatest authority on the relations of savages to language he was known to the neighbourhood of hart street bloomsbury as a bearded man with a bald head spectacles and a patient face the face of an unaccountable nonconformist who had forgotten how to be angry he went to and fro between the british museum and a selection of blameless teashops with an armful of books and a poor but honest umbrella he was never seen without the books and the umbrella and was supposed by the lighter wits of the persian ms room to go to bed with them in his little brick villa in the neighbourhood of shepherds bush there he lived with three sisters ladies of solid goodness but sinister demeanour his life was happy as are almost all the lives of methodical students but one would not have called it exhilarating his only hours of exhilaration occurred when his friend basil grant came into the house late at night a tornado of conversation  basil though close on sixty had moods of boisterous babyishness and these seemed for some reason or other to descend upon him particularly in the house of his studious and almost dingy friend i can remember vividly for i was acquainted with both parties and often dined with them the gaiety of grant on that particular evening when the strange calamity fell upon the professor professor chadd was like most of his particular class and type the class that is at once academic and middleclass a radical of a solemn and oldfashioned type grant was a radical himself but he was that more discriminating and not uncommon type of radical who passes most of his time in abusing the radical party chadd had just contributed to a magazine an article called zulu interests and the new makango frontier in which a precise scientific report of his study of the customs of the people of tchaka was reinforced by a severe protest against certain interferences with these customs both by the british and the germans hewas sitting with the magazine in front of him the lamplight shining on his spectacles a wrinkle in his forehead not of anger but of perplexity as basil grant strode up and down the room shaking it with his voice with his high spirits and his heavy tread  its not your opinions that i object to my esteemed chadd he was saying its you you are quite right to champion the zulus but for all that you do not sympathize with them no doubt you know the zulu way of cooking tomatoes and the zulu prayer before blowing ones nose but for all that you dont understand them as well as i do who dont know an assegai from an alligator you are more learned chadd but i am more zulu why is it that the jolly old barbarians of this earth are always championed by people who are their antithesis why is it you are sagacious you are benevolent you are well informed but chadd you are not savage live no longer under that rosy illusion look in the glass ask your sisters consult the librarian of the british museum look at this umbrella and he held up that sad but still respectable article look at it for ten mortal years to my certain knowledge you have carried that object under your arm and i have no sort of doubt that you carried it at the age of eight months and it never occurred to you to give one wild yell and hurl it like a javelinthus  and he sent the umbrella whizzing past the professors bald head so that it knocked over a pile of books with a crash and left a vase rocking  professor chadd appeared totally unmoved with his face still lifted to the lamp and the wrinkle cut in his forehead  your mental processes he said always go a little too fast and they are stated without method there is no kind of inconsistencyand no words can convey the time he took to get to the end of the wordbetween valuing the right of the aborigines to adhere to their stage in the evolutionary process so long as they find it congenial and requisite to do so there is i say no inconsistency between this concession which i have just described to you and the view that the evolutionary stage in question is nevertheless so far as we can form any estimate of values in the variety of cosmic processes definable in some degree as an inferior evolutionary stage  nothing but his lips had moved as he spoke and his glasses still shone like two pallid moons  grant was shaking with laughter as he watched him  true he said there is no inconsistency my son of the red spear but there is a great deal of incompatibility of temper i am very far from being certain that the zulu is on an inferior evolutionary stage whatever the blazes that may mean i do not think there is anything stupid or ignorant about howling at the moon or being afraid of devils in the dark it seems to me perfectly philosophical why should a man be thought a sort of idiot because he feels the mystery and peril of existence itself suppose my dear chadd suppose it is we who are the idiots because we are not afraid of devils in the dark  professor chadd slit open a page of the magazine with a bone paperknife and the intent reverence of the bibliophile  beyond all question he said it is a tenable hypothesis i allude to the hypothesis which i understand you to entertain that our civilization is not or may not be an advance upon and indeed if i apprehend you is or may be a retrogression from states identical with or analogous to the state of the zulus moreover i shall be inclined to concede that such a proposition is of the nature in some degree at least of a primary proposition and cannot adequately be argued in the same sense i mean that the primary proposition of pessimism or the primary proposition of the nonexistence of matter cannot adequately be argued but i do not conceive you to be under the impression that you have demonstrated anything more concerning this proposition than that it is tenable which after all amounts to little more than the statement that it is not a contradiction in terms  basil threw a book at his head and took out a cigar  you dont understand he said but on the other hand as a compensation you dont mind smoking why you dont object to that disgustingly barbaric rite i cant think i can only say that i began it when i began to be a zulu about the age of ten what i maintained was that although you knew more about zulus in the sense that you are a scientist i know more about them in the sense that i am a savage for instance your theory of the origin of language something about its having come from the formulated secret language of some individual creature though you knocked me silly with facts and scholarship in its favour still does not convince me because i have a feeling that that is not the way that things happen if you ask me why i think so i can only answer that i am a zulu and if you ask me as you most certainly will what is my definition of a zulu i can answer that also he is one who has climbed a sussex appletree at seven and been afraid of a ghost in an english lane  your process of thought began the immovable chadd but his speech was interrupted his sister with that masculinity which always in such families concentrates in sisters flung open the door with a rigid arm and said  james mr bingham of the british museum wants to see you again  the philosopher rose with a dazed look which always indicates in such men the fact that they regard philosophy as a familiar thing but practical life as a weird and unnerving vision and walked dubiously out of the room  i hope you do not mind my being aware of it miss chadd said basil grant but i hear that the british museum has recognized one of the men who have deserved well of their commonwealth it is true is it not that professor chadd is likely to be made keeper of asiatic manuscripts  the grim face of the spinster betrayed a great deal of pleasure and a great deal of pathos also i believe its true she said if it is it will not only be great glory which women i assure you feel a great deal but great relief which they feel more relief from worry from a lot of things james health has never been good and while we are as poor as we are he had to do journalism and coaching in addition to his own dreadful grinding notions and discoveries which he loves more than man woman or child i have often been afraid that unless something of this kind occurred we should really have to be careful of his brain but i believe it is practically settled  i am delighted began basil but with a worried face but these redtape negotiations are so terribly chancy that i really cant advise you to build on hope only to be hurled down into bitterness ive known men and good men like your brother come nearer than this and be disappointed of course if it is true  if it is true said the woman fiercely it means that people who have never lived may make an attempt at living  even as she spoke the professor came into the room still with the dazed look in his eyes  is it true asked basil with burning eyes  not a bit true answered chadd after a moments bewilderment your argument was in three points fallacious  what do you mean demanded grant  well said the professor slowly in saying that you could possess a knowledge of the essence of zulu life distinct from  oh confound zulu life cried grant with a burst of laughter i mean have you got the post  you mean the post of keeper of the asiatic manuscripts he said opening his eye with childlike wonder oh yes i got that but the real objection to your argument which has only i admit occurred to me since i have been out of the room is that it does not merely presuppose a zulu truth apart from the facts but infers that the discovery of it is absolutely impeded by the facts  i am crushed said basil and sat down to laugh while the professors sister retired to her room possibly possibly not  it was extremely late when we left the chadds and it is an extremely long and tiresome journey from shepherds bush to lambeth this may be our excuse for the fact that we for i was stopping the night with grant got down to breakfast next day at a time inexpressibly criminal a time in point of fact close upon noon even to that belated meal we came in a very lounging and leisurely fashion grant in particular seemed so dreamy at table that he scarcely saw the pile of letters by his plate and i doubt if he would have opened any of them if there had not lain on the top that one thing which has succeeded amid modern carelessness in being really urgent and coercivea telegram this he opened with the same heavy distraction with which he broke his egg and drank his tea when he read it he did not stir a hair or say a word but something i know not what made me feel that the motionless figure had been pulled together suddenly as strings are tightened on a slack guitar though he said nothing and did not move i knew that he had been for an instant cleared and sharpened with a shock of cold water it was scarcely any surprise to me when a man who had drifted sullenly to his seat and fallen into it kicked it away like a cur from under him and came round to me in two strides  what do you make of that he said and flattened out the wire in front of me  it ran please come at once james mental state dangerous chadd  what does the woman mean i said after a pause irritably those women have been saying that the poor old professor was mad ever since he was born  you are mistaken said grant composedly it is true that all sensible women think all studious men mad it is true for the matter of that all women of any kind think all men of any kind mad but they dont put it in telegrams any more than they wire to you that grass is green or god allmerciful these things are truisms and often private ones at that if miss chadd has written down under the eye of a strange woman in a postoffice that her brother is off his head you may be perfectly certain that she did it because it was a matter of life and death and she can think of no other way of forcing us to come promptly  it will force us of course i said smiling  oh yes he replied there is a cabrank near  basil scarcely said a word as we drove across westminster bridge through trafalgar square along piccadilly and up the uxbridge road only as he was opening the gate he spoke  i think you will take my word for it my friend he said this is one of the most queer and complicated and astounding incidents that ever happened in london or for that matter in any high civilization  i confess with the greatest sympathy and reverence that i dont quite see it i said is it so very extraordinary or complicated that a dreamy somnambulant old invalid who has always walked on the borders of the inconceivable should go mad under the shock of great joy is it so very extraordinary that a man with a head like a turnip and a soul like a spiders web should not find his strength equal to a confounding change of fortunes is it in short so very extraordinary that james chadd should lose his wits from excitement  it would not be extraordinary in the least answered basil with placidity it would not be extraordinary in the least he repeated if the professor had gone mad that was not the extraordinary circumstance to which i referred  what i asked stamping my foot was the extraordinary thing  the extraordinary thing said basil ringing the bell is that he has not gone mad from excitement  the tall and angular figure of the eldest miss chadd blocked the doorway as the door opened two other miss chadds seemed in the same way to be blocking the narrow passage and the little parlour there was a general sense of their keeping something from view they seemed like three blackclad ladies in some strange play of maeterlinck veiling the catastrophe from the audience in the manner of the greek chorus  sit down wont you said one of them in a voice that was somewhat rigid with pain i think you had better be told first what has happened  then with her bleak face looking unmeaningly out of the window she continued in an even and mechanical voice  i had better state everything that occurred just as it occurred this morning i was clearing away the breakfast things my sisters were both somewhat unwell and had not come down my brother had just gone out of the room i believe to fetch a book he came back again however without it and stood for some time staring at the empty grate i said were you looking for anything i could get he did not answer but this constantly happens as he is often very abstracted i repeated my question and still he did not answer sometimes he is so wrapped up in his studies that nothing but a touch on the shoulder would make him aware of ones presence so i came round the table towards him i really do not know how to describe the sensation which i then had it seems simply silly but at the moment it seemed something enormous upsetting ones brain the fact is james was standing on one leg  grant smiled slowly and rubbed his hands with a kind of care  standing on one leg i repeated  yes replied the dead voice of the woman without an inflection to suggest that she felt the fantasticality of her statement he was standing on the left leg and the right drawn up at a sharp angle the toe pointing downwards i asked him if his leg hurt him his only answer was to shoot the leg straight at right angles to the other as if pointing to the other with his toe to the wall he was still looking quite gravely at the fireplace  james what is the matter i cried for i was thoroughly frightened james gave three kicks in the air with the right leg flung up the other gave three kicks in the air with it also and spun round like a teetotum the other way are you mad i cried why dont you answer me he had come to a standstill facing me and was looking at me as he always does with his lifted eyebrows and great spectacled eyes when i had spoken he remained a second or two motionless and then his only reply was to lift his left foot slowly from the floor and describe circles with it in the air i rushed to the door and shouted for christina i will not dwell on the dreadful hours that followed all three of us talked to him implored him to speak to us with appeals that might have brought back the dead but he has done nothing but hop and dance and kick with a solemn silent face it looks as if his legs belonged to some one else or were possessed by devils he has never spoken to us from that time to this  where is he now i said getting up in some agitation we ought not to leave him alone  doctor colman is with him said miss chadd calmly they are in the garden doctor colman thought the air would do him good and he can scarcely go into the street  basil and i walked rapidly to the window which looked out on the garden it was a small and somewhat smug suburban garden the flower beds a little too neat and like the pattern of a coloured carpet but on this shining and opulent summer day even they had the exuberance of something natural i had almost said tropical in the middle of a bright and verdant but painfully circular lawn stood two figures one of them was a small sharplooking man with black whiskers and a very polished hat i presume dr colman who was talking very quietly and clearly yet with a nervous twitch as it were in his face the other was our old friend listening with his old forbearing expression and owlish eyes the strong sunlight gleaming on his glasses as the lamplight had gleamed the night before when the boisterous basil had rallied him on his studious decorum but for one thing the figure of this morning might have been the identical figure of last night that one thing was that while the face listened reposefully the legs were industriously dancing like the legs of a marionette the neat flowers and the sunny glitter of the garden lent an indescribable sharpness and incredibility to the prodigythe prodigy of the head of a hermit and the legs of a harlequin for miracles should always happen in broad daylight the night makes them credible and therefore commonplace  the second sister had by this time entered the room and came somewhat drearily to the window  you know adelaide she said that mr bingham from the museum is coming again at three  i know said adelaide chadd bitterly i suppose we shall have to tell him about this i thought that no good fortune would ever come easily to us  grant suddenly turned round what do you mean he said what will you have to tell mr bingham  you know what i shall have to tell him said the professors sister almost fiercely i dont know that we need give it its wretched name do you think that the keeper of asiatic manuscripts will be allowed to go on like that and she pointed for an instant at the figure in the garden the shining listening face and the unresting feet  basil grant took out his watch with an abrupt movement when did you say the british museum man was coming he said  three oclock said miss chadd briefly  then i have an hour before me said grant and without another word threw up the window and jumped out into the garden he did not walk straight up to the doctor and lunatic but strolling round the garden path drew near them cautiously and yet apparently carelessly he stood a couple of feet off them seemingly counting halfpence out of his trousers pocket but as i could see looking up steadily under the broad brim of his hat  suddenly he stepped up to professor chadds elbow and said in a loud familiar voice well my boy do you still think the zulus our inferiors  the doctor knitted his brows and looked anxious seeming to be about to speak the professor turned his bald and placid head towards grant in a friendly manner but made no answer idly flinging his left leg about  have you converted dr colman to your views basil continued still in the same loud and lucid tone  chadd only shuffled his feet and kicked a little with the other leg his expression still benevolent and inquiring the doctor cut in rather sharply shall we go inside professor he said now you have shown me the garden a beautiful garden a most beautiful garden let us go in and he tried to draw the kicking ethnologist by the elbow at the same time whispering to grant i must ask you not to trouble him with questions most risky he must be soothed  basil answered in the same tone with great coolness  of course your directions must be followed out doctor i will endeavour to do so but i hope it will not be inconsistent with them if you will leave me alone with my poor friend in this garden for an hour i want to watch him i assure you dr colman that i shall say very little to him and that little shall be as soothing asas syrup  the doctor wiped his eyeglass thoughtfully  it is rather dangerous for him he said to be long in the strong sun without his hat with his bald head too  that is soon settled said basil composedly and took off his own big hat and clapped it on the egglike skull of the professor the latter did not turn round but danced away with his eyes on the horizon  the doctor put on his glasses again looked severely at the two for some seconds with his head on one side like a birds and then saying shortly all right strutted away into the house where the three misses chadd were all looking out from the parlour window on to the garden they looked out on it with hungry eyes for a full hour without moving and they saw a sight which was more extraordinary than madness itself  basil grant addressed a few questions to the madman without succeeding in making him do anything but continue to caper and when he had done this slowly took a red notebook out of one pocket and a large pencil out of another  he began hurriedly to scribble notes when the lunatic skipped away from him he would walk a few yards in pursuit stop and make notes again thus they followed each other round and round the foolish circle of turf the one writing in pencil with the face of a man working out a problem the other leaping and playing like a child  after about threequarters of an hour of this imbecile scene grant put the pencil in his pocket but kept the notebook open in his hand and walking round the mad professor planted himself directly in front of him  then occurred something that even those already used to that wild morning had not anticipated or dreamed the professor on finding basil in front of him stared with a blank benignity for a few seconds and then drew up his left leg and hung it bent in the attitude that his sister had described as being the first of all his antics and the moment he had done it basil grant lifted his own leg and held it out rigid before him confronting chadd with the flat sole of his boot the professor dropped his bent leg and swinging his weight on to it kicked out the other behind like a man swimming basil crossed his feet like a saltire cross and then flung them apart again giving a leap into the air then before any of the spectators could say a word or even entertain a thought about the matter both of them were dancing a sort of jig or hornpipe opposite each other and the sun shone down on two madmen instead of one  they were so stricken with the deafness and blindness of monomania that they did not see the eldest miss chadd come out feverishly into the garden with gestures of entreaty a gentleman following her professor chadd was in the wildest posture of a pasdequatre basil grant seemed about to turn a cartwheel when they were frozen in their follies by the steely voice of adelaide chadd saying mr bingham of the british museum  mr bingham was a slim wellclad gentleman with a pointed and slightly effeminate grey beard unimpeachable gloves and formal but agreeable manners he was the type of the overcivilized as professor chadd was of the uncivilized pedant his formality and agreeableness did him some credit under the circumstances he had a vast experience of books and a considerable experience of the more dilettante fashionable salons but neither branch of knowledge had accustomed him to the spectacle of two greyhaired middleclass gentlemen in modern costume throwing themselves about like acrobats as a substitute for an afterdinner nap  the professor continued his antics with perfect placidity but grant stopped abruptly the doctor had reappeared on the scene and his shiny black eyes under his shiny black hat moved restlessly from one of them to the other  dr colman said basil turning to him will you entertain professor chadd again for a little while i am sure that he needs you mr bingham might i have the pleasure of a few moments private conversation my name is grant  mr bingham of the british museum bowed in a manner that was respectful but a trifle bewildered  miss chadd will excuse me continued basil easily if i know my way about the house and he led the dazed librarian rapidly through the back door into the parlour  mr bingham said basil setting a chair for him i imagine that miss chadd has told you of this distressing occurrence  she has mr grant said bingham looking at the table with a sort of compassionate nervousness i am more pained than i can say by this dreadful calamity it seems quite heartrending that the thing should have happened just as we have decided to give your eminent friend a position which falls far short of his merits as it is of coursereally i dont know what to say professor chadd may of course retaini sincerely trust he willhis extraordinarily valuable intellect but i am afraidi am really afraidthat it would not do to have the curator of the asiatic manuscriptserdancing about  i have a suggestion to make said basil and sat down abruptly in his chair drawing it up to the table  i am delighted of course said the gentleman from the british museum coughing and drawing up his chair also  the clock on the mantelpiece ticked for just the moments required for basil to clear his throat and collect his words and then he said  my proposal is this i do not know that in the strict use of words you could altogether call it a compromise still it has something of that character my proposal is that the government acting as i presume through your museum should pay professor chadd l800 a year until he stops dancing  eight hundred a year said mr bingham and for the first time lifted his mild blue eyes to those of his interlocutorand he raised them with a mild blue stare i think i have not quite understood you did i understand you to say that professor chadd ought to be employed in his present state in the asiatic manuscript department at eight hundred a year  grant shook his head resolutely  no he said firmly no chadd is a friend of mine and i would say anything for him i could but i do not say i cannot say that he ought to take on the asiatic manuscripts i do not go so far as that i merely say that until he stops dancing you ought to pay him l800 surely you have some general fund for the endowment of research  mr bingham looked bewildered  i really dont know he said blinking his eyes what you are talking about do you ask us to give this obvious lunatic nearly a thousand a year for life  not at all cried basil keenly and triumphantly i never said for life not at all  what for then asked the meek bingham suppressing an instinct meekly to tear his hair how long is this endowment to run not till his death till the judgement day  no said basil beaming but just what i said till he has stopped dancing and he lay back with satisfaction and his hands in his pockets  bingham had by this time fastened his eyes keenly on basil grant and kept them there  come mr grant he said do i seriously understand you to suggest that the government pay professor chadd an extraordinarily high salary simply on the ground that he has pardon the phrase gone mad that he should be paid more than four good clerks solely on the ground that he is flinging his boots about in the back yard  precisely said grant composedly  that this absurd payment is not only to run on with the absurd dancing but actually to stop with the absurd dancing  one must stop somewhere said grant of course  bingham rose and took up his perfect stick and gloves  there is really nothing more to be said mr grant he said coldly what you are trying to explain to me may be a jokea slightly unfeeling joke it may be your sincere view in which case i ask your pardon for the former suggestion but in any case it appears quite irrelevant to my duties the mental morbidity the mental downfall of professor chadd is a thing so painful to me that i cannot easily endure to speak of it but it is clear there is a limit to everything and if the archangel gabriel went mad it would sever his connection i am sorry to say with the british museum library  he was stepping towards the door but grants hand flung out in dramatic warning arrested him  stop said basil sternly stop while there is yet time do you want to take part in a great work mr bingham do you want to help in the glory of europein the glory of science do you want to carry your head in the air when it is bald or white because of the part that you bore in a great discovery do you want  bingham cut in sharply  and if i do want this mr grant  then said basil lightly your task is easy get chadd l800 a year till he stops dancing  with a fierce flap of his swinging gloves bingham turned impatiently to the door but in passing out of it found it blocked dr colman was coming in  forgive me gentlemen he said in a nervous confidential voice the fact is mr grant ierhave made a most disturbing discovery about mr chadd  bingham looked at him with grave eyes  i was afraid so he said drink i imagine  drink echoed colman as if that were a much milder affair oh no its not drink  mr bingham became somewhat agitated and his voice grew hurried and vague homicidal mania he began  no no said the medical man impatiently  thinks hes made of glass said bingham feverishly or says hes godor  no said dr colman sharply the fact is mr grant my discovery is of a different character the awful thing about him is  oh go on sir cried bingham in agony  the awful thing about him is repeated colman with deliberation that he isnt mad  not mad  there are quite wellknown physical tests of lunacy said the doctor shortly he hasnt got any of them  but why does he dance cried the despairing bingham why doesnt he answer us why hasnt he spoken to his family  the devil knows said dr colman coolly im paid to judge of lunatics but not of fools the mans not mad  what on earth can it mean cant we make him listen said mr bingham can none get into any kind of communication with him  grants voice struck in sudden and clear like a steel bell  i shall be very happy he said to give him any message you like to send  both men stared at him  give him a message they cried simultaneously how will you give him a message  basil smiled in his slow way  if you really want to know how i shall give him your message he began but bingham cried  of course of course with a sort of frenzy  well said basil like this and he suddenly sprang a foot into the air coming down with crashing boots and then stood on one leg  his face was stern though this effect was slightly spoiled by the fact that one of his feet was making wild circles in the air  you drive me to it he said you drive me to betray my friend and i will for his own sake betray him  the sensitive face of bingham took on an extra expression of distress as of one anticipating some disgraceful disclosure anything painful of course he began  basil let his loose foot fall on the carpet with a crash that struck them all rigid in their feeble attitudes  idiots he cried have you seen the man have you looked at james chadd going dismally to and fro from his dingy house to your miserable library with his futile books and his confounded umbrella and never seen that he has the eyes of a fanatic have you never noticed stuck casually behind his spectacles and above his seedy old collar the face of a man who might have burned heretics or died for the philosophers stone it is all my fault in a way i lit the dynamite of his deadly faith i argued against him on the score of his famous theory about languagethe theory that language was complete in certain individuals and was picked up by others simply by watching them i also chaffed him about not understanding things in rough and ready practice what has this glorious bigot done he has answered me he has worked out a system of language of his own it would take too long to explain he has made up i say a language of his own and he has sworn that till people understand it till he can speak to us in this language he will not speak in any other and he shall not i have understood by taking careful notice and by heaven so shall the others this shall not be blown upon he shall finish his experiment he shall have l800 a year from somewhere till he has stopped dancing to stop him now is an infamous war on a great idea it is religious persecution  mr bingham held out his hand cordially  i thank you mr grant he said i hope i shall be able to answer for the source of the l800 and i fancy that i shall will you come in my cab  no thank you very much mr bingham said grant heartily i think i will go and have a chat with the professor in the garden  the conversation between chadd and grant appeared to be personal and friendly they were still dancing when i left    chapter 6 the eccentric seclusion of the old lady  the conversation of rupert grant had two great elements of interestfirst the long fantasias of detective deduction in which he was engaged and second his genuine romantic interest in the life of london his brother basil said of him his reasoning is particularly cold and clear and invariably leads him wrong but his poetry comes in abruptly and leads him right whether this was true of rupert as a whole or no it was certainly curiously supported by one story about him which i think worth telling  we were walking along a lonely terrace in brompton together the street was full of that bright blue twilight which comes about half past eight in summer and which seems for the moment to be not so much a coming of darkness as the turning on of a new azure illuminator as if the earth were lit suddenly by a sapphire sun in the cool blue the lemon tint of the lamps had already begun to flame and as rupert and i passed them rupert talking excitedly one after another the pale sparks sprang out of the dusk rupert was talking excitedly because he was trying to prove to me the nine hundred and ninetyninth of his amateur detective theories he would go about london with this mad logic in his brain seeing a conspiracy in a cab accident and a special providence in a falling fusee his suspicions at the moment were fixed upon an unhappy milkman who walked in front of us so arresting were the incidents which afterwards overtook us that i am really afraid that i have forgotten what were the main outlines of the milkmans crime i think it had something to do with the fact that he had only one small can of milk to carry and that of that he had left the lid loose and walked so quickly that he spilled milk on the pavement this showed that he was not thinking of his small burden and this again showed that he anticipated some other than lacteal business at the end of his walk and this taken in conjunction with something about muddy boots showed something else that i have entirely forgotten i am afraid that i derided this detailed revelation unmercifully and i am afraid that rupert grant who though the best of fellows had a good deal of the sensitiveness of the artistic temperament slightly resented my derision he endeavoured to take a whiff of his cigar with the placidity which he associated with his profession but the cigar i think was nearly bitten through  my dear fellow he said acidly ill bet you half a crown that wherever that milkman comes to a real stop ill find out something curious  my resources are equal to that risk i said laughing done  we walked on for about a quarter of an hour in silence in the trail of the mysterious milkman he walked quicker and quicker and we had some ado to keep up with him and every now and then he left a splash of milk silver in the lamplight suddenly almost before we could note it he disappeared down the area steps of a house i believe rupert really believed that the milkman was a fairy for a second he seemed to accept him as having vanished then calling something to me which somehow took no hold on my mind he darted after the mystic milkman and disappeared himself into the area  i waited for at least five minutes leaning against a lamppost in the lonely street then the milkman came swinging up the steps without his can and hurried off clattering down the road two or three minutes more elapsed and then rupert came bounding up also his face pale but yet laughing a not uncommon contradiction in him denoting excitement  my friend he said rubbing his hands so much for all your scepticism so much for your philistine ignorance of the possibilities of a romantic city two and sixpence my boy is the form in which your prosaic good nature will have to express itself  what i said incredulously do you mean to say that you really did find anything the matter with the poor milkman  his face fell  oh the milkman he said with a miserable affectation at having misunderstood me no iididnt exactly bring anything home to the milkman himself i  what did the milkman say and do i said with inexorable sternness  well to tell the truth said rupert shifting restlessly from one foot to another the milkman himself as far as merely physical appearances went just said milk miss and handed in the can that is not to say of course that he did not make some secret sign or some  i broke into a violent laugh you idiot i said why dont you own yourself wrong and have done with it why should he have made a secret sign any more than any one else you own he said nothing and did nothing worth mentioning you own that dont you  his face grew grave  well since you ask me i must admit that i do it is possible that the milkman did not betray himself it is even possible that i was wrong about him  then come along with you i said with a certain amicable anger and remember that you owe me half a crown  as to that i differ from you said rupert coolly the milkmans remarks may have been quite innocent even the milkman may have been but i do not owe you half a crown for the terms of the bet were i think as follows as i propounded them that wherever that milkman came to a real stop i should find out something curious  well i said  well he answered i jolly well have you just come with me and before i could speak he had turned tail once more and whisked through the blue dark into the moat or basement of the house i followed almost before i made any decision  when we got down into the area i felt indescribably foolish literally as the saying is in a hole there was nothing but a closed door shuttered windows the steps down which we had come the ridiculous well in which i found myself and the ridiculous man who had brought me there and who stood there with dancing eyes i was just about to turn back when rupert caught me by the elbow  just listen to that he said and keeping my coat gripped in his right hand he rapped with the knuckles of his left on the shutters of the basement window his air was so definite that i paused and even inclined my head for a moment towards it from inside was coming the murmur of an unmistakable human voice  have you been talking to somebody inside i asked suddenly turning to rupert  no i havent he replied with a grim smile but i should very much like to do you know what somebody is saying in there  no of course not i replied  then i recommend you to listen said rupert sharply  in the dead silence of the aristocratic street at evening i stood a moment and listened from behind the wooden partition in which there was a long lean crack was coming a continuous and moaning sound which took the form of the words when shall i get out when shall i get out will they ever let me out or words to that effect  do you know anything about this i said turning upon rupert very abruptly  perhaps you think i am the criminal he said sardonically instead of being in some small sense the detective i came into this area two or three minutes ago having told you that i knew there was something funny going on and this woman behind the shutters for it evidently is a woman was moaning like mad no my dear friend beyond that i do not know anything about her she is not startling as it may seem my disinherited daughter or a member of my secret seraglio but when i hear a human being wailing that she cant get out and talking to herself like a mad woman and beating on the shutters with her fists as she was doing two or three minutes ago i think it worth mentioning that is all  my dear fellow i said i apologize this is no time for arguing what is to be done  rupert grant had a long claspknife naked and brilliant in his hand  first of all he said housebreaking and he forced the blade into the crevice of the wood and broke away a huge splinter leaving a gap and glimpse of the dark windowpane inside the room within was entirely unlighted so that for the first few seconds the window seemed a dead and opaque surface as dark as a strip of slate then came a realization which though in a sense gradual made us step back and catch our breath two large dim human eyes were so close to us that the window itself seemed suddenly to be a mask a pale human face was pressed against the glass within and with increased distinctness with the increase of the opening came the words  when shall i get out  what can all this be i said  rupert made no answer but lifting his walkingstick and pointing the ferrule like a fencing sword at the glass punched a hole in it smaller and more accurate than i should have supposed possible the moment he had done so the voice spouted out of the hole so to speak piercing and querulous and clear making the same demand for liberty  cant you get out madam i said drawing near the hole in some perturbation  get out of course i cant moaned the unknown female bitterly they wont let me i told them i would be let out i told them id call the police but its no good nobody knows nobody comes they could keep me as long as they liked only  i was in the very act of breaking the window finally with my stick incensed with this very sinister mystery when rupert held my arm hard held it with a curious still and secret rigidity as if he desired to stop me but did not desire to be observed to do so i paused a moment and in the act swung slightly round so that i was facing the supporting wall of the front door steps the act froze me into a sudden stillness like that of rupert for a figure almost as motionless as the pillars of the portico but unmistakably human had put his head out from between the doorposts and was gazing down into the area one of the lighted lamps of the street was just behind his head throwing it into abrupt darkness consequently nothing whatever could be seen of his face beyond one fact that he was unquestionably staring at us i must say i thought ruperts calmness magnificent he rang the area bell quite idly and went on talking to me with the easy end of a conversation which had never had any beginning the black glaring figure in the portico did not stir i almost thought it was really a statue in another moment the grey area was golden with gaslight as the basement door was opened suddenly and a small and decorous housemaid stood in it  pray excuse me said rupert in a voice which he contrived to make somehow or other at once affable and underbred but we thought perhaps that you might do something for the waifs and strays we dont expect  not here said the small servant with the incomparable severity of the menial of the nonphilanthropic and slammed the door in our faces  very sad very sadthe indifference of these people said the philanthropist with gravity as we went together up the steps as we did so the motionless figure in the portico suddenly disappeared  well what do you make of that asked rupert slapping his gloves together when we got into the street  i do not mind admitting that i was seriously upset under such conditions i had but one thought  dont you think i said a trifle timidly that we had better tell your brother  oh if you like said rupert in a lordly way he is quite near as i promised to meet him at gloucester road station shall we take a cab perhaps as you say it might amuse him  gloucester road station had as if by accident a somewhat deserted look after a little looking about we discovered basil grant with his great head and his great white hat blocking the ticketoffice window i thought at first that he was taking a ticket for somewhere and being an astonishingly long time about it as a matter of fact he was discussing religion with the bookingoffice clerk and had almost got his head through the hole in his excitement when we dragged him away it was some time before he would talk of anything but the growth of an oriental fatalism in modern thought which had been well typified by some of the officials ingenious but perverse fallacies at last we managed to get him to understand that we had made an astounding discovery when he did listen he listened attentively walking between us up and down the lamplit street while we told him in a rather feverish duet of the great house in south kensington of the equivocal milkman of the lady imprisoned in the basement and the man staring from the porch at length he said  if youre thinking of going back to look the thing up you must be careful what you do its no good you two going there to go twice on the same pretext would look dubious to go on a different pretext would look worse you may be quite certain that the inquisitive gentleman who looked at you looked thoroughly and will wear so to speak your portraits next to his heart if you want to find out if there is anything in this without a police raid i fancy you had better wait outside ill go in and see them  his slow and reflective walk brought us at length within sight of the house it stood up ponderous and purple against the last pallor of twilight it looked like an ogres castle and so apparently it was  do you think its safe basil said his brother pausing a little pale under the lamp to go into that place alone of course we shall be near enough to hear if you yell but these devils might do somethingsomething suddenor odd i cant feel its safe  i know of nothing that is safe said basil composedly except possiblydeath and he went up the steps and rang at the bell when the massive respectable door opened for an instant cutting a square of gaslight in the gathering dark and then closed with a bang burying our friend inside we could not repress a shudder it had been like the heavy gaping and closing of the dim lips of some evil leviathan a freshening night breeze began to blow up the street and we turned up the collars of our coats at the end of twenty minutes in which we had scarcely moved or spoken we were as cold as icebergs but more i think from apprehension than the atmosphere suddenly rupert made an abrupt movement towards the house  i cant stand this he began but almost as he spoke sprang back into the shadow for the panel of gold was again cut out of the black house front and the burly figure of basil was silhouetted against it coming out he was roaring with laughter and talking so loudly that you could have heard every syllable across the street another voice or possibly two voices were laughing and talking back at him from within  no no no basil was calling out with a sort of hilarious hostility thats quite wrong thats the most ghastly heresy of all its the soul my dear chap the soul thats the arbiter of cosmic forces when you see a cosmic force you dont like trick it my boy but i must really be off  come and pitch into us again came the laughing voice from out of the house we still have some bones unbroken  thanks very much i willgood night shouted grant who had by this time reached the street  good night came the friendly call in reply before the door closed  basil said rupert grant in a hoarse whisper what are we to do  the elder brother looked thoughtfully from one of us to the other  what is to be done basil i repeated in uncontrollable excitement  im not sure said basil doubtfully what do you say to getting some dinner somewhere and going to the court theatre tonight i tried to get those fellows to come but they couldnt  we stared blankly  go to the court theatre repeated rupert what would be the good of that  good what do you mean answered basil staring also have you turned puritan or passive resister or something for fun of course  but great god in heaven what are we going to do i mean cried rupert what about the poor woman locked up in that house shall i go for the police  basils face cleared with immediate comprehension and he laughed  oh that he said id forgotten that thats all right some mistake possibly or some quite trifling private affair but im sorry those fellows couldnt come with us shall we take one of these green omnibuses there is a restaurant in sloane square  i sometimes think you play the fool to frighten us i said irritably how can we leave that woman locked up how can it be a mere private affair how can crime and kidnapping and murder for all i know be private affairs if you found a corpse in a mans drawingroom would you think it bad taste to talk about it just as if it was a confounded dado or an infernal etching  basil laughed heartily  thats very forcible he said as a matter of fact though i know its all right in this case and there comes the green omnibus  how do you know its all right in this ease persisted his brother angrily  my dear chap the things obvious answered basil holding a return ticket between his teeth while he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket those two fellows never committed a crime in their lives theyre not the kind have either of you chaps got a halfpenny i want to get a paper before the omnibus comes  oh curse the paper cried rupert in a fury do you mean to tell me basil grant that you are going to leave a fellow creature in pitch darkness in a private dungeon because youve had ten minutes talk with the keepers of it and thought them rather good men  good men do commit crimes sometimes said basil taking the ticket out of his mouth but this kind of good man doesnt commit that kind of crime well shall we get on this omnibus  the great green vehicle was indeed plunging and lumbering along the dim wide street towards us basil had stepped from the curb and for an instant it was touch and go whether we should all have leaped on to it and been borne away to the restaurant and the theatre  basil i said taking him firmly by the shoulder i simply wont leave this street and this house  nor will i said rupert glaring at it and biting his fingers theres some black work going on there if i left it i should never sleep again  basil grant looked at us both seriously  of course if you feel like that he said well investigate further youll find its all right though theyre only two young oxford fellows extremely nice too though rather infected with this pseudodarwinian business ethics of evolution and all that  i think said rupert darkly ringing the bell that we shall enlighten you further about their ethics  and may i ask said basil gloomily what it is that you propose to do  i propose first of all said rupert to get into this house secondly to have a look at these nice young oxford men thirdly to knock them down bind them gag them and search the house  basil stared indignantly for a few minutes then he was shaken for an instant with one of his sudden laughs  poor little boys he said but it almost serves them right for holding such silly views after all and he quaked again with amusement theres something confoundedly darwinian about it  i suppose you mean to help us said rupert  oh yes ill be in it answered basil if its only to prevent your doing the poor chaps any harm  he was standing in the rear of our little procession looking indifferent and sometimes even sulky but somehow the instant the door opened he stepped first into the hall glowing with urbanity  so sorry to haunt you like this he said i met two friends outside who very much want to know you may i bring them in  delighted of course said a young voice the unmistakable voice of the isis and i realized that the door had been opened not by the decorous little servant girl but by one of our hosts in person he was a short but shapely young gentleman with curly dark hair and a square snubnosed face he wore slippers and a sort of blazer of some incredible college purple  this way he said mind the steps by the staircase this house is more crooked and oldfashioned than you would think from its snobbish exterior there are quite a lot of odd corners in the place really  that said rupert with a savage smile i can quite believe  we were by this time in the study or back parlour used by the young inhabitants as a sittingroom an apartment littered with magazines and books ranging from dante to detective stories the other youth who stood with his back to the fire smoking a corncob was big and burly with dead brown hair brushed forward and a norfolk jacket he was that particular type of man whose every feature and action is heavy and clumsy and yet who is you would say rather exceptionally a gentleman  any more arguments he said when introductions had been effected i must say mr grant you were rather severe upon eminent men of science such as we ive half a mind to chuck my dsc and turn minor poet  bosh answered grant i never said a word against eminent men of science what i complain of is a vague popular philosophy which supposes itself to be scientific when it is really nothing but a sort of new religion and an uncommonly nasty one when people talked about the fall of man they knew they were talking about a mystery a thing they didnt understand now that they talk about the survival of the fittest they think they do understand it whereas they have not merely no notion they have an elaborately false notion of what the words mean the darwinian movement has made no difference to mankind except that instead of talking unphilosophically about philosophy they now talk unscientifically about science  that is all very well said the big young man whose name appeared to be burrows of course in a sense science like mathematics or the violin can only be perfectly understood by specialists still the rudiments may be of public use greenwood here indicating the little man in the blazer doesnt know one note of music from another still he knows something he knows enough to take off his hat when they play god save the king he doesnt take it off by mistake when they play oh dem golden slippers just in the same way science  here mr burrows stopped abruptly he was interrupted by an argument uncommon in philosophical controversy and perhaps not wholly legitimate rupert grant had bounded on him from behind flung an arm round his throat and bent the giant backwards  knock the other fellow down swinburne he called out and before i knew where i was i was locked in a grapple with the man in the purple blazer he was a wiry fighter who bent and sprang like a whalebone but i was heavier and had taken him utterly by surprise i twitched one of his feet from under him he swung for a moment on the single foot and then we fell with a crash amid the litter of newspapers myself on top  my attention for a moment released by victory i could hear basils voice finishing some long sentence of which i had not heard the beginning   wholly i must confess unintelligible to me my dear sir and i need not say unpleasant still one must side with ones old friends against the most fascinating new ones permit me therefore in tying you up in this antimacassar to make it as commodious as handcuffs can reasonably be while  i had staggered to my feet the gigantic burrows was toiling in the garotte of rupert while basil was striving to master his mighty hands rupert and basil were both particularly strong but so was mr burrows how strong we knew a second afterwards his head was held back by ruperts arm but a convulsive heave went over his whole frame an instant after his head plunged forward like a bulls and rupert grant was slung head over heels a catherine wheel of legs on the floor in front of him simultaneously the bulls head butted basil in the chest bringing him also to the ground with a crash and the monster with a berserker roar leaped at me and knocked me into the corner of the room smashing the wastepaper basket the bewildered greenwood sprang furiously to his feet basil did the same but they had the best of it now  greenwood dashed to the bell and pulled it violently sending peals through the great house before i could get panting to my feet and before rupert who had been literally stunned for a few moments could even lift his head from the floor two footmen were in the room defeated even when we were in a majority we were now outnumbered greenwood and one of the footmen flung themselves upon me crushing me back into the corner upon the wreck of the paper basket the other two flew at basil and pinned him against the wall rupert lifted himself on his elbow but he was still dazed  in the strained silence of our helplessness i heard the voice of basil come with a loud incongruous cheerfulness  now this he said is what i call enjoying oneself  i caught a glimpse of his face flushed and forced against the bookcase from between the swaying limbs of my captors and his to my astonishment his eyes were really brilliant with pleasure like those of a child heated by a favourite game  i made several apoplectic efforts to rise but the servant was on top of me so heavily that greenwood could afford to leave me to him he turned quickly to come to reinforce the two who were mastering basil the latters head was already sinking lower and lower like a leaking ship as his enemies pressed him down he flung up one hand just as i thought him falling and hung on to a huge tome in the bookcase a volume i afterwards discovered of st chrysostoms theology just as greenwood bounded across the room towards the group basil plucked the ponderous tome bodily out of the shelf swung it and sent it spinning through the air so that it struck greenwood flat in the face and knocked him over like a rolling ninepin at the same instant basils stiffness broke and he sank his enemies closing over him  ruperts head was clear but his body shaken he was hanging as best he could on to the halfprostrate greenwood they were rolling over each other on the floor both somewhat enfeebled by their falls but rupert certainly the more so i was still successfully held down the floor was a sea of torn and trampled papers and magazines like an immense wastepaper basket burrows and his companion were almost up to the knees in them as in a drift of dead leaves and greenwood had his leg stuck right through a sheet of the pall mall gazette which clung to it ludicrously like some fantastic trouser frill  basil shut from me in a human prison a prison of powerful bodies might be dead for all i knew i fancied however that the broad back of mr burrows which was turned towards me had a certain bend of effort in it as if my friend still needed some holding down suddenly that broad back swayed hither and thither it was swaying on one leg basil somehow had hold of the other burrows huge fists and those of the footman were battering basils sunken head like an anvil but nothing could get the giants ankle out of his sudden and savage grip while his own head was forced slowly down in darkness and great pain the right leg of his captor was being forced in the air burrows swung to and fro with a purple face then suddenly the floor and the walls and the ceiling shook together as the colossus fell all his length seeming to fill the floor basil sprang up with dancing eyes and with three blows like batteringrams knocked the footman into a cocked hat then he sprang on top of burrows with one antimacassar in his hand and another in his teeth and bound him hand and foot almost before he knew clearly that his head had struck the floor then basil sprang at greenwood whom rupert was struggling to hold down and between them they secured him easily the man who had hold of me let go and turned to his rescue but i leaped up like a spring released and to my infinite satisfaction knocked the fellow down the other footman bleeding at the mouth and quite demoralized was stumbling out of the room my late captor without a word slunk after him seeing that the battle was won rupert was sitting astride the pinioned mr greenwood basil astride the pinioned mr burrows  to my surprise the latter gentleman lying bound on his back spoke in a perfectly calm voice to the man who sat on top of him  and now gentlemen he said since you have got your own way perhaps you wouldnt mind telling us what the deuce all this is  this said basil with a radiant face looking down at his captive this is what we call the survival of the fittest  rupert who had been steadily collecting himself throughout the latter phases of the fight was intellectually altogether himself again at the end of it springing up from the prostrate greenwood and knotting a handkerchief round his left hand which was bleeding from a blow he sang out quite coolly  basil will you mount guard over the captive of your bow and spear and antimacassar swinburne and i will clear out the prison downstairs  all right said basil rising also and seating himself in a leisured way in an armchair dont hurry for us he said glancing round at the litter of the room we have all the illustrated papers  rupert lurched thoughtfully out of the room and i followed him even more slowly in fact i lingered long enough to hear as i passed through the room the passages and the kitchen stairs basils voice continuing conversationally  and now mr burrows he said settling himself sociably in the chair theres no reason why we shouldnt go on with that amusing argument im sorry that you have to express yourself lying on your back on the floor and as i told you before ive no more notion why you are there than the man in the moon a conversationalist like yourself however can scarcely be seriously handicapped by any bodily posture you were saying if i remember right when this incidental fracas occurred that the rudiments of science might with advantage be made public  precisely said the large man on the floor in an easy tone i hold that nothing more than a rough sketch of the universe as seen by science can be  and here the voices died away as we descended into the basement i noticed that mr greenwood did not join in the amicable controversy strange as it may appear i think he looked back upon our proceedings with a slight degree of resentment mr burrows however was all philosophy and chattiness we left them as i say together and sank deeper and deeper into the underworld of that mysterious house which perhaps appeared to us somewhat more tartarean than it really was owing to our knowledge of its semicriminal mystery and of the human secret locked below  the basement floor had several doors as is usual in such a house doors that would naturally lead to the kitchen the scullery the pantry the servants hall and so on rupert flung open all the doors with indescribable rapidity four out of the five opened on entirely empty apartments the fifth was locked rupert broke the door in like a bandbox and we fell into the sudden blackness of the sealed unlighted room  rupert stood on the threshold and called out like a man calling into an abyss  whoever you are come out you are free the people who held you captive are captives themselves we heard you crying and we came to deliver you we have bound your enemies upstairs hand and foot you are free  for some seconds after he had spoken into the darkness there was a dead silence in it then there came a kind of muttering and moaning we might easily have taken it for the wind or rats if we had not happened to have heard it before it was unmistakably the voice of the imprisoned woman drearily demanding liberty just as we had heard her demand it  has anybody got a match said rupert grimly i fancy we have come pretty near the end of this business  i struck a match and held it up it revealed a large bare yellowpapered apartment with a darkclad figure at the other end of it near the window an instant after it burned my fingers and dropped leaving darkness it had however revealed something more practicalan iron gas bracket just above my head i struck another match and lit the gas and we found ourselves suddenly and seriously in the presence of the captive  at a sort of workbox in the window of this subterranean breakfastroom sat an elderly lady with a singularly high colour and almost startling silver hair she had as if designedly to relieve these effects a pair of mephistophelian black eyebrows and a very neat black dress the glare of the gas lit up her piquant hair and face perfectly against the brown background of the shutters the background was blue and not brown in one place at the place where ruperts knife had torn a great opening in the wood about an hour before  madam said he advancing with a gesture of the hat permit me to have the pleasure of announcing to you that you are free your complaints happened to strike our ears as we passed down the street and we have therefore ventured to come to your rescue  the old lady with the red face and the black eyebrows looked at us for a moment with something of the apoplectic stare of a parrot then she said with a sudden gust or breathing of relief  rescue where is mr greenwood where is mr burrows did you say you had rescued me  yes madam said rupert with a beaming condescension we have very satisfactorily dealt with mr greenwood and mr burrows we have settled affairs with them very satisfactorily  the old lady rose from her chair and came very quickly towards us  what did you say to them how did you persuade them she cried  we persuaded them my dear madam said rupert laughing by knocking them down and tying them up but what is the matter  to the surprise of every one the old lady walked slowly back to her seat by the window  do i understand she said with the air of a person about to begin knitting that you have knocked down mr burrows and tied him up  we have said rupert proudly we have resisted their oppression and conquered it  oh thanks answered the old lady and sat down by the window  a considerable pause followed  the road is quite clear for you madam said rupert pleasantly  the old lady rose cocking her black eyebrows and her silver crest at us for an instant  but what about greenwood and burrows she said what did i understand you to say had become of them  they are lying on the floor upstairs said rupert chuckling tied hand and foot  well that settles it said the old lady coming with a kind of bang into her seat again i must stop where i am  rupert looked bewildered  stop where you are he said why should you stop any longer where you are what power can force you now to stop in this miserable cell  the question rather is said the old lady with composure what power can force me to go anywhere else  we both stared wildly at her and she stared tranquilly at us both  at last i said do you really mean to say that we are to leave you here  i suppose you dont intend to tie me up she said and carry me off i certainly shall not go otherwise  but my dear madam cried out rupert in a radiant exasperation we heard you with our own ears crying because you could not get out  eavesdroppers often hear rather misleading things replied the captive grimly i suppose i did break down a bit and lose my temper and talk to myself but i have some sense of honour for all that  some sense of honour repeated rupert and the last light of intelligence died out of his face leaving it the face of an idiot with rolling eyes  he moved vaguely towards the door and i followed but i turned yet once more in the toils of my conscience and curiosity can we do nothing for you madam i said forlornly  why said the lady if you are particularly anxious to do me a little favour you might untie the gentlemen upstairs  rupert plunged heavily up the kitchen staircase shaking it with his vague violence with mouth open to speak he stumbled to the door of the sittingroom and scene of battle  theoretically speaking that is no doubt true mr burrows was saying lying on his back and arguing easily with basil but we must consider the matter as it appears to our sense the origin of morality  basil cried rupert gasping she wont come out  who wont come out asked basil a little cross at being interrupted in an argument  the lady downstairs replied rupert the lady who was locked up she wont come out and she says that all she wants is for us to let these fellows loose  and a jolly sensible suggestion cried basil and with a bound he was on top of the prostrate burrows once more and was unknotting his bonds with hands and teeth  a brilliant idea swinburne just undo mr greenwood  in a dazed and automatic way i released the little gentleman in the purple jacket who did not seem to regard any of the proceedings as particularly sensible or brilliant the gigantic burrows on the other hand was heaving with herculean laughter  well said basil in his cheeriest way i think we must be getting away weve so much enjoyed our evening far too much regard for you to stand on ceremony if i may so express myself weve made ourselves at home good night thanks so much come along rupert  basil said rupert desperately for gods sake come and see what you can make of the woman downstairs i cant get the discomfort out of my mind i admit that things look as if we had made a mistake but these gentlemen wont mind perhaps  no no cried burrows with a sort of rabelaisian uproariousness no no look in the pantry gentlemen examine the coalhole make a tour of the chimneys there are corpses all over the house i assure you  this adventure of ours was destined to differ in one respect from others which i have narrated i had been through many wild days with basil grant days for the first half of which the sun and the moon seemed to have gone mad but it had almost invariably happened that towards the end of the day and its adventure things had cleared themselves like the sky after rain and a luminous and quiet meaning had gradually dawned upon me but this days work was destined to end in confusion worse confounded before we left that house ten minutes afterwards one halfwitted touch was added which rolled all our minds in cloud if ruperts head had suddenly fallen off on the floor if wings had begun to sprout out of greenwoods shoulders we could scarcely have been more suddenly stricken and yet of this we had no explanation we had to go to bed that night with the prodigy and get up next morning with it and let it stand in our memories for weeks and months as will be seen it was not until months afterwards that by another accident and in another way it was explained for the present i only state what happened  when all five of us went down the kitchen stairs again rupert leading the two hosts bringing up the rear we found the door of the prison again closed throwing it open we found the place again as black as pitch the old lady if she was still there had turned out the gas she seemed to have a weird preference for sitting in the dark  without another word rupert lit the gas again the little old lady turned her birdlike head as we all stumbled forward in the strong gaslight then with a quickness that almost made me jump she sprang up and swept a sort of oldfashioned curtsey or reverence i looked quickly at greenwood and burrows to whom it was natural to suppose this subservience had been offered i felt irritated at what was implied in this subservience and desired to see the faces of the tyrants as they received it to my surprise they did not seem to have seen it at all burrows was paring his nails with a small penknife greenwood was at the back of the group and had hardly entered the room and then an amazing fact became apparent it was basil grant who stood foremost of the group the golden gaslight lighting up his strong face and figure his face wore an expression indescribably conscious with the suspicion of a very grave smile his head was slightly bent with a restrained bow it was he who had acknowledged the ladys obeisance and it was he beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt to whom it had really been directed  so i hear he said in a kindly yet somehow formal voice i hear madam that my friends have been trying to rescue you but without success  no one naturally knows my faults better than you answered the lady with a high colour but you have not found me guilty of treachery  i willingly attest it madam replied basil in the same level tones and the fact is that i am so much gratified with your exhibition of loyalty that i permit myself the pleasure of exercising some very large discretionary powers you would not leave this room at the request of these gentlemen but you know that you can safely leave it at mine  the captive made another reverence i have never complained of your injustice she said i need scarcely say what i think of your generosity  and before our staring eyes could blink she had passed out of the room basil holding the door open for her  he turned to greenwood with a relapse into joviality this will be a relief to you he said  yes it will replied that immovable young gentleman with a face like a sphinx  we found ourselves outside in the dark blue night shaken and dazed as if we had fallen into it from some high tower  basil said rupert at last in a weak voice i always thought you were my brother but are you a man i meanare you only a man  at present replied basil my mere humanity is proved by one of the most unmistakable symbolshunger we are too late for the theatre in sloane square but we are not too late for the restaurant here comes the green omnibus and he had leaped on it before we could speak   as i said it was months after that rupert grant suddenly entered my room swinging a satchel in his hand and with a general air of having jumped over the garden wall and implored me to go with him upon the latest and wildest of his expeditions he proposed to himself no less a thing than the discovery of the actual origin whereabouts and headquarters of the source of all our joys and sorrowsthe club of queer trades i should expand this story for ever if i explained how ultimately we ran this strange entity to its lair the process meant a hundred interesting things the tracking of a member the bribing of a cabman the fighting of roughs the lifting of a paving stone the finding of a cellar the finding of a cellar below the cellar the finding of the subterranean passage the finding of the club of queer trades  i have had many strange experiences in my life but never a stranger one than that i felt when i came out of those rambling sightless and seemingly hopeless passages into the sudden splendour of a sumptuous and hospitable diningroom surrounded upon almost every side by faces that i knew there was mr montmorency the arboreal houseagent seated between the two brisk young men who were occasionally vicars and always professional detainers there was mr p g northover founder of the adventure and romance agency there was professor chadd who invented the dancing language  as we entered all the members seemed to sink suddenly into their chairs and with the very action the vacancy of the presidential seat gaped at us like a missing tooth  the presidents not here said mr p g northover turning suddenly to professor chadd  nno said the philosopher with more than his ordinary vagueness i cant imagine where he is  good heavens said mr montmorency jumping up i really feel a little nervous ill go and see and he ran out of the room  an instant after he ran back again twittering with a timid ecstasy  hes there gentlemenhes there all righthes coming in now he cried and sat down rupert and i could hardly help feeling the beginnings of a sort of wonder as to who this person might be who was the first member of this insane brotherhood who we thought indistinctly could be maddest in this world of madmen what fantastic was it whose shadow filled all these fantastics with so loyal an expectation  suddenly we were answered the door flew open and the room was filled and shaken with a shout in the midst of which basil grant smiling and in evening dress took his seat at the head of the table  how we ate that dinner i have no idea in the common way i am a person particularly prone to enjoy the long luxuriance of the club dinner but on this occasion it seemed a hopeless and endless string of courses horsdoeuvre sardines seemed as big as herrings soup seemed a sort of ocean larks were ducks ducks were ostriches until that dinner was over the cheese course was maddening i had often heard of the moon being made of green cheese that night i thought the green cheese was made of the moon and all the time basil grant went on laughing and eating and drinking and never threw one glance at us to tell us why he was there the king of these capering idiots  at last came the moment which i knew must in some way enlighten us the time of the club speeches and the club toasts basil grant rose to his feet amid a surge of songs and cheers  gentlemen he said it is a custom in this society that the president for the year opens the proceedings not by any general toast of sentiment but by calling upon each member to give a brief account of his trade we then drink to that calling and to all who follow it it is my business as the senior member to open by stating my claim to membership of this club years ago gentlemen i was a judge i did my best in that capacity to do justice and to administer the law but it gradually dawned on me that in my work as it was i was not touching even the fringe of justice i was seated in the seat of the mighty i was robed in scarlet and ermine nevertheless i held a small and lowly and futile post i had to go by a mean rule as much as a postman and my red and gold was worth no more than his daily there passed before me taut and passionate problems the stringency of which i had to pretend to relieve by silly imprisonments or silly damages while i knew all the time by the light of my living common sense that they would have been far better relieved by a kiss or a thrashing or a few words of explanation or a duel or a tour in the west highlands then as this grew on me there grew on me continuously the sense of a mountainous frivolity every word said in the court a whisper or an oath seemed more connected with life than the words i had to say then came the time when i publicly blasphemed the whole bosh was classed as a madman and melted from public life  something in the atmosphere told me that it was not only rupert and i who were listening with intensity to this statement  well i discovered that i could be of no real use i offered myself privately as a purely moral judge to settle purely moral differences before very long these unofficial courts of honour kept strictly secret had spread over the whole of society people were tried before me not for the practical trifles for which nobody cares such as committing a murder or keeping a dog without a licence my criminals were tried for the faults which really make social life impossible they were tried before me for selfishness or for an impossible vanity or for scandalmongering or for stinginess to guests or dependents of course these courts had no sort of real coercive powers the fulfilment of their punishments rested entirely on the honour of the ladies and gentlemen involved including the honour of the culprits but you would be amazed to know how completely our orders were always obeyed only lately i had a most pleasing example a maiden lady in south kensington whom i had condemned to solitary confinement for being the means of breaking off an engagement through backbiting absolutely refused to leave her prison although some wellmeaning persons had been inopportune enough to rescue her  rupert grant was staring at his brother his mouth fallen agape so for the matter of that i expect was i this then was the explanation of the old ladys strange discontent and her still stranger content with her lot she was one of the culprits of his voluntary criminal court she was one of the clients of his queer trade  we were still dazed when we drank amid a crash of glasses the health of basils new judiciary we had only a confused sense of everything having been put right the sense men will have when they come into the presence of god we dimly heard basil say  mr p g northover will now explain the adventure and romance agency  and we heard equally dimly northover beginning the statement he had made long ago to major brown thus our epic ended where it had begun like a true cycle
