lightning speed and even his dramas were thought out and worked through with unhesitating energy and rapid achievement nevertheless the composition of his two great poems was all but coextensive with his poetical life he began the first canto of childe harold in the autumn of 1809 and he did not complete the fourth canto till the spring of 1818 he began the first canto of don juan in the autumn of 1818 and he was still at work on a seventeenth canto in the spring of 1823 both poems were issued in parts and with long intervals of unequal duration between the parts but the same result was brought about by different causes and produced a dissimilar effect childe harold consists of three distinct poems descriptive of three successive travels or journeys in foreign lands the adventures of the hero are but the pretext for the shifting of the diorama whereas in don juan the story is continuous and the scenery is exhibited as a background for the dramatic evolution of the personality of the hero childe harold came out at intervals because there were periods when the author was stationary but the interruptions in the composition and publication of don juan were due to the disapproval and discouragement of friends and the very natural hesitation and procrastination of the publisher canto i was written in september 1818 canto ii in decemberjanuary 18181819 both cantos were published on july 15 1819 cantos iii iv were written in the winter of 18191820 canto v after an interval of nine months in octobernovember 1820 but the publication of cantos iii iv v was delayed till august 8 1821 the next interval was longer still but it was the last in june 1822 byron began to work at a sixth and by the end of march 1823 he had completed a sixteenth canto but the publication of these later cantos which had been declined by murray and were finally entrusted to john hunt was spread over a period of several months cantos vi vii viii with a preface were published july 15 cantos ix x xi august 29 cantos xii xiii xiv december 17 1823 and finally cantos xv xvi march 26 1824 the composition of don juan considered as a whole synchronized with the composition of all the dramas except manfred and the following poems the prophecy of dante the translation of the morgante maggiore the vision of judgment the age of bronze and the island  there is little to be said with regard to the sources of don juan freres whistlecraft had suggested beppo and at the same time had prompted and provoked a sympathetic study of freres italian models berni and pulci see introduction to beppo poetical works 1901 iv 155158 and introduction to the morgante maggiore ibid pp 279281 and again the success of beppo and still more a sense of inspiration and the conviction that he had found the path to excellence suggested another essay of the ottava rima a humorous poem à la beppo on a larger and more important scale if byron possessed more than a superficial knowledge of the legendary don juan he was irresponsive and unimpressed he speaks letter to murray february 16 1821 of the spanish tradition but there is nothing to show that he had read or heard of tirso de molinas gabriel tellez el burlador de sevilla y convidado de piedra the deceiver of seville and the stone guest 1626 which dramatized the ower true tale of the actual don juan tenorio or that he was acquainted with any of the italian eg convitato di pietra del dottor giacinto andrea cicognini fiorentino see l allacci dramaturgia 1755 4º p 862 or french adaptations of the legend eg le festin de pierre ou le fils criminel tragicomédie de de villiers 1659 and molières dom juan ou le festin de pierre 1665 he had seen vide post p 11 note 2 delpinis pantomime which was based on shadwells libertine and he may have witnessed at milan or venice a performance of mozarts don giovanni but in taking don juan for his hero he took the name only and disregarded the terrible figure of the titan of embodied evil the likeness of sin made flesh see selections from the works of lord byron by ac swinburne 1885 p xxvi as something to his purpose nothing  why then did he choose the name and what was the scheme or motif of his poem something is to be gathered from his own remarks and reflections but it must be borne in mind that he is on the defensive and that his halfhumorous paradoxes were provoked by advice and opposition writing to moore september 19 1818 he says i have finished the first canto  of a poem in the style and manner of beppo encouraged by the good success of the same it is  meant to be a little quietly facetious upon every thing but i doubt whether it is notat least as far as it has gonetoo free for these very modest days the critics before and after publication thought that don juan was too free and a month after the two first cantos had been issued he writes to murray august 12 1819 you ask me for the plan of donny johnny i have no plani had no plan but i had or have materials you are too earnest and eager about a work never intended to be serious do you suppose that i could have any intention but to giggle and make gigglea playful satire with as little poetry as could be helped was what i meant again after the completion but before the publication of cantos iii iv v in a letter to murray february 16 1821 he writes the fifth is so far from being the last of don juan that it is hardly the beginning i meant to take him the tour of europe with a proper mixture of siege battle and adventure and to make him finish as anacharsis cloots in the french revolution i meant to have made him a cavalier servente in italy and a cause for a divorce in england and a sentimental wertherfaced man in germany so as to show the different ridicules of the society in each of these countries and to have displayed him gradually gâté and blasé as he grew older as is natural but i had not quite fixed whether to make him end in hell or in an unhappy marriage not knowing which would be the severest  byron meant what he said but he kept back the larger truth great works in which the poet speaks ex animo and the man lays bare the very pulse of the machine are not conceived or composed unconsciously and at haphazard byron did not whistle don juan for want of thought he had found a thing to say and he meant to make the world listen he had read with angry disapproval but he had read coleridges critique on maturins bertram vide post p 4 note 1 and it may be had caught an inspiration from one brilliant sentence which depicts the don juan of the legend somewhat after the likeness of childe harold if not of lord byron rank fortune wit talent acquired knowledge and liberal accomplishments with beauty of person vigorous health  all these advantages elevated by the habits and sympathies of noble birth and natural character are  combined in don juan so as to give him the means of carrying into all its practical consequences the doctrine of a godless nature  obedience to nature is the only virtue again it is not the wickedness of don juan  which constitutes the character an abstraction  but the rapid succession of the correspondent acts and incidents his intellectual superiority and the splendid accumulation of his gifts and desirable qualities as coexistent with entire wickedness in one and the same person here was at once a suggestion and a challenge  would it not be possible to conceive and to depict an ideal character gifted gracious and delightful who should carry into all its practical consequences the doctrine of a mundane if not godless doctrine and at the same time retain the charities and virtues of uncelestial but not devilish manhood in defiance of monition and in spite of resolution the primrose path is trodden by all sorts and conditions of men sinners no doubt but not necessarily abstractions of sin and to assert the contrary makes for cant and not for righteousness the form and substance of the poem were due to the compulsion of genius and the determination of art but the argument is a vindication of the natural man it is byrons criticism of life don juan was taboo from the first the earlier issues of the first five cantos were doubly anonymous neither author nor publisher subscribed their names on the titlepage the book was a monster and as its maker had foreseen all the world shuddered immoral in the sense that it advocates immoral tenets or prefers evil to good it is not but it is unquestionably a dangerous book which to quote kingsleys words used in another connection the young and innocent will do well to leave altogether unread it is dangerous because it ignores resistance and presumes submission to passion it is dangerous because as byron admitted it is now and then voluptuous and it is dangerous in a lesser degree because here and there the purport of the quips and allusions is gross and offensive no one can take up the book without being struck and arrested by these violations of modesty and decorum but no one can master its contents and become possessed of it as a whole without perceiving that the mirror is held up to nature that it reflects spots and blemishes which on a survey of the vast and various orb dwindle into natural and so comparative insignificance byron was under no delusion as to the grossness of don juan his plea or pretence that he was sheltered by the superior grossness of ariosto and la fontaine of prior and of fielding is nihil ad rem if it is not insincere when murray may 3 1819 charges him with approximations to indelicacy he laughs himself away at the euphemism but when hobhouse and the zoili of albemarle street talked to him about morality he flames out i maintain that it is the most moral of poems he looked upon his great work as a whole and he knew that the raison dêtre of his song was not only to celebrate but by the white light of truth to represent and exhibit the great things of the worldlove and war and death by sea and land and man halfangel halfdemonthe comedy of his fortunes and the tragedy of his passions and his fate  don juan has won great praise from the great sir walter scott edinburgh weekly journal may 19 1824

to his wonder and delight this poem carries with it at once the stamp of originality and defiance of imitation nothing has ever been written like it in english nor if i may venture to prophesy will there be unless carrying upon it the mark of a secondary and borrowed light you are building up a drama he adds such as england has not yet seen and the task is sufficiently noble and worthy of you again of the fifth canto he writes shelleys prose works ed h buxton forman iv 219 every word has the stamp of immortality it fulfils in a certain degree what i have long preached of producingsomething wholly new and relative to the age and yet surpassingly beautiful finally a living poet neither a disciple nor encomiast of byron pays eloquent tribute to the strength and splendour of don juan across the stanzas  we swim forward as over the broad backs of the sea they break and glitter hiss and laugh murmur and move like waves that sound or that subside there is in them a delicious resistance an elastic motion which salt water has and fresh water has not there is about them a wide wholesome air full of vivid light and constant wind which is only felt at sea life undulates and death palpitates

   don josé and the donna inez led       for some time an unhappy sort of life     wishing each other not divorced but deadd       they lived respectably as man and wife     their conduct was exceedingly wellbred       and gave no outward signs of inward strife     until at length the smothered fire broke out     and put the business past all kind of doubt                        xxvii      for inez called some druggists and physicians       and tried to prove her loving lord was mad35     but as he had some lucid intermissions       she next decided he was only bad     yet when they asked her for her depositions       no sort of explanation could be had     save that her duty both to man and god36     required this conductwhich seemed very odd37                        xxviii      she kept a journal where his faults were noted       and opened certain trunks of books and letters38     all which might if occasion served be quoted       and then she had all seville for abettors     besides her good old grandmother who doted       the hearers of her case became repeaters     then advocates inquisitors and judges     some for amusement others for old grudges                        xxix      and then this best and meekest woman bore       with such serenity her husbands woes     just as the spartan ladies did of yore       who saw their spouses killed and nobly chose     never to say a word about them more       calmly she heard each calumny that rose     and saw his agonies with such sublimity     that all the world exclaimed what magnanimity                        xxx      no doubt this patience when the world is damning us       is philosophic in our former friends     t is also pleasant to be deemed magnanimous       the more so in obtaining our own ends     and what the lawyers call a malus animus       conduct like this by no means comprehends     revenge in persons certainly no virtue     but then t is not my fault if others hurt you                        xxxi

           xxxiii      he died and most unluckily because       according to all hints i could collect     from counsel learnéd in those kinds of laws       although their talks obscure and circumspect     his death contrived to spoil a charming cause       a thousand pities also with respect     to public feeling which on this occasion     was manifested in a great sensation                        xxxiv      but ah he died and buried with him lay       the public feeling and the lawyers fees     his house was sold his servants sent away       a jew took one of his two mistresses     a priest the otherat least so they say       i asked the doctors after his disease     he died of the slow fever called the tertian     and left his widow to her own aversion                        xxxv      yet josé was an honourable man       that i must say who knew him very well     therefore his frailties ill no further scan       indeed there were not many more to tell     and if his passions now and then outran       discretion and were not so peaceable     as numas who was also named pompilius     he had been ill brought up and was born biliousg                        xxxvi      whateer might be his worthlessness or worth       poor fellow he had many things to wound him     lets ownsince it can do no good on earthh       it was a trying moment that which found him     standing alone beside his desolate hearth       where all his household gods lay shivered round him39     no choice was left his feelings or his pride     save death or doctors commonsso he diedi                        xxxvii      dying intestate juan was sole heir       to a chancery suit and messuages and lands     which with a long minority and care       promised to turn out well in proper hands     inez became sole guardian which was fair       and answered but to natures just demands     an only son left with an only mother     is brought up much more wisely than another                        xxxviii      sagest of women even of widows she       resolved that juan should be quite a paragon     and worthy of the noblest pedigree       his sire was of castile his dam from aragon     then for accomplishments of chivalry       in case our lord the king should go to war again     he learned the arts of riding fencing gunnery     and how to scale a fortressor a nunnery                        xxxix      but that which donna inez most desired       and saw into herself each day before all     the learnéd tutors whom for him she hired       was that his breeding should be strictly moral     much into all his studies she inquired       and so they were submitted first to her all     arts sciencesno branch was made a mystery     to juans eyes excepting natural history                        xl      the languages especially the dead       the sciences and most of all the abstruse     the arts at least all such as could be said       to be the most remote from common use     in all these he was much and deeply read       but not a page of anything thats loose     or hints continuation of the species     was ever suffered lest he should grow vicious                        xli      his classic studies made a little puzzle       because of filthy loves of gods and goddesses     who in the earlier ages raised a bustle       but never put on pantaloons or bodices40     his reverend tutors had at times a tussle       and for their Æneids iliads and odysseysj     were forced to make an odd sort of apology     for donna inez dreaded the mythology                        xlii      ovids a rake as half his verses show him       anacreons morals are a still worse sample     catullus scarcely has a decent poem       i dont think sapphos ode a good example     although longinus41 tells us there is no hymn       where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample     but virgils songs are pure except that horrid one     beginning with formosum pastor corydon42                        xliii      lucretius irreligion is too strong       for early stomachs to prove wholesome food     i cant help thinking juvenal was wrong       although no doubt his real intent was good     for speaking out so plainly in his song       so much indeed as to be downright rude     and then what proper person can be partial     to all those nauseous epigrams of martial                        xliv      juan was taught from out the best edition       expurgated by learned men who place     judiciously from out the schoolboys vision       the grosser parts but fearful to deface     too much their modest bard by this omissionk       and pitying sore his mutilated case     they only add them all in an appendix43     which saves in fact the trouble of an index

ages     till some less rigid editor shall stoop       to call them back into their separate cages     instead of standing staring all together     like garden godsand not so decent either                        xlvi      the missal too it was the family missal       was ornamented in a sort of way     which ancient massbooks often are and this all       kinds of grotesques illumined and how they     who saw those figures on the margin kiss all       could turn their optics to the text and pray     is more than i knowbut don juans mother     kept this herself and gave her son another                        xlvii      sermons he read and lectures he endured       and homilies and lives of all the saints     to jerome and to chrysostom inured       he did not take such studies for restraints     but how faith is acquired and then insured       so well not one of the aforesaid paints     as saint augustine in his fine confessions     which make the reader envy his transgressions44                        xlviii      this too was a sealed book to little juan       i cant but say that his mamma was right     if such an education was the true one       she scarcely trusted him from out her sight     her maids were old and if she took a new one       you might be sure she was a perfect fright     she did this during even her husbands life     i recommend as much to every wife                        xlix      young juan waxed in goodliness and grace       at six a charming child and at eleven     with all the promise of as fine a face       as eer to mans maturer growth was given     he studied steadily and grew apace       and seemed at least in the right road to heaven     for half his days were passed at church the other     between his tutors confessor and mother                        l      at six i said he was a charming child       at twelve he was a fine but quiet boy     although in infancy a little wild       they tamed him down amongst them to destroy     his natural spirit not in vain they toiled       at least it seemed so and his mothers joy     was to declare how sage and still and steady     her young philosopher was grown already                        li      i had my doubts perhaps i have them still      but what i say is neither here nor there     i knew his father well and have some skill       in characterbut it would not be fair     from sire to son to augur good or ill       he and his wife were an illsorted pair     but scandals my aversioni protest     against all evil speaking even in jest                        lii      for my part i say nothingnothingbut       this i will saymy reasons are my own     that if i had an only son to put       to school as god be praised that i have none     t is not with donna inez i would shut       him up to learn his catechism alone     nonoid send him out betimes to college     for there it was i picked up my own knowledge                        liii      for there one learnst is not for me to boast       though i acquiredbut i pass over that     as well as all the greek i since have lost       i say that theres the placebut verbum sat     i think i picked up too as well as most       knowledge of mattersbut no matter what     i never marriedbut i think i know     that sons should not be educated so                        liv      young juan now was sixteen years of age       tall handsome slender but well knit he seemed     active though not so sprightly as a page       and everybody but his mother deemed     him almost man but she flew in a rage45       and bit her lips for else she might have screamed     if any said sofor to be precocious     was in her eyes a thing the most atrocious                        lv      amongst her numerous acquaintance all       selected for discretion and devotion     there was the donna julia whom to call       pretty were but to give a feeble notion     of many charms in her as natural       as sweetness to the flower or salt to ocean     her zone to venus or his bow to cupid     but this last simile is trite and stupid                        lvi      the darkness of her oriental eye       accorded with her moorish origin     her blood was not all spanish by the by       in spain you know this is a sort of sin     when proud granada fell and forced to fly       boabdil wept46 of donna julias kin     some went to africa some stayed in spain     her great great grandmamma chose to remain                        lvii      she married i forget the pedigree       with an hidalgo who transmitted down     his blood less noble than such blood should be       at such alliances his sires would frown     in that point so precise in each degree       that they bred in and in as might be shown     marrying their cousinsnay their aunts and nieces     which always spoils the breed if it increases                        lviii      this heathenish cross restored the breed again       ruined its blood but much improved its flesh     for from a root the ugliest in old spain       sprung up a branch as beautiful as fresh     the sons no more were short the daughters plain       but theres a rumour which i fain would hushl     t is said that donna julias grandmamma     produced her don more heirs at love than law                        lix      however this might be the race went on       improving still through every generation     until it centred in an only son       who left an only daughter my narration     may have suggested that this single one       could be but julia whom on this occasion     i shall have much to speak about and she     was married charming chaste and twentythree                        lx      her eye im very fond of handsome eyes       was large and dark suppressing half its fire     until she spoke then through its soft disguise       flashed an expression more of pride than ire     and love than either and there would arise       a something in them which was not desire     but would have been perhaps but for the soul     which struggled through and chastened down the whole                        lxi      her glossy hair was clustered oer a brow       bright with intelligence and fair and smooth     her eyebrows shape was like the aërial bow       her cheek all purple with the beam of youth     mounting at times to a transparent glow       as if her veins ran lightning she in sooth     possessed an air and grace by no means common     her stature talli hate a dumpy woman                        lxii      wedded she was some years and to a man       of fifty and such husbands are in plenty     and yet i think instead of such a one       t were better to have two of fiveandtwenty     especially in countries near the sun       and now i think on t mi vien in mente     ladies even of the most uneasy virtue     prefer a spouse whose age is short of thirtym                        lxiii      t is a sad thing i cannot choose but say       and all the fault of that indecent sun     who cannot leave alone our helpless clay       but will keep baking broiling burning on     that howsoever people fast and pray       the flesh is frail and so the soul undone     what men call gallantry and gods adultery     is much more common where the climates sultry                        lxiv      happy the nations of the moral north       where all is virtue and the winter season     sends sin without a rag on shivering forth       t was snow that brought st anthony47 to reason     where juries cast up what a wife is worth       by laying whateer sum in mulct they please on     the lover who must pay a handsome price     because it is a marketable vice                        lxv      alfonso was the name of julias lord       a man well looking for his years and who     was neither much beloved nor yet abhorred       they lived together as most people do     suffering each others foibles by accord       and not exactly either one or two     yet he was jealous though he did not show it     for jealousy dislikes the world to know it                        lxvi      julia wasyet i never could see why       with donna inez quite a favourite friend     between their tastes there was small sympathy       for not a line had julia ever penned     some people whisper but no doubt they lie       for malice still imputes some private end     that inez had ere don alfonsos marriage     forgot with him her very prudent carriage                        lxvii      and that still keeping up the old connection       which time had lately rendered much more chaste     she took his lady also in affection       and certainly this course was much the best     she flattered julia with her sage protection       and complimented don alfonsos taste     and if she could not who can silence scandal     at least she left it a more slender handle                        lxviii      i cant tell whether julia saw the affair       with other peoples eyes or if her own     discoveries made but none could be aware       of this at least no symptom eer was shown     perhaps she did not know or did not care       indifferent from the first or callous grown     im really puzzled what to think or say     she kept her counsel in so close a way                        lxix      juan she saw and as a pretty child       caressed him oftensuch a thing might be     quite innocently done and harmless styled       when she had twenty years and thirteen he     but i am not so sure i should have smiled       when he was sixteen julia twentythree     these few short years make wondrous alterations     particularly amongst sunburnt nations                        lxx      whateer the cause might be they had become       changed for the dame grew distant the youth shy     their looks cast down their greetings almost dumb       and much embarrassment in either eye     there surely will be little doubt with some       that donna julia knew the reason why     but as for juan he had no more notion     than he who never saw the sea of ocean                        lxxi      yet julias very coldness still was kind       and tremulously gentle her small hand     withdrew itself from his but left behind       a little pressure thrilling and so bland     and slight so very slight that to the mind       t was but a doubt but neer magicians wand     wrought change with all armidas48 fairy art     like what this light touch left on juans heart                        lxxii      and if she met him though she smiled no more       she looked a sadness sweeter than her smile     as if her heart had deeper thoughts in store       she must not own but cherished more the while     for that compression in its burning core       even innocence itself has many a wile     and will not dare to trust itself with truth     and love is taught hypocrisy from youth                        lxxiii      but passion most dissembles yet betrays       even by its darkness as the blackest sky     foretells the heaviest tempest it displays       its workings through the vainly guarded eye     and in whatever aspect it arrays       itself t is still the same hypocrisy     coldness or anger even disdain or hate     are masks it often wears and still too late                        lxxiv      then there were sighs the deeper for suppression       and stolen glances sweeter for the theft     and burning blushes though for no transgression       tremblings when met and restlessness when left     all these are little preludes to possession       of which young passion cannot be bereft     and merely tend to show how greatly love is     embarrassed at first starting with a novice                        lxxv      poor julias heart was in an awkward state       she felt it going and resolved to make     the noblest efforts for herself and mate       for honours prides religions virtues sake     her resolutions were most truly great       and almost might have made a tarquin quake     she prayed the virgin mary for her grace     as being the best judge of a ladys case49                        lxxvi      she vowed she never would see juan more       and next day paid a visit to his mother     and looked extremely at the opening door       which by the virgins grace let in another     grateful she was and yet a little sore       again it opens it can be no other     t is surely juan nowno im afraid     that night the virgin was no further prayed50                        lxxvii      she now determined that a virtuous woman       should rather face and overcome temptation     that flight was base and dastardly and no man       should ever give her heart the least sensation     that is to say a thought beyond the common       preference that we must feel upon occasion     for people who are pleasanter than others     but then they only seem so many brothers                        lxxviii      and even if by chanceand who can tell       the devils so very slyshe should discover     that all within was not so very well       and if still free that such or such a lover     might please perhaps a virtuous wife can quell       such thoughts and be the better when theyre over     and if the man should ask t is but denial     i recommend young ladies to make trial                        lxxix      and then there are such things as love divine       bright and immaculate unmixed and pure     such as the angels think so very fine       and matrons who would be no less secure     platonic perfect just such love as mine       thus julia saidand thought so to be sure     and so id have her think were i the man     on whom her reveries celestial ran                        lxxx      such love is innocent and may exist       between young persons without any danger     a hand may first and then a lip be kissed       for my part to such doings im a stranger     but hear these freedoms form the utmost list       of all oer which such love may be a ranger     if people go beyond t is quite a crime     but not my faulti tell them all in time                        lxxxi      love then but love within its proper limits       was julias innocent determination     in young don juans favour and to him its       exertion might be useful on occasion     and lighted at too pure a shrine to dim its       ethereal lustre with what sweet persuasion     he might be taught by love and her together     i really dont know what nor julia either                        lxxxii      fraught with this fine intention and well fenced       in mail of proofher purity of soul51     she for the future of her strength convinced       and that her honour was a rock or molen     exceeding sagely from that hour dispensed       with any kind of troublesome control     but whether julia to the task was equal     is that which must be mentioned in the sequel                        lxxxiii      her plan she deemed both innocent and feasible       and surely with a stripling of sixteen     not scandals fangs could fix on much thats seizable       or if they did so satisfied to mean     nothing but what was good her breast was peaceable       a quiet conscience makes one so serene     christians have burnt each other quite persuaded     that all the apostles would have done as they did                        lxxxiv      and if in the mean time her husband died       but heaven forbid that such a thought should cross     her brain though in a dream and then she sighed       never could she survive that common loss     but just suppose that moment should betide       i only say suppose itinter nos     this should be entre nous for julia thought     in french but then the rhyme would go for nought                        lxxxv      i only say suppose this supposition       juan being then grown up to mans estate     would fully suit a widow of condition       even seven years hence it would not be too late     and in the interim to pursue this vision       the mischief after all could not be great     for he would learn the rudiments of love     i mean the seraph way of those above                        lxxxvi      so much for julia now well turn to juan       poor little fellow he had no idea     of his own case and never hit the true one       in feelings quick as ovids miss medea52     he puzzled over what he found a new one       but not as yet imagined it could be a     thing quite in course and not at all alarming     which with a little patience might grow charming                        lxxxvii      silent and pensive idle restless slow       his home deserted for the lonely wood     tormented with a wound he could not know       his like all deep grief plunged in solitude     im fond myself of solitude or so       but then i beg it may be understood     by solitude i mean a sultans not     a hermits with a haram for a grot                        lxxxviii      oh love in such a wilderness as this       where transport and security entwine     here is the empire of thy perfect bliss       and here thou art a god indeed divine53     the bard i quote from does not sing amiss       with the exception of the second line     for that same twining transport and security     are twisted to a phrase of some obscurity                        lxxxix      the poet meant no doubt and thus appeals       to the good sense and senses of mankind     the very thing which everybody feels       as all have found on trial or may find     that no one likes to be disturbed at meals       or lovei wont say more about entwined     or transport as we knew all that before     but beg security will bolt the door                        xc      young juan wandered by the glassy brooks       thinking unutterable things he threw     himself at length within the leafy nooks       where the wild branch of the cork forest grew     there poets find materials for their books       and every now and then we read them through     so that their plan and prosody are eligible     unless like wordsworth they prove unintelligible                        xci      he juan and not wordsworth so pursued       his selfcommunion with his own high soul     until his mighty heart in its great mood       had mitigated part though not the whole     of its disease he did the best he could       with things not very subject to control     and turned without perceiving his condition     like coleridge into a metaphysician54                        xcii      he thought about himself and the whole earth       of man the wonderful and of the stars     and how the deuce they ever could have birth       and then he thought of earthquakes and of wars     how many miles the moon might have in girth       of airballoons and of the many bars     to perfect knowledge of the boundless skies     and then he thought of donna julias eyes                        xciii      in thoughts like these true wisdom may discern       longings sublime and aspirations high     which some are born with but the most part learn       to plague themselves withal they know not why     t was strange that one so young should thus concern       his brain about the action of the skyo     if you think t was philosophy that this did     i cant help thinking puberty assisted                        xciv      he pored upon the leaves and on the flowers       and heard a voice in all the winds and then     he thought of woodnymphs and immortal bowers       and how the goddesses came down to men     he missed the pathway he forgot the hours       and when he looked upon his watch again     he found how much old time had been a winner     he also found that he had lost his dinner                        xcv      sometimes he turned to gaze upon his book       boscan55 or garcilasso56by the wind     even as the page is rustled while we look       so by the poesy of his own mind     over the mystic leaf his soul was shook       as if t were one whereon magicians bind     their spells and give them to the passing gale     according to some good old womans tale                        xcvi      thus would he while his lonely hours away       dissatisfied not knowing what he wanted     nor glowing reverie nor poets lay       could yield his spirit that for which it panted     a bosom whereon he his head might lay       and hear the heart beat with the love it granted     withseveral other things which i forget     or which at least i need not mention yet                        xcvii      those lonely walks and lengthening reveries       could not escape the gentle julias eyes     she saw that juan was not at his ease       but that which chiefly may and must surprise     is that the donna inez did not tease       her only son with question or surmise     whether it was she did not see or would not     or like all very clever people could not                        xcviii      this may seem strange but yet t is very common       for instancegentlemen whose ladies take     leave to oerstep the written rights of woman       and break thewhich commandment is t they break     i have forgot the number and think no man       should rashly quote for fear of a mistake     i say when these same gentlemen are jealous     they make some blunder which their ladies tell us                        xcix      a real husband always is suspicious       but still no less suspects in the wrong placep     jealous of some one who had no such wishes       or pandering blindly to his own disgrace     by harbouring some dear friend extremely vicious       the last indeeds infallibly the case     and when the spouse and friend are gone off wholly     he wonders at their vice and not his folly                        c      thus parents also are at times shortsighted       though watchful as the lynx they neer discover     the while the wicked world beholds delighted       young hopefuls mistress or miss fannys lover     till some confounded escapade has blighted       the plan of twenty years and all is over     and then the mother cries the father swears     and wonders why the devil he got heirs                        ci      but inez was so anxious and so clear       of sight that i must think on this occasion     she had some other motive much more near       for leaving juan to this new temptation     but what that motive was i shant say here       perhaps to finish juans education     perhaps to open don alfonsos eyes     in case he thought his wife too great a prize                        cii      it was upon a day a summers day       summers indeed a very dangerous season     and so is spring about the end of may       the sun no doubt is the prevailing reason     but whatsoeer the cause is one may say       and stand convicted of more truth than treason     that there are months which nature grows more merry in     march has its hares and may must have its heroine                        ciii      t was on a summers daythe sixth of june       i like to be particular in dates     not only of the age and year but moon       they are a sort of posthouse where the fates     change horses making history change its tuneq       then spur away oer empires and oer states     leaving at last not much besides chronology     excepting the postobits of theologyr                        civ      t was on the sixth of june about the hour       of halfpast sixperhaps still nearer seven     when julia sate within as pretty a bower       as eer held houri in that heathenish heaven     described by mahomet and anacreon moore57       to whom the lyre and laurels have been given     with all the trophies of triumphant song     he won them well and may he wear them long                        cv      she sate but not alone i know not well       how this same interview had taken place     and even if i knew i should not tell       people should hold their tongues in any case     no matter how or why the thing befell       but there were she and juan face to face     when two such faces are so t would be wise     but very difficult to shut their eyes

of calling wholly back its selfcontrol     the silver light which hallowing tree and tower       sheds beauty and deep softness oer the whole     breathes also to the heart and oer it throws     a

closed the oration of the trusty maid     she loitered and he told her to be gone       an order somewhat sullenly obeyed     however present remedy was none       and no great good seemed answered if

excuses for his late proceeding     he would not justify what he had done       to say the best it was extreme illbreeding     but there were ample reasons for it none       of which he specified in

  a ready answer which at once enables     a matron who her husbands foible knows       by a few timely words to turn the tables     which if it does not silence still must pose       even if it should comprise a pack of fables     t is to retort with firmness and when he     suspects with one do you reproach with three                        clxxvi      julia in fact had tolerable grounds       alfonsos loves with inez were well known     but whether t was that ones own guilt confounds       but that cant be as has been often shown     a lady with apologies abounds       it might be that her silence sprang alone     from delicacy to don juans ear     to whom she knew his mothers fame was dear                        clxxvii      there might be one more motive which makes two

there is a tact80     that modern phrase appears to me sad stuff       but it will serve to keep my verse compact     which keeps when pushed by questions rather rough       a lady always distant from the fact     the charming creatures lie with such a grace     theres nothing so becoming to the face                        clxxix      they blush and we believe them at least i       have always done so t is of no great use     in any case attempting a reply       for then their eloquence grows quite profuse     and when at length theyre out of breath they sigh       and cast their languid eyes

julia half withheld and then half granted     and laid conditions he thought very hard on       denying several little things he wanted     he stood like adam lingering near his garden       with useless penitence perplexed and hauntedai     beseeching she no further would refuse     when lo he stumbled oer a pair of shoes                        clxxxi      a pair of shoes81what then not much

the only mischief was it came too late     of all experience t is the usual price       a sort of incometax laid on by fate     juan had reached the roomdoor in a trice       and might have done so by the gardengate     but met alfonso in his dressinggown     who threatened deathso juan knocked him down                        clxxxiv      dire was the scuffle and out went the light       antonia cried out rape and julia fire     but not a servant stirred to aid the fight       alfonso pommelled to his hearts desire     swore lustily hed be revenged this night       and juan too blasphemed an octave higher     his blood was up though young he was a tartar     and not at all disposed to prove a martyr                        clxxxv      alfonsos sword had dropped ere he could draw it       and they continued battling hand to hand     for juan very luckily neer saw it       his temper not being under great command     if at that moment he had chanced to claw it       alfonsos days had

throttled him to get away     and blood t was from the nose began to flow       at last as they more faintly wrestling lay     juan contrived to give an awkward blow       and then his only garment quite gave way     he fled like joseph leaving it but there     i doubt all likeness ends between the pair                        clxxxvii      lights came at length and men and maids who found       an awkward spectacle their eyes before     antonia in hysterics julia swooned       alfonso leaning breathless by the door     some halftorn drapery scattered on the ground       some blood and

english poets 1870 pp 203 204 i am accused of having lauded buonaparte to the skies in the hour of his success and then peevishly wreaking my disappointment on the god of my idolatry the first lines i ever wrote upon buonaparte were the ode to napoleon after his abdication in 1814 all that i have ever written on that subject has been done since his declinei never met him in the hour of his success i have considered his character at different periods in its strength and in its weakness by his zealots i am accused of injusticeby his enemies as his warmest partisan in many publications both english and foreign  for the accuracy of my delineation i have high authority a year and some months ago i had the pleasure of seeing at venice my friend the honourable douglas kinnaird in his way through germany he told me that he had been honoured with a presentation to and some interviews with one of the nearest family connections of napoleon eugène beauharnais during one of these he read and translated the lines alluding to buonaparte in the third canto of childe harold he informed me that he was authorized by the illustrious personagestill recognized as such by the legitimacy in europeto whom they were read to say that the delineation was complete or words to this effect it is no puerile vanity which induces me to publish this factbut mr hazlitt accuses my inconsistency and infers my inaccuracy perhaps he will admit that with regard to the latter one of the most intimate family connections of the emperor may be equally capable of deciding on the subject i tell mr hazlitt that i never flattered napoleon on the throne nor maligned him since his fall i wrote what i think are the incredible antitheses of his character  mr hazlitt accuses me further of delineating myself in childe harold etc etc i have denied this long agobut even were it true locke tells us that all his knowledge of human understanding was derived from studying his own mind from mr hazlitts opinion of my poetry i do not appeal but i request that gentleman not to insult me by imputing the basest of crimesviz praising publicly the same man whom i wished to depreciate in his adversitythe first lines i ever wrote on buonaparte were in his dispraise in 1814the last though not at all in his favour were more impartial and discriminative in 1818 has he become more fortunate since 1814 for byrons

lastfarewell of spain                        xii      i cant but say it is an awkward sight       to see ones native land receding through     the growing waters it unmans one quite       especially when life is rather new     i recollect great britains coast looks white99       but almost every other countrys blue     when gazing on them mystified by distance     we enter on our nautical existence                        xiii      so juan stood bewildered on the deck       the wind sung cordage strained and sailors swore     and the ship creaked the town became a speck       from which

                      xv      but juan had got many things to leave       his mother and a mistress and no wife     so that he had much better cause to grieve       than many persons more advanced in life     and if we now and then a sigh must heave       at quitting even those we quit in strife     no doubt we weep for those the heart endears     that is till deeper griefs congeal our tears                        xvi      so juan wept as wept the captive jews       by babels waters still remembering sion     id weepbut mine is not a weeping muse       and such light griefs are not a thing to die on     young men should travel if but to amuse       themselves and the next time their servants tie on     behind their carriages their new portmanteau     perhaps it may be lined with this my

had a       letter of introduction which the morn     of his departure had been sent him by     his spanish friends for those in italy                        xxv      his suite consisted of three servants and       a tutor the licentiate pedrillo     who several languages did understand       but now lay sick and speechless on his pillow     and rocking in his hammock longed for land       his headache being increased by every billow     and the waves oozing through the porthole made     his berth a little damp and him afraid                        xxvi      t was not without some reason

she could lift       herself from out her present jeopardy     the rudder tore away t was time to sound     the pumps and there were four feet water found                        xxviii      one gang of people instantly was put       upon the pumps and the remainder set     to get up part of the cargo and what not       but they could not come at the leak as yet     at last they did get at it really but       still their salvation was an even bet     the water rushed through in a way quite puzzling     while they thrust sheets shirts jackets bales of muslin                        xxix

to all the brother tars who may have need hence       for fifty tons of water were upthrown     by them per hour and they had all been undone     but for the maker mr mann of london102

still in use     the wind blew fresh again as it grew late       a squall came on and while some guns broke loose     a gustwhich all descriptive power transcends     laid with one blast the ship on her beam ends                        xxxi      there she lay motionless and seemed upset       the water left the hold and washed the decks     and made a scene men do not soon forget       for they remember battles fires and wrecks     or any other thing that brings regret       or breaks their hopes or hearts or heads or necks     thus drownings are much talked of by the divers     and swimmers who may chance to be survivors                        xxxii      immediately the masts were cut away       both main and mizen first the mizen went     the mainmast followed but the ship still lay       like a mere log and baffled our intent     foremast and bowsprit were cut down and they       eased her at last although we never meant     to part with all till every hope was blighted     and then with violence the old ship righted103                        xxxiii      it may be easily supposed while this       was going on some people were unquiet     that passengers would find it much amiss       to lose their lives as well as spoil their diet     that even the able seaman deeming his       days nearly oer might be disposed to riot     as upon such occasions tars will ask     for grog and sometimes drink rum from the cask                        xxxiv      theres nought no doubt so much the spirit calms       as rum and true religion thus it was     some plundered some drank spirits some sung psalms       the high wind made the treble and as bass     the hoarse harsh waves kept time fright cured the qualms       of all the luckless landsmens seasick maws     strange sounds of wailing blasphemy devotion     clamoured in chorus to the roaring ocean                        xxxv      perhaps more mischief had been done but forbc       our juan who with sense beyond his years     got to the spiritroom and stood before       it with a pair of pistols104 and their fears     as if death were more dreadful by his door       of fire than water spite of oaths and tears     kept still aloof the crew who ere they sunk     thought it would be becoming to die drunk                        xxxvi      give us more grog they cried for it will be       all one an hour hence juan answered no     t is true that death awaits both you and me       but let us die like men not sink below     like brutesand thus his dangerous post kept he       and none liked to anticipate the blow     and even pedrillo his most reverend tutor     was for some rum a disappointed suitor                        xxxvii      the good old gentleman was quite aghast       and made a loud and pious lamentation     repented all his sins and made a last       irrevocable vow of reformation     nothing should tempt him more this peril past       to quit his academic occupation     in cloisters of the classic salamanca     to follow juans wake like sancho panca                        xxxviii      but now there came a flash of hope once more       day broke and the wind lulled the masts were gone     the leak increased shoals round her but no shore       the vessel swam yet still she held her own105     they tried the pumps again and though before       their desperate efforts seemed all useless grown     a glimpse of sunshine set some hands to bale     the stronger pumped the weaker thrummed a sail                        xxxix      under the vessels keel the sail was passed       and for the moment it had some effect     but with a leak and not a stick of mast       nor rag of canvas what could they expect     but still t is best to struggle to the last       t is never too late

thence       without their will they carried them away     for they were forced with steering to dispense       and never had as yet a quiet day     on which they might repose or even commence       a jurymast or rudder or could say     the ship would swim an hour which by good luck     still swamthough not exactly like a duck                        xli      the wind in fact perhaps was rather less       but the ship laboured so they scarce could hope     to weather out much longer the distress       was also great with which they had to cope     for want of water and their solid mess       was scant enough in vain the telescope     was usednor sail nor shore appeared in sight     nought but the heavy sea and coming night                        xlii      again the weather threatenedagain

tears       in his rough eyes and told the captain he     could do no more he was a man in years       and long had voyaged through many a stormy sea     and if he wept at length they were not fears       that made his eyelids as a womans be     but he poor fellow had a wife and children     two things for dying people quite bewildering                        xliv      the ship was evidently settling now       fast by the head and all distinction gone     some went to prayers again and made a vow       of candles to their saints106but there were none     to pay them with and some looked oer the bow       some hoisted out the boats and there was one     that begged pedrillo for an absolution     who told him to be damnedin his confusion107                        xlv      some lashed them in their hammocks some put on       their best clothes as if going to a fair     some cursed the day on which they saw the sun       and gnashed their teeth and howling tore their hair     and others went on as they had begun       getting the boats out being well aware     that a tight boat will live in a rough sea     unless with breakers close beneath her lee108                        xlvi      the worst of all was that in their condition       having been several days in great distress     t was difficult to get out such provision       as now might render their long suffering

contrived to get     a portion of their beef up from below109       and with a piece of pork moreover met     but scarce enough to serve them for a luncheon     then there was rum eight gallons in a puncheon                        xlviii      the other boats the yawl and pinnace had       been stove in the beginning of the gale110     and the longboats condition was but bad       as there were but two blankets for a sail111     and one oar for a mast which a young lad       threw in by good luck over the ships rail     and two boats could not hold far less be stored     to save one half the people then on board                        xlix      t was twilight and the sunless day went down       over the waste of waters like a veil     which if withdrawn would but disclose the frownbf       of one whose hate is masked but to assail     thus to their hopeless eyes the night was shown       and grimly darkled oer the faces pale     and the dim desolate deep twelve days had fearbg     been their familiar and now death was here                        l      some trial had been making at a raft       with little hope in such a rolling sea     a sort of thing at which one would have laughed112       if any laughter at such times could be     unless with people who too much have quaffed       and have a kind of wild and horrid glee     half epileptical and half hysterical

keep afloat the struggling tars113       for yet they strove although of no great use     there was no light in heaven but a few stars       the boats put off oercrowded with their crews     she gave a heel and then a lurch to port     and going down head foremostsunk in short114                        lii      then rose from sea to sky the wild farewell       then shrieked the timid and stood still the brave     then some leaped overboard with dreadful yell115       as eager to anticipate their grave     and the sea yawned around her like a hell       and down she sucked with her the whirling wave     like one who grapples with his enemy     and strives to strangle him before he die                        liii      and first one universal shriek there rushed       louder than the loud ocean like a crash     of echoing thunder and then all was hushed       save the wild wind and the remorseless dash     of billows but at intervals there gushed       accompanied by a convulsive splash     a solitary shriek the bubbling cry     of some strong swimmer in his agony                        liv      the boats as stated had got off before       and in them crowded several of the crew     and yet their present hope was hardly more       than what it had been for so strong it blew     there was slight chance of reaching any shore       and then they were too many though so few     nine in the cutter thirty in the boat     were counted in them when they got afloat                        lv      all the rest perished near two hundred souls       had left their bodies and whats worse alas     when over catholics the ocean rolls       they must wait several weeks before a mass     takes off one peck of purgatorial coals       because till people know whats come to pass     they wont lay out their money on the dead     it costs three francs for every mass thats said                        lvi      juan got into the longboat and there       contrived to help pedrillo to a place     it seemed as if they had exchanged their care       for juan wore the magisterial face     which courage gives while poor pedrillos pair       of eyes were crying for their owners case     battista though a name called shortly tita     was lost by getting at some aquavita                        lvii      pedro his valet too he tried to save       but the same cause conducive to his loss     left him so drunk he jumped into the wave       as oer the cutters edge he tried to cross     and so he found a wineandwatery grave       they could not rescue him although so close     because the sea ran higher every minute     and for the boatthe crew kept crowding in it                        lviii      a small old spanielwhich had been don josés       his fathers whom he loved as ye may think     for on such things the memory reposes       with tendernessstood howling on the brink     knowing dogs have such intellectual noses       no doubt the vessel was about to sink     and juan caught him up and ere he stepped     off threw him in then after him he leaped116                        lix      he also stuffed his money where he could       about his person and pedrillos too     who let him do in fact whateer he would       not knowing what himself to say or do     as every rising wave his dread renewed       but juan trusting they might still get through     and deeming there were remedies for any ill     thus reembarked his tutor and his spaniel                        lx      t was a rough night and blew so stiffly yet       that the sail was becalmed between the seas117     though on the waves high top too much to set       they dared not take it in for all the breeze     each sea curled oer the stern and kept them wet       and made them bale without a moments ease118     so that themselves as well as hopes were damped     and the poor little cutter quickly swamped                        lxi      nine souls more went in her the longboat still       kept above water with an oar for mast     two blankets stitched together answering ill       instead of sail were to the oar made fast     though every wave rolled menacing to fill       and present peril all before surpassed119     they grieved for those who perished with the cutter     and also for the biscuitcasks and butter                        lxii      the sun rose red and fiery a sure sign       of the continuance of the gale to run     before the sea until it should grow fine       was all that for the present could be done     a few teaspoonfuls of their rum and wine       were served out to the people who begun120     to faint and damaged bread wet through the bags     and most of them had little clothes but rags                        lxiii      they counted thirty crowded in a space       which left scarce room for motion or exertion     they did their best to modify their case       one half sate up though numbed with the immersion     while t other half were laid down in their place       at watch and watch thus shivering like the tertian     ague in its cold fit they filled their boat     with nothing but the sky for a great coat121                        lxiv      t is very certain the desire of life       prolongs it this is obvious to physicians     when patients neither plagued with friends nor wife       survive through very desperate conditions     because they still can hope nor shines the knife       nor shears of atropos before their visions     despair of all recovery spoils longevity     and makes mens misery of alarming brevity                        lxv      t is said that persons living on annuities       are longer lived than othersgod knows why     unless to plague the grantorsyet so true it is       that some i really think do never die     of any creditors the worst a jew it is       and thats their mode of furnishing supply     in my young days they lent me cash that way     which i found very troublesome to pay122                        lxvi      t is thus with people in an open boat       they live upon the love of life and bear     more than can be believed or even thought       and stand like rocks the tempests wear and tear     and hardship still has been the sailors lot       since noahs ark went cruising here and there     she had a curious crew as well as cargo     like the first old greek privateer the argo                        lxvii      but man is a carnivorous production       and must have meals at least one meal a day     he cannot live like woodcocks upon suction       but like the shark and tiger must have prey     although his anatomical construction       bears vegetables in a grumbling way     your labouring people think beyond all question     beef veal and mutton better for digestion                        lxviii      and thus it was with this our hapless crew       for on the third day there came on a calm     and though at first their strength it might renew       and lying on their weariness like balm     lulled them like turtles sleeping on the blue       of ocean when they woke they felt a qualm     and fell all ravenously on their provision     instead of hoarding it with due precision                        lxix      the consequence was easily foreseen       they ate up all they had and drank their wine     in spite of all remonstrances and then       on what in fact next day were they to dine     they hoped the wind would rise these foolish men       and carry them to shore these hopes were fine     but as they had but one oar and that brittle     it would have been more wise to save their victual                        lxx      the fourth day came but not a breath of air       and ocean slumbered like an unweaned child     the fifth day and their boat lay floating there       the sea and sky were blue and clear and mild     with their one oar i wish they had had a pair       what could they do and hungers rage grew wild     so juans spaniel spite of his entreating     was killed and portioned out for present eating123                        lxxi       on the sixth day they fed upon his hide       and juan who had still refused because     the creature was his fathers dog that died       now feeling all the vulture in his jaws     with some remorse received though first denied       as a great favour one of the forepaws124     which he divided with pedrillo who     devoured it longing for the other too                        lxxii      the seventh day and no windthe burning sun       blistered and scorched and stagnant on the sea     they lay like carcasses and hope was none       save in the breeze that came not savagely     they glared upon each otherall was done       water and wine and foodand you might see     the longings of the cannibal arise     although they spoke not in their wolfish eyes                        lxxiii      at length one whispered his companion who       whispered another and thus it went round     and then into a hoarser murmur grew       an ominous and wild and desperate sound     and when his comrades thought each sufferer knew       t was but his own suppressed till now he found     and out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood     and who should die to be his fellows food                        lxxiv      but ere they came to this they that day shared       some leathern caps and what remained of shoes     and then they looked around them and despaired       and none to be the sacrifice would choose     at length the lots were torn up125 and prepared       but of materials that must shock the muse     having no paper for the want of better     they took by force from juan julias letter                        lxxv      the lots were made and marked and mixed and handed       in silent horror126 and their distribution     lulled even the savage hunger which demanded       like the promethean vulture this pollution     none in particular had sought or planned it       t was nature gnawed them to this resolution     by which none were permitted to be neuter     and the lot fell on juans luckless tutor                        lxxvi      he but requested to be bled to death       the surgeon had his instruments and bled127     pedrillo and so gently ebbed his breath       you hardly could perceive when he was dead     he died as born a catholic in faith       like most in the belief in which theyre bred     and first a little crucifix he kissed     and then held out his jugular and wrist                        lxxvii      the surgeon as there was no other fee       had his first choice of morsels for his pains     but being thirstiest at the moment he       preferred a draught from the fastflowing veins128     part was divided part thrown in the sea       and such things as the entrails and the brains     regaled two sharks who followed oer the billow     the sailors ate the rest of poor pedrillo                        lxxviii      the sailors ate him all save three or four       who were not quite so fond of animal food     to these was added juan who before       refusing his own spaniel hardly could     feel now his appetite increased much more       t was not to be expected that he should     even in extremity of their disaster     dine with them on his pastor and his master                        lxxix      t was better that he did not for in fact       the consequence was awful in the extreme     for they who were most ravenous in the act       went raging mad129lord how they did blaspheme     and foam and roll with strange convulsions racked       drinking saltwater like a mountainstream     tearing and grinning howling screeching swearing     and with hyænalaughter died despairing                        lxxx      their numbers were much thinned by this infliction       and all the rest were thin enough heaven knows     and some of them had lost their recollection       happier than they who still perceived their woes     but others pondered on a new dissection       as if not warned sufficiently by those     who had already perished suffering madly     for having used their appetites so sadly                        lxxxi      and next they thought upon the masters mate       as fattest but he saved himself because     besides being much averse from such a fate       there were some other reasons the first was     he had been rather indisposed of late       andthat which chiefly proved his saving clause     was a small present made to him at cadiz     by general subscription of the ladies                        lxxxii      of poor pedrillo something still remained       but was used sparinglysome were afraid     and others still their appetites constrained       or but at times a little supper made     all except juan who throughout abstained       chewing a piece of bamboo and some lead130     at length they caught two boobies and a noddy131     and then they left off eating the dead body                        lxxxiii      and if pedrillos fate should shocking be       remember ugolino132 condescends     to eat the head of his archenemy       the moment after he politely ends     his tale if foes be food in hell at sea       t is surely fair to dine upon our friends     when shipwrecks short allowance grows too scanty     without being much more horrible than dante                        lxxxiv      and the same night there fell a shower of rain       for which their mouths gaped like the cracks of earth     when dried to summer dust till taught by pain       men really know not what good waters worth     if you had been in turkey or in spain       or with a famished boatscrew had your berth     or in the desert heard the camels bell     youd wish yourself where truth isin a well

deemed its moisture was complete     they wrung it out and though a thirsty ditcher133       might not have thought the scanty draught so sweet     as a full pot of porter to their thinking     they neer till now had known the joys of drinking                        lxxxvi      and their baked lips with many a bloody crack134       sucked in the moisture which like nectar streamed     their throats were ovens their swoln tongues were black       as the rich mans in hell who vainly screamed     to beg the beggar who could not rain back     a drop of dew when every drop had seemed     to taste of heavenif this be true indeed     some christians have a comfortable creed                        lxxxvii      there were two fathers in this ghastly crew       and with them their two sons of

done     i can do nothing and he saw him thrown     into the deep without a tear or groan135                        lxxxviii      the other father had a weaklier child       of a soft cheek and aspect delicate136     but the boy bore up long and with a mild       and patient spirit held aloof his fate     little he said and now and then he smiled       as if to win a part from off the weight     he saw increasing on his fathers heart     with the deep deadly thought that they must part                        lxxxix      and oer him bent his sire and never raised       his eyes from off his face but wiped the foam     from his pale lips and ever on him gazed       and when the wishedfor shower at length was come     and the boys eyes which the dull film half glazed       brightened and for a moment seemed to roam     he squeezed from out a rag some drops of rain     into his dying childs mouthbut in vain137                        xc      the boy expiredthe father held the clay       and looked upon it long and when at last     death left no doubt and the dead burthen lay       stiff on his heart and pulse and hope were past     he watched it wistfully until away       t was borne by the rude wave whereint was cast138     then he himself sunk down all dumb and shivering     and gave no sign of life save his limbs quivering                        xci      now overhead a rainbow bursting through       the scattering clouds shone spanning the dark sea     resting its bright base on the quivering blue       and all within its arch appeared to be     clearer than that without and its wide hue       waxed broad and waving like a banner free     then changed like to a bow thats bent and then     forsook the dim eyes of these shipwrecked men                        xcii      it changed of course a heavenly chameleon       the airy child of vapour and the sun     brought forth in purple cradled in vermilion       baptized in molten gold and swathed in dun     glittering like crescents oer a turks pavilion       and blending every colour into one     just like a black eye in a recent scuffle     for sometimes we must box without the muffle                        xciii      our shipwrecked seamen thought it a good omen       it is as well to think so now and then     t was an old custom of the greek and roman       and may become of great advantage when     folks are discouraged and most surely no men       had greater need to nerve themselves again     than these and so this rainbow looked like hope     quite a celestial kaleidoscope                        xciv      about this time a beautiful white bird       webfooted not unlike a dove in size     and plumage probably it might have erred       upon its course passed oft before their eyes     and tried to perch although it saw and heard       the men within the boat and in this guise     it came and went and fluttered round them till     night fellthis seemed a better omen still139                        xcv      but in this case i also must remark       t was well this bird of promise did not perch     because the tackle of our shattered bark       was not so safe for roosting as a church     and had it been the dove from noahs ark       returning there from her successful search     which in their way that moment chanced to fall     they would have eat her olivebranch and all                        xcvi      with twilight it again came on to blow       but not with violence the stars shone out     the boat made way yet now they were so low       they knew not where nor what they were about     some fancied they saw land and some said no       the frequent fogbanks gave them cause to doubt     some swore that they heard breakers others guns140     and all mistook about the latter once                        xcvii      as morning broke the light wind died away       when he who had the watch sung out and swore     if t was not land that rose with the suns ray       he wished that land he never might see more141     and the rest rubbed their eyes and saw a bay       or thought they saw and shaped their course for shore     for shore it was and gradually grew     distinct and high and palpable to view                        xcviii      and then of these some part burst into tears       and others looking with a stupid stare142     could not yet separate their hopes from fears       and seemed as if they had no further care     while a few prayedthe first time for some years       and at the bottom of the boat three were     asleep they shook them by the hand and head     and tried to awaken them but found them dead                        xcix      the day before fast sleeping on the water       they found a turtle of the hawksbill kind     and by good fortune gliding softly caught her143     which yielded a days life and to their mind     proved even still a more nutritious matter       because it left encouragement behind     they thought that in such perils more than chance     had sent them this for their deliverance                        c      the land appeared a high and rocky coast       and higher grew the mountains as they drew     set by a current toward it they were lost       in various conjectures for none knew     to what part of the earth they had been tost       so changeable had been the winds that blew     some thought it was mount Ætna some the highlands     of candia cyprus rhodes or other islands                        ci      meantime the current with a rising gale       still set them onwards to the welcome shore     like charons bark of spectres dull and pale       their living freight was now reduced to four     and three dead whom their strength could not avail       to heave into the deep with those before

by turns and thinned them to     such things a mother had not known her son       amidst the skeletons of that gaunt crew144     by night chilled by day scorched thus one by one       they perished until withered to these few     but chiefly by a species of selfslaughter     in washing down pedrillo with salt water                        cii      as they drew nigh the land which now was seen       unequal in its aspect here and there     they felt the freshness of its growing green       that waved in foresttops and smoothed the air     and fell upon their glazed eyes like a screen       from glistening waves and skies so hot and bare     lovely seemed any object that should sweep     away the vastsaltdreadeternal deep                        civ      the shore looked wild without a trace of man      and girt by formidable waves but they     were mad for land and thus their course they ran       though right ahead the roaring breakers lay     a reef between them also now began       to show its boiling surf and bounding spray     but finding no place for their landing better     they ran the boat for shoreand overset her145                        cv      but in his native stream the guadalquivir       juan to lave his youthful limbs was wont     and having learnt to swim in that sweet river       had often turned the art to some account     a better swimmer you could scarce see ever       he could perhaps have passed the hellespont     as once a feat on which ourselves we prided     leander mr ekenhead and i did146                        cvi      so here though faint emaciated and stark       he buoyed his boyish limbs and strove to ply     with the quick wave and gain ere it was dark       the beach which lay before him high and dry     the greatest danger here was from a shark       that carried off his neighbour by the thigh     as for the other two they could not swim     so nobody arrived on shore but him                        cvii      nor yet had he arrived but for the oar       which providentially for him was washed     just as his feeble arms could strike no more       and the hard wave oerwhelmed him as t was dashed     within his grasp he clung to it and sore       the waters beat while he thereto was lashed     at last with swimming wading scrambling he     rolled on the beach halfsenseless from the sea                        cviii      there breathless with his digging nails he clung       fast to the sand lest the returning wave     from whose reluctant roar his life he wrung       should suck him back to her insatiate grave     and there he lay full length where he was flung       before the entrance of a cliffworn cave     with just enough of life to feel its pain     and deem that it was saved perhaps in vain                        cix      with slow and staggering effort he arose       but sunk again upon his bleeding knee     and quivering hand and then he looked for those       who long had been his mates upon the sea     but none of them appeared to share his woes       save one a corpse from out the famished three     who died two days before and now had found     an unknown barren beach for burial ground                        cx      and as he gazed his dizzy brain spun fast       and down he sunk and as he sunk the sand     swam round and round and all his senses passed       he fell upon his side and his stretched hand     drooped dripping on the oar their jurymast       and like a withered lily on the land     his slender frame and pallid aspect lay     as fair a thing as eer was formed of clay                        cxi      how long in his damp trance young juan lay147       he knew not for the earth was gone for him     and time had nothing more of night nor day       for his congealing blood and senses dim     and how this heavy faintness passed away       he knew not till each painful pulse and limb     and tingling vein seemed throbbing back to life     for death though vanquished still retired with strife                        cxii      his eyes he opened shut again unclosed       for all was doubt and dizziness he thought     he still was in the boat and had but dozed       and felt again with his despair oerwrought     and wished it death in which he had reposed       and then once more his feelings back were brought     and slowly by his swimming eyes was seen     a lovely female face of seventeen                        cxiii      t was bending close oer his and the small mouth       seemed almost prying into his for breath     and chafing him the soft warm hand of youth       recalled his answering spirits back from death     and bathing his chill temples tried to soothe       each pulse to animation till beneath     its gentle touch and trembling care a sigh     to these kind efforts made a low reply                        cxiv      then was the cordial poured and mantle flung       around his scarceclad limbs and the fair arm     raised higher the faint head which oer it hung       and her transparent cheek all pure and warm     pillowed his deathlike forehead then she wrung       his dewy curls long drenched by every storm     and watched with eagerness each throb that drew     a sigh from his heaved bosomand hers too                        cxv      and lifting him with care into the cave       the gentle girl and her attendantone     young

the maid or whatsoeer     she was appeared distinct and tall and fair                        cxvi      her brow was overhung with coins of gold       that sparkled oer the auburn of her hair     her clustering hair whose longer locks were rolled       in braids behind and though her stature were     even of the highest for a female mould       they nearly reached her heel and in her air     there was a something which bespoke command     as one who was a lady in the land                        cxvii      her hair i said was auburn but her eyes       were black as death their lashes the same hue     of downcast length in whose silk shadow lies       deepest attraction for when to the view     forth from its raven fringe the full glance flies       neer with such force the swiftest arrow flew     t is as the snake late coiled who pours his length     and hurls at once his venom and his strength                        cxviii      her brow was white and low her cheeks pure dye       like twilight rosy still with the set sun     short upper lipsweet lips that make us sigh       ever to have seen such for she was onebh     fit for the model of a statuary       a race of mere

one should not rail without a decent cause     there was an irish lady149 to whose bust       i neer saw justice done and yet she was     a frequent model and if eer she must       yield to stern time and natures wrinkling laws     they will destroy a face which mortal thought     neer compassed nor less mortal chisel wrought                        cxx      and such was she the lady of the cave       her dress was very different from the spanish     simpler and yet of colours not so grave       for as you know the spanish women banish     bright hues when out of doors and yet while wave       around them what i hope will never vanish     the basquiña and the mantilla they     seem at the same time mystical and gay150                        cxxi      but with our damsel this was not the case       her dress was manycoloured finely spun     her locks curled negligently round her face       but through them gold and gems profusely shone     her girdle sparkled and the richest lace       flowed in her veil and many a precious stone     flashed on her little hand but what was shocking     her small snow feet had slippers but no stocking                        cxxii      the other females dress was not unlike       but of inferior materials she     had not so many ornaments to strike       her hair had silver only bound to be     her dowry and her veil in form alike       was coarser and her air though firm less free     her hair was thicker but less long her eyes     as black but quicker and of smaller size                        cxxiii      and these two tended him and

girls they really were       they shall appear before your curious eyes     mistress and maid the first was only daughter     of an old man who lived upon the water                        cxxv      a fisherman he had been in his youth       and still a sort of fisherman was he     but other speculations were in sooth       added to his connection with the sea     perhaps not so respectable in truth       a little smuggling and some piracy     left him at last the sole of many masters     of an illgotten million of piastres                        cxxvi      a fisher therefore was hethough of men       like peter the apostle and he fished     for wandering merchantvessels now and then       and sometimes caught as many as he wished     the cargoes he confiscated and gain       he sought in the slavemarket too and dished     full many a morsel for that turkish trade     by which no doubt a good deal may be made                        cxxvii      he was a greek and on his isle had built       one of the wild and smaller cyclades     a very handsome house from out his guilt       and there he lived exceedingly at ease     heaven knows what cash he got or blood he spilt       a sad old fellow was he if you please     but this i know it was a spacious building     full of barbaric carving paint and gilding                        cxxviii      he had an only daughter called haidée       the greatest heiress of the eastern isles     besides so very beautiful was she       her dowry was as nothing to her smiles     still in her teens and like a lovely tree       she grew to womanhood and between whiles     rejected several suitors just to learn     how to accept a better in his turn                        cxxix      and walking out upon the beach below       the cliff towards sunset on that day she found     insensiblenot dead but nearly so       don juan almost famished and half drowned     but being naked she was shocked you know       yet deemed herself in

always on her maid relies     to place him in the cave for present rest       and when at last he opened his black eyes     their charity increased about their guest       and their compassion grew to such a size     it opened half the turnpikegates to heaven     st paul says t is the toll which must be given                        cxxxii      they made a firebut such a fire as they       upon the

crumbled to a crutch     but by gods grace here wrecks were in such plenty     that there was fuel to have furnished twenty                        cxxxiii      he had a bed of furs and a pelissebj       for haidée stripped her sables off to make     his couch and that he might be more at ease       and warm in case by chance he should awake     they also gave a petticoat apiece       she and her

juan slept like a top or like the dead     who sleep at last perhaps god only knows       just for the present and in his lulled head     not even a vision of his former woes       throbbed in

the maid       who smoothed his pillow as she left the den     looked back upon him and a moment stayed       and turned believing that he called again     he slumbered yet she thought at least she said       the heart will slip even as the tongue and pen     he had pronounced her namebut she forgot     that at this moment juan knew it not                        cxxxvi      and pensive to her

sleep his fill       and need he had of slumber yet for none     had suffered morehis hardships were comparativebl     to those related in my granddads narrative152                        cxxxviii      not so haidée she sadly tossed and tumbled       and started from her sleep and turning oer     dreamed of a thousand wrecks oer which she stumbled       and handsome corpses strewed upon the shore

first flame       and young aurora kissed her lips with dew     taking her for a sister just the same       mistake you would have made on seeing the two     although the mortal quite as fresh and

cant say that she gave them any tea     but there were eggs fruit coffee bread fish honey     with scio wineand all for love not money                        cxlvi      and zoe when the eggs were ready and       the coffee made would fain have wakened juan     but haidée stopped her with her quick small hand       and without word a sign her finger drew on     her lip which zoe needs must understand       and the first breakfast spoilt prepared a new one     because her mistress would not let her break     that sleep which seemed as it would neer awake                        cxlvii      for still he lay and on his thin worn cheek       a purple hectic played like dying day     on the snowtops of distant hills the streak       of sufferance yet upon his forehead lay     where the blue veins looked shadowy shrunk and weak       and his black curls were dewy with the spray     which weighed upon them yet all damp and salt     mixed with the stony vapours of the vault                        cxlviii      and she bent oer him and he lay beneath       hushed as the babe upon its mothers breast     drooped as the willow when no winds can breathe       lulled like the depth of ocean when at rest     fair as the crowning rose of the whole wreath       soft as the callow cygnet in its nestbp     in short he was a very pretty fellow     although his woes had turned him rather yellow                        cxlix      he woke and gazed and would have slept again       but the fair face which met his eyes forbade     those eyes to close though weariness and pain       had further sleep a further pleasure made     for womans face was never formed in vain       for juan so that even when he prayed     he turned from grisly saints and martyrs hairy     to the sweet portraits of the virgin mary                        cl      and thus upon his elbow he arose       and looked upon the lady in whose cheek     the pale contended with the purple rose       as with an effort she began to speak     her eyes were eloquent her words would pose       although she told him in good modern greek     with an ionian accent low and sweet     that he was faint and must not talk but eat                        cli      now juan could not understand a word       being no grecian but he had an ear     and her voice was the warble of a bird155       so soft so sweet so delicately clear     that finer simpler music neer was heardbq       the sort of sound we echo with a tear     without knowing whyan overpowering tone     whence melody descends as from a throne                        clii      and juan gazed as one who is awoke       by a distant organ doubting if he be     not yet a dreamer till the spell is broke       by the watchman or some such reality     or by ones early valets curséd knock       at least it is a heavy sound to me     who like a morning slumberfor the night     shows stars and women in a better light                        cliii      and juan too was helped out from his dream       or sleep or whatsoeer it was by feeling     a most prodigious appetite the steam       of zoes cookery no doubt was stealing     upon his senses and the kindling beam       of the new fire which zoe kept up kneeling     to stir her viands made him quite awake     and long for food but chiefly a beefsteak                        cliv      but beef is rare within these oxless isles       goats flesh there is no doubt and kid and mutton     and when a holiday upon them smiles       a joint upon their barbarous spits they put on     but this occurs but seldom between whiles       for some of these are rocks with scarce a hut on     others are fair and fertile among which     this though not large was one of the most rich                        clv      i say that beef is rare and cant help thinking       that the old fable of the minotaurfrom     which our modern morals rightly shrinking       condemn the royal ladys taste who wore     a cows shape for a maskwas only sinking       the allegory a mere type no more     that pasiphae promoted breeding cattle     to make the cretans bloodier in battle                        clvi      for we all know that english people are       fed upon beefi wont say much of beer     because t is liquor only and being far       from this my subject has no business here     we know too they are very fond of war       a pleasurelike all pleasuresrather dear     so were the cretansfrom which i infer     that beef and battles both were owing to her                        clvii      but to resume the languid juan raised       his head upon his elbow and he saw     a sight on which he had not lately gazed       as all his latter meals had been quite raw     three or four things for which the lord he praised       and feeling still the famished vulture gnaw     he fell upon whateer was offered like     a priest a shark an alderman or pike                        clviii      he ate and he was well supplied and she       who watched him like a mother would have fed     him past all bounds because she smiled to see       such appetite in one she had deemed dead     but zoe being older than haidée       knew by tradition for she neer had read     that famished people must be slowly nurst     and fed by spoonfuls else they always burst                        clix      and so she took the liberty to state       rather by deeds than words because the case     was urgent that the gentleman whose fate       had made her mistress quit her bed to trace     the seashore at this hour must leave his plate       unless he wished to die upon the place     she snatched it and refused another morsel     saying he had gorged enough to make a horse ill                        clx      next theyhe being naked save a tattered       pair of scarce decent trowserswent to work     and in the fire his recent rags they scattered       and dressed him for the present like a turk     or greekthat is although it not much mattered       omitting turban slippers pistol dirk     they furnished him entire except some stitches     with a clean shirt and very spacious breeches                        clxi      and then fair haidée tried her tongue at speaking       but not a word could juan comprehend     although he listened so that the young greek in       her earnestness would neer have made an end     and as he interrupted not went eking       her speech out to her protégé and friend     till pausing at the last her breath to take     she saw he did not understand romaic                        clxii      and then she had recourse to nods and signs       and smiles and sparkles of the speaking eye     and read the only book she could the lines       of his fair face and found by sympathy     the answer eloquent where the soul shines       and darts in one quick glance a long reply     and thus in every look she saw expressed     a world of words and things at which she guessed                        clxiii      and now by dint of fingers and of eyes       and words repeated after her he took     a lesson in her tongue but by surmise       no doubt less of her language than her look     as he who studies fervently the skies       turns oftener to the stars than to his book     thus juan learned his alpha beta better     from haidées glance than any graven

that he fled       they saw not in themselves aught to condemn     each was the others mirror and but read       joy sparkling in their dark eyes like a gem     and knew such brightness was but the reflection     of their exchanging glances of affection                        xiv      the gentle pressure and the thrilling touch       the least glance better understood than words     which still

theirs was love in which the mind delights     to lose itself when the old world grows dull       and we are sick of its hack sounds and sights     intrigues adventures of the common school       its

means great       and juan was a boy of saintly breeding     so that there was no reason for their loves     more than for those of nightingales or doves                        xx      they gazed upon

      xxi      i know not why but in that hour tonight       even as they gazed a sudden tremor came     and swept as t were across their hearts delight       like the wind oer a harpstring or a flame     when one is shook in sound and one in sight       and thus some boding flashed through either frame     and called from juans breast a faint low sigh     while one new tear arose in haidées eye                        xxii      that large black prophet eye seemed to dilate       and follow far the disappearing sun     as if their last day of a happy date       with his broad bright and dropping orb were gone     juan gazed on her as to ask his fate       he felt a grief but knowing cause for none     his glance inquired of hers for some excuse     for feelings causeless or at least abstruse                        xxiii      she turned to him and smiled but in that sort       which makes not others smile then turned aside     whatever feeling shook her it seemed short       and mastered by her wisdom or her pride     when juan spoke tooit might be in sport       of this their mutual feeling she replied     if it should be sobutit cannot be     or i at least shall not survive to see                        xxiv      juan would question further but she pressed       his lip to hers and silenced him with this     and then dismissed the omen from her breast       defying augury with that fond kiss     and no doubt of all methods t is the best       some people prefer winet is not amiss     i have tried bothso those who would a part take     may choose between the headache and the

hardly know     and if i had to give a casting voice       for both sides i could many reasons show     and then decide without great wrong to either     it were much better to have both than neither                        xxvi      juan and haidée gazed upon each other       with swimming looks of speechless tenderness     which mixed all feelingsfriend child lover brother       all that the best can mingle and express     when two pure hearts are poured in one another       and love too much and yet can not love less     but almost sanctify the sweet excess     by the immortal wish and power

deep       for ever and anon a something shook     juan and shuddering oer his frame would creep       and haidées sweet lips murmured like a brook     a wordless music and her face so fair     stirred with her dream as roseleaves with the airdo                        xxx      or as the stirring of a deep clear stream       within an alpine hollow when the wind     walks oer it was she

 senseless to feel and with sealed eyes to seedp                        xxxi      she dreamed of being alone on the seashore       chained to a rock she knew not how but stir     she could not from the spot and the loud roar       grew and each wave rose roughly threatening her     and oer her upper lip they seemed to pour       until she sobbed for breath and soon they were     foaming oer her lone head so fierce and high     each broke to drown her yet she could not die                        xxxii      anonshe was released and then she strayed       oer the sharp shingles with her bleeding feet     and stumbled almost every step she made       and something rolled before her in a sheet     which she must still pursue howeer afraid       t was white and indistinct nor stopped to meet     her glance nor grasp for still she gazed and grasped     and ran but it escaped her as she clasped                        xxxiii      the dream changedin a cave240 she stood its walls       were hung with marble icicles the work     of ages on its waterfretted halls       where waves might wash and seals might breed and lurk     her hair was dripping and the very balls       of her black eyes seemed turned to tears and mirk     the sharp rocks looked below each drop they caught     which froze to marble as it fellshe thoughtdq                        xxxiv      and wet and cold and lifeless at her feet       pale as the foam that frothed on his dead brow     which she essayed in vain to clear how sweet       were once her cares how idle seemed they now     lay juan nor could aught renew the beat       of his quenched heart and the sea dirges low     rang in her sad ears like a mermaids song     and that brief dream appeared a life too long                        xxxv      and gazing on the dead she thought his face       faded or altered into something new     like to her fathers features till each trace       more like and like to lambros aspect grew     with all his keen worn look and grecian grace       and starting she awoke and what to view     oh powers of heaven what dark eye meets she there     t ist is her fathersfixed upon the pair

high and inscrutable the old man stood       calm in his voice and calm within his eye     not always signs with him of calmest mood       he looked upon her but gave no reply     then turned to juan in whose cheek the blood       oft came and went as there resolved to die     in arms at least he stood in act to spring     on the first foe whom lambros call might bring                        xl      young man your sword so lambro once more said       juan replied not while this arm is free     the old mans cheek grew pale but not with dread       and drawing from his belt a pistol he     replied your blood be then on your own head       then looked close at the flint as if to see     t was freshfor he had lately used the lock     and next proceeded quietly to cock

gentlemanly distance not too near       if you have got a former friend for foe     but after being fired at once or twice     the ear becomes more irish and less nice                        xlii

tall beyond her sex and their compeers       she drew up to her height as if to show     a fairer mark and with a fixed eye scanned     her fathers facebut never stopped his hand

     a pair of trousers of fleshcoloured silkff     next with a virgin zone he was equipped       which girt a slight chemise as white as milk     but tugging on his petticoat he tripped       whichas we sayor as the scotch say whilk295     the rhyme obliges me to this sometimes     monarchs are less imperative than rhymesfg                        lxxviii      whilk which or what you please was owing to       his garments novelty and his being awkward     and yet at last he managed to get through       his toilet though no doubt a little backward     the negro baba helped a little too       when some untoward part of raiment stuck hard     and wrestling both his arms into a gown     he paused and took a survey up and down                        lxxix      one difficulty still remainedhis hair       was hardly long enough but baba found     so many false long tresses all to spare       that soon his head was most completely crowned     after the manner then in fashion there       and this addition with such gems was bound     as suited the ensemble of his toilet     while baba made him comb his head and oil it                        lxxx      and now being femininely all arrayed       with some small aid from scissors paint and tweezers     he looked in almost all respects a maidfh       and baba smilingly exclaimed you see sirs     a perfect transformation here displayed       and now then you must come along with me sirs     that isthe lady clapping his hands twice     four blacks were at his elbow in a trice                        lxxxi      you sir said baba nodding to the one       will please to accompany those gentlemen     to supper but you worthy christian nun       will follow me no trifling sir for when     i say a thing it must at once be done       what fear you think you this a lions den     why t is a palace where the truly wise     anticipate the prophets paradise                        lxxxii      you fool i tell you no one means you harm       so much the better juan said for them     else they shall feel the weight of this my arm       which is not quite so light as you may deem     i yield thus far but soon will break the charm       if any take me for that which i seem     so that i trust for every bodys sake     that this disguise may lead to no mistake                        lxxxiii      blockhead come on and see quoth baba while       don juan turning to his comrade who     though somewhat grieved could scarce forbear a smile       upon the metamorphosis in view     farewell they mutually exclaimed this soil       seems fertile in adventures strange and new     ones turned half mussulman and one a maid     by this old black enchanters unsought aid                        lxxxiv      farewell said juan should we meet no more       i wish you a good appetitefarewell     replied the other though it grieves me sore       when we next meet well have a tale to tell     we needs must follow when fate puts from shore       keep your good name though eve herself once fell     nay quoth the maid the sultans self shant carry me     unless his highness promises to marry me                        lxxxv      and thus they parted each by separate doors       baba led juan onward room by room     through glittering galleries and oer marble floors       till a gigantic portal through the gloom     haughty and huge along the distance lowers       and wafted far arose a rich perfume     it seemed as though they came upon a shrine     for all was vast still fragrant and divine                        lxxxvi      the giant door was broad and bright and high       of gilded bronze and carved in curious guise     warriors thereon were battling furiously       here stalks the victor there the vanquished lies     there captives led in triumph droop the eye       and in perspective many a squadron flies     it seems the work of times before the line     of rome transplanted fell with constantine                        lxxxvii      this massy portal stood at the wide close       of a huge hall and on its either side     two little dwarfs the least you could suppose       were sate like ugly imps as if allied     in mockery to the enormous gate which rose       oer them in almost pyramidic pride     the gate so splendid was in all its features296     you never thought about those little creatures                        lxxxviii      until you nearly trod on them and then       you started back in horror to survey     the wondrous hideousness of those small men       whose colour was not black nor white nor grey     but an extraneous mixture which no pen       can trace although perhaps the pencil may     they were misshapen pigmies deaf and dumb     monsters who cost a no less monstrous sum                        lxxxix      their duty wasfor they were strong and though       they looked so little did strong things at times     to ope this door which they could really do       the hinges being as smooth as rogers rhymes     and now and then with tough strings of the bow       as is the custom of those eastern climes     to give some rebel pacha a cravat     for mutes are generally used for that                        xc      they spoke by signsthat is not spoke at all       and looking like two incubi they glared     as baba with his fingers made them fall       to heaving back the portal folds it scared     juan a moment as this pair so small       with shrinking serpent optics on him stared297     it was as if their little looks could poison     or fascinate whomeer they fixed their eyes on                        xci      before they entered baba paused to hint       to juan some slight lessons as his guide     if you could just contrive he said to stint       that somewhat manly majesty of stride     t would be as well andthough theres not much in t       to swing a little less from side to side     which has at times an aspect of the oddest     and also could you look a little modest                        xcii      t would be convenient for these mutes have eyes       like needles which may pierce those petticoats     and if they should discover your disguise       you know how near us the deep bosphorus floats     and you and i may chance ere morning rise       to find our way to marmora without boats     stitched up in sacksa mode of navigation     a good deal practised here upon occasion298                        xciii      with this encouragement he led the way       into a room still nobler than the last     a rich confusion formed a disarray       in such sort that the eye along it cast     could hardly carry anything away       object on object flashed so bright and fast     a dazzling mass of gems and gold and glitter     magnificently mingled in a litter                        xciv      wealth had done wonderstaste not much such things       occur in orient palaces and even     in the more chastened domes of western kings       of which i have also seen some six or seven     where i cant say or gold or diamond flings       great lustre there is much to be forgiven     groups of bad statues tables chairs and pictures     on which i cannot pause to make my strictures                        xcv      in this imperial hall at distance lay       under a canopy and there reclined     quite in a confidential queenly way       a lady baba stopped and kneeling signed     to juan who though not much used to pray       knelt down by instinct wondering in his mind     what all this meant while baba bowed and bended     his head until the ceremony ended                        xcvi      the lady rising up with such an air       as venus rose with from the wave on them     bent like an antelope a paphian pairfi       of eyes which put out each surrounding gem     and raising up an arm as moonlight fair       she signed to baba who first kissed the hem     of her deep purple robe and speaking low     pointed to juan who remained below                        xcvii      her presence was as lofty as her state       her beauty of that overpowering kind     whose force description only would abate       id rather leave it much to your own mind     than lessen it by what i could relate       of forms and features it would strike you blind     could i do justice to the full detail     so luckily for both my phrases fail                        xcviii      thus much however i may addher years       were ripe they might make sixandtwenty springs     but there are forms which time to touch forbears       and turns aside

de lenclos299                        xcix      she spake some words to her attendants who       composed a choir of girls ten or a dozen     and were all clad alike like juan too       who wore their uniform by baba chosen     they formed a very nymphlike looking crew300       which might have called dianas chorus cousin     as far as outward show may correspond     i wont be bail for anything beyond                        c      they bowed obeisance and withdrew retiring       but not by the same door through which came in     baba and juan which last stood admiring       at some small distance all he saw within     this strange saloon much fitted for inspiring       marvel and praise for both or none things win     and i must say i neer could see the very     great happiness of the nil admirari301                        ci      not to admire is all the art i know       plain truth dear murray needs few flowers of speech     to make men happy or to keep them so       so take it in the very words of creech     thus horace wrote we all know long ago       and thus pope302 quotes the precept to reteach     from his translation but had none admired     would pope have sung or horace been inspired303                        cii      baba when all the damsels were withdrawn       motioned to juan to approach and then     a second time desired him to kneel down       and kiss the ladys foot which maxim when     he heard repeated juan with a frown       drew himself up to his full height again     and said it grieved him but he could not stoop     to any shoe unless it shod the pope                        cii      baba indignant at this illtimed pride       made fierce remonstrances and then a threat     he muttered but the last was given aside       about a bowstringquite in vain not yet     would juan bend though t were to mahomets bride       theres nothing in the world like etiquette     in kingly chambers or imperial halls     as also at the race and county balls                        civ      he stood like atlas with a world of words       about his ears and nathless would not bend     the blood of all his lines castilian lords       boiled in his veins and rather than descend     to stain his pedigree a thousand swords       a thousand times of him had made an end     at length perceiving the foot could not stand     baba proposed that he should kiss the hand                        cv      here was an honourable compromise       a halfway house of diplomatic rest     where they might meet in much more peaceful guise       and juan now his willingness expressed     to use all fit and proper courtesies       adding that this was commonest and best     for through the south the custom still commands     the gentleman to kiss the ladys hands                        cvi      and he advanced though with but a bad grace       though on more thoroughbred304 or fairer fingers     no lips eer left their transitory trace       on such as these the lip too fondly lingers     and for one kiss would fain imprint a brace       as you will see if she you love shall bring hers     in contact and sometimes even a fair strangers     an almost twelvemonths constancy endangers                        cvii      the lady eyed him oer and oer and bade       baba retire which he obeyed in style     as if well used to the retreating trade       and taking hints in good part all the while     he whispered juan not to be afraid       and looking on him with a sort of smile     took leave with such a face of satisfaction     as good men wear who have done a virtuous action                        cviii      when he was gone there was a sudden change       i know not what might be the ladys thought     but oer her bright brow flashed a tumult strange       and into her clear cheek the blood was brought     bloodred as sunset summer clouds which range       the verge of heaven and in her large eyes wrought     a mixture of sensations might be scanned     of half voluptuousness and half command                        cix      her form had all the softness of her sex       her features all the sweetness of the devil     when he put on the cherub to perplex305       eve and paved god knows how the road to evil     the sun himself was scarce more free from specks       than she from aught at which the eye could cavil     yet somehow there was something somewhere wanting     as if she rather ordered than was granting                        cx      something imperial or imperious threw       a chain oer all she did that is a chain     was thrown as t were about the neck of you       and raptures self will seem almost a pain     with aught which looks like despotism in view       our souls at least are free and t is in vain     we would against them make the flesh obey     the spirit in the end will have its way                        cxi      her very smile was haughty though so sweet       her very nod was not an inclination     there was a selfwill even in her small feet       as though they were quite conscious of her station     they trod as upon necks and to complete       her state it is the custom of her nation     a poniard decked her girdle as the sign     she was a sultans bride thank heaven not mine                        cxii      to hear and to obey had been from birth       the law of all around her to fulfil     all phantasies which yielded joy or mirth       had been her slaves chief pleasure as her will     her blood was high her beauty scarce of earth       judge then if her caprices eer stood still     had she but been a christian ive a notion     we should have found out the perpetual motion                        cxiii      whateer she saw and coveted was brought       whateer she did not see if she supposed     it might be seen with diligence was sought       and when t was found straightway the bargain closed     there was no end unto the things she bought       nor to the trouble which her fancies caused     yet even her tyranny had such a grace     the women pardoned all except her facefk                        cxiv      juan the latest of her whims had caught       her eye in passing on his way to sale     she ordered him directly to be bought       and baba who had neer been known to fail     in any kind of mischief to be wrought       at all such auctions knew how to prevailfl     she had no prudence but he hadand this     explains the garb which juan took amiss                        cxv      his youth and features favoured the disguise       and should you ask how she a sultans bride     could risk or compass such strange phantasies       this i must leave sultanas to decide     emperors are only husbands in wives eyes       and kings and consorts oft are mystifiedfm     as we may ascertain with due precision     some by experience others by tradition                        cxvi      but to the main point where we have been tending       she now conceived all difficulties past     and deemed herself extremely condescending       when being made her property at last     without more preface in her blue eyes blending       passion and power a glance on him she cast     and merely saying christian canst thou love     conceived that phrase was quite enough to move                        cxvii      and so it was in proper time and place       but juan who had still his mind oerflowing     with haidées isle and soft ionian face       felt the warm blood which in his face was glowing     rush back upon his heart which filled apace       and left his cheeks as pale as snowdrops blowing     these words went through his soul like arab spears306     so that he spoke not but burst into tears                        cxviii      she was a good deal shocked not shocked at tears       for women shed and use them at their liking     but there is something when mans eye appears       wet still more disagreeable and striking     a womans teardrop melts a mans half sears       like molten lead as if you thrust a pike in     his heart to force it out for to be shorter     to them t is a relief to us a torture                        cxix      and she would have consoled but knew not how       having no equals nothing which had eer     infected her with sympathy till now       and never having dreamt what t was to bear     aught of a serious sorrowing kind although       there might arise some pouting petty care     to cross her brow she wondered how so near     her eyes anothers eye could shed a tear                        cxx      but nature teaches more than power can spoilfn       and when a strong although a strange sensation     movesfemale hearts are such a genial soil       for kinder feelings whatsoer their nation     they naturally pour the wine and oil       samaritans in every situation     and thus gulbeyaz though she knew not why     felt an odd glistening moisture in her eye                        cxxi      but tears must stop like all things else and soon       juan who for an instant had been moved     to such a sorrow by the intrusive tone       of one who dared to ask if he had loved     called back the stoic to his eyes which shone       bright with the very weakness he reproved     and although sensitive to beauty he     felt most indignant still at not being free                        cxxii      gulbeyaz for the first time in her days       was much embarrassed never having met     in all her life with aught save prayers and praise       and as she also risked her life to get     him whom she meant to tutor in loves ways       into a comfortable têteàtête     to lose the hour would make her quite a martyr     and they had wasted now almost a quarter                        cxxiii      i also would suggest the fitting time       to gentlemen in any such like case     that is to say in a meridian clime       with us there is more law given to the chase     but here a small delay forms a great crime       so recollect that the extremest grace     is just two minutes for your declaration     a moment more would hurt your reputation                        cxxiv      juans was good and might have been still better       but he had got haidée into his head     however strange he could not yet forget her       which made him seem exceedingly illbred     gulbeyaz who looked on him as her debtor       for having had him to her palace led     began to blush up to the eyes and then     grow deadly pale and then blush back again                        cxxv      at length in an imperial way she laid       her hand on his and bending on him eyes     which needed not an empire to persuade       looked into his for love where none replies     her brow grew black but she would not upbraid       that being the last thing a proud woman tries     she rose and pausing one chaste moment threw     herself upon his breast and there she grew                        cxxvi      this was an awkward test as juan found       but he was steeled by sorrow wrath and pride     with gentle force her white arms he unwound       and seated her all drooping by his side     then rising haughtily he glanced around       and looking coldly in her face he cried     the prisoned eagle will not pair nor i     serve a sultanas sensual phantasy                        cxxvii      thou askst if i can love be this the proof       how much i have lovedthat i love not thee     in this vile garb the distaff web and woof       were fitter for me love is for the free     i am not

cxxviii      this was a truth to us extremely trite       not so to her who neer had heard such things     she deemed her least command must yield delight       earth being only made for queens and kings     if hearts lay on the left side or the right       she hardly knew to such perfection brings     legitimacy its born votaries when     aware of their due royal rights oer men                        cxxix      besides as has been said she was so fair       as even in a much humbler lot had made     a kingdom or confusion anywhere       and also as may be presumed she laid     some stress on charms which seldom are if eer       by their possessors thrown into the shade     she thought hers gave a double right divine     and half of that opinions also mine                        cxxx

the late duc de richelieu then a young volunteer in the russian service and afterward the founder and benefactor of odessa where his name and memory can never cease to be regarded with reverence  in the course of these cantos a stanza or two will be found relative to the late marquis of londonderry320 but written some time before his decease had that persons oligarchy died with him they would have been suppressed as it is i am aware of nothing in the manner of his death or of his life to prevent the free expression of the opinions of all whom his whole existence was consumed in endeavouring to enslave that he was an amiable man in private life may or may not be true but with this the public have nothing to do and as to lamenting his death it will be time enough when ireland has ceased to mourn for his birth as a minister i for one of millions looked upon him as the most despotic in intention and the weakest in intellect that ever tyrannised over a country it is the first time indeed since the normans that england has been insulted by a minister at least who could not speak english and that parliament permitted itself to be dictated to in the language of mrs malaprop  of the manner of his death little need be said except that if a poor radical such as waddington or watson321 had cut his throat he would have been buried in a crossroad with the usual appurtenances of the stake and mallet but the minister was an elegant lunatica sentimental suicidehe merely cut the carotid artery blessings on their learning and lo the pageant and the abbey and the syllables of dolour yelled forth322 by the newspapersand the harangue of the coroner in a eulogy over the bleeding body of the deceasedan anthony worthy of such a cæsarand the nauseous and atrocious cant of a degraded crew of conspirators against all that is sincere and honourable in his death he was necessarily one of two things by the law323a felon or a madmanand in either case no great subject for panegyric324 in his life he waswhat all the world knows and half of it will feel for years to come unless his death prove a moral lesson to the surviving sejani325 of europe it may at least serve as some consolation to the nations that their oppressors are not happy and in some instances judge so justly of their own actions as to anticipate the sentence of mankind let us hear no more of this man

the following sentences are taken from the report of the inquest contained in the annual biography and obituary for the year 1823 vol vii p 57 as a public man it is impossible for me to weigh his character in any scales that i can hold in private life i believe the world will admit that a more amiable man could not be found if it should unfortunately appear that there is not sufficient evidence to prove what is generally considered the indication of a disordered mind i trust that the jury will pay some attention to my humble opinion which is that no man can be in his proper senses at the moment he commits so rash an act as selfmurder the bible declares that a man clings to nothing so strongly as his own life i therefore view it as an axiom and an abstract principle that a man must necessarily be out of his mind at the moment of destroying himself byron probably read the report of the inquest in cobbetts weekly register august 17 1822 vol 43 pp 389425 the eulogy was in

made to tread     but rather skim the earth while dudùs form       looked more adapted to be put to bed     being somewhat large and languishing and lazy     yet of a beauty that would drive you crazy

such stuff     nor show your georgian ignorancefor shame       said lolah with an accent rather rough     to poor katinka spains an island near     morocco betwixt egypt and tangier                        xlv      dudù said nothing but sat down beside       juanna playing with her veil or hair     and looking at her steadfastly she sighed       as if she pitied her for being there     a pretty stranger without friend or guide       and all abashed too at the general stare     which welcomes hapless strangers in all places     with kind remarks upon their mien and faces

sleep alone quoth she       the matron frowned why sofor fear of ghosts     replied katinka i am sure i see       a phantom upon each of the four posts     and then i have the worst dreams that can be

t was on the whole a nobly furnished hall     with all things ladies want save one or two     and even those were nearer than they knew                        lii      dudù as has been said was a sweet creature       not very dashing but extremely winning     with the most regulated charms of feature       which painters cannot catch like faces sinning     against proportionthe wild strokes of nature       which they hit off at once in the beginning     full of expression right or wrong that strike     and pleasing or unpleasing still are like                        liii      but she was a soft landscape of mild earth       where all was harmony and calm and quiet     luxuriant budding cheerful without mirth       which if not happiness is much more nigh it     than are your mighty

but she was pensive more than melancholy       and serious more than pensive and serene     it may be more than eithernot unholy       her thoughts at least till now appear to have been     the

she gave juanna a chaste kiss       dudú was fond of kissingwhich im sure     that nobody can ever take amiss       because t is pleasant so that it be pure     and between females means no more than this       that they have nothing better near or newer     kiss rhymes to bliss in fact as well as verse     i wish it never led to something worse                        lx      in perfect innocence

dress       were laid aside but not before she offered     her aid to fair juanna whose excess       of modesty declined the assistance proffered     which passed well offas she could do no less

she screamed out                        lxxi      and that so loudly that upstarted all       the oda in a general commotion     matron and maids and those whom you may call       neither came crowding like the waves of ocean     one on the other throughout the whole hall       all trembling wondering without the least notion     more than i have myself of what could make     the calm dudù so turbulently wake                        lxxii      but wide awake she was and round her bed       with floating draperies and with flying hair     with eager eyes and light but hurried tread       and bosoms arms and ankles glancing bare     and bright as any meteor ever bred       by the north polethey sought her cause of care     for she seemed agitated flushed and frightened     her eye

    in holy matrimony snores away     not all the clamour broke her happy state       of slumber ere they shook herso they say     at leastand then she too unclosed her eyes     and yawned a good deal with discreet surprisegy                        lxxiv      and now commenced a strict investigation       which as all spoke at once and more than once     conjecturing wondering asking a narration       alike might puzzle either wit or dunce     to answer in a very clear oration       dudú had never passed for wanting sense     but being no orator as brutus is353     could not at first expound what was amiss                        lxxv      at length she said that in a slumber sound       she dreamed a dream of walking in a wood     a wood obscure like that where dante found354       himself in at the age when all grow goodgz     lifes halfway house where dames with virtue crowned       run much less risk of lovers turning rude     and that this wood was full of pleasant fruits     and trees of goodly growth and spreading roots                        lxxvi      and in the midst a golden apple grew       a most prodigious pippinbut it hung     rather too high and distant that she threw       her glances on it and then longing flung     stones and whatever she could pick up to       bring down the fruit which still perversely clung     to its own bough and dangled yet in sight     but always at a most provoking heightha                        lxxvii      that on a sudden when she least had hope       it fell down of its own accord before     her feet that her first movement was to stoop       and pick it up and bite it to the core     that just as her young lip began to opehb       upon the golden fruit the vision bore     a bee flew out and stung her to the heart     and soshe woke with a great scream and start                        lxxviii      all this she told with some confusion and       dismay the usual consequence of dreams     of the unpleasant kind with none at hand       to expound their vain and visionary gleams     ive known some odd ones which seemed really planned       prophetically or that which one deems     a strange coincidence to use a phrase     by which such things are settled nowadays355                        lxxix      the damsels who had thoughts of some great harm       began as is the consequence of fear     to scold a little at the false alarm       that broke for nothing on their sleeping ear     the matron too was wroth to leave her warm       bed for the dream she had been obliged to hear     and chafed at poor dudù who only sighed     and said that she was sorry she had cried                        lxxx      ive heard of stories of a cock and bull       but visions of an apple and a bee     to take us from

highnesss physician     will say to this hysteric of a vision                        lxxxi      and poor juanna too the childs first night       within these walls to be broke in upon     with such a clamouri had thought it right       that the young stranger should not lie alone     and as the quietest of all she might       with you dudù a good nights rest have known     but now i must transfer

from the scolding or the vision       implored that present pardon might be shown     for this first fault and that on no condition       she added in a soft and piteous tone     juanna should be taken from her and     her future dreams should be all kept in hand                        lxxxiii      she promised never more to have a dream       at least to dream so loudly as just now     she wondered at herself how she could scream       t was foolish nervous as she must allow     a fond hallucination and a theme       for laughterbut she felt her spirits low     and begged they would excuse her shed get over     this weakness in a few hours and recover                        lxxxiv      and here juanna kindly interposed       and said she felt herself extremely well     where she then was as her sound sleep disclosed       when all around rang like a tocsin bell     she did not find herself the least disposed       to quit her gentle partner and to dwell     apart from one who had no sin to show     save that of dreaming once malàpropos                        lxxxv      as thus juanna spoke dudù turned round       and hid her face within juannas breast     her neck alone was seen but that was found       the colour of a budding roses cresthc     i cant tell why she blushed nor can expound       the mystery of this rupture of their test     all that i know is that the

and information     of what had passed since all the slaves retired       and whether he had occupied their station     if matters had been managed as desired       and his disguise with due

hoped indeed he thought he could be sure       juan had not betrayed himself in fact     t was certain that his conduct had been pure       because a foolish or imprudent act     would not alone have made him insecure       but ended in his being found out and sacked     and thrown into the seathus baba spoke     of all save dudùs dream which was no joke                        cv      this he

and such their creed was till they were invaded     when it grew rather late to set things right       but as the danube could not well be waded     they looked upon the muscovite flotilla     and only shouted allah and bis millah                        xiv      the russians now were ready to attack       but oh ye goddesses of war and glory     how shall i spell the name of each cossacque

country or its crown       but wishing to be one day brigadiers     also to have the sacking of a town       a pleasant thing to young men at their years     mongst them were several englishmen of pith     sixteen called thomson and nineteen named smith                        xix      jack thomson and bill thomsonall the rest       had been called jemmy after the great bard     i dont know whether they had arms or crest       but such a godfathers as good a card     three of the smiths were peters but the best       amongst them all hard blows to inflict or ward     was he since so renowned in country quarters     at halifax381 but now he served the tartars                        xx      the rest were jacks and gills and wills and bills       but when ive added that the elder jack smith     was born in cumberland among the hills       and that his father was an honest blacksmith     ive said all i know of a name that fills       three lines of the despatch in taking schmacksmith     a village of moldavias waste wherein     he fell immortal in a bulletin                        xxi      i wonder although mars no doubts a god i       praise if a mans name in a bulletin     may make up for a bullet in his body       i hope this little question is no sin     because though i am but a simple noddy       i think one shakespeare puts the same thought in     the mouth of some one in his plays so doting     which many people pass for wits by quoting382                        xxii      then there were frenchmen gallant young and gay       but im too great a patriot to record     their gallic names upon a glorious day       id rather tell ten lies than say a word     of truthsuch truths are treason they betray       their country and as traitors are

isle near ismail had two ends in view     the first was to bombard it and knock down       the public buildings and the private too     no matter what poor souls might be undonehl       the citys shape suggested this t is true     formed like an amphitheatreeach dwelling     presented a fine mark to throw a shell in383                        xxiv      the second object was to profit by       the moment of the general consternation     to attack the turks flotilla which lay nigh       extremely tranquil anchored at its station     but a third motive was as probably       to frighten them into capitulation384     a phantasy which sometimes seizes warriors     unless they are game as bulldogs and foxterriershm                        xxv      a habit rather blameable which is       that of despising those we combat with     common in many cases was in this       the cause385 of killing tchitchitzkoff and smith     one of the valorous smiths whom we shall miss       out of those nineteen who late rhymed to pith     but t is a name so spread oer sir and madam     that one would think the first who bore it adam                        xxvi      the russian batteries were incomplete       because they were constructed in a hurry386     thus the same cause which makes a verse want feet       and throws a cloud oer longman and john murray     when the sale of new books is not so fleet       as they who print them think is necessary     may likewise put off for a time what story     sometimes calls murder and at others glory                        xxvii      whether it was their engineers stupidity       their haste or waste i neither know nor care     or some contractors personal cupidity       saving his soul by cheating in the ware     of homicide but there was no solidity       in the new batteries erected there     they either missed or they were never missed     and added greatly to the missing list                        xxviii      a sad miscalculation about distance       made all their naval matters incorrect     three fireships lost their amiable existence       before they reached a spot to take effect     the match was lit too soon and no assistance       could remedy this lubberly defect     they blew up in the middle of the river     while though t was dawn the turks slept fast as ever387                        xxix      at seven they rose however and surveyed       the russ flotilla getting under way     t was nine when still advancing undismayed       within a cables length their vessels lay     off ismail and commenced a cannonade       which was returned with interest i may say     and by a fire of musketry and grape     and shells and shot of every size and shape388                        xxx      for six hours bore they without intermission       the turkish fire and aided by their own     land batteries worked their guns with great precision       at length they found mere cannonade alone     by no means would produce the towns submission       and made a signal to retreat at one     one bark blew up a second near the works     running aground was taken by the turks389                        xxxi      the moslem too had lost both ships and men       but when they saw the enemy retire     their delhis390 manned some boats and sailed again       and galled the russians with a heavy fire     and tried to make a landing on the main       but here the effect fell short of their desire     count damas drove them back into the water     pellmell and with a whole gazette of slaughter391                        xxxii      if says the historian here i could report       all that the russians did upon this day     i think that several volumes would fall short       and i should still have many things to say392     and so he says no morebut pays his court       to some distinguished strangers in that fray     the prince de ligne and langeron and damas     names great as any that the roll of fame has393                        xxxiii      this being the case may show us what fame is       for out of these three preux chevaliers how     many of common readers give a guess       that such existed and they may live now     for aught we know renowns all hit or miss       theres fortune even in fame we must allow     t is true the memoirs of the prince de ligne394     have half withdrawn from him oblivions screen                        xxxiv      but here are men who fought in gallant actions       as gallantly as ever heroes fought     but buried in the heap of such transactions       their names are rarely found nor often sought     thus even good fame may suffer sad contractions       and is extinguished sooner than she ought     of all our modern battles i will bet     you cant repeat nine names from each gazette                        xxxv      in short this last attack though rich in glory       showed that somewhere somehow there was a fault     and admiral ribas395 known in russian story       most strongly recommended an assault     in which he was opposed by young and hoary       which made a long debate but i must halt     for if i wrote down every warriors speech     i doubt few readers eer would mount the breach                        xxxvi      there was a man if that he was a man       not that his manhood could be called in question     for had he not been hercules his span       had been as short in youth as indigestion     made his last illness when all worn and wan       he died beneath a tree as much unblest on     the soil of the green province he had wasted     as eer was locust on the land it blasted                        xxxvii      this was potemkin396a great thing in days       when homicide and harlotry made great     if stars and titles could entail long praise       his glory might half equal his estate     this fellow being six foot high could raise       a kind of phantasy proportionate     in the then sovereign of the russian people     who measured men as you would do a steeple                        xxxviii      while things were in abeyance ribas sent       a courier to the prince and he succeeded     in ordering matters after his own bent       i cannot tell the way in which he pleaded     but shortly he had cause to be content       in the mean time the batteries proceeded     and fourscore cannon on the danubes border     were briskly fired and answered in due order397                        xxxix      but on the thirteenth when already part       of the troops were embarked the siege to raise     a

cause     been one to which a good heart could be partial       defence of freedom country or of laws     but as it was mere lust of power to oerarch all       with its proud brow it merits slight applause     save for its style which said all in a trice     you will take ismail at whatever price399                        xli      let there be light said god and there was light       let there

about it in a heat     but here i say the turks were much mistaken     who hating hogs yet wished to save their bacon                        xliii      for on the sixteenth at full gallop drew       in sight two horsemen who were deemed cossacques     for some time till they came in nearer view       they had but little baggage at their backs     for there were but three shirts between the two       but on they rode upon two ukraine hacks     till in approaching were at length descried     in this plain pair suwarrow and his guide402                        xliv      great joy to london now

    t is thus the spirit of a single mind       makes that of multitudes take one direction     as roll the waters to the breathing wind       or roams the herd beneath the bulls protection     or as

supplementary despatches 1865 xii 271546 byron probably drew his own conclusions as to the kinnairdmarinet incident from the letter to the duke of wellington on the arrest of m marinet by lord kinnaird 1818 the story which is full of interest may be briefly recounted on january 30 1818 lord kinnaird informed sir george murray chief of the staff of the army of occupation that a person whose name he withheld had revealed to him the existence of a plot to assassinate the duke of wellington at 1230 am february 11 1818 the duke on returning to his hotel was fired at by an unknown person and then but not till then he wrote to urge lord clancarty to advise the prince regent to take steps to persuade or force kinnaird to disclose the name of his informant a mr gw chad of the consular service was empowered to proceed to brussels and to seek an interview with kinnaird he carried with him among other documents a letter from the duke to lord clancarty dated february 12 1818 a postscript contained this intimation it may be proper to mention to you that the french government are disposed to go every length in the way of negotiation with the person mentioned by lord kinnaird or others to discover the plot  kinnaird absolutely declined to give up the name of his informant but acting on the strength of the postscript which had been read but not shown to him started for paris with the great unknown some days after their arrival and while kinnaird was a guest of the duke the man was arrested and discovered to be one nicholle or marinet who had been appointed receveur under the restored government of louis xviii but during the cent jours had fled to belgium retaining the funds he had amassed during his term of office kinnaird regarded this action of the french government as a breach of faith and in a memorial to the french chamber of peers and his letter maintained that the dukes postscript implied a promise of a safe conduct for marinet to and from paris to brussels the duke on the other hand was equally positive see his letter to lord liverpool may 30 1818 that he never intended to have any negotiations with anybody kinnaird was a dog with a bad name he had been accused see his letter to the earl of liverpool 1816 p 16 of the promulgation of dangerous opinions and of intimacy with persons suspected the duke speaks of him as the friend of revolutionists it is evident that he held the dangerous doctrine that a promise to a rogue is a promise and that the authorities took a different view of the ethics of the situation it is clear too that the dukes postscript was ambiguous but that it did not warrant the assumption that if marinet went to paris he should be protected the air was full of plots the great duke despised and was inclined to ignore the pistol or the dagger of the assassin but he believed that mischief was afoot and that great personages might or might not be responsible he was beset by difficulties at every turn and would have been more than mortal if he had put too favourable a construction on the scruples or condoned the imprudence of a friend of revolutionists  374480 the reference may be to the duke

ive known a dozen weddings made even thus       and some of them high names i have also known     young men whothough they hated to discuss       pretensions which they never dreamed to have shown     yet neither frightened by a female fuss       nor by mustachios moved were let alone     and lived as did the brokenhearted fair     in happier plight than if they formed a pair

metaphysics       that labyrinth whose clue is of the same     construction as your cures for hectic phthisics       those bright moths fluttering round a dying flame     and this reflection brings me to plain physics       and to the beauties of a foreign dame     compared with those of our pure pearls of price     those polar summers all sun and some icelu641                        lxxiii      or say they are like virtuous mermaids whose       beginnings are fair faces ends mere fishes     not that theres not a quantity of those       who have a due respect for their own wishes     like russians rushing from hot baths to snows642       are they at bottom virtuous even when vicious     they warm into a scrape but keep of course     as a reserve a plunge into remorse                        lxxiv      but this has nought to do with their outsides       i said that juan did not think them pretty     at the first blush for a fair briton hides       half her attractionsprobably from pityand     rather calmly into the heart glides       than storms it as a foe would take a city     but once there if you doubt this prithee trylv     she keeps it for you like a true ally                        lxxv      she cannot step as does an arab barb643       or andalusian girl from mass returning     nor wear as gracefully as gauls her garb       nor in her eye ausonias glance is burning     her voice though sweet is not so fit to warb       le those bravuras which i still am learning     to like though i have been seven years in italy     and have or had an ear that served me prettily                        lxxvi      she cannot do these things nor one or two       others in that offhand and dashing style     which takes so muchto give the devil his due       nor is she quite so ready with her smile     nor settles all things in one interview       a thing approved as saving time and toil     but though the soil may give you time and trouble     well cultivated it will render double                        lxxvii      and if in fact she takes to a grande passion       it is a very serious thing indeed     nine times in ten t is but caprice or fashion       coquetry or a wish to take the lead     the pride of a mere child with a new sash on       or wish to make a rivals bosom bleed     but the tenth instance will be a tornado     for theres no saying what they will or may do                        lxxviii      the reasons obvious if theres an éclat       they lose their caste at once as do the parias     and when the delicacies of the law       have filled their papers with their comments various     society that china without flaw       the hypocrite will banish them like marius     to sit amidst the ruins of their guilt644     for fames a carthage not so

settle their own score     abroad though doubtless they do much amiss       an erring woman finds an opener door     for her return to virtueas they call     that lady who should be at home to alllw                        lxxx      for me i leave the matter where i find it       knowing that such uneasy virtue leads     people some ten times less in fact to mind it       and care but for discoveries and not deeds     and as for chastity youll never bind it       by all the laws the strictest lawyer pleads     but aggravate the crime you have not prevented     by rendering desperate those who had else repented                        lxxxi      but juan was no casuist nor had pondered       upon the moral lessons of mankind     besides he had not seen of several hundred       a lady altogether to his mind     a little blasét is not to be wondered       at that his heart had got a tougher rind     and though not vainer from his past success     no doubt his sensibilities were less                        lxxxii      he also had been busy seeing sights       the parliament and all the other houses     had sat beneath the gallery at nights       to hear debates whose thunder roused not rouses     the world to gaze upon those northern lights       which flashed as far as where the muskbull browses645     he had also stood at times behind the throne     but grey646 was not arrived and chatham gone647                        lxxxiii      he saw however at the closing session       that noble sight when really free the nation     a king in constitutional possession       of such a throne as is the proudest station     though despots know it nottill the progression       of freedom shall complete their education     t is not mere splendour makes the show august     to eye or heartit is the peoples trust                        lxxxiv      there too he saw whateer he may be now       a prince the prince of princes at the time648     with fascination in his very bow       and full of promise as the spring of prime     though royalty was written on his brow       he had then the grace too rare in every clime     of being without alloy of fop or beau     a finished gentleman from top to toe649                        lxxxv      and juan was received as hath been said       into the best society and there     occurred what often happens im afraid       however disciplined and debonnaire     the talent and good humour he displayed       besides the marked distinction of his air     exposed him as was natural to temptation     even though himself avoided the occasion                        lxxxvi      but what and where with whom and when and why       is not to be put hastily together     and as my object is morality       whatever people say i dont know

henry who was cautious as       reserve and pride could make him and full slow     in judging menwhen once his judgment was       determined right or wrong on friend or foe     had all the pertinacity pride has       which knows no ebb to its imperious flow     and loves or hates disdaining to be guided     because its own good pleasure hath decided                        xvii      his friendships

the same     because bold britons have a tongue and free quill       at which all modern nations vainly aim     and the lord henry was a great debater     so that few members kept the house up later                        xxi      these were advantages and then he thought       it was his foible but by no means sinister     that few or none more than himself had caught       court mysteries having been himself a minister     he liked to teach that which he had been taught       and greatly shone whenever there had been a stir     and reconciled all qualities which grace man     always a patriotand sometimes a placeman                        xxii      he liked the gentle spaniard for his gravity       he almost honoured him for his docility     because though young he acquiesced with suavity       or contradicted but with proud humility     he knew the world and would not see depravity       in faults which sometimes show the soils fertility     if that the weeds oerlive not the first crop     for then they are very difficult to stop                        xxiii      and then he talked with him about madrid       constantinople and such distant places     where people always

andalusian     could back660 a horse as despots ride a russian                        xxiv      and thus acquaintance grew at noble routs       and diplomatic dinners or at other     for juan stood well both with ins and outs       as in freemasonry a higher brother     upon his talent henry had no doubts       his manner showed him sprung from a high mother     and all men like to show their

  and apt to sow an authors wheat with tares       reaping allusions private and inglorious     where none were dreamt of unto loves affairs       which were or are or are to be notorious     that therefore do i previously declare     lord henrys mansion was in blankblank square                        xxvi      also there bin662 another pious reason       for making squares and streets anonymous     which is that there is scarce a single season       which doth not shake some very splendid house     with some slight heartquake of domestic treason       a topic scandal doth delight

juan a recherché welcome guest     as many other noble scions were       and some who had but talent for their crest     or wealth which is a passport everywhere       or even mere fashion which indeeds the best     recommendation and to be well dressed     will very often supersede the rest                        xxix      and since theres safety in a multitude       of counsellors as solomon has said     or some one for him in some sage grave mood       indeed we see the daily proof displayed     in senates at the bar in wordy feud       whereer collective wisdom can parade

shield which leaves but little merit     to virtue proper or good education       her chief resource was in her own high spirit     which judged mankind at their due estimation       and for coquetry

which neer can pass the equinoctial line       of anything which nature would express     just as a mandarin finds nothing fine       at least his manner suffers not to guess     that anything he views can greatly please     perhaps we have borrowed this from the chinesema                        xxxv      perhaps from horace his nil admirari       was what he called the art of happiness     an

good society     were nothing but a moral inebriety                        xxxvi      but adeline was not indifferent for       now for a commonplace beneath the snow     as a volcano holds the lava

not forgotten he could not forget that enchanted and enchanting scene  newstead abbey or priory was founded by henry ii by way of deodand or expiation for the murder of thomas becket lands which bordered the valley of the leen and which had formed part of sherwood forest were assigned for the use and endowment of a chapter of black canons regular of the order of st augustine and on a site by the riverside to the south of the forest uplands stanza lv lines 58 the new stede or place or station arose it was a norman abbey stanza lv line 1 which the black canons dedicated to our lady and here and there in the cloisters traces of norman architecture remain but the enlargement and completion of the monastery was carried out in successive stages and transition periods in a style or styles which perhaps more by hap than by cunning byron rightly named mixed gothic stanza lv line 4 to work their mills and perhaps to drain the marshy valley the monks dammed the leen and excavated a chain of lakesthe largest to the northwest byrons lucid lake a second to the south of the abbey and a third now surrounded with woods and overlooked by the wicked lords ragged rock below the abbey half a mile to the southeast the cascade which flows over and through a stonework sluice and forms a rocky waterfall issues from the upper lake and is in full view of the west front of the abbey almost at right angles to these lakes are three ponds the forest pond to the north of the stone wall which divides the garden from the forest the square eagle pond in the monks garden and the narrow stewpond bordered on either side with overhanging yews which drains into the second or garden lake byron does not enlarge on this double chain of lakes and ponds and perhaps for the sake of pictorial unity converts the second if a second then existed and third lakes into a river  the abbey which at the dissolution of monasteries in 1539 was handed over by henry viii to sir john byron steward and warden of the forest of shirewood was converted here and there more or less into a baronial mansion stanza lxvi it is roughly speaking a square block of buildings flanking the sides of a grassy quadrangle surrounding the quadrangle are twostoried cloisters and in the centre a gothic fountain stanza lxv line 1 of composite workmanship the upper portion of the stonework is hexagonal and is ornamented with a double row of gargoyles all monsters and no saints recalling perhaps identical with the seven deadly sins gargoyles still in situ in the quadrangle of magdalen college oxford the lower half which belongs to the seventeenth or eighteenth century is hollowed into niches of a roman or classical design in byrons time the fountain stood in a courtyard in front of the abbey but before he composed this canto it had been restored by colonel wildman to its original place within the quadrangle byron was acquainted with the change and writes accordingly when the byrons took possession of the abbey the upper stories of the cloisters were converted on three sides of the quadrangle into galleries and on the fourth the north side into a library abutting on the cloisters are the monastic buildings proper in part transformed but with much of the monastic preserved on the west the front of the abbey the ground floor consists of the entrance hall and monks parlour and above the guests refectory or banquetinghall and the priors parlour on the south the xenodochium or guesten hall and above the monks refectory or grand drawingroom on the south and east on the ground floor the priors lodgings the chapter house the exquisite small chapel stanza lxvi line 5 the slype or passage between church and chapter house and in the upper story the state bedrooms named after the kings edward iii henry vii etc who by the terms of the grant of land to the prior and canons were entitled to free quarters in the abbey during byrons brief tenure of newstead and for long years before these huge halls long galleries and spacious chambers stanza lxxvii line 1 were half dismantled and in a more or less ruinous condition a few pictures remained on the walls of the great drawingroom of the priors

exception it is a screen and nothing more in the centre is the mighty window stanza lxii line 1 shorn of glass and tracery above are six lancet windows which byron seems to have regarded as niches and above again in a higher niche stanza lxi line 1 is the crowned virgin with the babe in her arms which escaped as by a miracle the fiery dartsthe shot and cannonballs of the cromwellian troopers on either side of the central window are two blank windows containing tracery geometrical decorated  carved in relief on the solid ashlar on either side of the window and at the northern and southern extremities of the front are buttresses with canopied niches in each of which a saint or apostle must once have stood over the west door there is the mutilated figure of  the saviour but of twelve saints or twelve niches there is no trace the grand arch is an ivyclad screen and nothing more behind and beyond in place of vanished nave of aisle and transept is the smooth green turf and at the

then there wasbut why should i go on       unless the ladies should go offthere was     indeed a certain fair and fairy one       of the best class and better than her class     aurora raby a young star who shone       oer life too sweet an image for such glass     a lovely being scarcely formed or moulded     a rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded                        xliv      rich noble but an orphanleft an only       child to the care of guardians good and kind     but still her aspect had an air so lonely       blood is not water and where shall we find     feelings of youth like those which overthrown lie       by death when we are left alas behind     to feel in friendless palaces a home     is wanting and our best ties in the tomb                        xlv      early in years and yet more infantine       in figure she had something of sublime     in eyes which sadly shone as seraphs shine       all youthbut with an aspect beyond time     radiant and graveas pitying mans decline       mournfulbut mournful of anothers crime     she looked as if she sat by edens door     and grieved for those who could return no more                        xlvi      she was a catholic too sincere austere       as far as her own gentle heart allowed     and deemed that fallen worship far more dear       perhaps because t was fallen her sires were proud     of deeds and days when they had filled the ear       of nations and had never bent or bowed     to novel power and as she was the last     she held their old faith and old feelings fast                        xlvii      she gazed upon a world she scarcely knew       as seeking not to know it silent lone     as grows a flower thus quietly she grew       and kept her heart serene within its zone     there was awe in the homage which she drew       her spirit seemed as seated on a throne     apart from the surrounding world and strong     in its own strengthmost strange in one so young                        xlviii      now it so happened in the catalogue       of adeline aurora was omitted     although her birth and wealth had given her vogue       beyond the charmers we have already cited     her beauty also seemed to form no clog       against her being mentioned as well fitted     by many virtues to be worth the trouble     of single gentlemen who would be double                        xlix      and this omission like that of the bust       of brutus at the pageant of tiberius750     made juan wonder as no doubt he must       this he expressed half smiling and half serious     when adeline replied with some disgust       and with an air to say the least imperious     she marvelled what he saw in such a baby     as that prim silent cold aurora raby                        l      juan rejoinedshe was a catholic       and therefore fittest as of his persuasion     since he was sure his mother would fall sick       and the pope thunder excommunication     if but here adeline who seemed to pique       herself extremely on the inoculation     of others with her own opinions stated     as usualthe same reason which she late did                        li      and wherefore not a reasonable reason       if good is none the worse for repetition     if bad the best ways certainly to tease on       and amplify you lose much by concision     whereas insisting in or out of season       convinces all men even a politician     orwhat is just the sameit wearies out     so the ends gained what signifies the route                        lii      why adeline had this slight prejudice       for prejudice it wasagainst a creature     as pure as sanctity itself from vice       with all the added charm of form and feature     for me appears a question far too nice       since adeline was liberal by nature     but natures nature and has more caprices     than i have time or will to take to pieces                        liii      perhaps she did not like the quiet way       with which aurora on those baubles looked     which charm most people in their earlier day       for there are few things by mankind less brooked     and womankind too if we so may say       than finding

of mankind     it was notbut t is easier far alas     to say what it was not than what it was                        lv      little aurora deemed she was the theme       of such discussion she was there a guest     a beauteous ripple of the brilliant stream       of rank and youth though purer than the rest     which flowed on for a moment in the beam       time sheds a moment oer each sparkling crest     had she known this she would have calmly smiled     she had so much or little of the child                        lvi      the dashing and proud air of adeline       imposed not upon her she saw her blaze     much as she would have seen a glowworm shine       then turned unto the stars for loftier rays     juan was something she could not divine       being no sibyl in the new worlds ways     yet she was nothing dazzled by the meteor     because she did not pin her faith on feature                        lvii      his fame toofor he had that kind of fame       which sometimes plays the deuce with womankind     a heterogeneous mass of glorious blame       half virtues and whole vices being combined     faults which attract because they are not tame       follies tricked out so brightly that they blind     these seals upon her wax made no impression     such was her coldness or her selfpossession                        lviii      juan knew nought of such a character       high yet resembling not his lost haidée     yet each was radiant in her proper sphere       the island girl bred up by the lone sea     more warm as lovely and not less sincere

two     hast ever had the gout i have not had it     but i may have and you too reader dread it                        lxxiii      the simple olives best allies of wine       must i pass over in my bill of fare     i must although a favourite plat of mine       in spain and lucca athens everywhere     on them and bread twas oft my luck to dine       the grass my tablecloth in open air     on sunium or hymettus like diogenes     of whom half my philosophy the progeny is758                        lxxiv      amidst this tumult of fish flesh and fowl       and vegetables all in masquerade     the guests were placed according to their roll       but various as the various meats displayed     don juan sat next an à lespagnole       no damsel but a dish as hath been saidnx     but so far like a lady that twas drest     superbly and contained a world of zest                        lxxv      by some odd chance too he was placed between       aurora and the lady adeline     a situation difficult i ween       for man therein with eyes and heart to dine     also the conference which we have seen       was not such as to encourage him to shine     for adeline addressing few words to him     with two transcendent eyes seemed to look through him                        lxxvi      i sometimes almost think that eyes have ears       this much is sure that out of earshot things     are somehow echoed to the pretty dears       of which i cant tell whence their knowledge springs     like that same mystic music of the spheres       which no one hears so loudly though it rings     tis wonderful how oft the sex have heard     long dialogueswhich passed without a word                        lxxvii      aurora sat with that indifference       which piques a preux chevalieras it ought     of all offences thats the worst offence       which seems to hint you are not worth a thought     now juan though no coxcomb in pretence       was not exactly pleased to be so caught     like a good ship entangled among ice     and after so much excellent advice                        lxxviii      to his gay nothings nothing was replied       or something which was nothing as urbanity     required aurora scarcely looked aside       nor even smiled enough for any vanity     the devil was in the girl could it be pride       or modesty or absence or inanity     heaven knows but adelines malicious eyes     sparkled with her successful prophecies                        lxxix      and looked as much as if to say i said it       a kind of triumph ill not recommend     because it sometimes as i have seen or read it       both in the case of lover and of friend     will pique a gentleman for his own credit       to bring what was a jest to a serious end     for all men prophesy what is or was     and hate those who wont let them come to pass                        lxxx      juan was drawn thus into some attentions       slight but select and just enough to express     to females of perspicuous comprehensions       that he would rather make them more than less     aurora at the last so history mentions       though probably much less a fact than guess     so far relaxed her thoughts from their sweet prison     as once or twice to smile if not to listen                        lxxxi      from answering she began to question this       with her was rare and adeline who as yet     thought her predictions went not much amiss       began to dread shed thaw to a coquette     so very difficult they say it is       to keep extremes from meeting when once set     in motion but she here too much refined     auroras spirit was not of that kind                        lxxxii      but juan had a sort of winning way       a proud humility if such there be     which showed such deference to what females say       as if each charming word were a decree     his tact too tempered him from grave to gay       and taught him when to be reserved or free     he had the art of drawing people out     without their seeing what he was about                        lxxxiii      aurora who in her indifference       confounded him in common with the crowd     of flatterers though she deemed he had more sense       than whispering foplings or than witlings loud     commenced759 from such slight things will great commence       to feel that flattery which attracts the proud     rather by deference than compliment     and wins even by a delicate dissentny                        lxxxiv      and then he had good looksthat point was carried       nem con amongst the women which i grieve     to say leads oft to crim con with the married       a case which to the juries we may leave     since with digressions we too long have tarried       now though we know of old that looks deceive     and always have donesomehow these good looks     make more impression than the best of books                        lxxxv      aurora who looked more on books than faces       was very young although so very sage     admiring more minerva than the graces       especially upon a printed page     but virtues self with all her tightest laces       has not the natural stays of strict old age     and socrates that model of all duty     owned to a penchant though discreet for beauty                        lxxxvi      and girls of sixteen are thus far socratic       but innocently so as socrates     and really if the sage sublime and attic       at seventy years had phantasies like these     which plato in his dialogues dramatic       has shown i know not

sorry jest     but if a writer should be quite consistent     how could he possibly show things existent                        lxxxviii      if people contradict themselves can i       help

people can remember     i have had of both some not to be disdained     i wish theyd state how many they have gained                        xii      and juan on retiring for the night       felt restless and perplexed and compromised     he thought aurora rabys eyes more bright       than adeline such is advice advised     if he had known exactly his own plight       he probably would have philosophised     a great resource to all and neer denied     till wanted therefore juan only sighed                        xiii      he sighedthe next resource is the full moon       where all sighs are deposited and now     it happened luckily the chaste orb shone       as clear as such a climate will allow     and juans mind was in the proper tone       to hail her with the apostropheo thou     of amatory egotism the tuism777     which further to explain would be a truism                        xiv      but lover poet or astronomer       shepherd or swainwhoever may behold     feel some abstraction when they gaze on her       great thoughts we catch from thence besides a cold     sometimes unless my feelings rather err       deep secrets to her rolling light are told     the oceans tides and mortals brains she sways     and also heartsif there be truth in lays                        xv      juan felt somewhat pensive and disposed       for contemplation rather than his pillow     the gothic chamber where he was enclosed       let in the rippling sound of the lakes billow     with all the mystery by midnight caused       below his window waved of course willow     and he stood gazing out on the cascade     that flashed and after darkened in the shade                        xvi      upon his table or his toilet778which       of these is not exactly ascertained     i state this for i am cautious to a pitch       of nicety where a fact is to be gained     a lamp burned high while he leant from a niche       where many a gothic ornament remained     in chiselled stone and painted glass and all     that time has left our fathers of their hall                        xvii      then as the night was clear though cold he threw       his chamber door wide open779and went forth     into a gallery of a sombre hue       long furnished with old pictures of great worth     of knights and dames heroic and chaste too       as doubtless should be people of high birth     but by dim lights the portraits of the dead     have something ghastly desolate and dread                        xviii      the forms of the grim knight and pictured saint       look living in the moon and as you turn     backward and forward to the echoes faint       of your own footstepsvoices from the urn     appear to wake and shadows wild and quaint       start from the frames which fence their aspects stern     as if to ask how you can dare to keep     a vigil there where all but death should sleep                        xix      and the pale smile of beauties in the grave       the charms of other days in starlight gleams     glimmer on high their buried locks still wave       along the canvas their eyes glance like dreams     on ours or spars within some dusky cave780       but death is imaged in their shadowy beams     a picture is the past even ere its frame     be gilt who sate hath ceased to be the same                        xx      as juan mused on mutability       or on his mistressterms synonymous     no sound except the echo of his sigh       or step ran sadly through that antique house     when suddenly he heard or thought so nigh       a supernatural agentor a mouse     whose little nibbling rustle will embarrass     most people as it plays along the arras                        xxi      it was no mousebut lo a monk arrayed781       in cowl and beads and dusky garb appeared     now in the moonlight and now lapsed in shade       with steps that trod as heavy yet unheard     his garments only a slight murmur made       he moved as shadowy as the sisters weird782     but slowly and as he passed juan by     glanced without pausing on him a bright eye                        xxii      juan was petrified he had heard a hint       of such a spirit in these halls of old     but thought like most men that there was nothing in t       beyond the rumour which such spots unfold     coined from surviving superstitions mint       which passes ghosts in currency like gold     but rarely seen like gold compared with paper     and did he see this or was it a vapour                        xxiii      once twice thrice passed repassedthe thing of air       or earth beneath or heaven or t other place     and juan gazed upon it with a stare       yet could not speak or move but on its base     as stands a statue stood he felt his hair       twine like a knot of snakes around his face     he taxed his tongue for words which were not granted     to ask the reverend person what he wanted                        xxiv      the third time after a still longer pause       the shadow passed awaybut where the hall     was long and thus far there was no great cause       to think his vanishing unnatural     doors there were many through which by the laws       of physics bodies whether short or tall     might come or go but juan could not state     through which the spectre seemed to evaporate                        xxv      he stoodhow long he knew not but it seemed       an ageexpectant powerless with his eyes     strained on the spot where first the figure gleamed       then by degrees recalled his energies     and would have passed the whole off as a dream       but could not wake he was he did surmise     waking already and returned at length     back to his chamber shorn of half his strength                        xxvi      all there was as he left it still his taper       burned and not blue as modest tapers use     receiving sprites with sympathetic vapour       he rubbed his eyes and they did not refuse     their office he took up an old newspaper       the paper was right easy to peruse     he read an article the king attacking     and a long eulogy of patent blacking                        xxvii      this savoured of this world but his hand shook       he shut his door and after having read     a paragraph i think about horne tooke       undressed and rather slowly went to bed     there couched all snugly on his pillows nook       with what he had seen his phantasy he fed     and though it was no opiate slumber crept     upon him by degrees and so he slept                        xxviii      he woke betimes and as may be supposed       pondered upon his visitant or vision     and whether it ought not to be disclosed       at risk of being quizzed for superstition     the more he thought the more his mind was posed       in the mean time his valet whose precision     was great because his master brooked no less     knocked to inform him it was time to dress                        xxix      he dressed and like young people he was wont       to take some trouble with his toilet but     this morning rather spent less time upon t       aside his very mirror soon was put     his curls fell negligently oer his front       his clothes were not curbed to their usual cut     his very neckcloths gordian knot was tied     almost an hairs breadth too much on one side                        xxx      and when he walked down into the saloon       he sate him pensive oer a dish of tea     which he perhaps had not discovered soon       had it not happened scalding hot to be     which made him have recourse unto his spoon       so much distrait he was that all could see     that something was the matteradeline     the firstbut what she could not well divine                        xxxi      she looked and saw him pale and turned as pale       herself then hastily looked down and muttered     something but whats not stated in my tale       lord henry said his muffin was ill buttered     the duchess of fitzfulke played with her veil       and looked at juan hard but nothing uttered     aurora raby with her large dark eyes     surveyed him with a kind of calm surprise                        xxxii      but seeing him all cold and silent still       and everybody wondering more or less     fair adeline inquired if he were ill       he started and said yesnoratheryes     the family physician had great skill       and being present now began to express     his readiness to feel his pulse and tell     the cause but juan said he was quite well                        xxxiii      quite well yesnothese answers were mysterious       and yet his looks appeared to sanction both     however they might savour of delirious       something like illness of a sudden growth     weighed on his spirit though by no means serious       but for the rest as he himself seemed both     to state the case it might be taen for granted     it was not the physician that he wanted                        xxxiv      lord henry who had now discussed his chocolate       also the muffin whereof he complained     said juan had not got his usual look elate       at which he marvelled since it had not rained     then asked her grace what news were of the duke of late       her grace replied his grace was rather pained     with some slight light hereditary twinges     of gout which rusts aristocratic hinges                        xxxv      then henry turned to juan and addressed       a few words of condolence on his state     you look quoth he as if you had had your rest       broke in upon by the black friar of late     what friar said juan and he did his best       to put the question with an air sedate     or careless but the effort was not valid     to hinder him from growing still more pallid                        xxxvi      oh have you never heard of the black friar       the spirit of these wallsin truth not i     why famebut fame you knows sometimes a liar       tells an odd story of which by and by     whether with time the spectre has grown shyer       or that our sires had a more gifted eye     for such sights though the tale is half believed     the friar of late has not been oft perceived                        xxxvii      the last time wasi pray said adeline       who watched the changes of don juans brow     and from its context thought she could divine       connections stronger than he chose to avow     with this same legendif you but design       to jest youll choose some other theme just now     because the present tale has oft been told

air of twas a friar of orders graynz                        xxxix      but add the words cried henry which you made       for adeline is half a poetess     turning round to the rest he smiling said       of course the others could not but express     in courtesy their wish to see displayed       by one three talents for there were no less     the voice the words the harpers skill at once     could hardly be united by a dunce                        xl      after some fascinating hesitation       the charming of these charmers who seem bound     i cant tell why to this dissimulation       fair adeline with eyes fixed on the ground     at first then kindling into animation       added her sweet voice to the lyric sound     and sang with much simplicitya merit     not the less precious that we seldom hear it  1      beware beware of the black friar       who sitteth by norman stone     for he mutters his prayer in the midnight air       and his mass of the days that are gone     when the lord of the hill amundeville       made norman church his prey     and expelled the friars one friar still     would not be driven away  2      though he came in his might with king henrys right       to turn church lands to lay     with sword in hand and torch to light       their walls if they said nay     a monk remained unchased unchained       and he did not seem formed of clay     for hes seen in the porch and hes seen in the church     though he is not seen by day  3      and whether for good or whether for ill       it is not mine to say     but still with the house of amundeville

an heir is born hes heard to mourn       and when aught is to befall     that ancient line in the pale moonshine       he walks from hall to hall     his form you may trace but not his face       tis shadowed by his cowl     but his eyes may be seen from the folds between     and they seem of a parted soul  5      but beware beware of the black friar       he still retains his sway     for he is yet the churchs heir       whoever may be the lay     amundeville is lord by day       but the monk is lord by night     nor wine nor wassail could raise a vassal     to question that friars right  6      say nought to him as he walks the hall       and hell say nought to you     he sweeps along in his dusky pall       as oer the grass the dew     then grammercy for the black friar       heaven

kindled them to sound     and the pause followed which when song expires       pervades a moment those who listen round     and then of course the circle much admires       nor less applauds as in politeness bound     the tones the feeling and the execution     to the performers diffident confusion                        xlii      fair adeline though in a careless way       as if she rated such accomplishment     as the mere pastime of an idle day       pursued an instant for her own content     would now and then as twere without display       yet with display in fact at times relent     to such performances with haughty smile     to show she could if it were worth her while                        xliii      now this but we will whisper it aside       waspardon the pedantic illustration

for fear we should suppose us quite in heaven                        l      i have not heard she was at all poetic       though once she was seen reading the bath guide788     and hayleys triumphs789 which she deemed pathetic       because she said her temper had been tried     so much the bard had really been prophetic       of what she had gone through withsince a bride     but of all verse what most ensured her praise     were sonnets to herself or bouts rimés                        li      twere difficult to say what was the object       of adeline in bringing this same lay     to bear on what appeared to her the subject       of juans nervous feelings on that day     perhaps she merely had the simple project       to laugh him out of his supposed dismay     perhaps she might wish to confirm him in it     though why i cannot sayat least this minute                        lii      but so far the immediate effect       was to restore him to his selfpropriety     a thing quite necessary to the elect       who wish to take the tone of their society     in which you cannot be too circumspect       whether the mode be persiflage or piety     but wear the newest mantle of hypocrisy     on pain of much displeasing the gynocracy790                        liii      and therefore juan now began to rally       his spirits and without more explanation     to jest upon such themes in many a sally       her grace too also seized the same occasion     with various similar remarks to tally       but wished for a still more detailed narration     of this same mystic friars curious doings     about the present familys deaths and wooings                        liv      of these few could say more than has been said       they passed as such things do for superstition     with some while others who had more in dread       the theme half credited the strange tradition     and much was talked on all sides on that head       but juan when crossquestioned on the vision     which some supposed though he had not avowed it     had stirred him answered in a way to cloud it                        lv      and then the midday having worn to one       the company prepared to

really rather took amiss       in those who rarely smile their smile bespeaks     a strong external motive and in this       smile of auroras there was nought to pique     or hope or lovewith any of

the circumstances which ensued       he gained esteem where it was worth the most     and certainly aurora had renewed       in him some feelings he had lately lost     or hardened feelings which

in french mobilité i am not sure that mobility is english but it is expressive of a quality which rather belongs to other climates though it is sometimes seen to a great extent in our own it may be defined as an excessive susceptibility of immediate impressionsat the same time without losing the past and is though sometimes apparently useful to the possessor a most painful and unhappy attribute  that he was fully aware not only of the abundance of this quality in his own nature but of the danger in which it placed consistency and singleness of character did not require the note on this passage to assure us the consciousness indeed of his own natural tendency to yield thus to every chance impression and change with every passing impulse was not only for ever present in his mind but  had the effect of keeping him in that general line of consistency on certain great subjects which  he continued to preserve throughout lifelife p 646 mobility is not the tendency to yield to every impression to change with every impulse but the capability of being moved by many and various impressions of responding to an everrenewed succession of impulses byron is defending the enthusiastic
