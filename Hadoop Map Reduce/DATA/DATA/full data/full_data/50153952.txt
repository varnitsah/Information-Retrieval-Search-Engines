50153952	all for love   by  john dryden     introductory note  the age of elizabeth memorable for so many reasons in the history of england was especially brilliant in literature and within literature in the drama  with some falling off in spontaneity the impulse to great dramatic production lasted till the long parliament closed the theaters in 1642 and when they were reopened at the restoration in 1660 the stage only too faithfully reflected the debased moral tone of the court society of charles ii  john dryden 16311700 the great representative figure in the literature of the latter part of the seventeenth century exemplifies in his work most of the main tendencies of the time he came into notice with a poem on the death of cromwell in 1658 and two years later was composing couplets expressing his loyalty to the returned king  he married lady elizabeth howard the daughter of a royalist house and for practically all the rest of his life remained an adherent of the tory party  in 1663 he began writing for the stage and during the next thirty years he attempted nearly all the current forms of drama  his annus mirabilis 1666 celebrating the english naval victories over the dutch brought him in 1670 the poet laureateship  he had meantime begun the writing of those admirable critical essays represented in the present series by his preface to the fables and his dedication to the translation of virgil  in these he shows himself not only a critic of sound and penetrating judgment but the first master of modern english prose style  with absalom and achitophel a satire on the whig leader shaftesbury dryden entered a new phase and achieved what is regarded as the finest of all political satires  this was followed by the medal again directed against the whigs and this by mac flecknoe a fierce attack on his enemy and rival shadwell  the government rewarded his services by a lucrative appointment  after triumphing in the three fields of drama criticism and satire dryden appears next as a religious poet in his religio laici an exposition of the doctrines of the church of england from a laymans point of view  in the same year that the catholic james ii ascended the throne dryden joined the roman church and two years later defended his new religion in the hind and the panther an allegorical debate between two animals standing respectively for catholicism and anglicanism  the revolution of 1688 put an end to drydens prosperity and after a short return to dramatic composition he turned to translation as a means of supporting himself  he had already done something in this line and after a series of translations from juvenal persius and ovid he undertook at the age of sixtythree the enormous task of turning the entire works of virgil into english verse  how he succeeded in this readers of the aeneid in a companion volume of these classics can judge for themselves  drydens production closes with the collection of narrative poems called fables published in 1700 in which year he died and was buried in the poets corner in westminster abbey  dryden lived in an age of reaction against excessive religious idealism and both his character and his works are marked by the somewhat unheroic traits of such a period  but he was on the whole an honest man open minded genial candid and modest the wielder of a style both in verse and prose unmatched for clearness vigor and sanity  three types of comedy appeared in england in the time of drydenthe comedy of humors the comedy of intrigue and the comedy of mannersand in all he did work that classed him with the ablest of his contemporaries  he developed the somewhat bombastic type of drama known as the heroic play and brought it to its height in his conquest of granada then becoming dissatisfied with this form he cultivated the french classic tragedy on the model of racine  this he modified by combining with the regularity of the french treatment of dramatic action a richness of characterization in which he showed himself a disciple of shakespeare and of this mixed type his best example is all for love  here he has the daring to challenge comparison with his master and the greatest testimony to his achievement is the fact that as professor noyes has said fresh from shakespeares antony and cleopatra we can still read with intense pleasure drydens version of the story   dedication  to the right honourable thomas earl of danby viscount latimer and baron osborne of kiveton in yorkshire lord high treasurer of england one of his majestys most honourable privy council and knight of the most noble order of the garter  my lord  the gratitude of poets is so troublesome a virtue to great men that you are often in danger of your own benefits  for you are threatened with some epistle and not suffered to do good in quiet or to compound for their silence whom you have obliged yet i confess i neither am or ought to be surprised at this indulgence for your lordship has the same right to favour poetry which the great and noble have ever had       carmen amat quisquis carmine digna gerit  there is somewhat of a tie in nature betwixt those who are born for worthy actions and those who can transmit them to posterity and though ours be much the inferior part it comes at least within the verge of alliance nor are we unprofitable members of the commonwealth when we animate others to those virtues which we copy and describe from you  it is indeed their interest who endeavour the subversion of governments to discourage poets and historians for the best which can happen to them is to be forgotten  but such who under kings are the fathers of their country and by a just and prudent ordering of affairs preserve it have the same reason to cherish the chroniclers of their actions as they have to lay up in safety the deeds and evidences of their estates for such records are their undoubted titles to the love and reverence of after ages  your lordships administration has already taken up a considerable part of the english annals and many of its most happy years are owing to it  his majesty the most knowing judge of men and the best master has acknowledged the ease and benefit he receives in the incomes of his treasury which you found not only disordered but exhausted  all things were in the confusion of a chaos without form or method if not reduced beyond it even to annihilation so that you had not only to separate the jarring elements but if that boldness of expression might be allowed me to create them  your enemies had so embroiled the management of your office that they looked on your advancement as the instrument of your ruin  and as if the clogging of the revenue and the confusion of accounts which you found in your entrance were not sufficient they added their own weight of malice to the public calamity by forestalling the credit which should cure it  your friends on the other side were only capable of pitying but not of aiding you no further help or counsel was remaining to you but what was founded on yourself and that indeed was your security for your diligence your constancy and your prudence wrought most surely within when they were not disturbed by any outward motion  the highest virtue is best to be trusted with itself for assistance only can be given by a genius superior to that which it assists and it is the noblest kind of debt when we are only obliged to god and nature  this then my lord is your just commendation and that you have wrought out yourself a way to glory by those very means that were designed for your destruction  you have not only restored but advanced the revenues of your master without grievance to the subject and as if that were little yet the debts of the exchequer which lay heaviest both on the crown and on private persons have by your conduct been established in a certainty of satisfaction  an action so much the more great and honourable because the case was without the ordinary relief of laws above the hopes of the afflicted and beyond the narrowness of the treasury to redress had it been managed by a less able hand  it is certainly the happiest and most unenvied part of all your fortune to do good to many while you do injury to none to receive at once the prayers of the subject and the praises of the prince and by the care of your conduct to give him means of exerting the chiefest if any be the chiefest of his royal virtues his distributive justice to the deserving and his bounty and compassion to the wanting  the disposition of princes towards their people cannot be better discovered than in the choice of their ministers who like the animal spirits betwixt the soul and body participate somewhat of both natures and make the communication which is betwixt them  a king who is just and moderate in his nature who rules according to the laws whom god has made happy by forming the temper of his soul to the constitution of his government and who makes us happy by assuming over us no other sovereignty than that wherein our welfare and liberty consists a prince i say of so excellent a character and so suitable to the wishes of all good men could not better have conveyed himself into his peoples apprehensions than in your lordships person who so lively express the same virtues that you seem not so much a copy as an emanation of him  moderation is doubtless an establishment of greatness but there is a steadiness of temper which is likewise requisite in a minister of state so equal a mixture of both virtues that he may stand like an isthmus betwixt the two encroaching seas of arbitrary power and lawless anarchy  the undertaking would be difficult to any but an extraordinary genius to stand at the line and to divide the limits to pay what is due to the great representative of the nation and neither to enhance nor to yield up the undoubted prerogatives of the crown  these my lord are the proper virtues of a noble englishman as indeed they are properly english virtues no people in the world being capable of using them but we who have the happiness to be born under so equal and so wellpoised a governmenta government which has all the advantages of liberty beyond a commonwealth and all the marks of kingly sovereignty without the danger of a tyranny  both my nature as i am an englishman and my reason as i am a man have bred in me a loathing to that specious name of a republic that mock appearance of a liberty where all who have not part in the government are slaves and slaves they are of a viler note than such as are subjects to an absolute dominion  for no christian monarchy is so absolute but it is circumscribed with laws but when the executive power is in the lawmakers there is no further check upon them and the people must suffer without a remedy because they are oppressed by their representatives  if i must serve the number of my masters who were born my equals would but add to the ignominy of my bondage the nature of our government above all others is exactly suited both to the situation of our country and the temper of the natives an island being more proper for commerce and for defence than for extending its dominions on the continent for what the valour of its inhabitants might gain by reason of its remoteness and the casualties of the seas it could not so easily preserve  and therefore neither the arbitrary power of one in a monarchy nor of many in a commonwealth could make us greater than we are  it is true that vaster and more frequent taxes might be gathered when the consent of the people was not asked or needed but this were only by conquering abroad to be poor at home and the examples of our neighbours teach us that they are not always the happiest subjects whose kings extend their dominions farthest  since therefore we cannot win by an offensive war at least a land war the model of our government seems naturally contrived for the defensive part and the consent of a people is easily obtained to contribute to that power which must protect it  felices nimium bona si sua norint angligenae and yet there are not wanting malcontents among us who surfeiting themselves on too much happiness would persuade the people that they might be happier by a change  it was indeed the policy of their old forefather when himself was fallen from the station of glory to seduce mankind into the same rebellion with him by telling him he might yet be freer than he was that is more free than his nature would allow or if i may so say than god could make him  we have already all the liberty which freeborn subjects can enjoy and all beyond it is but licence but if it be liberty of conscience which they pretend the moderation of our church is such that its practice extends not to the severity of persecution and its discipline is withal so easy that it allows more freedom to dissenters than any of the sects would allow to it  in the meantime what right can be pretended by these men to attempt innovation in church or state who made them the trustees or to speak a little nearer their own language the keepers of the liberty of england  if their call be extraordinary let them convince us by working miracles for ordinary vocation they can have none to disturb the government under which they were born and which protects them  he who has often changed his party and always has made his interest the rule of it gives little evidence of his sincerity for the public good it is manifest he changes but for himself and takes the people for tools to work his fortune  yet the experience of all ages might let him know that they who trouble the waters first have seldom the benefit of the fishing as they who began the late rebellion enjoyed not the fruit of their undertaking but were crushed themselves by the usurpation of their own instrument  neither is it enough for them to answer that they only intend a reformation of the government but not the subversion of it  on such pretence all insurrections have been founded it is striking at the root of power which is obedience every remonstrance of private men has the seed of treason in it and discourses which are couched in ambiguous terms are therefore the more dangerous because they do all the mischief of open sedition yet are safe from the punishment of the laws these my lord are considerations which i should not pass so lightly over had i room to manage them as they deserve for no man can be so inconsiderable in a nation as not to have a share in the welfare of it and if he be a true englishman he must at the same time be fired with indignation and revenge himself as he can on the disturbers of his country  and to whom could i more fitly apply myself than to your lordship who have not only an inborn but an hereditary loyalty  the memorable constancy and sufferings of your father almost to the ruin of his estate for the royal cause were an earnest of that which such a parent and such an institution would produce in the person of a son but so unhappy an occasion of manifesting your own zeal in suffering for his present majesty the providence of god and the prudence of your administration will i hope prevent that as your fathers fortune waited on the unhappiness of his sovereign so your own may participate of the better fate which attends his son  the relation which you have by alliance to the noble family of your lady serves to confirm to you both this happy augury  for what can deserve a greater place in the english chronicle than the loyalty and courage the actions and death of the general of an army fighting for his prince and country  the honour and gallantry of the earl of lindsey is so illustrious a subject that it is fit to adorn an heroic poem for he was the protomartyr of the cause and the type of his unfortunate royal master  yet after all my lord if i may speak my thoughts you are happy rather to us than to yourself for the multiplicity the cares and the vexations of your employment have betrayed you from yourself and given you up into the possession of the public you are robbed of your privacy and friends and scarce any hour of your life you can call your own  those who envy your fortune if they wanted not goodnature might more justly pity it and when they see you watched by a crowd of suitors whose importunity it is impossible to avoid would conclude with reason that you have lost much more in true content than you have gained by dignity and that a private gentleman is better attended by a single servant than your lordship with so clamorous a train  pardon me my lord if i speak like a philosopher on this subject the fortune which makes a man uneasy cannot make him happy and a wise man must think himself uneasy when few of his actions are in his choice  this last consideration has brought me to another and a very seasonable one for your relief which is that while i pity your want of leisure i have impertinently detained you so long a time  i have put off my own business which was my dedication till it is so late that i am now ashamed to begin it and therefore i will say nothing of the poem which i present to you because i know not if you are like to have an hour which with a good conscience you may throw away in perusing it and for the author i have only to beg the continuance of your protection to him who is       my lord           your lordships most obliged                most humble and                     most obedient servant                                    john dryden   preface  the death of antony and cleopatra is a subject which has been treated by the greatest wits of our nation after shakespeare and by all so variously that their example has given me the confidence to try myself in this bow of ulysses amongst the crowd of suitors and withal to take my own measures in aiming at the mark  i doubt not but the same motive has prevailed with all of us in this attempt i mean the excellency of the moral  for the chief persons represented were famous patterns of unlawful love and their end accordingly was unfortunate  all reasonable men have long since concluded that the hero of the poem ought not to be a character of perfect virtue for then he could not without injustice be made unhappy nor yet altogether wicked because he could not then be pitied  i have therefore steered the middle course and have drawn the character of antony as favourably as plutarch appian and dion cassius would give me leave the like i have observed in cleopatra that which is wanting to work up the pity to a greater height was not afforded me by the story for the crimes of love which they both committed were not occasioned by any necessity or fatal ignorance but were wholly voluntary since our passions are or ought to be within our power  the fabric of the play is regular enough as to the inferior parts of it and the unities of time place and action more exactly observed than perhaps the english theatre requires particularly the action is so much one that it is the only one of the kind without episode or underplot every scene in the tragedy conducing to the main design and every act concluding with a turn of it  the greatest error in the contrivance seems to be in the person of octavia for though i might use the privilege of a poet to introduce her into alexandria yet i had not enough considered that the compassion she moved to herself and children was destructive to that which i reserved for antony and cleopatra whose mutual love being founded upon vice must lessen the favour of the audience to them when virtue and innocence were oppressed by it  and though i justified antony in some measure by making octavias departure to proceed wholly from herself yet the force of the first machine still remained and the dividing of pity like the cutting of a river into many channels abated the strength of the natural stream  but this is an objection which none of my critics have urged against me and therefore i might have let it pass if i could have resolved to have been partial to myself  the faults my enemies have found are rather cavils concerning little and not essential decencies which a master of the ceremonies may decide betwixt us  the french poets i confess are strict observers of these punctilios  they would not for example have suffered cleopatra and octavia to have met or if they had met there must have only passed betwixt them some cold civilities but no eagerness of repartee for fear of offending against the greatness of their characters and the modesty of their sex  this objection i foresaw and at the same time contemned for i judged it both natural and probable that octavia proud of her newgained conquest would search out cleopatra to triumph over her and that cleopatra thus attacked was not of a spirit to shun the encounter  and it is not unlikely that two exasperated rivals should use such satire as i have put into their mouths for after all though the one were a roman and the other a queen they were both women  it is true some actions though natural are not fit to be represented and broad obscenities in words ought in good manners to be avoided  expressions therefore are a modest clothing of our thoughts as breeches and petticoats are of our bodies  if i have kept myself within the bounds of modesty all beyond it is but nicety and affectation which is no more but modesty depraved into a vice  they betray themselves who are too quick of apprehension in such cases and leave all reasonable men to imagine worse of them than of the poet  honest montaigne goes yet further  nous ne sommes que ceremonie la ceremonie nous emporte et laissons la substance des choses  nous nous tenons aux branches et abandonnons le tronc et le corps  nous avons appris aux dames de rougir oyans seulement nommer ce quelles ne craignent aucunement a faire  nous nosons appeller a droit nos membres et ne craignons pas de les employer a toute sorte de debauche  la ceremonie nous defend dexprimer par paroles les choses licites et naturelles et nous len croyons la raison nous defend de nen faire point dillicites et mauvaises et personne ne len croit my comfort is that by this opinion my enemies are but sucking critics who would fain be nibbling ere their teeth are come  yet in this nicety of manners does the excellency of french poetry consist  their heroes are the most civil people breathing but their good breeding seldom extends to a word of sense all their wit is in their ceremony they want the genius which animates our stage and therefore it is but necessary when they cannot please that they should take care not to offend  but as the civilest man in the company is commonly the dullest so these authors while they are afraid to make you laugh or cry out of pure good manners make you sleep  they are so careful not to exasperate a critic that they never leave him any work so busy with the broom and make so clean a riddance that there is little left either for censure or for praise  for no part of a poem is worth our discommending where the whole is insipid as when we have once tasted of palled wine we stay not to examine it glass by glass  but while they affect to shine in trifles they are often careless in essentials  thus their hippolytus is so scrupulous in point of decency that he will rather expose himself to death than accuse his stepmother to his father and my critics i am sure will commend him for it  but we of grosser apprehensions are apt to think that this excess of generosity is not practicable but with fools and madmen  this was good manners with a vengeance and the audience is like to be much concerned at the misfortunes of this admirable hero  but take hippolytus out of his poetic fit and i suppose he would think it a wiser part to set the saddle on the right horse and choose rather to live with the reputation of a plainspoken honest man than to die with the infamy of an incestuous villain  in the meantime we may take notice that where the poet ought to have preserved the character as it was delivered to us by antiquity when he should have given us the picture of a rough young man of the amazonian strain a jolly huntsman and both by his profession and his early rising a mortal enemy to love he has chosen to give him the turn of gallantry sent him to travel from athens to paris taught him to make love and transformed the hippolytus of euripides into monsieur hippolyte i should not have troubled myself thus far with french poets but that i find our chedreux critics wholly form their judgments by them but for my part i desire to be tried by the laws of my own country for it seems unjust to me that the french should prescribe here till they have conquered  our little sonneteers who follow them have too narrow souls to judge of poetry  poets themselves are the most proper though i conclude not the only critics  but till some genius as universal as aristotle shall arise one who can penetrate into all arts and sciences without the practice of them i shall think it reasonable that the judgment of an artificer in his own art should be preferable to the opinion of another man at least where he is not bribed by interest or prejudiced by malice  and this i suppose is manifest by plain inductions  for first the crowd cannot be presumed to have more than a gross instinct of what pleases or displeases them  every man will grant me this but then by a particular kindness to himself he draws his own stake first and will be distinguished from the multitude of which other men may think him one  but if i come closer to those who are allowed for witty men either by the advantage of their quality or by common fame and affirm that neither are they qualified to decide sovereignly concerning poetry i shall yet have a strong party of my opinion for most of them severally will exclude the rest either from the number of witty men or at least of able judges  but here again they are all indulgent to themselves and every one who believes himself a wit that is every man will pretend at the same time to a right of judging  but to press it yet further there are many witty men but few poets neither have all poets a taste of tragedy  and this is the rock on which they are daily splitting poetry which is a picture of nature must generally please but it is not to be understood that all parts of it must please every man therefore is not tragedy to be judged by a witty man whose taste is only confined to comedy  nor is every man who loves tragedy a sufficient judge of it he must understand the excellences of it too or he will only prove a blind admirer not a critic  from hence it comes that so many satires on poets and censures of their writings fly abroad  men of pleasant conversation at least esteemed so and endued with a trifling kind of fancy perhaps helped out with some smattering of latin are ambitious to distinguish themselves from the herd of gentlemen by their poetry       rarus enim ferme sensus communis in illa fortuna  and is not this a wretched affectation not to be contented with what fortune has done for them and sit down quietly with their estates but they must call their wits in question and needlessly expose their nakedness to public view  not considering that they are not to expect the same approbation from sober men which they have found from their flatterers after the third bottle  if a little glittering in discourse has passed them on us for witty men where was the necessity of undeceiving the world  would a man who has an ill title to an estate but yet is in possession of it would he bring it of his own accord to be tried at westminster  we who write if we want the talent yet have the excuse that we do it for a poor subsistence but what can be urged in their defence who not having the vocation of poverty to scribble out of mere wantonness take pains to make themselves ridiculous  horace was certainly in the right where he said that no man is satisfied with his own condition a poet is not pleased because he is not rich and the rich are discontented because the poets will not admit them of their number  thus the case is hard with writers  if they succeed not they must starve and if they do some malicious satire is prepared to level them for daring to please without their leave  but while they are so eager to destroy the fame of others their ambition is manifest in their concernment some poem of their own is to be produced and the slaves are to be laid flat with their faces on the ground that the monarch may appear in the greater majesty  dionysius and nero had the same longings but with all their power they could never bring their business well about  tis true they proclaimed themselves poets by sound of trumpet and poets they were upon pain of death to any man who durst call them otherwise  the audience had a fine time ont you may imagine they sat in a bodily fear and looked as demurely as they could  for it was a hanging matter to laugh unseasonably and the tyrants were suspicious as they had reason that their subjects had them in the wind so every man in his own defence set as good a face upon the business as he could  it was known beforehand that the monarchs were to be crowned laureates but when the show was over and an honest man was suffered to depart quietly he took out his laughter which he had stifled with a firm resolution never more to see an emperors play though he had been ten years amaking it  in the meantime the true poets were they who made the best markets  for they had wit enough to yield the prize with a good grace and not contend with him who had thirty legions  they were sure to be rewarded if they confessed themselves bad writers and that was somewhat better than to be martyrs for their reputation  lucans example was enough to teach them manners and after he was put to death for overcoming nero the emperor carried it without dispute for the best poet in his dominions no man was ambitious of that grinning honour for if he heard the malicious trumpeter proclaiming his name before his betters he knew there was but one way with him  maecenas took another course and we know he was more than a great man for he was witty too  but finding himself far gone in poetry which seneca assures us was not his talent he thought it his best way to be well with virgil and with horace that at least he might be a poet at the second hand and we see how happily it has succeeded with him for his own bad poetry is forgotten and their panegyrics of him still remain  but they who should be our patrons are for no such expensive ways to fame they have much of the poetry of maecenas but little of his liberality they are for prosecuting horace and virgil in the persons of their successors for such is every man who has any part of their soul and fire though in a less degree  some of their little zanies yet go further for they are persecutors even of horace himself as far as they are able by their ignorant and vile imitations of him by making an unjust use of his authority and turning his artillery against his friends  but how would he disdain to be copied by such hands  i dare answer for him he would be more uneasy in their company than he was with crispinus their forefather in the holy way and would no more have allowed them a place amongst the critics than he would demetrius the mimic and tigellius the buffoon        demetri teque tigelli      discipulorum inter jubeo plorare cathedras  with what scorn would he look down on such miserable translators who make doggerel of his latin mistake his meaning misapply his censures and often contradict their own  he is fixed as a landmark to set out the bounds of poetry        saxum antiquum ingens      limes agro positus litem ut discerneret arvis  but other arms than theirs and other sinews are required to raise the weight of such an author and when they would toss him against enemies       genua labant gelidus concrevit frigore sanguis      tum lapis ipse viri vacuum per inane volatus      nec spatium evasit totum nec pertulit ictum  for my part i would wish no other revenge either for myself or the rest of the poets from this rhyming judge of the twelvepenny gallery this legitimate son of sternhold than that he would subscribe his name to his censure or not to tax him beyond his learning set his mark  for should he own himself publicly and come from behind the lions skin they whom he condemns would be thankful to him they whom he praises would choose to be condemned and the magistrates whom he has elected would modestly withdraw from their employment to avoid the scandal of his nomination the sharpness of his satire next to himself falls most heavily on his friends and they ought never to forgive him for commending them perpetually the wrong way and sometimes by contraries  if he have a friend whose hastiness in writing is his greatest fault horace would have taught him to have minced the matter and to have called it readiness of thought and a flowing fancy for friendship will allow a man to christen an imperfection by the name of some neighbour virtue       vellem in amicitia sic erraremus et isti      errori nomen virtus posuisset honestum  but he would never allowed him to have called a slow man hasty or a hasty writer a slow drudge as juvenal explains it        canibus pigris scabieque vestusta      laevibus et siccae lambentibus ora lucernae      nomen erit pardus tigris leo si quid adhuc est      quod fremit in terris violentius  yet lucretius laughs at a foolish lover even for excusing the imperfections of his mistress       nigra melichroos est immunda et foetida akosmos      balba loqui non quit traylizei muta pudens est etc  but to drive it ad aethiopem cygnum is not to be endured  i leave him to interpret this by the benefit of his french version on the other side and without further considering him than i have the rest of my illiterate censors whom i have disdained to answer because they are not qualified for judges  it remains that i acquiant the reader that i have endeavoured in this play to follow the practice of the ancients who as mr rymer has judiciously observed are and ought to be our masters  horace likewise gives it for a rule in his art of poetry        vos exemplaria graeca      nocturna versate manu versate diurna  yet though their models are regular they are too little for english tragedy which requires to be built in a larger compass  i could give an instance in the oedipus tyrannus which was the masterpiece of sophocles but i reserve it for a more fit occasion which i hope to have hereafter  in my style i have professed to imitate the divine shakespeare which that i might perform more freely i have disencumbered myself from rhyme  not that i condemn my former way but that this is more proper to my present purpose  i hope i need not to explain myself that i have not copied my author servilely words and phrases must of necessity receive a change in succeeding ages but it is almost a miracle that much of his language remains so pure and that he who began dramatic poetry amongst us untaught by any and as ben jonson tells us without learning should by the force of his own genius perform so much that in a manner he has left no praise for any who come after him  the occasion is fair and the subject would be pleasant to handle the difference of styles betwixt him and fletcher and wherein and how far they are both to be imitated  but since i must not be overconfident of my own performance after him it will be prudence in me to be silent yet i hope i may affirm and without vanity that by imitating him i have excelled myself throughout the play and particularly that i prefer the scene betwixt antony and ventidius in the first act to anything which i have written in this kind     prologue    what flocks of critics hover here today   as vultures wait on armies for their prey   all gaping for the carcase of a play   with croaking notes they bode some dire event   and follow dying poets by the scent   ours gives himself for gone y have watched your time   he fights this day unarmedwithout his rhyme   and brings a tale which often has been told   as sad as didos and almost as old   his hero whom you wits his bully call   bates of his mettle and scarce rants at all   hes somewhat lewd but a wellmeaning mind   weeps much fights little but is wondrous kind   in short a pattern and companion fit   for all the keeping tonies of the pit   i could name more  a wife and mistress too   both to be plain too good for most of you   the wife wellnatured and the mistress true     now poets if your fame has been his care   allow him all the candour you can spare   a brave man scorns to quarrel once a day   like hectors in at every petty fray   let those find fault whose wits so very small   theyve need to show that they can think at all   errors like straws upon the surface flow   he who would search for pearls must dive below   fops may have leave to level all they can   as pigmies would be glad to lop a man   halfwits are fleas so little and so light   we scarce could know they live but that they bite   but as the rich when tired with daily feasts   for change become their next poor tenants guests   drink hearty draughts of ale from plain brown bowls   and snatch the homely rasher from the coals   so you retiring from

that watched it  men and beasts   were borne above the tops of trees that grew   on the utmost margin of the watermark   then with so swift an ebb the flood drove backward   it slipt from underneath the scaly herd   here monstrous phocae panted on the shore   forsaken dolphins there with their broad tails   lay lashing the departing waves  hard by them   sea horses floundering in the slimy mud

war seems on either side to sleep    serapion  tis strange that antony for some days past   has not beheld the face of cleopatra   but here in isis temple lives retired   and makes his heart a prey to black despair    alexas  tis true and we much fear he hopes by absence   to cure his mind of love    serapion  if he be vanquished   or make his peace egypt is doomed to be   a roman province and our

there met antony   a mortal foe was to us and egypt   butlet me witness to the worth i hate   a braver roman never drew a sword   firm to his prince but as a friend not slave   he neer was of his pleasures but presides   oer all his cooler hours and morning counsels   in short the plainness fierceness rugged virtue   of an old truestampt roman lives in him   his coming bodes i know not what of

anything but thought or if he talks   tis to himself and then tis perfect raving   then he defies the world and bids it pass   sometimes he gnaws his lips and curses loud   the boy octavius then he draws his mouth   into a scornful smile and cries take all   the worlds not worth my care    ventidius  just just his nature   virtues his path but sometimes tis too narrow   for his vast soul and then he starts out wide   and bounds into a vice that bears him far   from his first course and plunges him in ills   but when his danger makes him find his faults   quick to observe and full of sharp remorse   he censures eagerly his own misdeeds   judging himself with malice to himself   and not forgiving what as man he did   because his other parts are more than man   he must not thus be lost        alexas and the priests come forward    alexas  you have your full instructions now advance   proclaim your orders loudly    serapion  romans egyptians hear the queens command   thus cleopatra bids

degenerate progeny    alexas  a love which knows no bounds to antony   would mark the day with honours when all heaven   laboured for him when each propitious star   stood wakeful in his orb to watch that hour   and shed his better influence  her own birthday   our queen neglected like a vulgar fate   that passed obscurely by    ventidius  would it had slept   divided far from his till some remote   and future age had called it out to ruin   some other prince not him    alexas  your emperor   though grown unkind would be more gentle than   to upbraid my queen for loving him too well    ventidius  does the mute sacrifice upbraid the priest   he knows him not his executioner   oh she has decked his ruin with her love   led him in golden bands to gaudy slaughter   and made perdition pleasing  she has left him   the blank of what he was   i tell thee eunuch she has quite unmanned him   can any roman see and know him now   thus altered from the lord of half mankind   unbent

hopes or fears surveyed   methought he looked resolved and yet not pleased   when he beheld me struggling in the crowd   he blushed and bade make way    alexas  theres comfort yet    charmion  ventidius fixed his eyes upon my passage   severely as he meant to frown me back   and sullenly gave place  i told my message   just as you gave it broken and disordered   i numbered in it all your

so well   he could deny you nothing if he saw you   and therefore    cleopatra  thou wouldst say he would not see me    charmion  and therefore begged you not to use a power   which he could ill resist yet he should ever   respect you as he ought    cleopatra  is that a word   for antony to use to cleopatra   o that faint word respect how i disdain it   disdain myself for loving after it   he

run away   and shuns his masters eyes  if you pursue him   my life ont he still drags a chain along   that needs must clog his flight    cleopatra  could i believe thee    alexas  by every circumstance i know he loves   true hes hard prest by interest and by honour   yet he but doubts and parleys and casts out   many a long look for succour    cleopatra  he sends word   he fears to see

ourselves    antony  yes we have made them we have loved each other   into our mutual ruin    cleopatra  the gods have seen my joys with envious eyes   i have no friends in heaven and all the world   as twere the business of mankind to part us   is armed against my love  even you yourself   join with the rest you you are armed against me    antony  i will be justified in all i do   to late posterity and therefore hear me   if i mix a lie   with any truth reproach me freely with it   else favour me with silence    cleopatra  you command me   and i am dumb    ventidius  i like this well he shows authority    antony  that i derive my ruin   from you alone    cleopatra  o heavens  i ruin you    antony  you promised me your silence and you break it   ere i have scarce begun    cleopatra  well i obey you    antony  when i beheld you first it was in egypt   ere caesar saw your eyes you gave me love   and were too young to know it that i settled   your father in his throne was for your sake   i left the acknowledgment for time to ripen   caesar stept in and with a greedy hand   plucked the green fruit ere the first blush of red   yet cleaving to the bough  he was my lord   and was beside too great for me to rival   but i deserved you first though he enjoyed you   when after i beheld you in cilicia   an enemy to rome i pardoned you    cleopatra  i cleared myself    antony  again you break your promise   i loved you still and took your weak excuses   took you into my bosom stained by caesar   and not half mine  i went to egypt with you   and hid me from the business of the world   shut out inquiring nations from my sight   to give whole years to you    ventidius  yes to your shame bet spoken        aside    antony  how i loved   witness ye days and nights and all ye hours   that danced away with down upon your feet   as all your business were to count my passion   one day passed by and nothing saw but love   another came and still twas only love   the suns were wearied out with looking on   and i untired with loving   i saw you every day and all the day   and every day was still but as the first   so eager was i still to see you more    ventidius  tis all too true    antony  fulvia my wife grew jealous   as she indeed had reason raised a war   in italy to call me back    ventidius  but yet   you went not    antony  while within your arms i lay   the world fell mouldering from my hands each hour   and left me scarce a graspi thank your love fort    ventidius  well pushed  that last was home    cleopatra  yet may i speak    antony  if i have urged a falsehood yes else not   your silence says i have not  fulvia died   pardon you gods with my unkindness died   to set the world at peace i took octavia   this caesars sister in her pride of youth   and flower of beauty did i wed that lady   whom blushing i must praise because i left her   you called my love obeyed the fatal summons   this raised the roman arms the cause was yours   i would have fought by land where i was stronger   you hindered it  yet when i fought at sea   forsook me fighting and o stain to honour   o lasting shame i knew not that i fled   but fled to follow you    ventidius  what haste she made to hoist her purple sails   and to appear magnificent in flight   drew half our strength away    antony  all this you caused   and would you multiply more ruins on me   this honest man my best my only friend   has gathered up the shipwreck of my fortunes   twelve legions i have left my last recruits   and you have watched the news and bring your eyes   to seize them too  if you have aught to answer   now speak you have free leave    alexas  aside  she stands confounded   despair is in her eyes    ventidius  now lay a sigh in the way to stop his passage   prepare a tear and bid it for his legions   tis like they shall be sold    cleopatra  how shall i plead my cause when you my judge   already have condemned me  shall i bring   the love you bore me for my advocate   that now is turned against me that destroys me   for love once past is at the best forgotten   but oftener sours to hate  twill please my lord   to ruin me and therefore ill be guilty   but could i once have thought it would have pleased you   that you would pry with narrow searching eyes   into my faults severe to my destruction   and watching all advantages with care   that serve to make me wretched  speak my lord   for i end here  though i deserved this usage   was it like you to give it    antony  oh you wrong me   to think i sought this parting or desired   to accuse you more than what will clear myself   and justify this breach    cleopatra  thus low i thank you   and since my innocence will not offend   i shall not blush to own it    ventidius  after this   i think shell blush at nothing    cleopatra  you seem grieved   and therein you are kind that caesar first   enjoyed my love though you deserved it better   i grieve for that my lord much more than you   for had i first been yours it would have saved   my second choice  i never had been his   and neer had been but yours  but caesar first   you say possessed my love  not so my lord   he first possessed my person you my love   caesar loved me but i loved antony   if i endured him after twas because   i judged it due to the first name of men   and half constrained i gave as to a tyrant   what he would take by force    ventidius  o syren  syren   yet grant that all the love she boasts were true   has she not ruined you  i still urge that   the fatal consequence    cleopatra  the consequence indeed   for i dare challenge him my greatest foe   to say it was designed  tis true i loved you   and kept you far from an uneasy wife   such fulvia was   yes but hell say you left octavia for me   and can you blame me to receive that love   which quitted such desert for worthless me   how often have i wished some other caesar   great as the first and as the second young   would court my love to be refused for you    ventidius  words words but actium sir remember actium    cleopatra  even there i dare his malice  true i counselled   to fight at sea but i betrayed you not   i fled but not to the enemy  twas fear   would i had been a man not to have feared   for none would then have envied me your friendship   who envy me your love    antony  we are both unhappy   if nothing else yet our ill fortune parts us   speak would you have me perish by my stay    cleopatra  if as a friend you ask my judgment go   if as a lover stay  if you must perish   tis a hard wordbut stay    ventidius  see now the effects of her so boasted love   she strives to drag you down to ruin with her   but could she scape without you oh how soon   would she let go her hold and haste to shore   and never look behind    cleopatra  then judge my love by this        giving antony a writing   could i have borne   a life or death a happiness or woe   from yours divided this had given me means    antony  by hercules the writing of octavius   i know it well  tis that proscribing hand   young as it was that led the way to mine   and left me but the second place in murder   see see ventidius here he offers egypt   and joins all syria to it as a present   so in requital she forsake my fortunes   and join her arms with his    cleopatra  and yet you leave me   you leave me antony and yet i love you   indeed i do  i have refused a kingdom   that is a trifle   for i could part with life with anything   but only you  oh let me die but with you   is that a hard request    antony  next living with you   tis all that heaven can give    alexas  he melts we conquer        aside    cleopatra  no you shall go  your interest calls you hence   yes your dear interest pulls too strong for these   weak arms to hold you here        takes his hand   go leave me soldier   for youre no more a lover  leave me dying   push me all pale and panting from your bosom   and when your march begins let one run after   breathless almost for joy and cryshes dead   the soldiers shout you then perhaps may sigh   and muster all your roman gravity   ventidius chides and straight your brow clears up   as i had never been    antony  gods tis too much too much for man to bear    cleopatra  what ist for me then   a weak forsaken woman and a lover   here let me breathe my last  envy me not   this minute in your arms  ill die apace   as fast as eer i can and end your trouble    antony  die rather let me perish loosened nature   leap from its hinges sink the props of heaven   and fall the skies to crush the nether world   my eyes my soul my all        embraces her    ventidius  and whats this toy   in balance with your fortune honour fame    antony  what ist ventidiusit outweighs them all   why we have more than conquered caesar now   my queens not only innocent but loves me   this this is she who drags me down to ruin   but could she scape without me with what haste   would she let slip her hold and make to shore   and never look behind   down on thy knees blasphemer as thou art   and ask forgiveness of wronged innocence    ventidius  ill rather die than take it  will you go    antony  go whither  go from all thats excellent   faith honour virtue all good things forbid   that i should go from her who sets my love   above the price of kingdoms  give you gods   give to your boy your caesar   this rattle of a globe to play withal   this gewgaw world and put him cheaply off   ill not be pleased with less than cleopatra    cleopatra  shes wholly yours  my hearts so full of joy   that i shall do some wild extravagance   of love in public and the foolish world   which knows not tenderness will think me mad    ventidius  o women women women all the gods   have not such power of doing good to man   as you of doing harm        exit    antony  our men are armed   unbar the gate that looks to caesars camp   i would revenge the treachery he meant me   and long security makes conquest easy   im eager to return before i go   for all the pleasures i have known beat thick   on my remembrancehow i long for night   that both the sweets of mutual love may try   and triumph once oer caesar ere we die        exeunt           act iii         scene i         at one door enter cleopatra charmion iras and alexas        a train of egyptians  at the other antony and romans        the entrance on both sides is prepared by music the        trumpets first sounding on antonys part  then answered        by timbrels etc on cleopatras  charmion and iras        hold a laurel wreath betwixt them  a dance of egyptians        after the ceremony cleopatra crowns antony    antony  i thought how those white arms would fold me in   and strain me close and melt me into love   so pleased with that sweet image i sprung forwards   and added all my strength to every blow    cleopatra  come to me come my soldier to my arms   youve been too long away from my embraces   but when i have you fast and all my own   with broken murmurs and with amorous sighs   ill say you were unkind and punish you   and mark you red with many an eager kiss    antony  my brighter venus    cleopatra  o my greater mars    antony  thou joinst us well my love   suppose me come from the phlegraean plains   where gasping giants lay cleft by my sword   and mountaintops paired off each other blow   to bury those i slew  receive me goddess   let caesar spread his subtle nets like vulcan   in thy embraces i would be beheld   by heaven and earth at once   and make their envy what they meant their sport   let those who took us blush i would love on   with awful state regardless of their frowns   as their superior gods   theres no satiety of love in thee   enjoyed thou still art new perpetual spring   is in thy arms the ripened fruit but falls   and blossoms rise to fill its empty place   and i grow rich by giving         enter ventidius and stands apart    alexas  oh now the dangers past your general comes   he joins not in your joys nor minds your triumphs   but with contracted brows looks frowning on   as envying your success    antony  now on my soul he loves me truly loves me   he never flattered me in any vice   but awes me with his virtue  even this minute   methinks he has a right of chiding me   lead to the temple  ill avoid his presence   it checks too strong upon me        exeunt the rest        as antony is going ventidius pulls him by the robe    ventidius  emperor    antony  tis the old argument i prythee spare me        looking back    ventidius  but this one hearing emperor    antony  let go   my robe or by my father hercules    ventidius  by hercules father thats yet greater   i bring you somewhat you would wish to know    antony  thou seest we are observed attend me here   and ill return        exit    ventidius  i am waning in his favour yet i love him   i love this man who runs to meet his ruin   and sure the gods like me are fond of him   his virtues lie so mingled with his crimes   as would confound their choice to punish one   and not reward the other         enter antony    antony  we can conquer   you see without your aid   we have dislodged their troops   they look on us at distance and like curs   scaped from the lions paws they bay far off   and lick their wounds and faintly threaten war   five thousand romans with their faces upward   lie breathless on the plain    ventidius  tis well and he   who lost them could have spared ten thousand more   yet if by this advantage you could gain   an easier peace while caesar doubts the chance   of arms    antony  oh think not ont ventidius   the boy pursues my ruin hell no peace   his malice is considerable in advantage   oh hes the coolest murderer so staunch   he kills and keeps his temper    ventidius  have you no friend   in all his army who has power to move him   maecenas or agrippa might do much    antony  theyre both too deep in caesars interests   well work it out by dint of sword or perish    ventidius  fain i would find some other    antony  thank thy love   some four or five such victories as this   will save thy further pains    ventidius  expect no more caesar is on his guard   i know sir you have conquered against odds   but still you draw supplies from one poor town   and of egyptians  he has all the world   and at his beck nations come pouring in   to fill the gaps you make  pray think again    antony  why dost thou drive me from myself to search   for foreign aidsto hunt my memory   and range all oer a waste and barren place   to find a friend  the wretched have no friends   yet i had one the bravest youth of rome   whom caesar loves beyond the love of women   he could resolve his mind as fire does wax   from that hard rugged image melt him down   and mould him in what softer form he pleased    ventidius  him would i see that man of all the world   just such a one we want    antony  he loved me too   i was his soul he lived not but in me   we were so closed within each others breasts   the rivets were not found that joined us first   that does not reach us yet  we were so mixt   as meeting streams both to ourselves were lost   we were one mass we could not give or take   but from the same for he was i i he    ventidius  he moves as i would wish him        aside    antony  after this   i need not tell his nametwas dolabella    ventidius  hes now in caesars camp    antony  no matter where   since hes no longer mine  he took unkindly   that i forbade him cleopatras sight   because i feared he loved her  he confessed   he had a warmth which for my sake he stifled   for twere impossible that two so one   should not have loved the same  when he departed   he took no leave and that confirmed my thoughts    ventidius  it argues that he loved you more than her   else he had stayed but he perceived you jealous   and would not grieve his friend  i know he loves you    antony  i should have seen him then ere now    ventidius  perhaps   he has thus long been labouring for your peace    antony  would he were here    ventidius  would you believe he loved you   i read your answer in your eyes you would   not to conceal it longer he has sent   a messenger from caesars camp with letters    antony  let him appear    ventidius  ill bring him instantly        exit ventidius and reenters immediately with dolabella    antony  tis he himself himself by holy friendship        runs to embrace him   art thou returned at last my better half   come give me all myself   let me not live   if the young bridegroom longing for his night   was ever half so fond    dolabella  i must be silent for my soul is busy   about a nobler work shes new come home   like a longabsent man and wanders oer   each room a stranger to her own to look   if all be safe    antony  thou hast whats left of me   for i am now so sunk from what i was   thou findst me at my lowest watermark   the rivers that ran in and raised my fortunes   are all dried up or

antony  why then i yet am so for thou art all   if i had any joy when thou wert absent   i grudged it to myself methought i robbed   thee of thy part  but o my dolabella   thou has beheld me other than i am   hast thou not seen my morning chambers filled   with sceptred slaves who waited to salute me   with eastern monarchs who forgot the sun   to worship my uprisingmenial kings   ran coursing up and down my palaceyard   stood silent in my presence watched my eyes   and at my least command all started out   like racers to the goal    dolabella  slaves to your fortune    antony  fortune is caesars now and what am i    ventidius  what you have made yourself i will not flatter    antony  is this friendly done    dolabella  yes when his end is so i must join with him   indeed i must and

hatred thou beheldst her first   as accessary to thy brothers death    dolabella  spare my remembrance twas a guilty day   and still the blush hangs here    antony  to clear herself   for sending him no aid she came from egypt   her galley down the silver cydnus rowed   the tackling silk the streamers waved with gold   the gentle winds were lodged in purple sails   her nymphs like nereids round her couch were placed   where she another seaborn venus lay    dolabella  no more i would not hear it    antony  oh you must   she lay and leant her cheek upon her hand   and cast a look so languishingly sweet   as if secure of all beholders hearts   neglecting she could take them  boys like cupids   stood fanning with their painted wings the winds   that played about her face  but if she smiled   a darting glory seemed to blaze abroad   that mens desiring eyes were never wearied   but hung upon the object  to soft flutes   the silver oars kept time and while they played   the hearing gave new pleasure to the sight   and both to thought  twas heaven or somewhat more   for she so charmed all hearts that gazing crowds   stood panting on the shore and wanted breath   to give their welcome voice   then dolabella where was then thy soul   was not thy fury quite disarmed with wonder   didst thou not shrink behind me from those eyes   and whisper in my earoh tell her not   that i accused her with my brothers death    dolabella  and should my weakness be a plea for yours   mine was an age when love might be excused   when kindly warmth and when my springing youth   made it a debt to nature  yours    ventidius  speak boldly   yours he would say in your declining age   when no more heat was left but what you forced   when all the sap was needful for the trunk   when it went down then you constrained the course   and robbed from nature to supply desire   in you i would not use so harsh a word   tis but plain dotage    antony  ha    dolabella  twas urged too home   but yet the loss was private that i made   twas but myself i lost  i lost no legions   i had no world to lose no peoples love    antony  this from a friend    dolabella  yes antony a true one   a friend so tender that each word i speak   stabs my own heart before it reach your ear   oh judge me not less kind because i chide   to caesar i excuse you    antony  o ye gods   have i then lived to be excused to caesar    dolabella  as to your equal    antony  well hes but my equal   while i wear this he never shall be more    dolabella  i bring conditions from him    antony  are they noble   methinks thou shouldst not bring them else yet he   is full of deep dissembling knows no honour   divided from his interest  fate mistook him   for nature meant him for an usurer   hes fit indeed to buy not conquer kingdoms    ventidius  then granting this   what power was theirs who wrought so hard a temper   to honourable terms    antony  i was my dolabella or some god    dolabella  nor i nor yet maecenas nor agrippa   they were your enemies and i a friend   too weak alone yet twas a romans deed    antony  twas like a roman done  show me that man   who has preserved my life my love my

 haste my dear eunuch haste        exit    alexas  this downright fighting fool this thickskulled hero   this blunt unthinking instrument of death   with plain dull virtue has outgone my wit   pleasure forsook my earliest infancy   the luxury of others robbed my cradle   and ravished thence the promise of a man   cast out from nature disinherited   of what her meanest children claim by kind   yet greatness kept me from contempt  thats gone   had cleopatra followed my advice   then he had been betrayed who now forsakes   she dies for love but she has known its joys   gods is this just that i who know no joys   must die because she loves         enter cleopatra charmion iras and train    o madam i have seen what blasts my eyes   octavias here    cleopatra  peace with that ravens

 confined to her  it is  poor i was made   of that coarse matter which when she was finished   the gods threw by for rubbish    alexas  she is indeed a very miracle    cleopatra  death to my hopes a miracle    alexas  a miracle        bowing   i mean of goodness for in beauty madam   you make all wonders cease    cleopatra  i was too rash   take this in part of recompense  but oh        giving a

haughty carriage    cleopatra  shows i am a queen   nor need i ask you who you are    octavia  a roman   a name that makes and can unmake a queen    cleopatra  your lord the man who serves me is a roman    octavia  he was a roman till he lost that name   to be a slave in egypt but i come   to free him thence    cleopatra  peace peace my lovers juno   when he grew weary of that household clog   he chose my easier bonds    octavia  i wonder not   your bonds are easy  you have long been practised   in that lascivious art  hes not the first   for whom you spread your snares  let caesar witness    cleopatra  i loved not caesar twas but gratitude   i paid his love  the worst your malice can   is but to say the greatest of mankind   has been my slave  the next but far above him   in my esteem is he whom law calls yours   but whom his love made mine    octavia  i would view nearer        coming up close to her   that face which has so long usurped my right   to find the inevitable charms that catch   mankind so sure that ruined my dear lord    cleopatra  oh you do well to search for had you known   but half these charms you had not lost his heart    octavia  far be their knowledge from a roman lady   far from a modest wife  shame of our sex   dost thou not blush to own those black endearments   that make sin pleasing    cleopatra  you may blush who want them   if bounteous nature if indulgent heaven   have given me charms to please the bravest man   should i not thank them  should i be ashamed   and not be proud  i am that he has loved me   and when i love not him heaven change this face   for one like that    octavia  thou lovst him not so well    cleopatra  i love him better and deserve him more    octavia  you do not cannot  you have been his ruin   who made him cheap at rome but cleopatra   who made him scorned abroad but cleopatra   at actium who betrayed him  cleopatra   who made his children orphans and poor me   a wretched widow only cleopatra    cleopatra  yet she who loves him best is cleopatra   if you have suffered i have suffered more   you bear the specious title of a wife   to gild your cause and draw the pitying world   to favour it  the world condemns poor me   for i have lost my honour lost my fame   and stained the glory of my royal house   and all to bear the branded name of mistress   there wants but life and that too i would lose   for him i love    octavia  bet so then take thy wish        exit with her train    cleopatra  and tis my wish   now he is lost for whom alone i lived   my sight grows dim and every object dances   and swims before me in the maze of death   my spirits while they were opposed kept up   they could not sink beneath a rivals scorn   but now shes gone they faint    alexas  mine have had leisure   to recollect their strength and furnish counsel   to ruin her who else must ruin you    cleopatra  vain promiser   lead me my charmion nay your hand too iras   my grief has weight enough to sink you both   conduct me to some solitary chamber   and draw the curtains round   then leave me to myself to take alone   my fill of grief      there i till death will his unkindness weep      as harmless infants moan themselves asleep        exeunt           act iv         scene i         enter antony and dolabella    dolabella  why would you shift it from yourself on me   can you not tell her you must part    antony  i cannot   i could pull out an eye and bid it go   and tother should not weep  o dolabella   how many deaths are in this word depart   i dare not trust my tongue to tell her so   one look of hers would thaw me into tears   and i should melt till i were lost again    dolabella  then let ventidius   hes rough by nature    antony  oh hell speak too harshly   hell kill her with the news  thou only thou    dolabella  nature has cast me in so soft a mould   that but to hear a story feigned for pleasure   of some sad lovers death moistens my eyes   and robs me of my manhood  i should speak   so faintly with such fear to grieve her heart   shed not believe it earnest    antony  thereforetherefore   thou only thou art fit  think thyself me   and when thou speakst but let it first be long   take off the edge from every sharper sound   and let our parting be as gently made   as other loves begin  wilt thou do this    dolabella  what you have said so sinks into my soul   that if i must speak i shall speak just so    antony  i leave you then to your sad task  farewell   i sent her word to meet you        goes to the door and comes back   i forgot   let her be told ill make her peace with mine   her crown and dignity shall be preserved   if i have power with caesaroh be sure   to think on that    dolabella  fear not i will remember        antony goes again to the door and comes back    antony  and tell her too how much i was constrained   i did not this but with extremest force   desire her not to hate my memory   for i still cherish hersinsist on that    dolabella  trust me  ill not forget it    antony  then thats all        goes out and returns again   wilt thou forgive my fondness this once more   tell her though we shall never meet again   if i should hear she took another love   the news would break my heartnow i must go   for every time i have returned i feel   my soul more tender and my next command   would be to bid her stay and ruin both        exit    dolabella  men are but children of a larger growth   our appetites as apt to change as theirs   and full as craving too and full as vain   and yet the soul shut up in her dark room   viewing so clear abroad at home sees nothing   but like a mole in earth busy and blind   works all her folly up and casts it outward   to the worlds open view  thus i discovered   and blamed the love of ruined antony   yet wish that i were he to be so ruined         enter ventidius above    ventidius  alone and talking to himself concerned too   perhaps my guess is right he loved her once   and may pursue it still    dolabella  o friendship friendship   ill canst thou answer this and reason worse   unfaithful in the attempt hopeless to win   and if i win undone  mere madness all   and yet the occasions fair  what injury   to him to wear the robe which he throws by    ventidius  none none at all  this happens as i wish   to ruin her yet more with antony         enter cleopatra talking with alexas        charmion iras on the other side    dolabella  she comes  what charms have sorrow on that face   sorrow seems pleased to dwell with so much sweetness   yet now and then a melancholy smile   breaks loose like lightning in a winters night   and shows a moments day    ventidius  if she should love him too her eunuch there   that porcpisce bodes ill weather  draw draw nearer   sweet devil that i may hear    alexas  believe me try        dolabella goes over to charmion and iras         seems to talk with them   to make him jealous jealousy is like   a polished glass held to the lips when lifes in doubt   if there be breath twill catch the damp and show it    cleopatra  i grant you jealousys a proof of love   but tis a weak and unavailing medicine   it puts out the disease and makes it show   but has no power to cure    alexas  tis your last remedy and strongest too   and then this dolabella who so fit   to practise on  hes handsome valiant young   and looks as he were laid for natures bait   to catch weak womens eyes   he stands already more than half suspected   of loving you  the least kind word or glance   you give this youth will kindle him with love   then like a burning vessel set adrift   youll send him down amain before the wind   to fire the heart of jealous antony    cleopatra  can i do this  ah no my loves so true   that i can neither hide it where it is   nor show it where it is not  nature meant me   a wife a silly harmless household dove   fond without art and kind without deceit   but fortune that has made a mistress of me   has thrust me out to the wide world unfurnished   of falsehood to be happy    alexas  force yourself   the event will be your lover will return   doubly desirous to possess the good   which once he feared to lose    cleopatra  i must attempt it   but oh with what regret        exit alexas  she comes up to dolabella    ventidius  so now the scene draws near theyre in my reach    cleopatra  to dolabella   discoursing with my women might not i   share in your entertainment    charmion  you have been   the subject of it madam    cleopatra  how and how    iras  such praises of your beauty    cleopatra  mere poetry   your roman wits your gallus and tibullus   have taught you this from cytheris and delia    dolabella  those roman wits have never been in egypt   cytheris and delia else had been unsung   i who have seenhad i been born a poet   should choose a nobler name    cleopatra  you flatter me   but tis your nations vice  all of your country   are flatterers and all false  your friends like you   im sure he sent you not to speak these words    dolabella  no madam yet he sent me    cleopatra  well he sent you    dolabella  of a less pleasing errand    cleopatra  how less pleasing   less to yourself or me    dolabella  madam to both   for you must mourn and i must grieve to cause it    cleopatra  you charmion and your fellow stand at distance   hold up my spirits  asidewell now your mournful matter   for im prepared perhaps can guess it too    dolabella  i wish you would for tis a thankless office   to tell ill news  and i of all your sex   most fear displeasing you    cleopatra  of all your sex   i soonest could forgive you if you should    ventidius  most delicate advances  women women   dear damned inconstant sex    cleopatra  in the first place   i am to be forsaken ist not so    dolabella  i wish i could not answer to that question    cleopatra  then pass it oer because it troubles you   i should have been more grieved another time   next im to lose my kingdomfarewell egypt   yet is there ary more    dolabella  madam i fear   your too deep sense of grief has turned your reason    cleopatra  no no im not run mad i can bear fortune   and love may be expelled by other love   as poisons are by poisons    dolabella  you oerjoy me madam   to find your griefs so moderately borne   youve heard the worst all are not false like him    cleopatra  no heaven forbid they should    dolabella  some men are constant    cleopatra  and constancy deserves reward thats certain    dolabella  deserves it not but give it leave to hope    ventidius  ill swear thou hast my leave  i have enough   but how to manage this  well ill consider        exit    dolabella  i came prepared   to tell you heavy news news which i thought   would fright the blood from your pale cheeks to hear   but you have met it with a cheerfulness   that makes my task more easy and my tongue   which on anothers message was employed   would gladly speak its own    cleopatra  hold dolabella   first tell me were you chosen by my lord   or sought you this employment    dolabella  he picked me out and as his bosom friend   he charged me with his words    cleopatra  the message then   i know was tender and each accent smooth   to mollify that rugged word depart    dolabella  oh you mistake  he chose the harshest words   with fiery eyes and contracted brows   he coined his face in the severest stamp   and fury shook his fabric like an earthquake   he heaved for vent and burst like bellowing aetna   in sounds scarce humanhence away for ever   let her begone the blot of my renown   and bane of all my hopes        all the time of this speech cleopatra seems more         and more concerned till she sinks quite down   let her be driven as far as men can think   from mans commerce shell poison to the centre    cleopatra  oh i can bear no more    dolabella  help helpo wretch  o cursed cursed wretch   what have i done    charmion  help chafe her temples iras    iras  bend bend her forward quickly    charmion  heaven be praised   she comes again    cleopatra  oh let him not approach me   why have you brought me back to this loathed being   the abode of falsehood violated vows   and injured love  for pity let me go   for if there be a place of long repose   im sure i want it  my disdainful lord   can never break that quiet nor awake   the sleeping soul with hollowing in my tomb   such words as fright her henceunkind unkind    dolabella believe me tis against myself i speak        kneeling   that sure desires belief i injured him   my friend neer spoke those words  oh had you seen   how often he came back and every time   with something more obliging and more kind   to add to what he said what dear farewells   how almost vanquished by his love he parted   and leaned to what unwillingly he left   i traitor as i was for love of you   but what can you not do who made me false   i forged that lie for whose forgiveness kneels   this selfaccused selfpunished criminal    cleopatra  with how much ease believe we what we wish   rise dolabella if you have been guilty   i have contributed and too much love   has made me guilty too   the advance of kindness which i made was feigned   to call back fleeting love by jealousy   but twould not last  oh rather let me lose   than so ignobly trifle with his heart    dolabella  i find your breast fenced round from human reach   transparent as a rock of solid crystal   seen through but never pierced  my friend my friend   what endless treasure hast thou thrown away   and scattered like an infant in the ocean   vain sums of wealth which none can gather thence    cleopatra  could you not beg   an hours admittance to his private ear   like one who wanders through long barren wilds   and yet foreknows no hospitable inn   is near to succour hunger eats his fill   before his painful march   so would i feed a while my famished eyes   before we part for i have far to go   if death be far and never must return         ventidius with octavia behind    ventidius  from hence you may discoveroh sweet sweet   would you indeed  the pretty hand in earnest    dolabella  i will for this reward        takes her hand   draw it not back   tis all i eer will beg    ventidius  they turn upon us    octavia  what quick eyes has guilt    ventidius  seem not to have observed them and go on        they enter    dolabella saw you the emperor ventidius    ventidius  no   i sought him but i heard that he was private   none with him but hipparchus his freedman    dolabella  know you his business    ventidius  giving him instructions   and letters to his brother caesar    dolabella  well   he must be found        exeunt dolabella and cleopatra    octavia  most glorious impudence    ventidius  she looked methought   as she would saytake your old man octavia   thank you im better here   well but what use   make we of this discovery    octavia  let it die    ventidius  i pity dolabella but shes dangerous   her eyes have power beyond thessalian charms   to draw the moon from heaven for eloquence   the seagreen syrens taught her voice their flattery   and while she speaks night steals upon the day   unmarked of those that hear  then shes so charming   age buds at sight of her and swells to youth   the holy priests gaze on her when she smiles   and with heaved hands forgetting gravity   they bless her wanton eyes  even i who hate her   with a malignant joy behold such beauty   and while i curse desire it  antony   must needs have some remains of passion still   which may ferment into a worse relapse   if now not fully cured  i know this minute   with caesar hes endeavouring her peace    octavia  you have prevailedbut for a further purpose        walks off   ill prove how he will relish this discovery   what make a strumpets peace it swells my heart   it must not shall not be    ventidius  his guards appear   let me begin and you shall second me         enter antony    antony  octavia i was looking you my love   what are your letters ready  i have given   my last instructions    octavia  mine my lord are written    antony  ventidius        drawing him aside    ventidius  my lord    antony  a word in private   when saw you dolabella    ventidius  now my lord   he parted hence and cleopatra with him    antony  speak softlytwas by my command he went   to bear my last farewell    ventidius  it looked indeed        aloud   like your farewell    antony  more softlymy farewell   what secret meaning have you in those words   ofmy farewell  he did it by my order    ventidius  then he obeyed your order  i suppose        aloud   you bid him do it with all gentleness   all kindness and alllove    antony  how she mourned   the poor forsaken creature    ventidius  she took it as she ought she bore your parting   as she did caesars as she would anothers   were a new love to come    antony  thou dost belie her        aloud   most basely and maliciously belie her    ventidius  i thought not to displease you i have done    octavia  you seemed disturbed my lord        coming up    antony  a very trifle   retire my love    ventidius  it was indeed a trifle   he sent    antony  no more  look how thou disobeyst me        angrily   thy life shall answer it    octavia  then tis no trifle    ventidius  to octavia   tis less a very nothing  you too saw it   as well as i and therefore tis no secret    antony  she saw it    ventidius  yes  she saw young dolabella    antony  young dolabella    ventidius  young i think him young   and handsome too and so do others think him   but what of that  he went by your command   indeed tis probable with some kind message   for she received it graciously she smiled   and then he grew familiar with her hand   squeezed it and worried it with ravenous kisses   she blushed and sighed and smiled and blushed again   at last she took occasion to talk softly   and brought her cheek up close and leaned on his   at which he whispered kisses back on hers   and then she cried aloudthat constancy   should be rewarded    octavia  this i saw and heard    antony  what woman was it whom you heard and saw   so playful with my friend   not cleopatra    ventidius  even she my lord    antony  my cleopatra    ventidius  your cleopatra   dolabellas cleopatra every mans cleopatra    antony  thou liest    ventidius  i do not lie my lord   is this so strange  should mistresses be left   and not provide against a time of change   you know shes not much used to lonely nights    antony  ill think no more ont   i know tis false and see the plot betwixt you   you needed not have gone this way octavia   what harms it you that cleopatras just   shes mine no more  i see and i forgive   urge it no further love    octavia  are you concerned   that shes found false    antony  i should be were it so   for though tis past i would not that the world   should tax my former choice that i loved one   of so light note but i forgive you both    ventidius  what has my age deserved that you should think   i would abuse your ears with perjury   if heaven be true shes false    antony  though heaven and earth   should witness it ill not believe her tainted    ventidius  ill bring you then a witness   from hell to prove her sonay go not back        seeing alexas just entering and starting back   for stay you must and shall    alexas  what means my lord    ventidius  to make you do what most you hatespeak truth   you are of cleopatras private counsel   of her bedcounsel her lascivious hours   are conscious of each nightly change she makes   and watch her as chaldaeans do the moon   can tell what signs she passes through what day    alexas  my noble lord    ventidius  my most illustrious pander   no fine set speech no cadence no turned periods   but a plain homespun truth is what i ask   i did myself oerhear your queen make love   to dolabella  speak for i will know   by your confession what more passed betwixt them   how near the business draws to your employment   and when the happy hour    antony  speak truth alexas whether it offend   or please ventidius care not  justify   thy injured queen from malice  dare his worst    octavia  aside  see how he gives him courage how he fears   to find her false and shuts his eyes to truth   willing to be misled    alexas  as far as love may plead for womans frailty   urged by desert and greatness of the lover   so far divine octavia may my queen   stand even excused to you for loving him   who is your lord  so far from brave ventidius   may her past actions hope a fair report    antony  tis well and truly spoken  mark ventidius    alexas  to you most noble emperor her strong passion   stands not excused but wholly justified   her beautys charms alone without her crown   from ind and meroe drew the distant vows   of sighing kings and at her feet were laid   the sceptres of the earth exposed on heaps   to choose where she would reign   she thought a roman only could deserve her   and of all romans only antony   and to be less than wife to you disdained   their lawful passion    antony  tis but truth    alexas  and yet though love and your unmatched desert   have drawn her from the due regard of honour   at last heaven opened her unwilling eyes   to see the wrongs she offered fair octavia   whose holy bed she lawlessly usurped

and weakness   but bears its workings outward to the world   i should have kept the mighty anguish in   and forced a smile at cleopatras falsehood   octavia had believed it and had stayed   but i am made a shallowforded stream   seen to the bottom  all my clearness scorned   and all my faults exposedsee where he comes         enter dollabella    who has profaned the sacred name of friend   and worn it into vileness   with how secure a brow and specious form   he gilds the secret villain  sure that face   was meant for honesty but heaven mismatched it   and furnished treason out with natures pomp   to make its work more easy    dolabella  o my friend    antony  well dolabella you performed my message    dolabella  i did unwillingly    antony  unwillingly   was it so hard for you to bear our parting   you should have wished it    dolabella  why    antony  because you love me   and she received my message with as true   with as unfeigned a sorrow as you brought it    dolabella  she

were she mine    antony  and yet you first   persuaded me  how come you altered since    dolabella  i said at first i was not fit to go   i could not hear her sighs and see her tears   but pity must prevail  and so perhaps   it may again with you for i have promised   that she should take her last farewell  and see   she comes to claim my word         enter cleopatra    antony  false dolabella    dolabella  whats false my lord    antony  why dolabellas false   and cleopatras false both false and faithless   draw near you welljoined wickedness you serpents   whom i have in my kindly bosom

if fate   be just much greater  heaven should be ingenious   in punishing such crimes  the rolling stone   and gnawing vulture were slight pains invented   when jove was young and no examples known   of mighty ills but you have ripened sin   to such a monstrous growth twill pose the gods   to find an equal torture  two two such   oh theres no further nametwo such to me   to me who locked my soul within your breasts   had no desires no joys no life but you   when half the globe was mine i gave it you   in dowry with my heart i had no use   no fruit of all but you  a friend and mistress   was what the world could give  o cleopatra   o dolabella how could you betray   this tender heart which with an infant fondness   lay lulled betwixt your bosoms and there slept   secure of injured faith

cleopatra  they are enemies    antony  alexas is not so  he he confessed it   he who next hell best knew it he avowed it   why do i seek a proof beyond yourself        to dolabella   you whom i sent to bear my last farewell   returned to plead her stay    dolabella  what shall i answer   if to have loved be guilt then i have sinned   but if to have repented of that love   can wash away my crime i have repented   yet if i have offended past forgiveness   let not her suffer  she is innocent    cleopatra  ah what will not a woman do who loves   what means will she refuse to keep that heart   where all her joys are placed  twas i encouraged   twas i blew up the fire that scorched his soul   to make you jealous and by that regain you   but all in vain i could not counterfeit   in spite of all the dams my love broke oer   and drowned by heart again  fate took the occasion   and thus one minutes feigning has destroyed   my whole lifes truth    antony  thin cobweb arts of falsehood   seen

driven you out  avoid my sight   i would not kill the man whom i have loved   and cannot hurt the woman but avoid me   i do not know how long i can be tame   for if i stay one minute more to think   how i am wronged my justice and revenge   will cry so loud within me that my pity   will not be heard for either    dolabella  heaven has but   our sorrow for our sins and then delights   to pardon erring man  sweet mercy seems   its darling attribute which limits justice   as if there were degrees in infinite   and infinite would rather want perfection   than punish to extent    antony  i can forgive   a foe but not a mistress and a friend   treason is there in its most horrid shape   where trust is greatest and the soul resigned   is stabbed by its own guards  ill hear no more   hence from my sight for ever    cleopatra  how for ever   i cannot go one moment from your sight   and must i go for ever   my joys my only joys are centred here   what place have i to go to  my own kingdom   that i have lost for you  or to the romans   they hate me for your sake  or must i wander   the wide world oer a helpless banished woman   banished for love of you banished from you   ay theres the banishment  oh hear me hear me   with strictest justice  for i beg no favour   and if i have offended you then kill me   but do not banish me    antony  i must not hear you   i have a fool within me

  to place myself beneath the mighty flaw   thus to be crushed and pounded into atoms   by its oerwhelming weight  tis too presuming   for subjects to preserve that wilful power   which courts its own destruction    cleopatra  i would reason   more calmly with you  did not you oerrule   and force my plain direct and open love   into these crooked paths of jealousy   now whats the event  octavia is

  and thrice with cheerful cries they shouted back   twas then false fortune like a fawning strumpet   about to leave the bankrupt prodigal   with a dissembled smile would kiss at parting   and flatter to the last the welltimed oars   now dipt from every bank now smoothly run   to meet the foe and soon indeed they met   but not as foes  in few we saw their caps   on either side thrown up the

asks his oracle the glass   if pink or purple best become his face   for our poor wretch he neither rails nor prays   nor likes your wit just as you like his plays   he has not yet so much of mr bayes

ambition move   but grace you him who lost the world for love     yet if some antiquated lady say   the last age is not copied in his play   heaven help the man who for that face must drudge   which

one mans work to please you all
