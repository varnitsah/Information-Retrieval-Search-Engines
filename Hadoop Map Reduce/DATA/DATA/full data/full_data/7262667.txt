          1  proserpina  introduction  brantwood 14th march 1874  yesterday evening i was looking over the first book in which i studied botanycurtiss magazine published in 1795 at no 3 st georges crescent blackfriars road and sold by the principal booksellers in great britain and ireland its plates are excellent so that i am always glad to find in it the picture of a flower i know and i came yesterday upon what i suppose to be a variety of a favourite flower of mine called in curtis the st brunos lily  i am obliged to say what i suppose to be a variety because my pet lily is branched1 while this is drawn as unbranched and especially stated to be so and the page of text in which this statement is made is so characteristic of botanical books and botanical science not to say all science as hitherto taught for the blessing of mankind 2 and of the difficulties thereby accompanying its communication that i extract the page entire printing it opposite as nearly as possible in facsimile  now you observe in this instructive page that you have in the first place nine names given you for one flower and that among these nine names you are not even at liberty to make your choice because the united authority of haller and miller may be considered as an accurate balance to the single authority of linnæus and you ought therefore for the present to remain yourself balanced between the sides you may be farther embarrassed by finding that the anthericum of savoy is only described as growing in switzerland and farther still by finding that mr miller describes two varieties of it which differ only in size while you are left to conjecture whether the one here figured is the larger or smaller and how great the difference is  farther if you wish to know anything of the habits of the plant as well as its nine names you are informed that it grows both at the bottoms of the mountains and the tops and that with us it flowers in may and junebut you are not told when in its native country  the four lines of the last clause but one may indeed be useful to gardeners butalthough i know my good father and mother did the best they could for me in buying this beautiful book and though the admirable plates of it did their work and taught me much i cannot wonder that neither my infantine nor boyish mind was irresistibly attracted by the text of which this page is one of the most favourable specimens nor in consequence that my botanical studies werewhen i had attained the age of fiftyno farther advanced than the reader will find them in the opening chapter of this book  3                                                         318      anthericum liliastrum savoy anthericum     or st brunos lily      class and order      hexandria monogynia      generic

this     plant linnÆus considers it as an anthericum haller and miller make     it an hemerocallis      it is a native of switzerland where haller informs us it grows     abundantly in the alpine meadows and even on the summits of the     mountains with us it flowers in may and june      it is a plant of great elegance producing on an unbranched stem about     a foot and a half high numerous flowers of a delicate white colour     much smaller but resembling in form those of the common white lily     possessing a considerable degree of fragrance their beauty is     heightened by the rich orange colour of their antheræ unfortunately     they are but of short duration      miller describes two varieties of it differing merely in size      a loamy soil a situation moderately moist with an eastern or western     exposure suits this plant best so situated it will increase by its     roots though not very fast and by parting of these in the autumn it     is usually propagated      parkinson describes and figures it in his parad terrest observing     that divers allured by the beauty of its flowers had brought it into     these parts                                       4  which said book was therefore undertaken to put if it might be some elements of the science of botany into a form more tenable by ordinary human and childish faculties orfor i can scarcely say i have yet any tenure of it myselfto make the paths of approach to it more pleasant in fact i only know of it the pleasant distant effects which it bears to simple eyes and some pretty mists and mysteries which i invite my young readers to pierce as they may for themselvesmy power of guiding them being only for a little way  pretty mysteries i say as opposed to the vulgar and ugly mysteries of the socalled science of botanyexemplified sufficiently in this chosen page respecting which please observe farthernobodyi can say this very boldlyloves latin more dearly than i but precisely because i do love it as well as for other reasons i have always insisted that books whether scientific or not ought to be written either in latin or english and not in a doggish mixture of the refuse of both  linnæus wrote a noble book of universal natural history in latin it is one of the permanent classical treasures of the world and if any scientific man thinks his labors are worth the worlds attention let him also write 5 what he has to say in latin finishedly and exquisitely if it take him a month to a page2  but ifwhich unless he be one chosen of millions is assuredly the facthis lucubrations are only of local and temporary consequence let him write as clearly as he can in his native language  this book accordingly i have written in english not by the way that i could have written it in anything elseso there are small thanks to me and one of its purposes is to interpret for young english readers the necessary european latin or greek names of flowers and to make them vivid and vital to their understandings but two great difficulties occur in doing this the first that there are generally from three or four up to two dozen latin names current for every flower and every new botanist thinks his eminence only to be properly asserted by adding another  the second and a much more serious one is of the devils own contrivingand remember i am always quite serious when i speak of the devilnamely that the most current and authoritative names are apt to be founded on some unclean or debasing association so that to interpret them is to defile the readers mind i will give no instance too many will at once occur to any 6 learned reader and the unlearned i need not vex with so much as one but in such cases since i could only take refuge in the untranslated word by leaving other greek or latin words also untranslated and the nomenclature still entirely senselessand i do not choose to do thisthere is only one other course open to me namely to substitute boldly to my own pupils other generic names for the plants thus faultfully hitherto titled  as i do not do this for my own pride but honestly for my readers service i neither question nor care how far the emendations i propose may be now or hereafter adopted i shall not even name the cases in which they have been made for the serious reason above specified but even shall mask those which there was real occasion to alter by sometimes giving new names in cases where there was no necessity of such kind doubtless i shall be accused of doing myself what i violently blame in others i do so but with a different motiveof which let the reader judge as he is disposed the practical result will be that the children who learn botany on the system adopted in this book will know the useful and beautiful names of plants hitherto given in all languages the useless and ugly ones they will not know and they will have to learn one latin name for each plant which when differing from the common one i trust may yet by some scientific persons be accepted and with ultimate advantage  the learning of the one latin nameas for instance gramen striatumi hope will be accurately enforced 7 alwaysbut not less carefully the learning of the pretty english oneladielace grasswith due observance that ladies laces hath leaves like unto millet in fashion with many white vaines or ribs and silver strakes running along through the middest of the leaves fashioning the same like to laces of white and green silk very beautiful and faire to behold  i have said elsewhere and can scarcely repeat too often that a day will come when men of science will think their names disgraced instead of honoured by being used to barbarise nomenclature i hope therefore that my own name may be kept well out of the way but having been privileged to found the school of art in the university of oxford i think that i am justified in requesting any scientific writers who may look kindly upon this book to add such of the names suggested in it as they think deserving of acceptance to their own lists of synonyms under the head of schol art oxon  the difficulties thrown in the way of any quiet private student by existing nomenclature may be best illustrated by my simply stating what happens to myself in endeavouring to use the page above facsimiled not knowing how far st brunos lily might be connected with my own pet one and not having any sufficient book on swiss botany i take down loudons encyclopædia of plants a most useful book as far as any book in the present state of the science can be useful and find under the head of anthericum the savoy lily indeed but only the 8 following general information809 anthericum a name applied by the greeks to the stem of the asphodel and not misapplied to this set of plants which in some sort resemble the asphodel plants with fleshy leaves and spikes of bright yellow flowers easily cultivated if kept dry  hunting further i find again my savoy lily called a spiderplant under the article hemerocallis and the only information which the book gives me under hemerocallis is that it means beautiful day lily and then this is an ornamental genus of the easiest culture the species are remarkable among border flowers for their fine orange yellow or blue flowers the hemerocallis coerulea has been considered a distinct genus by mr salisbury and called saussurea as i correct this sheet for press however i find that the hemerocallis is now to be called funkia in honour of mr funk a prussian apothecary  all this while meantime i have a suspicion that my pet savoy lily is not in existing classification an anthericum nor a hemerocallis but a lilium it is in fact simply a turks cap which doesnt curl up but on trying lilium in loudon i find no mention whatever of any wild branched white lily  i then try the next word in my specimen page of curtis but there is no phalangium at all in loudons index and now i have neither time nor mind for more search but will give in due place such account as i can 9 of my own dwarf branched lily which i shall call st brunos as well as this liliastrumno offence to the saint i hope for it grows very gloriously on the limestones of savoy presumably therefore at the grande chartreuse though i did not notice it there and made a very unmonkish use of it when i gathered it lastthere was a pretty young english lady at the tabledhôte in the hotel du mont blanc at st martins3 and i wanted to get speech of her and didnt know how so all i could think of was to go halfway up the aiguille de varens to gather st brunos lilies and i made a great cluster of them and put wild roses all around them as i came down i never saw anything so lovely and i thought to present this to her before dinnerbut when i got down she had gone away to chamouni my fors always treated me like that in affairs of the heart  i had begun my studies of alpine botany just eighteen years before in 1842 by making a careful drawing of woodsorrel at chamouni and bitterly sorry i am now that the work was interrupted for i drew then very delicately and should have made a pretty book if i could have got peace even yet i can manage my point a little and would far rather be making outlines of flowers than writing and i meant to have drawn every english and scottish wild flower like this cluster of bog heather opposite4back and profile and front but blackwoods 10 magazine with its insults to turner dragged me into controversy and i have not had properly speaking a days peace since so that in 1868 my botanical studies were advanced only as far as the reader will see in next chapter and now in 1874 must end altogether i suppose heavier thoughts and work coming fast on me so that finding among my notebooks two or three full of broken materials for the proposed work on flowers and thinking they may be useful even as fragments i am going to publish them in their present stateonly let the reader note that while my other books endeavour and claim so far as they reach to give trustworthy knowledge of their subjects this one only shows how such knowledge may be obtained and it is little more than a history of efforts and plansbut of both i believe made in right methods  one part of the book however will i think be found of permanent value mr burgess has engraved on wood in reduced size with consummate skill some of the excellent old drawings in the flora danica and has interpreted and facsimiled some of his own and my drawings from nature with a vigour and precision unsurpassed in woodcut illustration which render these outlines the best exercises in black and white i have yet been able to 11 prepare for my drawing pupils the larger engravings by mr allen may also be used with advantage as copies for drawings with pen or sepia  rome 10th may my fathers birthday  i found the loveliest blue asphodel i ever saw in my life yesterday in the fields beyond monte marioa spire two feet high of more than two hundred stars the stalks of them all deep blue as well as the flowers heaven send all honest people the gathering of the like in elysian fields some day                                       12  chapter i  moss  denmark hill 3rd november 1868  1 it is mortifying enough to writebut i think thus much ought to be writtenconcerning myself as the author of modern painters in three months i shall be fifty years old and i dont at this hourten oclock in the morning of the two hundred and sixtyeighth day of my fortyninth yearknow what moss is  there is nothing i have more intended to knowsome day or other but the moss would always be there and then it was so beautiful and so difficult to examine that one could only do it in some quite separated time of happy leisurewhich came not i never was like to have less leisure than now but i will know what moss is if possible forthwith  2 to that end i read preparatorily yesterday what account i could find of it in all the botanical books in the house out of them all i get this general notion of a mossthat it has a fine fibrous roota stem surrounded with spirally set leavesand produces its fruit in a small case under a cap i fasten especially however on a 13 sentence of louis figuiers about the particular species hypnum  these mosses which often form little islets of verdure at the feet of poplars and willows are robust vegetable organisms which do not decay5  3 qui ne pourrissent point what do they do with themselves thenit immediately occurs to me to ask and secondlyif this immortality belongs to the hypnum only  it certainly does not by any means but however modified or limited this immortality is the first thing we ought to take note of in the mosses they are in some degree what the everlasting is in flowers those minute green leaves of theirs do not decay nor fall  but how do they die or how stop growing thenit is the first thing i want to know about them and from all the books in the house i cant as yet find out this meanwhile i will look at the leaves themselves  4 going out to the garden i bring in a bit of old brick emerald green on its rugged surface6 and a thick piece of mossy turf  first for the old brick to think of the quantity of pleasure one has had in ones life from that emerald green velvetand yet that for the first time today i am verily going to look at it doing so through a pocket 14 lens of no great power i find the velvet to be composed of small starlike groups of smooth strong oval leavesintensely green and much like the young leaves of any other plant except in thisthey all have a long brown spike like a sting at their ends  illustration fig 1  5 fastening on that i take the flora danica7 and look through its plates of mosses for their leaves only and i find first that this spike or strong central rib is characteristicsecondly that the said leaves are apt to be not only spiked but serrated and otherwise angrylooking at the pointsthirdly that they have a tendency to fold together in the centre fig 18 and at last after an hours work at them it strikes me suddenly that they are more like pineapple leaves than anything else  and it occurs to me very unpleasantly at the same time that i dont know what a pineapple is  stopping to ascertain that i am told that a pineapple belongs to the bromeliaceæcant stop to find out what that meansnay that of these plants the pineapple is the representative loudon their habit is acid their leaves rigid and toothed with spines their 15 bracteas often coloured with scarlet and their flowers either white or bluewhat are their flowers like but the two sentences that most interest me are that in the damp forests of carolina the tillandsia which is an epiphyte ie a plant growing on other plants forms dense festoons among the branches of the trees vegetating among the black mould that collects upon the bark of trees in hot damp countries other species are inhabitants of deep and gloomy forests and others form with their spring leaves an impenetrable herbage in the pampas of brazil so they really seem to be a kind of moss on a vast scale  6 next i find in gray9 bromeliaceæ andthe very thing i wanttillandsia the black moss or long moss which like most bromelias grows on the branches of trees so the pineapple is really a moss only it is a moss that flowers but imperfectly the fine fruit is caused by the consolidation of the imperfect flowers i wish we could consolidate some imperfect english mossflowers into little pineapples thenthough they were only as big as filberts but we cannot follow that farther now nor consider when a flower is perfect and when it is not or we should get into morals and i dont know where else we will go back to the moss i have gathered for i begin to see my way a little to understanding it  16  7 the second piece i have on the table is a clusteran inch or two deepof the moss that grows everywhere and that the birds use for nestbuilding and we for packing and the like it is dry since yesterday and its fibres define themselves against the dark ground in warm green touched with a glittering light note that burnished lustre of the minute leaves they are necessarily always relieved against dark hollows and this lustre makes them much clearer and brighter than if they were of dead green in that lustreand it is characteristic of themthey differ wholly from the dead aloelike texture of the pineapple leaf and remind me as i look at them closely a little of some conditions of chaff as on heads of wheat after being threshed i will hunt down that clue presently meantime there is something else to be noticed on the old brick  illustration fig 2  8 out of its emerald green cushions of minute leaves there rise here and there thin red threads each with a little brown cap or something like a cap at the top of it these red threads shooting up out of the green tufts are i believe the fructification of the moss fringing its surface in the woods and on the rocks with the small forests of brown stems each carrying its pointed cap or crestof infinitely varied mode as we shall see presently and which is one of their most blessed functions carrying high the dew in the morning every spear balancing its own crystal globe  9 and now with my own broken memories of moss 17 and this unbroken though unfinished gift of the noble labour of other people the flora danica i can generalize the idea of the precious little plant for myself and for the reader  all mosses i believe with such exceptions and collateral groups as we may afterwards discover but they are not many that is to say some thousands of species are in their strength of existence composed of fibres surrounded by clusters of dry spinous leaves set close to the fibre they grow on out of this leafy stern descends a fibrous root and ascends in its season a capped seed  we must get this very clearly into our heads fig 2 a is a little tuft of a common wood moss of norway10 in its fruit season of its real size but at present i want to look at the central fibre and its leaves accurately and understand that first  10 pulling it to pieces we find it composed of seven little companykeeping fibres each of which by itself appears as in fig 2 b but as in this its real size it 18 is too small not indeed for our respect but for our comprehension we magnify it fig 2 c and thereupon perceive it to be indeed composed of a the small fibrous root which sustains the plant b the leafsurrounded stem which is the actual being and main creature moss and c the aspirant pillar and cap of its fructification  11 but there is one minor division yet you see i have drawn the central part of the moss plant b fig 2 half in outline and half in black and that similarly in the upper group which is too small to show the real roots the base of the cluster is black and you remember i doubt not how often in gathering what most invited gathering of deep green starry perfectly soft and living woodmoss you found it fall asunder in your hand into multitudes of separate threads each with its bright green crest and long root of blackness  that blackness at the rootthough only so notable in this woodmoss and collateral species is indeed a general character of the mosses with rare exceptions it is their funeral blacknessthat i perceive is the way the moss leaves die they do not fallthey do not visibly decay but they decay invisibly in continual secession beneath the ascending crest they rise to form that crest all green and bright and take the light and air from those out of which they grewand those their ancestors darken and die slowly and at last become a mass of mouldering ground in fact as i perceive farther their final duty is so to die the main work of other leaves is 19 in their lifebut these have to form the earth out of which all other leaves are to grow not to cover the rocks with golden velvet only but to fill their crannies with the dark earth through which nobler creatures shall one day seek their being  12 grant but as many sorts of mind as moss pope could not have known the hundredth part of the number of sorts of moss there are and i suppose he only chose the word because it was a monosyllable beginning with m and the best english general expression for despised and minute structures of plants but a fate rules the words of wise men which makes their words truer and worth more than the men themselves know no other plants have so endless variety on so similar a structure as the mosses and none teach so well the humility of death as for the death of our bodies we have learned wisely or unwisely to look the fact of that in the face but none of us i think yet care to look the fact of the death of our minds in the face i do not mean death of our souls but of our mental work so far as it is good art indeed and done in realistic form it may perhaps not die but so far as it was only good thoughtgood for its time and apparently a great achievement thereinthat good useful thought may yet in the future become a foolish thought and then die quite awayit and the memory of itwhen better thought and knowledge come but the better thought could not have come if the weaker thought had not come first and died in sustaining the 20 better if we think honestly our thoughts will not only live usefully but even perish usefullylike the mossand become dark not without due service but if we think dishonestly or malignantly our thoughts will die like evil fungidripping corrupt dew  13 but farther if you have walked moorlands enough to know the look of them you know well those flat spaces or causeways of bright green or golden ground between the heathy rock masses which signify winding pools and inlets of stagnant water caught among the rockspools which the deep moss that covers themblanched not black at the rootis slowly filling and making firm whence generally the unsafe ground in the moorland gets known by being mossy instead of heathy and is at last called by its riders briefly the moss and as it is mainly at these same mossy places that the riding is difficult and brings out the gifts of horse and rider and discomfits all followers not similarly gifted the skilled crosser of them got his name naturally of mossrider or mosstrooper in which manner the moss of norway and scotland has been a taskmaster and maker of soldiers as yet the strongest known among natural powers the lightning may kill a man or cast down a tower but these little tender leaves of mossthey and their progenitorshave trained the northern armies  14 so much for the human meaning of that decay of the leaves now to go back to the little creatures themselves it seems that the upper part of the moss fibre is 21 especially undecaying among leaves and the lower part especially decaying that in fact a plant of mossfibre is a kind of persistent state of what is in other plants annual watch the years growth of any luxuriant flower first it comes out of the ground all fresh and bright then as the higher leaves and branches shoot up those first leaves near the ground get brown sickly earthyremain for ever degraded in the dust and under the dashed slime in rain staining and grieving and loading them with obloquy of envious earth halfkilling themonly life enough left in them to hold on the stem and to be guardians of the rest of the plant from all they sufferwhile above them the happier leaves for whom they are thus oppressed bend freely to the sunshine and drink the rain pure  the moss strengthens on a diminished scale intensifies and makes perpetual these two statesbright leaves above that never wither leaves beneath that exist only to wither  15 i have hitherto spoken only of the fading moss as it is needed for change into earth but i am not sure whether a yet more important office in its days of age be not its use as a colour  we are all thankful enoughas far as we ever are sofor green moss and yellow moss but we are never enough grateful for black moss the golden would be nothing without it nor even the grey  it is true that there are black lichens enough and 22 brown ones nevertheless the chief use of lichens is for silver and gold colour on rocks and it is the dead moss which gives the leopardlike touches of black and yet here againas to a thing i have been looking at and painting all my lifei am brought to pause the moment i think of it carefully the black moss which gives the precious velasquez touches lies much of it flat on the rocks radiating from its centrespowdering in the fingers if one breaks it off like dry tea is it a black speciesor a blackparched state of other species perishing for the sake of velasquez effects instead of accumulation of earth and if so does it die of drought accidentally or in a sere old age naturally and how is it related to the rich green bosses that grow in deep velvet and there again is another matter not clear to me one calls them velvet because they are all brought to an even surface at the top our own velvet is reduced to such trimness by cutting but how is the moss trimmed by what scissors carefullest elizabethan gardener never shaped his yew hedge more daintily than the moss fairies smooth these soft rounded surfaces of green and gold and just fancy the difference if they were ragged if the fibres had every one of them leave to grow at their own sweet will and to be long or short as they liked or worse still urged by fairy prizes into laboriously and agonizingly trying which could grow longest fancy the surface of a spot of competitive moss  16 but how is it that they are subdued into that 23 spherical obedience like a crystal of wavellite11 strangethat the vegetable creatures growing so fondly on rocks should form themselves in that minerallike manner it is true that the tops of all wellgrown trees are rounded on a large scale as equally but that is because they grow from a central stem while these mossy mounds are made out of independent filaments each growing to exactly his proper height in the sphereshort ones outside long in the middle stop though is that so i am not even sure of that perhaps they are built over a little dome of decayed moss below12 i must find out how every 24 filament grows separatelyfrom root to cap through the spirally set leaves and meanwhile i dont know very clearly so much as what a root isor what a leaf is before puzzling myself any farther in examination either of moss or any other grander vegetable i had better define these primal forms of all vegetation as well as i canor rather begin the definition of them for future completion and correction for as my reader must already sufficiently perceive this book is literally to be one of studiesnot of statements some one said of me once very shrewdly when he wants to work out a subject he writes a book on it that is a very true saying in the maini work down or up to my mark and let the reader see process and progress not caring to conceal them but this book will be nothing but process i dont mean to assert anything positively in it from the first page to the last whatever i say is to be understood only as a conditional statementliable to and inviting correction and this the more because as on the whole i am at war with the botanists i cant ask them to help me and then 25 call them names afterwards i hope only for a contemptuous heaping of coals on my head by correction of my errors from themin some cases my scientific friends will i know give me forgiving aidbut for many reasons i am forced first to print the imperfect statement as i can independently shape it for if once i asked for or received help every thought would be frostbitten into timid expression and every sentence broken by apology i should have to write a dozen of letters before i could print a line and the line at last would be only like a bit of any other botanical booktrustworthy it might be perhaps but certainly unreadable whereas now it will rather put things more forcibly in the readers mind to have them retouched and corrected as we go on and our natural and honest mistakes will often be suggestive of things we could not have discovered but by wandering  on these guarded conditions then i proceed to study with my reader the first general laws of vegetable form                                       26  chapter ii  the root  1 plants in their perfect form consist of four principal partsthe root stem leaf and flower it is true that the stem and flower are parts or remnants or altered states of the leaves and that speaking with close accuracy we might say a perfect plant consists of leaf and root but the division into these four parts is best for practical purposes and it will be desirable to note a few general facts about each before endeavouring to describe any one kind of plant only because the character of the stem depends on the nature of the leaf and flower we must put it last in order of examination and trace the development of the plant first in root and leaf then in the flower and its fruit and lastly in the stem  2 first then the root  every plant is divided as i just said in the main into two parts and these have opposite natures one part seeks the light the other hates it one part feeds on the air the other on the dust  the part that loves the light is called the leaf it is an old saxon word i cannot get at its origin the part that hates the light is called the root 27  in greek greek rhiza rhiza13  in latin radix the growing thing which shortens in french into race and then they put on the diminutive ine and get their two words race and racine of which we keep race for animals and use for vegetables a word of our own saxon and dutch dialectroot connected with roodan image of wood whence at last the holy rood or tree  3 the root has three great functions    1st to hold the plant in its place   2nd to nourish it with earth   3rd to receive vital power for it from the earth  with this last office is in some degreeand especially in certain plantsconnected that of reproduction  but in all plants the root has these three essential functions  first i said to hold the plant in its place the root is its fetter  you think it perhaps a matter of course that a plant is not to be a crawling thing it is not a matter of course at all a vegetable might be just what it is now as compared with an animalmight live on earth and water instead of on meatmight be as senseless in life as calm in death and in all its parts and apparent structure 28 unchanged and yet be a crawling thing it is quite as easy to conceive plants moving about like lizards putting forward first one root and then another as it is to think of them fastened to their place it might have been well for them one would have thought to have the power of going down to the streams to drink in time of droughtof migrating in winter with grim march from north to south of dunsinane hill side but that is not their appointed fate they areat least all the noblest of them rooted to their spot their honour and use is in giving immoveable shelterin remaining landmarks or lovemarks when all else is changed   the cedars wave on lebanon   but judahs statelier maids are gone  4 its root is thus a form of fate to the tree it condemns or indulges it in its place these semiliving creatures come what may shall abide happy or tormented no doubt concerning the position in which providence has placed them is to trouble their minds except so far as they can mend it by seeking light or shrinking from wind or grasping at support within certain limits in the thoughts of men they have thus become twofold imageson the one side of spirits restrained and half destroyed whence the fables of transformation into trees on the other of spirits patient and continuing having root in themselves and in good ground capable of all persistent 29 effort and vital stability both in themselves and for the human states they form  5 in this function of holding fast roots have a power of grasp quite different from that of branches it is not a grasp or clutch by contraction as that of a birds claw or of the small branches we call tendrils in climbing plants it is a dead clumsy but inevitable grasp by swelling after contortion for there is this main difference between a branch and root that a branch cannot grow vividly but in certain directions and relations to its neighbour branches but a root can grow wherever there is earth and can turn in any direction to avoid an obstacle14  6 in thus contriving access for itself where it chooses a root contorts itself into more serpentlike writhing than branches can and when it has once coiled partly round a rock or stone it grasps it tight necessarily merely by swelling now a root has force enough sometimes to split rocks but not to crush them so it is compelled to grasp by flattening as it thickens and as it must have room somewhere it alters its own shape as if it were made of 30 dough and holds the rock not in a claw but in a wooden cast or mould adhering to its surface and thus it not only finds its anchorage in the rock but binds the rocks of its anchorage with a constrictor cable  7 henceand this is a most important secondary functionroots bind together the ragged edges of rocks as a hem does the torn edge of a dress they literally stitch the stones together so that while it is always dangerous to pass under a treeless edge of overhanging crag as soon as it has become beautiful with trees it is safe also the rending power of roots on rocks has been greatly overrated capillary attraction in a willow wand will indeed split granite and swelling roots sometimes heave considerable masses aside but on the whole roots small and great bind and do not rend15 the surfaces of mountains are dissolved and disordered by rain and frost and chemical decomposition into mere heaps of loose stones on their desolate summits but where the forests grow soil accumulates and disintegration ceases and by cutting down forests on great mountain slopes not only is the climate destroyed but the danger of superficial landslip fearfully increased  8 the second function of roots is to gather for the plant the nourishment it needs from the ground this is 31 partly water mixed with some kinds of air ammonia etc but the plant can get both water and ammonia from the atmosphere and i believe for the most part does so though when it cannot get water from the air it will gladly drink by its roots but the things it cannot receive from the air at all are certain earthy salts essential to it as iron is essential in our own blood and of which when it has quite exhausted the earth no more such plants can grow in that ground on this subject you will find enough in any modern treatise on agriculture all that i want you to note here is that this feeding function of the root is of a very delicate and discriminating kind needing much searching and mining among the dust to find what it wants if it only wanted water it could get most of that by spreading in mere soft senseless limbs like sponge as far and as far down as it couldbut to get the salt out of the earth it has to sift all the earth and taste and touch every grain of it that it can with fine fibres and therefore a root is not at all a merely passive sponge or absorbing thing but an infinitely subtle tongue or tasting and eating thing that is why it is always so fibrous and divided and entangled in the clinging earth  9 always fibrous and divided but many roots are quite hard and solid  no the active part of the root is always i believe a fibre but there is often a provident and passive parta savings bank of rootin which nourishment is laid up for the plant and which though it may be underground is no 32 more to be considered its real root than the kernel of a seed is when you sow a pea if you take it up in a day or two you will find the fibre below which is root the shoot above which is plant and the pea as a now partly exhausted storehouse looking very woful and like the granaries of paris after the fire so the round solid root of a cyclamen or the conical one which you know so well as a carrot are not properly roots but permanent storehousesonly the fibres that grow from them are roots then there are other apparent roots which are not even storehouses but refuges houses where the little plant lives in its infancy through winter and rough weather so that it will be best for you at once to limit your idea of a root to thisthat it is a group of growing fibres which taste and suck what is good for the plant out of the ground and by their united strength hold it in its place only remember the thick limbs of roots do not feed but only the fine fibres at the ends of them which are something between tongues and sponges and while they absorb moisture readily are yet as particular about getting what they think nice to eat as any dainty little boy or girl looking for it everywhere and turning angry and sulky if they dont get it  10 but the root has it seems to me one more function the most important of all i say it seems to me for observe what i have hitherto told you is all i believe ascertained and admitted this that i am going to tell you has not yet as far as i know been asserted by men of 33 science though i believe it to be demonstrable but you are to examine into it and think of it for yourself  there are some plants which appear to derive all their food from the airwhich need nothing but a slight grasp of the ground to fix them in their place yet if we were to tie them into that place in a framework and cut them from their roots they would die not only in these but in all other plants the vital power by which they shape and feed themselves whatever that power may be depends i think on that slight touch of the earth and strange inheritance of its power it is as essential to the plants life as the connection of the head of an animal with its body by the spine is to the animal divide the feeble nervous thread and all life ceases nay in the tree the root is even of greater importance you will not kill the tree as you would an animal by dividing its body or trunk the part not severed from the root will shoot again but in the root and its touch of the ground is the life of it my own definition of a plant would be a living creature whose source of vital energy is in the earth or in the water as a form of the earth that is in inorganic substance there is however one tribe of plants which seems nearly excepted from this law it is a very strange one having long been noted for the resemblance of its flowers to different insects and it has recently been proved by mr darwin to be dependent on insects for its existence doubly strange therefore it seems that in some cases this race of plants all but reaches the independent life of 34 insects it rather settles upon boughs than roots itself in them half of its roots may wave in the air  11 what vital power is men of science are not a step nearer knowing than they were four thousand years ago they are if anything farther from knowing now than then in that they imagine themselves nearer but they know more about its limitations and manifestations than they did they have even arrived at something like a proof that there is a fixed quantity of it flowing out of things and into them but for the present rest content with the general and sure knowledge that fixed or flowing measurable or immeasurableone with electricity or heat or light or quite distinct from any of themlife is a delightful and its negative death a dreadful thing to human creatures and that you can give or gather a certain quantity of life into plants animals and yourself by wisdom and courage and by their reverses can bring upon them any quantity of death you please which is a much more serious point for you to consider than what life and death are  12 now having got a quite clear idea of a root properly so called we may observe what those storehouses refuges and ruins are which we find connected with roots the greater number of plants feed and grow at the same time but there are some of them which like to feed first and grow afterwards for the first year or at all events the first period of their life they gather material for their future life out of the ground and out 35 of the air and lay it up in a storehouse as bees make combs of these storesfor the most part rounded masses tapering downwards into the groundsome are as good for human beings as honeycombs are only not so sweet we steal them from the plants as we do from the bees and these conical upsidedown hives or treasuries of atreus under the names of carrots turnips and radishes have had important influence on human fortunes if we do not steal the store next year the plant lives upon it raises its stem flowers and seeds out of that abundance and having fulfilled its destiny and provided for its successor passes away root and branch together  13 there is a pretty example of patience for us in this and it would be well for young people generally to set themselves to grow in a carrotty or turnippy manner and lay up secret store not caring to exhibit it until the time comes for fruitful display but they must not in afterlife imitate the spendthrift vegetable and blossom only in the strength of what they learned long ago else they soon come to contemptible end wise people live like laurels and cedars and go on mining in the earth while they adorn and embalm the air  14 secondly refuges as flowers growing on trees have to live for some time when they are young in their buds so some flowers growing on the ground have to live for a while when they are young in what we call their 36 roots these are mostly among the drosidæ16 and other humble tribes loving the ground and in their babyhood liking to live quite down in it a baby crocus has literally its own little domedomus or duomowithin which in early spring it lives a delicate convent life of its own quite free from all worldly care and dangers exceedingly ignorant of things in general but itself brightly golden and perfectly formed before it is brought out these subterranean palaces and vaulted cloisters which we call bulbs are no more roots than the blade of grass is a root in which the ear of corn forms before it shoots up  15 thirdly ruins the flowers which have these subterranean homes form one of many families whose roots as well as seeds have the power of reproduction the succession of some plants is trusted much to their seeds a thistle sows itself by its down an oak by its acorns the companies of flying emigrants settle where they may and the shadowy tree is content to cast down its showers of nuts for swines food with the chance that here and there one may become a ships bulwark but others among plants are less careless or less proud many are anxious for their children to grow in the place where they grew themselves and secure this not merely by letting their fruit fall at their feet on the chance of its growing up 37 beside them but by closer bond bud springing forth from root and the young plant being animated by the gradually surrendered life of its parent sometimes the young root is formed above the old one as in the crocus or beside it as in the amaryllis or beside it in a spiral succession as in the orchis in these cases the old root always perishes wholly when the young one is formed but in a far greater number of tribes one root connects itself with another by a short piece of intermediate stem and this stem does not at once perish when the new root is formed but grows on at one end indefinitely perishing slowly at the other the scars or ruins of the past plants being long traceable on its sides when it grows entirely underground it is called a rootstock but there is no essential distinction between a rootstock and a creeping stem only the rootstock may be thought of as a stem which shares the melancholy humour of a root in loving darkness while yet it has enough consciousness of better things to grow towards or near the light in one family it is even fragrant where the flower is not and a simple houseleek is called rhodiola rosea because its rootstock has the scent of a rose  16 there is one very unusual condition of the rootstock which has become of much importance in economy though it is of little in botany the forming namely of knots at the ends of the branches of the underground stem where the new roots are to be thrown out of these knots or tubers swollen things one kind belonging to 38 the tobacco tribe has been singularly harmful together with its pungent relative to a neighbouring country of ours which perhaps may reach a higher destiny than any of its friends can conceive for it if it can ever succeed in living without either the potato or the pipe  17 being prepared now to find among plants many things which are like roots yet are not you may simplify and make fast your true idea of a root as a fibre or group of fibres which fixes animates and partly feeds the leaf then practically as you examine plants in detail ask first respecting them what kind of root have they is it large or small in proportion to their bulk and why is it so what soil does it like and what properties does it acquire from it the endeavour to answer these questions will soon lead you to a rational inquiry into the plants history you will first ascertain what rock or earth it delights in and what climate and circumstances then you will see how its root is fitted to sustain it mechanically under given pressures and violences and to find for it the necessary sustenance under given difficulties of famine or drought lastly you will consider what chemical actions appear to be going on in the root or its store what processes there are and elements which give pungency to the radish flavour to the onion or sweetness to the liquorice and of what service each root may be made capable under cultivation and by proper subsequent treatment either to animals or men  18 i shall not attempt to do any of this for you i 39 assume in giving this advice that you wish to pursue the science of botany as your chief study i have only broken moments for it snatched from my chief occupations and i have done nothing myself of all this i tell you to do but so far as you can work in this manner even if you only ascertain the history of one plant so that you know that accurately you will have helped to lay the foundation of a true science of botany from which the mass of useless nomenclature17 now mistaken for science will fall away as the husk of a poppy falls from the bursting flower                                       40  chapter iii  the leaf  1 in the first of the poems of which the english government has appointed a portion to be sung every day for the instruction and pleasure of the people there occurs this curious statement respecting any person who will behave himself rightly he shall be like a tree planted by the river side that bears its fruit in its season his leaf also shall not wither and you will see that whatever he does will prosper  i call it a curious statement because the conduct to which this prosperity is promised is not that which the english as a nation at present think conducive to prosperity but whether the statement be true or not it will be easy for you to recollect the two eastern figures under which the happiness of the man is representedthat he is like a tree bearing fruit in its season not so hastily as that the frost pinch it nor so late that no sun ripens it and that his leaf shall not fade i should like you to recollect this phrase in the vulgatefolium ejus non defluetshall not fall awaythat is to say shall not fall so as to leave any visible bareness in winter time but 41 only that others may come up in its place and the tree be always green  2 now you know the fruit of the tree is either for the continuance of its race or for the good or harm of other creatures in no case is it a good to the tree itself it is not indeed properly a part of the tree at all any more than the egg is part of the bird or the young of any creature part of the creature itself but in the leaf is the strength of the tree itself nay rightly speaking the leaves are the tree itself its trunk sustains its fruit burdens and exhausts but in the leaf it breathes and lives and thus also in the eastern symbolism the fruit is the labour of men for others but the leaf is their own life he shall bring forth fruit in his time and his own joy and strength shall be continual  3 notice next the word folium in greek greek phullon phyllon  the thing that is born or put forth when the branch is tender and putteth forth her leaves ye know that summer is nigh the botanists say the leaf is an expansion of the bark of the stem more accurately the bark is a contraction of the tissue of the leaf for every leaf is born out of the earth and breathes out of the air and there are many leaves that have no stems but only roots it is the springing thing this thin film of life rising with its edge out of the groundinfinitely feeble infinitely fair with folium in latin is rightly associated the word flos for the flower is only a group of 42 singularly happy leaves from these two roots come foglio feuille feuillage and fleurblume blossom and bloom our foliage and the borrowed foil and the connected technical groups of words in architecture and the sciences  4 this thin film i said that is the essential character of a leaf to be thinwidely spread out in proportion to its mass it is the opening of the substance of the earth to the air which is the giver of life the greeks called it therefore not only the born or blooming thing but the spread or expanded thinggreek petalon pindar calls the beginnings of quarrel petals of quarrel recollect therefore this form petalos and connect it with petasos the expanded cap of mercury for one great use of both is to give shade the root of all these words is said to be greek pet pet which may easily be remembered in greek as it sometimes occurs in no unpleasant sense in english  5 but the word petalos is connected in greek with another word meaning to flyso that you may think of a bird as spreading its petals to the wind and with another signifying fate in its pursuing flight the overtaking thing or overflying fate finally there is another greek word meaning wide greek platus platys whence at last our platea thing made broad or extendedbut especially made broad or flat out of the solid as in a lump of clay extended on the wheel or a lump of metal extended by the hammer so the first we call platter the second plate when of the precious metals then putting b for 43 p and d for t we get the blade of an oar and blade of grass  6 now gather a branch of laurel and look at it carefully you may read the history of the being of half the earth in one of those green oval leavesthe things that the sun and the rivers have made out of dry ground daphnedaughter of enipeus and beloved by the sunthat fable gives you at once the two great facts about vegetation where warmth is and moisturethere also the leaf where no warmththere is no leaf where there is no dewno leaf  7 look then to the branch you hold in your hand that you can so hold it or make a crown of it if you choose is the first thing i want you to note of itthe proportion of size namely between the leaf and you great part of your life and character as a human creature has depended on that suppose all leaves had been spacious like some palm leaves solid like cactus stem or that trees had grown as they might of course just as easily have grown like mushrooms all one great cluster of leaf round one stalk i do not say that they are divided into small leaves only for your delight or your service as if you were the monarch of everythingeven in this atom of a globe you are made of your proper size and the leaves of theirs for reasons and by laws of which neither the leaves nor you know anything only note the harmony between both and the joy we may have in this division and mystery of the frivolous and tremulous petals 44 which break the light and the breezecompared to what with the frivolous and tremulous mind which is in us we could have had out of domes or penthouses or walls of leaf  8 secondly think awhile of its dark clear green and the good of it to you scientifically you know green in leaves is owing to chlorophyll or in english to greenleaf it may be very fine to know that but my advice to you on the whole is to rest content with the general fact that leaves are green when they do not grow in or near smoky towns and not by any means to rest content with the fact that very soon there will not be a green leaf in england but only greenishblack ones and thereon resolve that you will yourself endeavour to promote the growing of the green wood rather than of the black  9 looking at the back of your laurelleaves you see how the central rib or spine of each and the lateral branchings strengthen and carry it i find much confused use in botanical works of the words vein and rib for indeed there are veins in the ribs of leaves as marrow in bones and the projecting bars often gradually depress themselves into a transparent net of rivers but the mechanical force of the framework in carrying the leaftissue is the point first to be noticed it is that which admits regulates or restrains the visible motions of the leaf while the system of circulation can only be studied through the microscope but the ribbed leaf bears itself to the wind as the webbed foot of a bird does to the 45 water and needs the same kind though not the same strength of support and its ribs always are partly therefore constituted of strong woody substance which is knit out of the tissue and you can extricate this skeleton framework and keep it after the leaftissue is dissolved so i shall henceforward speak simply of the leaf and its ribsonly specifying the additional veined structure on necessary occasions  10 i have just said that the ribsand might have said farther the stalk that sustains themare knit out of the tissue of the leaf but what is the leaf tissue itself knit out of one would think that was nearly the first thing to be discovered or at least to be thought of concerning plantsnamely how and of what they are made we say they grow but you know that they cant grow out of nothingthis solid wood and rich tracery must be made out of some previously existing substance what is the substanceand how is it woven into leavestwisted into wood  11 consider how fast this is done in spring you walk in february over a slippery field where through hoarfrost and mud you perhaps hardly see the small green blades of trampled turf in twelve weeks you wade through the same field up to your knees in fresh grass and in a week or two more you mow two or three solid haystacks off it in winter you walk by your currantbush or your vine they are shrivelled stickslike bits of black tea in the canister you pass again in may and 46 the currantbush looks like a young sycamore tree and the vine is a bower and meanwhile the forests all over this side of the round world have grown their foot or two in height with new leavesso much deeper so much denser than they were where has it all come from cut off the fresh shoots from a single branch of any tree in may weigh them and then consider that so much weight has been added to every such living branch everywhere this side the equator within the last two months what is all that made of  12 well this much the botanists really know and tell usit is made chiefly of the breath of animals that is to say of the substance which during the past year animals have breathed into the air and which if they went on breathing and their breath were not made into trees would poison them or rather suffocate them as people are suffocated in uncleansed pits and dogs in the grotta del cane so that you may look upon the grass and forests of the earth as a kind of green hoarfrost frozen upon it from our breath as on the windowpanes the white arborescence of ice  13 but how is it made into wood  the substances that have been breathed into the air are charcoal with oxygen and hydrogenor more plainly charcoal and water some necessary earthsin smaller quantity but absolutely essentialthe trees get from the ground but i believe all the charcoal they want and most of the water from the air now the question is where and how do they take it in and digest it into wood 47  14 you know in spring and partly through all the year except in frost a liquid called sap circulates in trees of which the nature one should have thought might have been ascertained by mankind in the six thousand years they have been cutting wood under the impression always that it had been ascertained and that i could at any time know all about it i have put off till today 19th october 1869 when i am past fifty the knowing anything about it at all but i will really endeavour now to ascertain something and take to my botanical books accordingly in due order  1 dressers rudiments of botany sap not in the index only samara and sarcocarpabout neither of which i feel the smallest curiosity 2 figuiers histoire des plantes18 sêve not in index only serpolet and sherardia arvensis which also have no help in them for me 3 balfours manual of botany sapyes at last article 257 course of fluids in exogenous stems i dont care about the course just now i want to know where the fluids come from if a plant be plunged into a weak solution of acetate of leadi dont in the least want to know what happens from the minuteness of the tissue it is not easy to determine the vessels through which the sap moves who said it was if it had been easy i should have done it myself changes take place in the composition of the 48 sap in its upward course i dare say but i dont know yet what its composition is before it begins going up the elaborated sap by mr schultz has been called latex i wish mr schultz were in a hogshead of it with the top on on account of these movements in the latex the laticiferous vessels have been denominated cinenchymatous i do not venture to print the expressions which i here mentally make use of  15 stayhere at last in article 264 is something to the purpose it appears then that in the case of exogenous plants the fluid matter in the soil containing different substances in solution is sucked up by the extremities of the roots yes but how of the pine trees on yonder rockis there any sap in the rock or water either the moisture must be seized during actual rain on the root or stored up from the snow stored up any way in a tranquil not actively sappy state till the time comes for its change of which there is no account here  16 i have only one chance left now lindleys introduction to botany sapyesgeneral motion of ii 325 the course which is taken by the sap after entering a plant is the first subject for consideration my dear doctor i have learned nearly whatever i know of plant structure from you and am grateful and that it is little is not your fault but mine but thislet me say it with all sincere respectis not what you should have told me here you know far better than i that sap never does enter a plant at all but only salt or earth and water 49 and that the roots alone could not make it and that therefore the course of it must be in great part the result or process of the actual making but i will read now patiently for i know you will tell me much that is worth hearing though not perhaps what i want  yes now that i have read lindleys statement carefully i find it is full of precious things and this is what with thinking over it i can gather for you  17 first towards the end of januaryas the light enlarges and the trees revive from their restthere is a general liquefaction of the blood of st januarius in their stems and i suppose there is really a great deal of moisture rapidly absorbed from the earth in most cases and that this absorption is a great help to the sun in drying the winters damp out of it for us then with that strange vital powerwhich scientific people are usually as afraid of naming as common people are afraid of naming deaththe tree gives the gathered earth and water a changed existence and to this newborn liquid an upward motion from the earth as our blood has from the heart for the life of the tree is out of the earth and this upward motion has a mechanical power in pushing on the growth forced onward by the current of sap the plumule ascends lindley p 132this blood of the tree having to supply exactly as our own blood has not only the forming powers of substance but a continual evaporation approximately seventeen times more than that of the human body while the force of motion in the sap is 50 sometimes five times greater than that which impels the blood in the crural artery of the horse  18 hence generally i think we may conclude thus muchthat at every pore of its surface under ground and above the plant in the spring absorbs moisture which instantly disperses itself through its whole system by means of some permeable quality of the membranes of the cellular tissue invisible to our eyes even by the most powerful glasses p 326 that in this way subjected to the vital power of the tree it becomes sap properly so called which passes downwards through this cellular tissue slowly and secretly and then upwards through the great vessels of the tree violently stretching out the supple twigs of it as yon see a flaccid waterpipe swell and move when the cock is turned to fill it and the tree becomes literally a fountain of which the springing streamlets are clothed with newwoven garments of green tissue and of which the silver spray stays in the skya spray now of leaves  19 that is the gist of the matter and a very wonderful gist it is to my mind the secret and subtle descentthe violent and exulting resilience of the trees bloodwhat guides itwhat compels the creature has no heart to beat like ours one cannot take refuge from the mystery in a muscular contraction fountain without supplyplaying by its own force for ever rising and falling all through the days of spring spending itself at last in gathered clouds of leaves and iris of blossom  very wonderful and it seems for the present that 51 we know nothing whatever about its causesnay the strangeness of the reversed arterial and vein motion without a heart does not seem to strike anybody perhaps however it may interest you as i observe it does the botanists to know that the cellular tissue through which the motion is effected is called parenchym and the woody tissue bothrenchym and that parenchym is divided by a system of nomenclature which has some advantages over that more commonly in use19 into merenchyma conenchyma ovenchyma atractenchyma cylindrenchyma colpenchyma cladenchyma and prismenchyma  20 take your laurel branch into your hand again there are as you must well know innumerable shapes and orders of leavesthere are some like claws some like fingers and some like feet there are endlessly cleft ones and endlessly clustered ones and inscrutable divisions within divisions of the fretted verdure and wrinkles and ripples and stitchings and hemmings and pinchings and gatherings and crumplings and clippings and what not but there is nothing so constantly noble as the pure leaf of the laurel bay orange and olive numerable sequent perfect in setting divinely simple and serene i shall call these noble leaves apolline leaves they characterize many orders of plants great and smallfrom the magnolia to the myrtle and exquisite myrtille 52 of the hills bilberry but wherever you find them strong lustrous dark green simply formed richly scented or storedyou have nearly always kindly and lovely vegetation in healthy ground and air  21 the gradual diminution in rank beneath the apolline leaf takes place in others by the loss of one or more of the qualities above named the apolline leaf i said is strong lustrous full in its green rich in substance simple in form the inferior leaves are those which have lost strength and become thin like paper which have lost lustre and become dead by roughness of surface like the nettlean apolline leaf may become dead by bloom like the olive yet not lose beauty which have lost colour and become feeble in green as in the poplar or crudely bright like rice which have lost substance and softness and have nothing to give in scent or nourishment or become flinty or spiny finally which have lost simplicity and become cloven or jagged many of these losses are partly atoned for by gain of some peculiar loveliness grass and moss and parsley and fern have each their own delightfulness yet they are all of inferior power and honour compared to the apolline leaves  illustration fig 3  22 you see however that though your laurel leaf has a central stem and traces of ribs branching from it in a vertebrated manner they are so faint that we cannot take it for a type of vertebrate structure but the two figures of elm and alisma leaf given in modern painters vol iii and now here repeated fig 3 will clearly enough 53 show the opposition between this vertebrate form branching again usually at the edges a and the softly opening lines diffused at the stem and gathered at the point of the leaf b which as you almost without doubt know already are characteristic of a vast group of plants including especially all the lilies grasses and palms which for the most part are the signs of local or temporary moisture in hot countrieslocal as of fountains and streams temporary as of rain or inundation  but temporary still more definitely in the day than in the year when you go out delighted into the dew of the morning have you ever considered why it is so rich upon the grasswhy it is not upon the trees it is partly on the trees but yet your memory of it will be always chiefly of its gleam upon the lawn on many 54 trees you will find there is none at all i cannot follow out here the many inquiries connected with this subject but broadly remember the branched trees are fed chiefly by rainthe unbranched ones by dew visible or invisible that is to say at all events by moisture which they can gather for themselves out of the air or else by streams and springs hence the division of the verse of the song of moses my doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distil as the dew as the small rain upon the tender herb and as the showers upon the grass  23 next examining the direction of the veins in the leaf of the alisma b fig 3 you see they all open widely as soon as they can towards the thick part of the leaf and then taper apparently with reluctance pushing each other outwards to the point if the leaf were a lake of the same shape and its stem the entering river the lines of the currents passing through it would i believe be nearly the same as that of the veins in the aquatic leaf i have not examined the fluid law accurately and i do not suppose there is more real correspondence than may be caused by the leafs expanding in every permitted direction as the water would with all the speed it can but the resemblance is so close as to enable you to fasten the relation of the unbranched leaves to streams more distinctly in your mindjust as the toss of the palm leaves from their stem may i think in their likeness to the springing of a fountain remind you of their relation to the desert and their necessity therein to life of man and beast 55  24 and thus associating these grass and lily leaves always with fountains or with dew i think we may get a pretty general name for them also you know that cora our madonna of the flowers was lost in sicilian fields you know also that the fairest of greek fountains lost in greece was thought to rise in a sicilian islet and that the real springing of the noble fountain in that rock was one of the causes which determined the position of the greatest greek city of sicily so i think as we call the fairest branched leaves apolline we will call the fairest flowing ones arethusan but remember that the apolline leaf represents only the central type of land leaves and is within certain limits of a fixed form while the beautiful arethusan leaves alike in flowing of their lines change their forms indefinitelysome shaped like round pools and some like winding currents and many like arrows and many like hearts and otherwise varied and variable as leaves ought to bethat rise out of the waters and float amidst the pausing of their foam  25 brantwood easter day 1875i dont like to spoil my pretty sentence above but on reading it over i suspect i wrote it confusing the waterlily leaf and other floating ones of the same kind with the arethusan forms but the waterlily and waterranunculus leaves and such others are to the orders of earthloving leaves what ducks and swans are to birds the swan is the waterlily of birds they are swimming leaves not properly watery creatures or able to live under water like fish unless 56 when dormant but just like birds that pass their lives on the surface of the wavesthough they must breathe in the air  and these natant leaves as they lie on the water surface do not want strong ribs to carry them20 but have very delicate ones beautifully branching into the orbed space to keep the tissue nice and flat while on the other hand leaves that really have to grow under water sacrifice their tissue and keep only their ribs like coral animals ranunculus heterophyllus otherleaved frogflower and its like just as if you keep your own hands too long in water they shrivel at the fingerends  26 so that you must not attach any great botanical importance to the characters of contrasted aspects in leaves which i wish you to express by the words apolline and arethusan but their mythic importance is very great and your careful observance of it will help you completely to understand the beautiful greek fable of apollo and daphne there are indeed several daphnes and the first root of the name is far away in another field of thought altogether connected with the gods of light but etymology the best of servants is an unreasonable master and professor max müller trusts his deepreaching knowledge of the first ideas connected with the names of athena 57 and daphne too implicitly when he supposes this idea to be retained in central greek theology athena originally meant only the dawn among nations who knew nothing of a sacred spirit but the athena who catches achilles by the hair and urges the spear of diomed has not in the mind of homer the slightest remaining connection with the mere beauty of daybreak daphne chased by apollo may perhapsthough i doubt even this much of consistence in the earlier mythhave meant the dawn pursued by the sun but there is no trace whatever of this first idea left in the fable of arcadia and thessaly  27 the central greek daphne is the daughter of one of the great river gods of arcadia her mother is the earth now arcadia is the oberland of greece and the crests of cyllene erymanthus and mænalus21 surround it like the swiss forest cantons with walls of rock and shadows of pine and it divides itself like the oberland into three regions first the region of rock and snow sacred to mercury and apollo in which mercurys birth on cyllene his construction of the lyre and his stealing the oxen of apollo are all expressions of the enchantments of cloud and sound mingling with the sunshine on the cliffs of cyllene                   while the mists   flying and rainy vapours call out shapes   58   and phantoms from the crags and solid earth   as fast as a musician scatters sounds   out of his instrument  then came the pine region sacred especially to pan and mænalus the son of lycaon and brother of callisto and you had better remember this relationship carefully for the sake of the meaning of the constellations of ursa major and the mons mænalius and of their wolf and bear traditions compare also the strong impression on the greek mind of the wild leafiness nourished by snow of the boeotian cithæronoh thou lakehollow full of divine leaves and of wild creatures nurse of the snow darling of diana phoenissæ 801 how wild the climate of this pine region is you may judge from the pieces in the note below22 out of colonel leakes diary in 59 crossing the mænalian range in spring and then lastly you have the laurel and vine region full of sweetness and elysian beauty  28 now as mercury is the ruling power of the hill enchantment so daphne of the leafy peace she is in her first life the daughter of the mountain river the mist of it filling the valley the sun pursuing and effacing it from dell to dell is literally apollo pursuing daphne and adverse to her not as in the earlier tradition the sun pursuing only his own light daphne thus hunted cries to her mother the earth which opens and receives her causing the laurel to spring up in her stead that is to say wherever the rocks protect the mist from the sunbeam and suffer it to water the earth there the laurel and other richest vegetation fill the hollows giving a better glory to the sun itself for sunshine on the torrent spray 60 on the grass of its valley and entangled among the laurel stems or glancing from their leaves became a thousandfold lovelier and more sacred than the same sunbeams burning on the leafless mountainside  and farther the leaf in its connection with the river is typically expressive not as the flower was of human fading and passing away but of the perpetual flow and renewal of human mind and thought rising like the rivers that run among the hills therefore it was that the youth of greece sacrificed their hairthe sign of their continually renewed strengthto the rivers and to apollo therefore to commemorate apollos own chief victory over deathover python the corruptera laurel branch was gathered every ninth year in the vale of tempe and the laurel leaf became the reward or crown of all beneficent and enduring work of manwork of inspiration born of the strength of the earth and of the dew of heaven and which can never pass away  29 you may doubt at first even because of its grace this meaning in the fable of apollo and daphne you will not doubt it however when you trace it back to its first eastern origin when we speak carelessly of the traditions respecting the garden of eden or in hebrew remember garden of delight we are apt to confuse miltons descriptions with those in the book of genesis milton fills his paradise with flowers but no flowers are spoken of in genesis we may indeed conclude that in speaking of every herb of the field flowers are included but they 61 are not named the things that are named in the garden of delight are trees only  the words are every tree that was pleasant to the sight and good for food and as if to mark the idea more strongly for us in the septuagint even the ordinary greek word for tree is not used but the word greek xulonliterally every wood every piece of timber that was pleasant or good they are indeed the vivi traviliving rafters of dantes apennine  do you remember how those trees were said to be watered not by the four rivers only the rivers could not supply the place of rain no rivers do for in truth they are the refuse of rain no stormclouds were there nor hidings of the blue by darkening veil but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the face of the groundor as in septuagint and vulgate there went forth a fountain from the earth and gave the earth to drink  30 and now lastly we continually think of that garden of delight as if it existed or could exist no longer wholly forgetting that it is spoken of in scripture as perpetually existent and some of its fairest trees as existent also or only recently destroyed when ezekiel is describing to pharaoh the greatness of the assyrians do you remember what image he gives of them behold the assyrian was a cedar in lebanon with fair branches and his top was among the thick boughs the waters nourished him and the deep brought him up with her rivers 62 running round about his plants under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young and under his shadow dwelt all great nations  31 now hear what follows the cedars in the garden of god could not hide him the fir trees were not like his boughs and the chestnut trees were not like his branches nor any tree in the garden of god was like unto him in beauty  so that you see whenever a nation rises into consistent vital and through many generations enduring power there is still the garden of god still it is the water of life which feeds the roots of it and still the succession of its people is imaged by the perennial leafage of trees of paradise could this be said of assyria and shall it not be said of england how much more of lives such as ours should bejust laborious united in aim beneficent in fulfilment may the image be used of the leaves of the trees of eden other symbols have been given often to show the evanescence and slightness of our livesthe foam upon the water the grass on the housetop the vapour that vanishes away yet none of these are images of true human life that life when it is real is not evanescent is not slight does not vanish away every noble life leaves the fibre of it interwoven for ever in the work of the world by so much evermore the strength of the human race has gained more stubborn in the root higher towards heaven in the branch and as a teil tree and as an oakwhose substance is in them 63 when they cast their leavesso the holy seed is in the midst thereof  32 only remember on what conditions in the great psalm of life we are told that everything that a man doeth shall prosper so only that he delight in the law of his god that he hath not walked in the counsel of the wicked nor sat in the seat of the scornful is it among these leaves of the perpetual springhelpful leaves for the healing of the nationsthat we mean to have our part and place or rather among the brown skeletons of leaves that lag the forest brook along for other leaves there are and other streams that water themnot water of life but water of acheron autumnal leaves there are that strew the brooks in vallombrosa remember you how the name of the place was changed once called sweet water aqua bella now the shadowy vale portion in one or other name we must choose all of uswith the living olive by the living fountains of waters or with the wild fig trees whose leafage of human soul is strewed along the brooks of death in the eternal vallombrosa                                       64  chapter iv  the flower  rome whit monday 1874  1 on the quiet road leading from under the palatine to the little church of st nereo and achilleo i met yesterday morning group after group of happy peasants heaped in pyramids on their triumphal carts in whitsunday dress stout and clean and gay in colour and the women all with bright artificial roses in their hair set with true natural taste and well becoming them this power of arranging wreath or crown of flowers for the head remains to the people from classic times and the thing that struck me most in the look of it was not so much the cheerfulness as the dignityin a true sense the becomingness and decorousness of the ornament among the ruins of the dead city and the worse desolation of the work of its modern rebuilders here was one element at least of honour and orderand in these of delight  and these are the real significances of the flower itself it is the utmost purification of the plant and the utmost discipline where its tissue is blanched fairest dyed purest set in strictest rank appointed to most chosen office 65 thereand created by the fact of this purity and functionis the flower  2 but created observe by the purity and order more than by the function the flower exists for its own sakenot for the fruits sake the production of the fruit is an added honour to itis a granted consolation to us for its death but the flower is the end of the seednot the seed of the flower you are fond of cherries perhaps and think that the use of cherry blossom is to produce cherries not at all the use of cherries is to produce cherry blossoms just as the use of bulbs is to produce hyacinthsnot of hyacinths to produce bulbs nay that the flower can multiply by bulb or root or slip as well as by seed may show you at once how immaterial the seedforming function is to the flowers existence a flower is to the vegetable substance what a crystal is to the mineral dust of sapphire writes my friend dr john brown to me of the wood hyacinths of scotland in the spring yes that is soeach bud more beautiful itself than perfectest jewelthis indeed jewel of purest ray serene but observe you the glory is in the purity the serenity the radiancenot in the mere continuance of the creature  3 it is because of its beauty that its continuance is worth heavens while the glory of it is in beingnot in begetting and in the spirit and substancenot the change for the earth also has its flesh and spirit every day of spring is the earths whit sundayfire 66 sunday the falling fire of the rainbow with the order of its zones and the gladness of its covenantyou may eat of it like esdras but you feed upon it only that you may see it do you think that flowers were born to nourish the blind  fasten well in your mind then the conception of order and purity as the essence of the flowers being no less than of the crystals a ruby is not made bright to scatter round it childrubies nor a flower but in collateral and added honour to give birth to other flowers  two main facts then you have to study in every flower the symmetry or order of it and the perfection of its substance first the manner in which the leaves are placed for beauty of form then the spinning and weaving and blanching of their tissue for the reception of purest colour or refining to richest surface  4 first the order the proportion and answering to each other of the parts for the study of which it becomes necessary to know what its parts are and that a flower consists essentially ofwell i really dont know what it consists essentially of for some flowers have bracts and stalks and toruses and calices and corollas and discs and stamens and pistils and ever so many odds and ends of things besides of no use at all seemingly and others have no bracts and no stalks and no toruses and no calices and no corollas and nothing recognizable for stamens or pistilsonly when they come to be reduced to this kind of poverty one doesnt call 67 them flowers they get together in knots and one calls them catkins or the like or forgets their existence altogetheri havent the least idea for instance myself what an oak blossom is like only i know its bracts get together and make a cup of themselves afterwards which the italians call as they do the dome of st peters cupola and that it is a great pity for their own sake as well as the worlds that they were not content with their ilex cupolas which were made to hold something but took to building these big ones upsidedown which hold nothingless than nothinglarge extinguishers of the flame of catholic religion and for farther embarrassment a flower not only is without essential consistence of a given number of parts but it rarely consists alone of itself one talks of a hyacinth as of a flower but a hyacinth is any number of flowers one does not talk of a heather when one says heath one means the whole plant not the blossombecause heathbells though they grow together for companys sake do so in a voluntary sort of way and are not fixed in their places and yet they depend on each other for effect as much as a bunch of grapes  5 and this grouping of flowers more or less waywardly is the most subtle part of their order and the most difficult to represent take that cluster of bogheather bells for instance linestudy 1 you might think at first there were no lines in it worth study but look at it more carefully there are twelve bells in the 68 cluster there may be fewer or more but the bogheath is apt to run into something near that number they all grow together as close as they can and on one side of the supporting branch only the natural effect would be to bend the branch down but the branch wont have that and so leans back to carry them now you see the use of drawing the profile in the middle figure it shows you the exactly balanced setting of the groupnot drooping nor erect but with a disposition to droop tossed up by the leaning back of the stem then growing as near as they can to each other those in the middle get squeezed here is another quite special character some flowers dont like being squeezed at all fancy a squeezed convolvulus but these heather bells like it and look all the prettier for itnot the squeezed ones exactly by themselves but the cluster altogether by their patience  then also the outside ones get pushed into a sort of starshape and in front show the colour of all their sides and at the back the rich green cluster of sharp leaves that hold them all this order being as essential to the plant as any of the more formal structures of the bell itself  6 but the bogheath has usually only one cluster of flowers to arrange on each branch take a spray of ling frontispiece and you will find that the richest piece of gothic spiresculpture would be dull and graceless beside the grouping of the floral masses in their various life but it is difficult to give the accuracy of attention 69 necessary to see their beauty without drawing them and still more difficult to draw them in any approximation to the truth before they change this is indeed the fatallest obstacle to all good botanical work flowers or leavesand especially the lastcan only be rightly drawn as they grow and even then in their loveliest spring action they grow as you draw them and will not stay quite the same creatures for half an hour  7 i said in my inaugural lectures at oxford § 107 that real botany is not so much the description of plants as their biography without entering at all into the history of its fruitage the life and death of the blossom itself is always an eventful romance which must be completely told if well the grouping given to the various states of form between bud and flower is always the most important part of the design of the plant and in the modes of its death are some of the most touching lessons or symbolisms connected with its existence the utter loss and farscattered ruin of the cistus and wild rosethe dishonoured and dark contortion of the convolvulusthe pale wasting of the crimson heath of apennine are strangely opposed by the quiet closing of the brown bells of the ling each making of themselves a little cross as they die and so enduring into the days of winter i have drawn the faded beside the full branch and know not which is the more beautiful  8 this grouping then and way of treating each other in their gathered company is the first and most subtle 70 condition of form in flowers and observe i dont mean just now the appointed and disciplined grouping but the wayward and accidental dont confuse the beautiful consent of the cluster in these sprays of heath with the legal strictness of a foxglovethough that also has its divinity but of another kind that legal order of blossomingfor which we may wisely keep the accepted name inflorescenceis itself quite a separate subject of study which we cannot take up until we know the still more strict laws which are set over the flower itself  9 i have in my hand a small red poppy which i gathered on whit sunday on the palace of the cæsars it is an intensely simple intensely floral flower all silk and flame a scarlet cup perfectedged all round seen among the wild grass far away like a burning coal fallen from heavens altars you cannot have a more complete a more stainless type of flower absolute inside and outside all flower no sparing of colour anywhereno outside coarsenessesno interior secrecies open as the sunshine that creates it finefinished on both sides down to the extremest point of insertion on its narrow stalk and robed in the purple of the cæsars  literally so that poppy scarlet so far as it could be painted by mortal hand for mortal king stays yet against the sun and wind and rain on the walls of the house of augustus a hundred yards from the spot where i gathered the weed of its desolation  10 a pure cup you remember it is that much at least 71 you cannot but remember of poppyform among the cornfields and it is best in beginning to think of every flower as essentially a cup there are flat ones but you will find that most of these are really groups of flowers not single blossoms and there are outoftheway and quaint ones very difficult to define as of any shape but even these have a cup to begin with deep down in them you had better take the idea of a cup or vase as the first simplest and most general form of true flower  the botanists call it a corolla which means a garland or a kind of crown and the word is a very good one because it indicates that the flowercup is made as our clay cups are on a potters wheel that it is essentially a revolute forma whirl or botanically whorl of leaves in reality successive round the base of the urn they form  11 perhaps however you think poppies in general are not much like cups but the flower in my hand is apovertystricken poppy i was going to writepovertystrengthened poppy i mean on richer ground it would have gushed into flaunting breadth of untenable purpleflapped its inconsistent scarlet vaguely to the winddropped the pride of its petals over my hand in an hour after i gathered it but this little roughbred thing a campagna pony of a poppy is as bright and strong today as yesterday so that i can see exactly where the leaves join or lap over each other and when i look down into the cup find it to be composed of four leaves altogethertwo smaller set within two larger 72  illustration fig 4  12 thus far and somewhat farther i had written in rome but now putting my work together in oxford a sudden doubt troubles me whether all poppies have two petals smaller than the other two whereupon i take down an excellent little schoolbook on botanythe best ive yet found thinking to be told quickly and i find a great deal about opium and apropos of opium that the juice of common celandine is of a bright orange colour and i pause for a bewildered five minutes wondering if a celandine is a poppy and how many petals it has going on againbecause i must without making up my mind on either questioni am told to observe the floral receptacle of the californian genus eschscholtzia now i cant observe anything of the sort and i dont want to and i wish california and all thats in it were at the deepest bottom of the pacific next i am told to compare the poppy and waterlily and i cant do that neitherthough i should like to and theres the end of the article and it never tells me whether one pair of petals is always smaller than the other or not only i see it says the corolla has four petals perhaps a celandine may be a double poppy and have eight i know theyre tiresome irregular things and i mustnt be stopped by them23at 73 any rate my roman poppy knew what it was about and had its two couples of leaves in clear subordination of which at the time i went on to inquire farther as follows  13 the next point is what shape are the petals of and that is easier asked than answered for when you pull them off you find they wont lie flat by any means but are each of them cups or rather shells themselves and that it requires as much conchology as would describe a cockle before you can properly give account of a single poppy leaf or of a single any leaffor all leaves are either shells or boats or solid if not hollow masses and cannot be represented in flat outline but laying these as flat as they will lie on a sheet of paper you will find the piece they hide of the paper they lie on can be drawn giving approximately the shape of the outer leaf as at a that of the inner as at b fig 4 which you will find very difficult lines to draw for they are each composed of two curves joined as in fig 5 all above the line a b being the outer edge of the leaf but joined so subtly to the side that the least break in drawing the line spoils the form  14 now every flower petal consists essentially of these two parts variously proportioned and outlined it 74 expands from c to a b and closes in the external line and for this reason  illustration fig 5  considering every flower under the type of a cup the first part of the petal is that in which it expands from the bottom to the rim the second part that in which it terminates itself on reaching the rim thus let the three circles a b c fig 6 represent the undivided cups of the three great geometrical orders of flowerstrefoil quatrefoil and cinquefoil  illustration fig 6  draw in the first an equilateral triangle in the second a square in the third a pentagon draw the dark lines from centres to angles d e f then a the third part of d b the fourth part of e c the fifth part of f are the normal outline forms of the petals of the three 75 families the relations between the developing angle and limiting curve being varied according to the depth of cup and the degree of connection between the petals thus a rose folds them over one another in the bud a convolvulus twists themthe one expanding into a flat cinquefoil of separate petals and the other into a deepwelled cinquefoil of connected ones  i find an excellent illustration in veronica polita one of the most perfectly graceful of field plants because of the light alternate flower stalks each with its leaf at the base the flower itself a quatrefoil of which the largest and least petals are uppermost pull one off its calyx draw if you can the outline of the striped blue upper petal with the jagged edge of pale gold below and then examine the relative shapes of the lateral and least upper 76 petal their under surface is very curious as if covered with white paint the blue stripes above in the direction of their growth deepening the more delicate colour with exquisite insistence  a lilac blossom will give you a pretty example of the expansion of the petals of a quatrefoil above the edge of the cup or tube but i must get back to our poppy at present  15 what outline its petals really have however is little shown in their crumpled fluttering but that very crumpling arises from a fine floral character which we do not enough value in them we usually think of the poppy as a coarse flower but it is the most transparent and delicate of all the blossoms of the field the restnearly all of themdepend on the texture of their surfaces for colour but the poppy is painted glass it never glows so brightly as when the sun shines through it wherever it is seenagainst the light or with the lightalways it is a flame and warms the wind like a blown ruby  in these two qualities the accurately balanced form and the perfectly infused colour of the petals you have as i said the central being of the flower all the other parts of it are necessary but we must follow them out in order  16 looking down into the cup you see the green boss divided by a black starof six rays onlyand surrounded by a few black spots my roughnurtured poppy contents itself with these for its centre a rich one would have had the green boss divided by a dozen of rays and surrounded by a dark crowd of crested threads 77  this green boss is called by botanists the pistil which word consists of the two first syllables of the latin pistillum otherwise more familiarly englished into pestle the meaning of the botanical word is of course also that the central part of a flowercup has to it something of the relations that a pestle has to a mortar practically however as this pestle has no pounding functions i think the word is misleading as well as ungraceful and that we may find a better one after looking a little closer into the matter for this pestle is divided generally into three very distinct parts there is a storehouse at the bottom of it for the seeds of the plant above this a shaft often of considerable length in deep cups rising to the level of their upper edge or above it and at the top of these shafts an expanded crest this shaft the botanists call style from the greek word for a pillar and the crest of iti do not know whystigma from the greek word for spot the storehouse for the seeds they call the ovary from the latin ovum an egg so you have twothirds of a latin word pistilawkwardly and disagreeably edged in between pestle and pistolfor the whole thing you have an englishlatin word ovary for the bottom of it an englishgreek word style for the middle and a pure greek word stigma for the top  17 this is a great mess of language and all the worse that the words style and stigma have both of them quite different senses in ordinary and scholarly english from this forced botanical one and i will venture therefore 78 for my own pupils to put the four names altogether into english instead of calling the whole thing a pistil i shall simply call it the pillar instead of ovary i shall say treasury for a seed isnt an egg but it is a treasure the style i shall call the shaft and the stigma the volute so you will have your entire pillar divided into the treasury at its base the shaft and the volute and i think you will find these divisions easily remembered and not unfitted to the sense of the words in their ordinary use  18 round this central but in the poppy very stumpy pillar you find a cluster of dark threads with dusty pendants or cups at their ends for these the botanists name stamens may be conveniently retained each consisting of a filament or thread and an anther or blossoming part  and in this rich corolla and pillar or pillars with their treasuries and surrounding crowd of stamens the essential flower consists fewer than these several parts it cannot have to be a flower at all of these the corolla leads and is the object of final purpose the stamens and the treasuries are only there in order to produce future corollas though often themselves decorative in the highest degree  these i repeat are all the essential parts of a flower but it would have been difficult with any other than the poppy to have shown you them alone for nearly all other flowers keep with them all their lives their nurse 79 or tutor leavesthe group which in stronger and humbler temper protected them in their first weakness and formed them to the first laws of their being but the poppy casts these tutorial leaves away it is the finished picture of impatient and luxuryloving youthat first too severely restrained then casting all restraint awayyet retaining to the end of life unseemly and illiberal signs of its once compelled submission to laws which were only painnot instruction  19 gather a green poppy bud just when it shows the scarlet line at its side break it open and unpack the poppy the whole flower is there complete in size and colourits stamens fullgrown but all packed so closely that the fine silk of the petals is crushed into a million of shapeless wrinkles when the flower opens it seems a deliverance from torture the two imprisoning green leaves are shaken to the ground the aggrieved corolla smooths itself in the sun and comforts itself as it can but remains visibly crushed and hurt to the end of its days  illustration fig 7  20 not so flowers of gracious breeding look at these four stages in the young life of a primrose fig 7 first confined as strictly as the poppy within five pinching green leaves whose points close over it the little thing is content to remain a child and finds its nursery large enough the green leaves unclose their pointsthe little yellow ones peep out like ducklings they find the light delicious and open wide to it and grow and grow 80 and throw themselves wider at last into their perfect rose but they never leave their old nursery for all that it and they live on together and the nursery seems a part of the flower  21 which is so indeed in all the loveliest flowers and in usual botanical parlance a flower is said to consist of its calyx or hiding partcalypso having rule over it and corolla or garland part proserpina having rule over it but it is better to think of them always as separate for this calyx very justly so named from its main function of concealing the flower in its youth is usually green not coloured and shows its separate nature by pausing or at least greatly lingering in its growth and modifying itself very slightly while the corolla is forming 81 itself through active change look at the two for instance through the youth of a pease blossom fig 8  illustration fig 8  the entire cluster at first appears pendent in this manner the stalk bending round on purpose to put it into that position on which all the little buds thinking themselves illtreated determine not to submit to anything of the sort turn their points upward persistently and determine thatat any cost of troublethey will get nearer the sun then they begin to open and let out their corollas i give the process of one only fig 924 it chances to be engraved the reverse way from the bud but that is of no consequence  illustration fig 9  at first you see the long lower point of the calyx thought that it was going to be the head of the family and curls upwards eagerly then the little corolla steals out and soon does away with that impression on the mind of the calyx the corolla soars up with widening wings the abashed calyx retreats beneath and finally the great upper leaf of corollanot pleased at having its back still 82 turned to the light and its face downthrows itself entirely back to look at the sky and nothing elseand your blossom is complete  keeping therefore the ideas of calyx and corolla entirely distinct this one general point you may note of both that as a calyx is originally folded tight over the flower and has to open deeply to let it out it is nearly always composed of sharp pointed leaves like the segments of a balloon while corollas having to open out as wide as possible to show themselves are typically like cups or plates only cut into their edges here and there for ornamentations sake  22 and finally though the corolla is essentially the floral group of leaves and usually receives the glory of colour for itself only this glory and delight may be given to any other part of the group and as if to show us that there is no really dishonoured or degraded membership the stalks and leaves in some plants near the blossom flush in sympathy with it and become themselves a part of the 83 effectively visible flowereryngojura hyacinth comosus and the edges of upper stems and leaves in many plants while others geranium lucidum are made to delight us with their leaves rather than their blossoms only i suppose in these the scarlet leaf colour is a kind of early autumnal glowa beautiful hectic and foretaste in sacred youth of sacred death  i observe among the speculations of modern science several lately not uningenious and highly industrious on the subject of the relation of colour in flowers to insectsto selective development etc etc there are such relations of course so also the blush of a girl when she first perceives the faltering in her lovers step as he draws near is related essentially to the existing state of her stomach and to the state of it through all the years of her previous existence nevertheless neither love chastity nor blushing are merely exponents of digestion  all these materialisms in their unclean stupidity are essentially the work of human bats men of semifaculty or semieducation who are more or less incapable of so much as seeing much less thinking about colour among whom for onesided intensity even mr darwin must be often ranked as in his vespertilian treatise on the ocelli of the argus pheasant which he imagines to be artistically gradated and perfectly imitative of a ball and socket if i had him here in oxford for a week and could force him to try to copy a feather by bewick or to draw for himself a boys thumbed marble his notions of feathers and balls 84 would be changed for all the rest of his life but his ignorance of good art is no excuse for the acutely illogical simplicity of the rest of his talk of colour in the descent of man peacocks tails he thinks are the result of the admiration of blue tails in the minds of wellbred peahensand similarly mandrills noses the result of the admiration of blue noses in wellbred baboons but it never occurs to him to ask why the admiration of blue noses is healthy in baboons so that it develops their race properly while similar maidenly admiration either of blue noses or red noses in men would be improper and develop the race improperly the word itself proper being one of which he has never asked or guessed the meaning and when he imagined the gradation of the cloudings in feathers to represent successive generation it never occurred to him to look at the much finer cloudy gradations in the clouds of dawn themselves and explain the modes of sexual preference and selective development which had brought them to their scarlet glory before the cock could crow thrice putting all these vespertilian speculations out of our way the human facts concerning colour are briefly these wherever men are noble they love bright colour and wherever they can live healthily bright colour is given themin sky sea flowers and living creatures  on the other hand wherever men are ignoble and sensual they endure without pain and at last even come to like especially if artists mudcolour and black and to dislike rosecolour and white and wherever it is unhealthy for 85 them to live the poisonousness of the place is marked by some ghastly colour in air earth or flowers  there are of course exceptions to all such widely founded laws there are poisonous berries of scarlet and pestilent skies that are fair but if we once honestly compare a venomous woodfungus rotting into black dissolution of dripped slime at its edges with a spring gentian or a puff adder with a salmon trout or a fog in bermondsey with a clear sky at berne we shall get hold of the entire question on its right side and be able afterwards to study at our leisure or accept without doubt or trouble facts of apparently contrary meaning and the practical lesson which i wish to leave with the reader is that lovely flowers and green trees growing in the open air are the proper guides of men to the places which their maker intended them to inhabit while the flowerless and treeless desertsof reed or sand or rockare meant to be either heroically invaded and redeemed or surrendered to the wild creatures which are appointed for them happy and wonderful in their wild abodes  nor is the world so small but that we may yet leave in it also unconquered spaces of beautiful solitude where the chamois and red deer may wander fearlessnor any fire of avarice scorch from the highlands of alp or grampian the rapture of the heath and the rose                                       86  chapter v  papaver rhoeas  brantwood july 11th 1875  1 chancing to take up yesterday a favourite old book mavors british tourists london 1798 i found in its fourth volume a delightful diary of a journey made in 1782 through various parts of england by charles p moritz of berlin  and in the fourteenth page of this diary i find the following passage pleasantly complimentary to england  the slices of bread and butter which they give you with your tea are as thin as poppy leaves but there is another kind of bread and butter usually eaten with tea which is toasted by the fire and is incomparably good this is called toast  i wonder how many people nowadays whose bread and butter was cut too thin for them would think of comparing the slices to poppy leaves but this was in the old days of travelling when people did not whirl themselves past cornfields that they might have more time to walk on pavingstones and understood that 87 poppies did not mingle their scarlet among the gold without some purpose of the poppymaker that they should be looked at  nevertheless with respect to the good and polite germans poeticallycontemplated and finely æsthetic tea may it not be asked whether poppy leaves themselves like the bread and butter are not if we may venture an opiniontoo thinimproperly thin in the last chapter my reader was i hope a little anxious to know what i meant by saying that modern philosophers did not know the meaning of the word proper and may wish to know what i mean by it myself and this i think it needful to explain before going farther  2 in our english prayerbook translation the first verse of the ninetythird psalm runs thus the lord is king and hath put on glorious apparel and although in the future republican world there are to be no lords no kings and no glorious apparel it will be found convenient for botanical purposes to remember what such things once were for when i said of the poppy in last chapter that it was robed in the purple of the cæsars the words gave to any one who had a clear idea of a cæsar and of his dress a better and even stricter account of the flower than if i had only said with mr sowerby petals bright scarlet which might just as well have been said of a pimpernel or scarlet geraniumbut of neither of these latter should i have said robed in purple of cæsars what i meant was first that the poppy leaf 88 looks dyed through and through like glass or tyrian tissue and not merely painted secondly that the splendour of it is proudalmost insolently so augustus in his glory might have been clothed like one of these and saul but not david nor solomon still less the teacher of solomon when he puts on glorious apparel  3 let us look however at the two translations of the same verse  in the vulgate it is dominus regnavit decorem indutus est he has put on becomingnessdecent apparel rather than glorious  in the septuagint it is greek euprepeiawellbecomingness an expression which if the reader considers must imply certainly the existence of an opposite idea of possible illbecomingnessof an apparel which should in just as accurate a sense belong appropriately to the creature invested with it and yet not be glorious but inglorious and not wellbecoming but illbecoming the mandrills blue nose for instance already referred tocan we rightly speak of this as greek euprepeia or the stings and minute colourless blossoming of the nettle may we call these a glorious apparel as we may the glowing of an alpine rose  you will find on reflection and find more convincingly the more accurately you reflect that there is an absolute sense attached to such words as decent honourable glorious or greek kalos contrary to another absolute sense in the words indecent shameful vile or greek aischros 89  and that there is every degree of these absolute qualities visible in living creatures and that the divinity of the mind of man is in its essential discernment of what is greek kalon from what is greek aischron and in his preference of the kind of creatures which are decent to those which are indecent and of the kinds of thoughts in himself which are noble to those which are vile  4 when therefore i said that mr darwin and his school25 had no conception of the real meaning of the word proper i meant that they conceived the qualities of things only as their properties but not as their becomingnesses and seeing that dirt is proper to a swine malice to a monkey poison to a nettle and folly to a fool they called a nettle but a nettle and the faults of fools but folly and never saw the difference between ugliness and beauty absolute decency and indecency absolute glory or shame absolute and folly or sense absolute  illustration fig 10  whereas the perception of beauty and the power of defining physical character are based on moral instinct and on the power of defining animal or human character nor is it possible to say that one flower is more highly developed or one animal of a higher order than another without the assumption of a divine law of perfection to which the one more conforms than the other  5 thus for instance that it should ever have been an open question with me whether a poppy had always 90 two of its petals less than the other two depended wholly on the hurry and imperfection with which the poppy carries out its plan it never would have occurred to me to 91 doubt whether an iris had three of its leaves smaller than the other three because an iris always completes itself to its own ideal nevertheless on examining various poppies as i have walked this summer up and down the hills between sheffield and wakefield i find the subordination of the upper and lower petals entirely necessary and normal and that the result of it is to give two distinct profiles to the poppy cup the difference between which however we shall see better in the yellow welsh poppy at present called meconopsis cambrica but which in the oxford schools will be papaver cruciformecrosslet poppyfirst because all our botanical names must be in latin if possible greek only allowed when we can do no better secondly because meconopsis is barbarous greek thirdly and chiefly because it is little matter whether this poppy be welsh or english but very needful that we should observe wherever it grows that the petals are arranged in what used to be in my young days called a diamond shape26 as at a fig 10 the two narrow inner ones at right angles to and projecting farther than the two outside broad ones and that the two broad ones when the flower is seen in profile as at b show their margins folded back as indicated by the thicker lines and have a profile curve which is only the softening or melting away into each other of two straight lines indeed when the flower is younger and quite strong both its 92 profiles a and b fig 11 are nearly straightsided and always be it young or old one broader than the other so as to give the flower seen from above the shape of a contracted cross or crosslet  illustration fig 11  6 now i find no notice of this flower in gerarde and in sowerby out of eighteen lines of closely printed descriptive text no notice of its crosslet form while the petals are only stated to be roundishconcave terms equally applicable to at least onehalf of all flower petals in the 93 world the leaves are said to be very deeply pinnately partite but drawnas neither pinnate nor partite  illustration fig 12  and this is your modern cheap science in ten volumes now i havent a quiet moment to spare for drawing this morning but i merely give the main relations of the petals a and blot in the wrinkles of one of the lower ones b fig 12 and yet in this rude sketch you will feel i believe there is something specific which could not belong to any other flower but all proper description is 94 impossible without careful profiles of each petal laterally and across it which i may not find time to draw for any poppy whatever because they none of them have wellbecomingness enough to make it worth my while being all more or less weedy and ungracious and mingled of good and evil whereupon rises before me ghostly and untenable the general question what is a weed and impatient for answer the particular question what is a poppy i choose for instance to call this yellow flower a poppy instead of a likeness to poppy which the botanists meant to call it in their bad greek i choose also to call a poppy what the botanists have called glaucous thing glaucium but where and when shall i stop calling things poppies this is certainly a question to be settled at once with others appertaining to it  7 in the first place then i mean to call every flower either one thing or another and not an aceous thing only half something or half another i mean to call this plant now in my hand either a poppy or not a poppy but not poppaceous and this other either a thistle or not a thistle but not thistlaceous and this other either a nettle or not a nettle but not nettlaceous i know it will be very difficult to carry out this principle when tribes of plants are much extended and varied in type i shall persist in it however as far as possible and when plants change so much that one cannot with any conscience call them by their family name any more i shall put them aside somewhere among families of poor relations not 95 to be minded for the present until we are well acquainted with the better bred circles i dont know for instance whether i shall call the burnet grassrose or put it out of court for having no petals but it certainly shall not be called rosaceous and my first point will be to make sure of my pupils having a clear idea of the central and unquestionable forms of thistle grass or rose and assigning to them pure latin and pretty english namesclassical if possible and at least intelligible and decorous  8 i return to our present special question then what is a poppy and return also to a book i gave away long ago and have just begged back again dr lindleys ladies botany for without at all looking upon ladies as inferior beings i dimly hope that what dr lindley considers likely to be intelligible to them may be also clear to their very humble servant  the poppies i find page 19 vol i differ from crowfeet in being of a stupifying instead of a burning nature and in generally having two sepals and twice two petals but as some poppies have three sepals and twice three petals the number of these parts is not sufficiently constant to form an essential mark yes i know that for i found a superb sixpetaled poppy spotted like a cistus the other day in a friends garden but then what makes it a poppy still that it is of a stupifying nature and itself so stupid that it does not know how many petals it should have is surely not enough distinction  9 returning to lindley and working the matter 96 farther out with his help i think this definition might stand a poppy is a flower which has either four or six petals and two or more treasuries united into one containing a milky stupifying fluid in its stalks and leaves and always throwing away its calyx when it blossoms  and indeed every flower which unites all these characters we shall in the oxford schools call poppy and papaver but when i get fairly into work i hope to fix my definitions into more strict terms for i wish all my pupils to form the habit of asking of every plant these following four questions in order corresponding to the subject of these opening chapters namely what root has it what leaf what flower and what stem and in this definition of poppies nothing whatever is said about the root and not only i dont know myself what a poppy root is like but in all sowerbys poppy section i find no word whatever about that matter  10 leaving however for the present the root unthought of and contenting myself with dr lindleys characteristics i shall place at the head of the whole group our common european wild poppy papaver rhoeas and with this arrange the nine following other flowers thusopposite  i must be content at present with determining the latin names for the oxford schools the english ones i shall give as they chance to occur to me in gerarde and the classical poets who wrote before the english revolution when no satisfactory name is to be found i must try to invent one as for instance just now i dont like gerardes cornrose for papaver rhoeas and must coin another but this cant be done by thinking it will come into my head some day by chance i might try at it straightforwardly for a week together and not do it  97    name in oxford catalogue  dioscorides         in present botany    1 papaver rhoeas     greek mêkôn rhoias       papaver rhoeas    2 p

fixed at once somehow and therefore i do the best i can keeping as much respect for the old nomenclature as possible though this involves the illogical practice of giving the epithet sometimes from the flower violaceum cruciforme and sometimes from the seed vessel elatum echinosum corniculatum guarding this distinction however we may perhaps be content to call the six last of the group in english urchin poppy violet poppy crosslet poppy horned poppy beach poppy and welcome poppy i dont think the last flower pretty enough to be connected more directly with the swallow in its english name  11 i shall be well content if my pupils know these ten poppies rightly all of them at present wild in our own country and i believe also european in range the head and type of all being the common wild poppy of our cornfields for which the name papaver rhoeas given it by dioscorides gerarde and linnæus is entirely authoritative and we will therefore at once examine the meaning and reason of that name  12 dioscorides says the name belongs to it greek dia to tacheôs to anthos apoballein because it casts off its bloom 99 quickly from greek rheô rheo in the sense of shedding29 and this indeed it doesfirst calyx then corollayou may translate it swiftly ruinous poppy but notice in connection with this idea how it droops its head before blooming an action which i doubt not mingled in homers thought with the image of its depression when filled by rain in the passage of the iliad which as i have relieved your memory of three unnecessary names of poppy families you have memory to spare for learning   greek mêkôn d hôs heterôse karê balen hêt eni kêpôi   greek karpôi brithomenê notiêisi te eiarinêisin   greek hôs heterôs êmuse karê pêlêki barunthen  and as a poppy lets its head fall aside which in a garden is loaded with its fruit and with the soft rains of spring so the youth drooped his head on one side burdened with the helmet  and now you shall compare the translations of this passage with its context by chapman and popeor the school of pope the one being by a man of pure english temper and able therefore to understand pure greek temper the other infected with all the faults of the falsely classical school of the renaissance  first i take chapman   his shaft smit fair gorgythion of priams princely race   who in Æpina was brought forth a famous town in thrace   100   by castianeira that for form was like celestial breed   and as a crimson poppyflower surcharged with his seed   and vernal humours falling thick declines his heavy brow   so aoneside his helmets weight his fainting head did bow  next pope   he missed the mark but pierced gorgythios heart   and drenched in royal blood the thirsty dart   fair castianeira nymph of form divine   this offspring added to king priams line   as fullblown poppies overcharged with rain   decline the head and drooping kiss the plain   so sinks the youth his beauteous head depressed   beneath his helmet drops upon his breast  13 i give you the two passages in full trusting that you may so feel the becomingness of the one and the gracelessness of the other but note farther in the homeric passage one subtlety which cannot enough be marked even in chapmans english that his second word greek êmuse is employed by him both of the stooping of ears of corn under wind and of troy stooping to its ruin30 and otherwise in good greek writers the word is marked as having such specific sense of mens drooping under weight or towards death under the burden of fortune which they have no more strength to sustain31 compare the passage 101 i quoted from plato crown of wild olive p 95 and bore lightly the burden of gold and of possessions 102 and thus you will begin to understand how the poppy became in the heathen mind the type at once of power or pride and of its loss and therefore both why virgil represents the white nymph nais pallentes violas et summa papavera carpensgathering the pale flags and the highest poppiesand the reason for the choice of this rather than any other flower in the story of tarquins message to his son  14 but you are next to remember the word rhoeas in another sense whether originally intended or afterwards caught at the resemblance of the word to rhoea a pomegranate mentally connects itself with the resemblance of the poppy head to the pomegranate fruit  and if i allow this flower to be the first we take up for careful study in proserpina on account of its simplicity of form and splendour of colour i wish you also to remember in connection with it the cause of proserpines eternal captivityher having tasted a pomegranate seedthe pomegranate being in greek mythology what the apple is in the mosaic legend and in the whole 103 worship of demeter associated with the poppy by a multitude of ideas which are not definitely expressed but can only be gathered out of greek art and literature as we learn their symbolism the chief character on which these thoughts are founded is the fulness of seed in the poppy and pomegranate as an image of life then the forms of both became adopted for beads or bosses in ornamental art the pomegranate remains more distinctly a jewish and christian type from its use in the border of aarons robe down to the fruit in the hand of angelicos and botticellis infant christs while the poppy is gradually confused by the byzantine greeks with grapes and both of these with palm fruit the palm in the shorthand of their art gradually becomes a symmetrical branched ornament with two pendent bosses this is again confused with the greek iris homers blue iris and pindars waterflagand the florentines in adopting byzantine ornament read it into their own fleurdelys but insert two poppyheads on each side of the entire foil in their finest heraldry  15 meantime the definitely intended poppy in late christian greek art of the twelfth century modifies the form of the acanthus leaf with its own until the northern twelfth century workman takes the thistlehead for the poppy and the thistleleaf for acanthus the true poppyhead remains in the south but gets more and more confused with grapes till the renaissance carvers are content with any kind of boss full of seed but insist on such boss 104 or bursting globe as some essential part of their ornamentthe beanpod for the same reason not without pythagorean notions and some of republican election is used by brunelleschi for main decoration of the lantern of florence duomo and finally the ornamentation gets so shapeless that m violetleduc in his dictionary of ornament loses trace of its origin altogether and fancies the later forms were derived from the spadix of the arum  16 i have no time to enter into farther details but through all this vast range of art note this singular fact that the wheatear the vine the fleurdelys the poppy and the jagged leaf of the acanthusweed or thistle occupy the entire thoughts of the decorative workmen trained in classic schools to the exclusion of the rose true lily and the other flowers of luxury and that the deeply underlying reason of this is in the relation of weeds to corn or of the adverse powers of nature to the beneficent ones expressed for us readers of the jewish scriptures centrally in the verse thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field greek chortos grass or corn and exquisitely symbolized throughout the fields of europe by the presence of the purple cornflag or gladiolus and cornrose gerardes name for papaver rhoeas in the midst of carelessly tended corn and in the traditions of the art of europe by the springing of the acanthus round the basket of the canephora strictly the basket for bread the idea of bread 105 including all sacred things carried at the feasts of demeter bacchus and the queen of the air and this springing of the thorny weeds round the basket of reed distinctly taken up by the byzantine italians in the basketwork capital of the twelfth century which i have already illustrated at length in the stones of venice becomes the germ of all capitals whatsoever in the great schools of gothic to the end of gothic time and also of all the capitals of the pure and noble renaissance architecture of angelico and perugino and all that was learned from them in the north while the introduction of the rose as a primal element of decoration only takes place when the luxury of english decorated gothic the result of that licentious spirit in the lords which brought on the wars of the roses indicates the approach of destruction to the feudal artistic and moral power of the northern nations  for which reason and many others i must yet delay the following out of our main subject till i have answered the other question which brought me to pause in the middle of this chapter namely what is a weed                                       106  chapter vi  the parable of joash  1 some ten or twelve years ago i boughtthree times twelve are thirtysixof a delightful little book by mrs gatty called aunt judys taleswhereof to make presents to my little lady friends i had at that happy time perhaps from fourandtwenty to sixandthirtyi forget exactly how manyvery particular little lady friends and greatly wished aunt judy to be the thirtysevenththe kindest wittiest prettiest girl one had ever read of at least in so entirely proper and orthodox literature  2 not but that it is a suspicious sign of infirmity of faith in our modern moralists to make their exemplary young people always pretty and dress them always in the height of the fashion one may read miss edgeworths harry and lucy frank and mary fashionable tales or parents assistant through from end to end with extremest care and never find out whether lucy was tall or short nor whether mary was dark or fair nor how miss annaly was dressed norwhich was my own chief point of interestwhat was the colour of 107 rosamonds eyes whereas aunt judy in charming position after position is shown to have expressed all her pure evangelical principles with the prettiest of lips and to have had her gown though puritanically plain made by one of the best modistes in london  3 nevertheless the book is wholesome and useful and the nicest story in it as far as i recollect is an inquiry into the subject which is our present business what is a weedin which by many pleasant devices aunt judy leads her little brothers and sisters to discern that a weed is a plant in the wrong place  vegetable in the wrong place by the way i think aunt judy says being a precisely scientific little aunt but i cant keep it out of my own less scientific head that vegetable means only something going to be boiled i like plant better for general sense besides that its shorter  whatever we call them aunt judy is perfectly right about them as far as she has gone but as happens often even to the best of evangelical instructresses she has stopped just short of the gist of the whole matter it is entirely true that a weed is a plant that has got into a wrong place but it never seems to have occurred to aunt judy that some plants never do  who ever saw a wood anemone or a heath blossom in the wrong place who ever saw nettle or hemlock in a right one and yet the difference between flower and weed i use for convenience sake these words in their 108 familiar opposition certainly does not consist merely in the flowers being innocent and the weed stinging and venomous we do not call the nightshade a weed in our hedges nor the scarlet agaric in our woods but we do the corncockle in our fields  4 had the thoughtful little tutoress gone but one thought farther and instead of a vegetable in a wrong place which it may happen to the innocentest vegetable sometimes to be without turning into a weed therefore said a vegetable which has an innate disposition to get into the wrong place she would have greatly furthered the matter for us but then she perhaps would have felt herself to be uncharitably dividing with vegetables her own little evangelical property of original sin  5 this you will find nevertheless to be the very essence of weed characterin plants as in men if you glance through your botanical books you will see often added certain namesa troublesome weed it is not its being venomous or ugly but its being impertinentthrusting itself where it has no business and hinders other peoples businessthat makes a weed of it the most accursed of all vegetables the one that has destroyed for the present even the possibility of european civilization is only called a weed in the slang of its votaries32 but in the finest and truest english we call so the plant which 109 has come to us by chance from the same country the type of mere senseless prolific activity the american waterplant choking our streams till the very fish that leap out of them cannot fall back but die on the clogged surface and indeed for this unrestrainable unconquerable insolence of uselessness what name can be enough dishonourable  6 i pass to vegetation of nobler rank  you remember i was obliged in the last chapter to leave my poppy for the present without an english specific name because i dont like gerardes cornrose and cant yet think of another nevertheless i would have used gerardes name if the cornrose were as much a rose as the cornflag is a flag but it isnt the rose and lily have quite different relations to the corn the lily is grass in loveliness as the corn is grass in use and both grow together in peacegladiolus in the wheat and narcissus in the pasture but the rose is of another and higher order than the corn and you never saw a cornfield overrun with sweetbriar or appleblossom  they have no mind they to get into the wrong place  what is it then this temper in some plantsmalicious as it seemsintrusive at all events or erringwhich brings them out of their placesthrusts them where they thwart us and offend  7 primarily it is mere hardihood and coarseness of make a plant that can live anywhere will often live where it is not wanted but the delicate and tender ones 110 keep at home you have no trouble in keeping down the spring gentian it rejoices in its own alpine home and makes the earth as like heaven as it can but yields as softly as the air if you want it to give place here in england it will only grow on the loneliest moors above the high force of tees its latin name for us i may as well tell you at once is to be lucia verna and its english one lucy of teesdale  8 but a plant may be hardy and coarse of make and able to live anywhere and yet be no weed the coltsfoot so far as i know is the first of largeleaved plants to grow afresh on ground that has been disturbed fall of alpine débris ruin of railroad embankment waste of drifted slime by flood it seeks to heal and redeem but it does not offend us in our gardens nor impoverish us in our fields  nevertheless mere coarseness of structure indiscriminate hardihood is at least a point of some unworthiness in a plant that it should have no choice of home no love of native land is ungentle much more if such discrimination as it has be immodest and incline it seemingly to open and muchtraversed places where it may be continually seen of strangers the tormentilla gleams in showers along the mountain turf her delicate crosslets are separate though constellate as the rubied daisy but the kingcupblessing be upon it always no lesscrowds itself sometimes into too burnished flame of inevitable gold i dont know if there was anything in the 111 darkness of this last spring to make it brighter in resistance but i never saw any spaces of full warm yellow in natural colour so intense as the meadows between reading and the thames nor did i know perfectly what purple and gold meant till i saw a field of park land embroidered a foot deep with kingcup and cloverwhile i was correcting my last notes on the spring colours of the royal academyat aylesbury  9 and there are two other questions of extreme subtlety connected with this main one what shall we say of the plants whose entire destiny is parasiticwhich are not only sometimes and impertinently but always and pertinently out of place not only out of the right place but out of any place of their own when is mistletoe for instance in the right place young ladies think you on an apple tree or on a ceiling when is ivy in the right placewhen wallflower the ivy has been torn down from the towers of kenilworth the weeds from the arches of the coliseum and from the steps of the araceli irreverently vilely and in vain but how are we to separate the creatures whose office it is to abate the grief of ruin by their gentleness           wafting wallflower scents   from out the crumbling ruins of fallen pride   and chambers of transgression now forlorn  from those which truly resist the toil of men and conspire against their fame which are cunning to consume and 112 prolific to encumber and of whose perverse and unwelcome sowing we know and can say assuredly an enemy hath done this  10 again the character of strength which gives prevalence over others to any common plant is more or less consistently dependent on woody fibre in the leaves giving them strong ribs and great expanding extent or spinous edges and wrinkled or gathered extent  get clearly into your mind the nature of those two conditions when a leaf is to be spread wide like the burdock it is supported by a framework of extending ribs like a gothic roof the supporting function of these is geometrical every one is constructed like the girders of a bridge or beams of a floor with all manner of science in the distribution of their substance in the section for narrow and deep strength and the shafts are mostly hollow but when the extending space of a leaf is to be enriched with fulness of folds and become beautiful in wrinkles this may be done either by pure undulation as of a liquid current along the leaf edge or by sharp drawingor gathering i believe ladies would call itand stitching of the edges together and this stitching together if to be done very strongly is done round a bit of stick as a sail is reefed round a mast and this bit of stick needs to be compactly not geometrically strong its function is essentially that of starchnot to hold the leaf up off the ground against gravity but to stick the edges out stiffly in a crimped frill and in beautiful work of 113 this kind which we are meant to study the stays of the leafor staybonesare finished off very sharply and exquisitely at the points and indeed so much so that they prick our fingers when we touch them for they are not at all meant to be touched but admired  11 to be admiredwith qualification indeed always but with extreme respect for their endurance and orderliness among flowers that pass away and leaves that shake as with ague or shrink like bad cloththese in their sturdy growth and enduring life we are bound to honour and under the green holly remember how much softer friendship was failing and how much of other loving folly and yetyou are not to confuse the thistle with the cedar that is in lebanon nor to forgetif the spinous nature of it become too cruel to provoke and offendthe parable of joash to amaziah and its fulfilment there passed by a wild beast that was in lebanon and trode down the thistle  12 then lastly if this rudeness and insensitiveness of nature be gifted with no redeeming beauty if the boss of the thistle lose its purple and the star of the lions tooth its light and much more if service be perverted as beauty is lost and the honied tube and medicinal leaf change into mere swollen emptiness and salt brown membrane swayed in nerveless languor by the idle seaat last the separation between the two natures is as great as between the fruitful earth and fruitless ocean and between the living hands that tend the garden of herbs where 114 love is and those unclasped that toss with tangle and with shells                                       13 i had a long bit in my head that i wanted to write about st george of the seaweed but ive no time to do it and those few words of tennysons are enough if one thinks of them only i see in correcting press that ive partly misapplied the idea of gathering in the leaf edge it would be more accurate to say it was gathered at the central rib but there is nothing in needlework that will represent the actual excess by lateral growth at the edge giving three or four inches of edge for one of centre but the stiffening of the fold by the thorn which holds it out is very like the action of a ships spars on its sails and absolutely in many cases like that of the spines in a fishs fin passing into the various conditions of serpentine and dracontic crest connected with all the terrors and adversities of nature not to be dealt with in a chapter on weeds  14 here is a sketch of a crested leaf of less adverse temper which may as well be given together with plate iii in this number these two engravings being meant for examples of two different methods of drawing both useful according to character of subject plate iii is sketched first with a finelypointed pen and common ink on white paper then washed rapidly with colour and retouched with the pen to give sharpness and completion 115 this method is used because the thistle leaves are full of complex and sharp sinuosities and set with intensely sharp spines passing into hairs which require many kinds of execution with the fine point to imitate at all in the drawing there was more look of the bloom or woolliness on the stems but it was useless to try for this in the mezzotint and i desired mr allen to leave his work at the stage where it expressed as much form as i wanted the leaves are of the common marsh thistle of which more anon and the two long lateral ones are only two different views of the same leaf while the central figure is a young leaf just opening it beat me in its delicate bossing and i had to leave it discontentedly enough  plate iv is much better work being of an easier subject adequately enough rendered by perfectly simple means here i had only a succulent and membranous surface to represent with definite outlines and merely undulating folds and this is sufficiently done by a careful and firm pen outline on grey paper with a slight wash of colour afterwards reinforced in the darks then marking the lights with white this method is classic and authoritative being used by many of the greatest masters by holbein continually and it is much the best which the general student can adopt for expression of the action and muscular power of plants  the goodness or badness of such work depends absolutely on the truth of the single line you will find a thousand botanical drawings which will give you a 116 delicate and deceptive resemblance of the leaf for one that will give you the right convexity in its backbone the right perspective of its peaks when they foreshorten or the right relation of depth in the shading of its dimples on which in leaves as in faces no little expression of temper depends  meantime we have yet to consider somewhat more touching that temper itself in next chapter                                       117  chapter vii  the parable of jotham  1 i do not know if my readers were checked as i wished them to be at least for a moment in the close of the last chapter by my talking of thistles and dandelions changing into seaweed by gradation of which doubtless mr darwin can furnish us with specious and sufficient instances but the two groups will not be contemplated in our oxford system as in any parental relations whatsoever  we shall however find some very notable relations existing between the two groups of the wild flowers of dry land which represent in the widest extent and the distinctest opposition the two characters of material serviceableness and unserviceableness the groups which in our english classification will be easily remembered as those of the thyme and the daisy  the one scented as with incensemedicinaland in all gentle and humble ways useful the other scentlesshelpless for ministry to the body infinitely dear as the bringer of light ruby white and gold the three colours of the day with no hue of shade in it therefore i 118 take it on the coins of st george for the symbol of the splendour or light of heaven which is dearest where humblest  2 now these great two ordersof which the types are the thyme and the daisyyou are to remember generally as the herbs and the sunflowers you are not to call them lipped flowers nor composed flowers because the first is a vulgar term for when you once come to be able to draw a lip or in noble duty to kiss one you will know that no other flower in earth is like that and the second is an indefinite term for a foxglove is as much a composed flower as a daisy but it is composed in the shape of a spire instead of the shape of the sun and again a thistle which common botany calls a composed flower as well as a daisy is composed in quite another shape being on the whole bossy instead of flat and of another temper or composition of mind also being connected in that respect with butterburs and a vast company of rough knotty halfblack or brown and generally unluminousflowers i can scarcely call themand weeds i will notcreatures at all events in nowise to be gathered under the general name composed with the stars that crown chaucers alcestis when she returns to the day from the dead  but the wilder and stronger blossoms of the hawkseyeagain you see i refuse for them the word weedand the wasteloving chicory which the venetians call sponsa solis are all to be held in one class with the 119 sunflowers but dedicatethe daisy to alcestis alone others to clytia or the physician apollo himself but i cant follow their mythology yet awhile  3 now in these two families you have typically use opposed to beauty in wildness it is their wildness which is their virtuethat the thyme is sweet where it is unthought of and the daisies red where the foot despises them while in other orders wildness is their crimewherefore when i looked that it should bring forth grapes brought it forth wild grapes but in all of them you must distinguish between the pure wildness of flowers and their distress it may not be our duty to tame them but it must be to relieve  4 it chanced as i was arranging the course of these two chapters that i had examples given me of distressed and happy wildness in immediate contrast the first i grieve to say was in a bit of my own brushwood left uncaredfor evidently many a year before it became mine i had to cut my way into it through a mass of thorny ruin black birdsnest like entanglement of brittle spray round twisted stems of illgrown birches strangling each other and changing half into roots among the rock clefts knotted stumps of neverblossoming blackthorn and choked stragglings of holly all laced and twisted and tethered round with an untouchable almost unhewable thatch a foot thick of dead bramble and rose laid over rotten ground through which the water soaked ceaselessly undermining it into merely unctuous 120 clods and clots knitted together by mossy sponge it was all natures free doing she had had her way with it to the uttermost and clearly needed human help and interference in her business and yet there was not one plant in the whole ruinous and deathful riot of the place whose nature was not in itself wholesome and lovely but all lost for want of discipline  5 the other piece of wild growth was among the fallen blocks of limestone under malham cove sheltered by the cliff above from stress of wind the ash and hazel wood spring there in a fair and perfect freedom without a diseased bough or an unwholesome shade i do not know why mine is all encumbered with overgrowth and this so lovely that scarce a branch could be gathered but with injurywhile underneath the oxalis and the two smallest geraniums lucidum and herbrobert and the mossy saxifrage and the crossleaved bedstraw and the white pansy wrought themselves into wreaths among the fallen crags in which every leaf rejoiced and was at rest  6 now between these two states of equally natural growth the point of difference that forced itself on me and practically enough in the work i had in my own wood was not so much the withering and waste of the one and the life of the other as the thorniness and cruelty of the one and the softness of the other in malham cove the stones of the brook were softer with moss than any silken pillowthe crowded oxalis leaves yielded to the pressure of the hand and were not feltthe cloven 121 leaves of the herbrobert and orbed clusters of its companion overflowed every rent in the rude crags with living balm there was scarcely a place left by the tenderness of the happy things where one might not lay down ones forehead on their warm softness and sleep but in the waste and distressed ground the distress had changed itself to cruelty the leaves had all perished and the bending saplings and the wood of trustbut the thorns were there immortal and the gnarled and sapless roots and the dusty treacheries of decay  7 of which things you will find it good to consider also otherwise than botanically for all these lower organisms suffer and perish or are gladdened and flourish under conditions which are in utter precision symbolical and in utter fidelity representative of the conditions which induce adversity and prosperity in the kingdoms of men and the eternal demetermother and judgebrings forth as the herb yielding seed so also the thorn and the thistle not to herself but to thee  8 you have read the words of the great law often enoughhave you ever thought enough of them to know the difference between these two appointed means of distress the first the thorn is the type of distress caused by crime changing the soft and breathing leaf into inflexible and wounding stubbornness the second is the distress appointed to be the means and herald of goodthou shalt see the stubborn thistle bursting into glossy purple which outredden all voluptuous garden roses 122  9 it is strange that after much hunting i cannot find authentic note of the day when scotland took the thistle for her emblem and i have no space in this chapter at least for tradition but with whatever lightness of construing we may receive the symbol it is actually the truest that could have been found for some conditions of the scottish mind there is no flower which the proserpina of our northern sicily cherishes more dearly and scarcely any of us recognize enough the beautiful power of its closeset stars and rooted radiance of ground leaves yet the stubbornness and ungraceful rectitude of its stem and the besetting of its wholesome substance with that fringe of offence and the forwardness of it and dominancei fear to lacess some of my dearest friends if i went onlet them rather with bailie jarvies true conscience33 take their scott from the inner shelf in their hearts library which all true scotsmen give him and trace with the swift reading of memory the characters of fergus mivor hector mintyre mause headrigg alison wilson richie 123 moniplies and andrew fairservice and then say if the faults of all these drawn as they are with a precision of touch like a corinthian sculptors of the acanthus leaf can be found in anything like the same strength in other races or if so stubbornly folded and starched moniplies of irritating kindliness selfish friendliness lowly conceit and intolerable fidelity are native to any other spot of the wild earth of the habitable globe  10 will you note alsofor this is of extreme interestthat these essential faults are all mean faultswhat we may call groundgrowing faults conditions of semieducation of hardlytreated homelife or of coarselyminded and wandering prosperity how literally may we go back from the living soul symbolized to the strangely accurate earthly symbol in the prickly weed for if with its bravery of endurance and carelessness in choice of home we find also definite faculty and habit of migration volant mechanism for choiceless journey not divinely directed in pilgrimage to known shrines but carried at the winds will by a spirit which listeth notit will go hard but that the plant shall become if not dreaded at least despised and in its wandering and reckless splendour disgrace the garden of the sluggard and possess the inheritance of the prodigal until even its own nature seems contrary to good and the invocation of the just man be made to it as the executor of judgment let thistles grow instead of wheat and cockle instead of barley  11 yet to be despisedeither for men or flowersmay 124 be no illfortune the real illfortune is only to be despicable these faults of human character wherever found observe belong to it as illtrainedincomplete confirm themselves only in the vulgar there is no base pertinacity no overweening conceit in the black douglas or claverhouse or montrose in these we find the pure scottish temper of heroic endurance and royal pride but when in the pay and not deceived but purchased idolatry of mammon the scottish persistence and pride become knit and vested in the spleuchan and your stiff covenanter makes his covenant with death and your old mortality deciphers only the senseless legends of the eternal gravestoneyou get your weed earthgrown in bitter verity and earthdevastating in bitter strength  12 i have told you elsewhere we are always first to study national character in the highest and purest examples but if our knowledge is to be complete we have to study also the special diseases of national character and in exact opposition to the most solemn virtue of scotland the domestic truth and tenderness breathed in all scottish song you have this special disease and mortal cancer this woodyfibriness literally of temper and thought the consummation of which into pure lignite or rather black devils charcoalthe sap of the birks of aberfeldy become cinder and the blessed juices of them deadly gasyou may know in its pure blackness best in the work of the greatest of these groundgrowing scotchmen adam smith 125  13 no man of like capacity i believe born of any other nation could have deliberately and with no momentary shadow of suspicion or question formalized the spinous and monstrous fallacy that human commerce and policy are naturally founded on the desire of every man to possess his neighbours goods  this is the release unto us barabbas with a witness and the deliberate systematization of that cry and choice for perpetual repetition and fulfilment in christian statesmanship has been with the strange precision of natural symbolism and retribution signed as of old by strewing of ashes on kidron by strewing of ashes on the brooks of scotland waters once of life health music and divine tradition but to whose festering scum you may now set fire with a candle and of which round the once excelling palace of scotland modern sanitary science is now helplessly contending with the poisonous exhalations  14 i gave this chapter its heading because i had it in my mind to work out the meaning of the fable in the ninth chapter of judges from what i had seen on that thorny ground of mine where the bramble was king over all the trees of the wood but the thoughts are gone from me now and as i reread the chapter of judgesnow except in my memory unread as it chances for many a yearthe sadness of that story of gideon fastens on me and silences me this the end of his angel visions and dreamled victories the slaughter of all his 126 sons but this youngest34and he never again heard of in israel  you scottish children of the rock taught through all your once pastoral and noble lives by many a sweet miracle of dew on fleece and groundonce servants of mighty kings and keepers of sacred covenant have you indeed dealt truly with your warrior kings and prophet saints or are these ruins of their homes and shrines dark with the fire that fell from the curse of jerubbael                                       127  chapter viii  the stem  1 as i read over again with a fresh mind the last chapter i am struck by the opposition of states which seem best to fit a weed for a weeds workstubbornness namely and flaccidity on the one hand a sternness and a coarseness of structure which changes its stem into a stake and its leaf into a spine on the other an utter flaccidity and ventosity of structure which changes its stem into a riband and its leaf into a bubble and before we go fartherfor we are not yet at the end of our study of these obnoxious thingswe had better complete an examination of the parts of a plant in general by ascertaining what a stem proper is and what makes it stiffer or hollower than we like ithow to wit the gracious and generous strength of ash differs from the spinous obstinacy of blackthornand how the geometric and enduring hollowness of a stalk of wheat differs from the soft fulness of that of a mushroom to which end i will take up a piece of study not of black but white thorn written last spring 128  2 i suppose there is no question but that all nice people like hawthorn blossom  i want if i can to find out today 25th may 1875 what it is we like it so much for holding these two branches of it in my handone full out the other in youth this full one is a mere mass of symmetrically balancedsnow one was going vaguely to write in the first impulse but it is nothing of the sort whiteyes in a high degree and pure totally but not at all dazzling in the white nor pure in an insultingly rivalless manner as snow would be yet pure somehow certainly and white absolutely in spite of what might be thought failureimperfectionnay even distress and loss in it for every little rose of it has a green darkness in the centrenot even a pretty green but a faded yellowish glutinous unaccomplished green and round that all over the surface of the blossom whose shelllike petals are themselves deep sunk with grey shadows in the hollows of themall above this already subdued brightness are strewn the dark points of the dead stamensmanifest more and more the longer one looks as a kind of grey sand sprinkled without sparing over what looked at first unspotted light and in all the ways of it the lovely thing is more like the spring frock of some prudent little maid of fourteen than a flowerfrock with some little spotty pattern on it to keep it from showing an unintended and inadvertent spotif fate should ever inflict such a thing undeveloped thinks mr darwinthe poor 129 shortcoming illblanched thorn blossomgoing to be a rose some day soon and what nextwho knowsperhaps a pæony  3 then this next branch in dawn and delight of youth set with opening clusters of yet numerable blossom four and five and seven edged and islanded and ended by the sharp leaves of freshest green deepened under the flowers and studded round with bosses better than pearl beads of st agnes rosaryfolded over and over with the edges of their little leaves pouting as the very softest waves do on flat sand where one meets another then opening just enough to show the violet colour withinwhich yet isnt violet colour nor even meno che le rose but a different colour from every other lilac that one ever sawfaint and faded even before it sees light as the filmy cup opens over the depth of it then broken into purple motes of tired bloom fading into darkness as the cup extends into the perfect rose  this with all its sweet change that one would so fain stay and soft effulgence of bud into softly falling flower one has watchedhow often but always with the feeling that the blossoms are thrown over the green depth like white cloudsnever with any idea of so much as asking what holds the cloud there have each of the innumerable blossoms a separate stalk and if so how is it that one never thinks of the stalk as one does with currants  4 turn the side of the branch to younature never meant you to see it so but now it is all stalk below and 130 stamens abovethe petals nothing the stalks all tiny trees always dividing their branches mainly into threeone in the centre short and the two lateral long with an intermediate extremely long one if needed to fill a gap so contriving that the flowers shall all be nearly at the same level or at least surface of ball like a guelder rose but the cunning with which the tree conceals its structure till the blossom is fallen and thenfor a little while we had best look no more at it for it is all like grapestalks with no grapes  these whether carrying hawthorn blossom and haw or grape blossom and grape or peach blossom and peach you will simply call the stalk whether of flower or fruit a stalk is essentially round like a pillar and has for the most part the power of first developing and then shaking off flower and fruit from its extremities you can pull the peach from its stalk the cherry the grape always at some time of its existence the flowerstalk lets fall something of what it sustained petal or seed  in late latin it is called petiolus the little foot because the expanding piece that holds the grape or olive is a little like an animals foot modern botanists have misapplied the word to the leafstalk which has no resemblance to a foot at all we must keep the word to its proper meaning and when we want to write latin call it petiolus when we want to write english call it stalk meaning always fruit or flower stalk 131  i cannot find when the word stalk first appears in englishits derivation will be given presently  5 gather next a hawthorn leaf that also has a stalk but you cant shake the leaf off it it and the leaf are essentially one for the sustaining fibre runs up into every ripple or jag of the leafs edge and its section is different from that of the flowerstalk it is no more round but has an upper and under surface quite different from each other it will be better however to take a larger leaf to examine this structure in cabbage cauliflower or rhubarb would any of them be good but dont grow wild in the luxuriance i want so if you please we will take a leaf of burdock arctium lappa the principal business of that plant being clearly to grow leaves wherewith to adorn foregrounds35  illustration fig 13  6 the outline of it in sowerby is not an intelligent one and i have not time to draw it but in the rudest way myself fig 13 a with perspectives of the elementary form below b c and d by help of which if you will construct a burdock leaf in paper my rude outline a may tell the rest of what i want you to see  illustration fig 14  take a sheet of stout note paper fig 14 a double it sharply down the centre by the dotted line then give it the two cuts at a and b and double those pieces sharply back as at b then opening them again cut the whole 132 into the form c and then pulling up the corners c d stitch them together with a loose thread so that the points c and d shall be within half an inch of each other and you will have a kind of triangular scoop or shovel with a stem by which you can sufficiently hold it d  7 and from this easily constructed and tenable model you may learn at once these following main facts about all leaves 133  i that they are not flat but however slightly always hollowed into craters or raised into hills in one or another direction so that any drawable outline of them does not in the least represent the real extent of their surfaces and until you know how to draw a cup or a mountain rightly you have no chance of drawing a leaf my simple artist readers of long ago when i told them to draw leaves thought they could do them by the boughfull whenever they liked alas except by old william hunt and burne jones ive not seen a leaf painted since those burdocks of turners far less sculpturedthough one would think at first that was easier of which we shall have talk elsewhere here i must go on to note fact number two concerning leaves  134  8 ii the strength of their supporting stem consists not merely in the gathering together of all the fibres but in gathering them essentially into the profile of the letter v which you will see your doubled paper stem has and of which you can feel the strength and use in your hand as you hold it gather a common plantain leaf and look at the way it puts its round ribs together at the base and you will understand the matter at once the arrangement is modified and disguised in every possible way according to the leafs need in the aspen the leafstalk becomes an absolute vertical plank and in the large trees is often almost rounded into the likeness of a fruitstalkbut in all36 the essential structure is this doubled one and in all it opens at the place where the leaf joins the main stem into a kind of cup which holds next years bud in the hollow of it  9 now there would be no inconvenience in your simply getting into the habit of calling the round petiol of the fruit the stalk and the contracted channel of the leaf leafstalk but this way of naming them would not enforce nor fasten in your mind the difference between the two so well as if you have an entirely different name for the leafstalk which is the more desirable because the limiting character of the leaf botanically isi only learned this from my botanical friend the other day just 135 in the very moment i wanted itthat it holds the bud of the new stem in its own hollow but cannot itself grow in the hollow of anything elseor in botanical language leaves are never axillarydont grow in armpits but are themselves armpits hollows that is to say where they spring from the main stem  10 now there is already a received and useful botanical word cyme which we shall want in a little while derived from the greek greek kuma a swelling or rising wave and used to express a swelling cluster of foamy blossom connected with that word but in a sort the reverse of it you have the greek greek kumbê the hollow of a cup or bowl whence greek kumbalou a cymbalthat is to say a musical instrument owing its tone to its hollowness these words become in latin cymba and cymbalum and i think you will find it entirely convenient and advantageous to call the leafstalk distinctively the cymba retaining the mingled idea of cup and boat with respect at least to the part of it that holds the bud and understanding that it gathers itself into a vshaped or even narrowly vertical section as a boat narrows to its bow for strength to sustain the leaf  with this word you may learn the virgilian line that shows the final use of ironor irondarkenedships   et ferrugíneâ subvectat corpora cymbâ  the subvectat corpora will serve to remind you of the office of the leafy cymba in carrying the bud and make 136 you thankful that the said leafy vase is not of iron and is a ship of life instead of death  11 already not once nor twice i have had to use the word stem of the main round branch from which both stalk and cymba spring this word you had better keep for all growing or advancing shoots of trees whether from the ground or from central trunks and branches i regret that the words multiply on us but each that i permit myself to use has its own proper thought or idea to express as you will presently perceive so that true knowledge multiplies with true words  12 the stem you are to say then when you mean the advancing shootwhich lengthens annually while a stalk ends every year in a blossom and a cymba in a leaf a stem is essentially round37 square or regularly polygonal though as a cymba may become exceptionally round a stem may become exceptionally flat or even mimic the shape of a leaf indeed i should have liked to write a stem is essentially round and constructively on occasion squarebut it would have been too grand the fact is however that a stem is really a roundly minded thing throwing off its branches in circles as a trundled mop throws off drops though it can always order the branches to fly off in what order it likestwo at a time opposite to each other or three or five in a spiral coil or one here and one there on this side and that 137 but it is always twisting in its own inner mind and force hence it is especially proper to use the word stem of itgreek stemma a twined wreath properly twined round a staff or sceptre therefore learn at once by heart these lines in the opening iliad       greek stemmat echôn en chersin hekêbolou apollônos   greek chruseôi ana skêptrôi  and recollect that a sceptre is properly a staff to lean upon and that as a crown or diadem is first a binding thing a sceptre is first a supporting thing and it is in its nobleness itself made of the stem of a young tree you may just as well learn also this   greek nai ma tode skêptron to men oupote phulla kai ozous   greek phusei epeidê prôta tomên en oressi leloipen   greek oud anathêlêsei peri gar rha he chalkos elepse   greek phulla te kai phloion nun aute min huies achaiôn   greek en palamêis phoreousi dikaspoloi hoi te themistas   greek pros dios eiruatai   now by this sacred sceptre hear me swear   which never more shall leaves or blossoms bear   which severed from the trunk as i from thee   on the bare mountains left its parent tree   this sceptre formed by tempered steel to prove   an ensign of the delegates of jove   from whom the power of laws and justice springs   tremendous oath inviolate to kings  13 the supporting power in the tree itself is i doubt not greatly increased by this spiral action and the fine 138 instinct of its being so caused the twisted pillar to be used in the lombardic gothicat first merely as a pleasant variety of form but at last constructively and universally by giotto and all the architects of his school not that the spiral form actually adds to the strength of a lombardic pillar by imitating contortions of wood any more than the fluting of a doric shaft adds to its strength by imitating the canaliculation of a reed but the perfect action of the imagination which had adopted the encircling acanthus for the capital adopted the twining stemma for the shaft the pure delight of the eye being the first condition in either case and it is inconceivable how much of the pleasure taken both in ornament and in natural form is founded elementarily on groups of spiral line the study in our fifth plate of the involucre of the wastethistle38 is as good an example as i can give of the more subtle and concealed conditions of this structure  14 returning to our present business of nomenclature we find the greek word stemma adopted by the latins 139 becoming the expression of a growing and hereditary race and the branched tree the natural type among all nations of multiplied families hence the entire fitness of the word for our present purposes as signifying a spiral shoot extending itself by branches but since unless it is spiral it is not a stem and unless it has branches it is not a stem we shall still want another word for the sustaining sceptre of a foxglove or cowslip before determining that however we must see what need there may be of one familiar to our ears until lately although now i understand falling into disuse  15 by our definition a stem is a spirally bent essentially living and growing shoot of vegetation but the branch of a tree in which many such stems have their origin is not except in a very subtle and partial way spiral nor except in the shoots that spring from it progressive forwards it only receives increase of thickness at its sides much more what used to be called the trunk of a tree in which many branches are united has ceased to be except in mere tendency and temper spiral and has so far ceased from growing as to be often in a state of decay in its interior while the external layers are still in serviceable strength  16 if however a trunk were only to be defined as an arrested stem or a cluster of arrested stems we might perhaps refuse in scientific use the popular word but such a definition does not touch the main idea branches usually begin to assert themselves at a height above the 140 ground approximately fixed for each species of treelow in an oak high in a stone pine but in both marked as a point of structural change in the direction of growing force like the spring of a vault from a pillar and as the tree grows old some of its branches getting torn away by winds or falling under the weight of their own fruit or load of snow or by natural decay there remains literally a truncated mass of timber still bearing irregular branches here and there but inevitably suggestive of resemblance to a human body after the loss of some of its limbs  and to prepare trees for their practical service what age and storm only do partially the first rough process of human art does completely the branches are lopped away leaving literally the truncus as the part of the tree out of which log and rafter can be cut and in many trees it would appear to be the chief end of their being to produce this part of their body on a grand scale and of noble substance so that while in thinking of vegetable life without reference to its use to men or animals we should rightly say that the essence of it was in leaf and flowernot in trunk or fruit yet for the sake of animals we find that some plants like the vine are apparently meant chiefly to produce fruit others like laurels chiefly to produce leaves others chiefly to produce flowers and others to produce permanently serviceable and sculptural wood or in some cases merely picturesque and monumental masses of vegetable rock intertwisted 141 fibres serpentineof far nobler and more pathetic use in their places and their enduring age than ever they could be for material purpose in human habitation for this central mass of the vegetable organism then the english word trunk and french tronc are always in accurate scholarship to be retainedmeaning the part of a tree which remains when its branches are lopped away  17 we have now got distinct ideas of four different kinds of stem and simple names for them in latin and englishpetiolus cymba stemma and truncus stalk leafstalk stem and trunk and these are all that we shall commonly need there is however one more that will be sometimes necessary though it is ugly and difficult to pronounce and must be as little used as we can  and here i must ask you to learn with me a little piece of roman history i say to learn with me because i dont know any roman history except the two first books of livy and little bits here and there of the following six or seven i only just know enough about it to be able to make out the bearings and meaning of any fact that i now learn the greater number of modern historians know if honest enough even for that the facts or something that may possibly be like the facts but havent the least notion of the meaning of them so that though i have to find out everything that i want in smiths dictionary like any schoolboy i can usually tell you the 142 significance of what i so find better than perhaps even mr smith himself could  18 in the 586th page of mr smiths volume you have it written that calvus baldhead was the name of a family of the licinia gens that the man of whom we hear earliest as so named was the first plebeian elected to military tribuneship in bc 400 and that the fourth of whom we hear was surnamed stolo because he was so particular in pruning away the stolons stolones or useless young shoots of his vines  we must keep this word stolon therefore for these young suckers springing from an old root its derivation is uncertain but the main idea meant by it is one of uselessnesssprouting without occasion or fruit and the words stolidus and stolid are really its derivatives though we have lost their sense in english by partly confusing them with solid which they have nothing to do with a stolid person is essentially a useless sucker of society frequently very leafy and graceful but with no good in him  illustration fig 15  19 nevertheless i wont allow our vegetable stolons to be despised some of quite the most beautiful forms of leafage belong to themeven the foliage of the olive itself is never seen to the same perfection on the upper branches as in the young groundrods in which the dual groups of leaves crowd themselves in their haste into clusters of three  but for our point of latin history remember always 143 that in 400 bc just a year before the death of socrates at athens this family of stolid persons manifested themselves at rome shooting up from plebeian roots into places where they had no business and preparing the way for the degradation of the entire roman race under the empire their success being owed remember also to the faults of the patricians for one of the laws passed by calvus stolo was that the sibylline books should be in custody of ten men of whom five should be plebeian that no falsifications might be introduced in favour of the patricians  20 all this time however we have got no name for the prettiest of all stemsthat of annual flowers growing high from among their ground leaves like lilies of the valley and saxifrages and the tall primulasof which this pretty type fig 15 was cut for me by mr burgess years ago admirable in its light outline of the foamy globe of flowers supported and balanced in the meadow breezes on that elastic rod of slenderest life  what shall we call it we had better rest from our study of terms a little and do a piece of needful classifying before we try to name it  21 my younger readers will find it easy to learn and convenient to remember for a beginning of their science 144 the names of twelve great families of cinquefoiled flowers39 of which the first group of three is for the most part golden the second blue the third purple and the fourth red  and their names by simple lips can be pleasantly said or sung in this order the two first only being a little difficult to get over        1          2            3          4    rooffoil    lucy        pea       pink   rockfoil    bluebell   pansy     peach   primrose     bindweed    daisy     rose  which even in their latin magniloquence will not be too terrible namely       1           2           3            4    stella     lucia       alata       clarissa   francesca  campanula   viola       persica   primula    convoluta   margarita   rosa  22 i do not care much to assert or debate my reasons for the changes of nomenclature made in this list the 145 most gratuitous is that of lucy for gentian because the king of macedon from whom the flower has been so long named was by no means a person deserving of so consecrated memory i conceive no excuse needed for rejecting caryophyll one of the crudest and absurdest words ever coined by unscholarly men of science or papilionaceæ which is unendurably long for pease and when we are now writing latin in a sentimental temper and wish to say that we gathered a daisy we shall not any more be compelled to write that we gathered a bellidem perennem or an oculum diei  i take the pure latin form margarita instead of margareta in memory of margherita of cortona40 as well as of the great saint also the tiny scatterings and sparklings of the daisy on the turf may remind us of the old use of the word margaritæ for the minute particles of the host sprinkled on the patinahas particulas greek meridas vocat euchologium greek margaritas liturgia chrysostomi41 my young german readers will i hope call the flower gretschenunless they would uproot the daisies of the rhine lest french girls should also count their lovelots by the marguerite i must be so ungracious to my fair young readers however as to warn them that this trial of their lovers is a very favourable one for in nine blossoms out of 146 ten the leaves of the marguerite are odd so that if they are only gracious enough to begin with the supposition that he loves them they must needs end in the conviction of it  23 i am concerned however for the present only with my first or golden order of which the rooffoil or houseleek is called in present botany sedum the squatter because of its way of fastening itself down on stones or roof as close as it can sit but i think this an ungraceful notion of its behaviour and as its blossoms are of all flowers the most sharply and distinctly starshaped i shall call it stella providing otherwise in due time for the poor little chickweeds and the common stonecrop will therefore be stella domestica  the second tribe at present saxifraga growing for the most part wild on rocks may i trust even in protestant botany be named francesca after st francis of assisi not only for its modesty and love of mountain ground and poverty of colour and leaf but also because the chief element of its decoration seen close will be found in its spots or stigmata  in the nomenclature of the third order i make no change  24 now all this group of goldenblossoming plants agree in general character of having a rich cluster of radical leaves from which they throw up a single stalk bearing clustered blossoms for which stalk when entirely leafless i intend always to keep the term virgula the 147 little rodnot painfully caring about it but being able thus to define it with precision if required and these are connected with the stems of branching shrubs through infinite varieties of structure in which the first steps of transition are made by carrying the cluster of radical leaves up and letting them expire gradually from the rising stem the changes of form in the leaves as they rise higher from the ground being one of quite the most interesting specific studies in every plant i had set myself once in a byestudy for foreground drawing hard on this point and began with mr burgess a complete analysis of the foliation of annual stems of which linestudies ii iii and iv are examples reduced copies all from the beautiful flora danica but after giving two whole lovely long summer days under the giesbach to the blue scabious devils bit and getting in that time only halfway up it i gave in and must leave the work to happier and younger souls  25 for these flowering stems therefore possessing nearly all the complex organization of a tree but not its permanence we will keep the word virga and virgula for those that have no leaves i believe when we come to the study of leaforder it will be best to begin with these annual virgæ in which the leaf has nothing to do with preparation for a next years branch and now the remaining terms commonly applied to stems may be for the most part dispensed with but several are interesting and must be examined before dismissal 148  26 indeed in the first place the word we have to use so often stalk has not been got to the roots of yet it comes from the greek greek stelechos stelechos the holding part of a tree that which is like a handle to all its branches stock is another form in which it has come down to us with some notion of its being the mother of branches thus when athenas olive was burnt by the persians two days after a shoot a cubit long had sprung from the stelechos of it  27 secondly few words are more interesting to the modern scholarly and professorial mind than stipend i have twice a year at present to consider whether i am worth mine sent with compliments from the curators of the university chest now this word comes from stips small pay which itself comes from stipo to press together with the idea of small coin heaped up in little towers or piles but with the idea of lateral pressing together instead of downward we get stipes a solid log in greek with the same sense greek stupos stupos whence gradually with help from another word meaning to beat and a sideglance at beating of hemp we get our stupid the german stumph the scottish sumph and the plain english stump  refining on the more delicate sound of stipes the latins got stipula the thin stem of straw which rustles and ripples daintily in verse associated with spica and spiculum used of the sharp pointed ear of corn and its fine processes of fairy shafts 149  28 there are yet two more names of stalk to be studied though except for particular plants not needing to be usednamely the latin caudex and caulis both connected with the greek greek kaulos properly meaning a solid stalk like a handle passing into the sense of the hilt of a sword or quill of a pen then in latin caudex passes into the sense of log and so of cut plank or tablet of wood thus finally becoming the classical codex of writings engraved on such wooden tablets and therefore generally used for authoritative manuscripts  lastly caulis retained accurately in our cauliflower contracted in colewort and refined in kail softens itself into the french chou meaning properly the whole family of thickstalked eatable salads with spreading heads but these being distinguished explicitly by pliny as capitati salads with a head or captain salads the mediæval french softened the caulis capitatus into chou cabusor to separate the round or applelike mass of leaves from the flowery foam cabus simply by us at last enriched and emphasized into cabbage  29 i believe we have now got through the stiffest piece of etymology we shall have to master in the course of our botany but i am certain that young readers will find patient work in this kind well rewarded by the groups of connected thoughts which will thus attach themselves to familiar names and their grasp of every language they learn must only be esteemed by them secure when they recognize its derivatives in these homely associations 150 and are as much at ease with the latin or french syllables of a word as with the english ones this familiarity being above all things needful to cure our young students of their present ludicrous impression that what is simple in english is knowing in greek and that terms constructed out of a dead language will explain difficulties which remained insoluble in a living one but greek is not yet dead while if we carry our unscholarly nomenclature much further english soon will be and then doubtless botanical gentlemen at athens will for some time think it fine to describe what we used to call caryophyllaceæ as the greek hedlêphides  30 for indeed we are all of us yet but schoolboys clumsily using alike our lips and brains and with all our mastery of instruments and patience of attention but few have reached and those dimly the first level of sciencewonder  for the first instinct of the stemunnamed by us yetunthought ofthe instinct of seeking light as of the root to seek darknesswhat words can enough speak the wonder of it  look here is the little thing linestudy v a in its first birth to us the stem of stems the one of which we pray that it may bear our daily bread the seed has fallen in the ground with the springing germ of it downwards with heavenly cunning the taught stem curls round and seeks the neverseen light veritable conversion miraculous called of god and here is the oat 151 germ bafter the wheat most vital of divine gifts and assuredly in days to come fated to grow on many a naked rock in hitherto lifeless lands over which the glancing sheaves of it will shake sweet treasure of innocent gold  and who shall tell us how they grow and the fashion of their rustling pillarsbent and again erect at every breeze fluted shaft or clustered pier how poor of art beside this grassshaftbuilt first to sustain the food of men then to be strewn under their feet  we must not stay to think of it yet or we shall get no farther till harvest has come and gone again and having our names of stems now determined enough we must in next chapter try a little to understand the different kinds of them  the following notes among many kindly sent me on the subject of scottish heraldry seem to be the most trustworthy      the earliest known mention of the thistle as the national badge of     scotland is in the inventory of the effects of james iii who probably     adopted it as an appropriate illustration of the royal motto in     defence      thistles occur on the coins of james iv mary james v and james     vi and on those of james vi they are for the first time accompanied     by the motto nemo me impune lacesset      a collar of thistles appears on the gold bonnetpieces of james v of     1539 and the royal ensigns as depicted in sir david lindsays     armorial register of 1542 are surrounded by a collar formed entirely     of golden thistles with an oval badge attached 152      this collar however was a mere device until the institution or as     it is generally but inaccurately called the revival of the order of     the thistle by james vii ii of england which took place on may 29     1687      date of james iiis reign 14601488                                       153  chapter ix  outside and in  1 the elementary study of methods of growth given in the following chapter has been many years written the greater part soon after the fourth volume of modern painters and ought now to be rewritten entirely but having no time to do this i leave it with only a word or two of modification because some truth and clearness of incipient notion will be conveyed by it to young readers from which i can afterwards lop the errors and into which i can graft the finer facts better than if i had a less blunt embryo to begin with  illustration fig 16  illustration fig 17  2 a stem then broadly speaking i had thus began the old chapter is the channel of communication between the leaf and root and if the leaf can grow directly from the root there is no stem so that it is well first to conceive of all plants as consisting of leaves and roots only with the condition that each leaf must have its own quite particular root42 somewhere 154 let a b c fig 16 be three leaves each as you see with its own root and by no means dependent on other leaves for its daily bread and let the horizontal line be the surface of the ground then the plant has no stem or an underground one but if the three leaves rise above the ground as in fig 17 they must reach their roots by elongating their stalks and this elongation is the stem of the plant if the outside leaves grow last and are therefore youngest the plant is said to grow from the outside you know that ex means out and that gen is the first syllable of genesis or creation therefore the old botanists putting an o between the two syllables called plants whose outside leaves grew last exogens if the inside leaf grows last and is youngest the plant was said to grow from the inside and from the greek endon within called an endogen if these names are persisted in the greek botanists to return the compliment will of course call endogens greek inseidbornides and exogens greek houtseidbornides in the oxford school they will be called simply inlaid and outlaid  illustration fig 18  3 you see that if the outside leaves are to grow last they may conveniently grow two at a time which they accordingly do and exogens always start with two little 155 leaves from their roots and may therefore conveniently be called twoleaved which if you please we will for our parts call them the botanists call them twosuckered and cant be content to call them that in english but drag in a long greek word meaning the fleshy sucker of the seadevilcotyledon which however i find is practically getting shortened into cot and that they will have to end by calling endogens monocots and exogens bicots i mean steadily to call them oneleaved and twoleaved for this further reason that they differ not merely in the single or dual springing of first leaves from the seed but in the distinctly single or dual arrangement of leaves afterwards on the stem so that through all the complexity obtained by alternate and spiral placing every bicot or twoleaved flower or tree is in reality composed of dual groups of leaves separated by a given length of stem as most characteristically in this pure mountain type of the ragged robin clarissa laciniosa fig 18 and compare a and b linestudy ii while on the other hand the monocot plants are by close analysis i think always resolvable into successively climbing leaves sessile on one another and sending their roots 156 or processes for nourishment down through one another as in fig 19  illustration fig 19  4 not that i am yet clear at all myself but i do think its more the botanists fault than mine what cotyledonous structure there may be at the outer base of each successive bud and still less how the intervenient length of stem in the bicots is related to their power or law of branching for not only the twoleaved tree is outlaid and the oneleaved inlaid but the twoleaved tree is branched and the oneleaved tree is not branched this is a most vital and important distinction which i state to you in very bold terms for though there are some apparent exceptions to the law there are i believe no real ones if we define a branch rightly thus the head of a palm tree is merely a cluster of large leaves and the spike of a grass a clustered blossom the stem in both is unbranched and we should be able in this respect to classify plants very simply indeed but for a provoking species of intermediate creatures whose branching is always in the manner of corals or sponges or arborescent minerals irregular and accidental and essentially therefore distinguished from the systematic anatomy of a truly branched tree of these presently we must go on by very short steps and i find no step can be taken without check from existing generalizations sowerbys definition of monocotyledons in his ninth volume begins thus herbs or rarely and only in exotic genera trees in which the wood pith and bark are indistinguishable 157 now if there be one plant more than another in which the pith is defined it is the common rush while the nobler families of true herbs derive their principal character from being pithless altogether we cannot advance too slowly  5 in the families of oneleaved plants in which the young leaves grow directly out of the old ones it becomes a grave question for them whether the old ones are to lie flat or edgeways and whether they must therefore grow out of their faces or their edges and we must at once understand the way they contrive it in either case  illustration fig 20  among the many forms taken by the arethusan leaf one of the commonest is long and gradually taperingmuch broader at the base than the point we will take such an one for examination and suppose that it is growing on the ground as in fig 20 with a root to its every fibre cut out a piece of strong paper roughly into the shape of this arethusan leaf a fig 21 now suppose the next young leaf has to spring out of the front of this one at about the middle of its height give it two nicks with the scissors at b b then roll up the lower part into a cylinder it will overlap a good deal at the bottom and tie it fast with a fine thread so you will get the form at c then bend the top of it back so that seen sideways it appears as at d and you see you have made quite a little flowerpot to plant your 158 new leaf in and perhaps it may occur to you that you have seen something like this before now make another a little less wide but with the part for the cylinder twice as long roll it up in the same way and slip it inside the other with the flat part turned the other way e surely this reminds you now of something you have seen or must i draw the something fig 22  illustration fig 21  6 all grasses are thus constructed and have their leaves set thus opposite on the sides of their tubular stems alternately as they ascend but in most of them there is also a peculiar construction by which at the base of the sheath or enclosing tube each leaf articulates itself with the rest of the stem at a ringed knot or joint 159  illustration fig 22  before examining these remember there are mainly two sorts of joints in the framework of the bodies of animals one is that in which the bone is thick at the joints and thin between them see the bone of the next chicken leg you eat the other is that of animals that have shells or horny coats in which characteristically the shell is thin at the joints and thick between them look at the next lobsters claw you can see without eating you know also that though the crustaceous are titled only from their crusts the name insect is given to the whole insect tribe because they are farther jointed almost into sections it is easily remembered also that the projecting joint means strength and elasticity in the creature and that all its limbs are useful to it and cannot conveniently be parted with and that the incised sectional or insectile joint means more or less weakness43 and necklacelike laxity or license in the creatures make and an ignoble power of shaking off its legs or arms on occasion coupled also with modes of growth involving occasionally quite astonishing transformations and beginnings of new life under new circumstances so that until very lately no mortal knew what a crab was like in its youth the very existence 160 of the creature as well as its legs being jointed as it were and made in separate pieces with the narrowest possible thread of connection between them and its principal or stomachic period of life connected with its sentimental period by as thin a thread as a wasps stomach is with its thorax  7 now in plants as in animals there are just the same opposed aspects of joint with this specialty of difference in function that the animals limb bends at the joints but the vegetable limb stiffens and when the articulation projects as in the joint of a cane it means not only that the strength of the plant is well carried through the junction but is carried farther and more safely than it could be without it a cane is stronger and can stand higher than it could otherwise because of its joints also this structure implies that the plant has a will of its own and a position which on the whole it will keep however it may now and then be bent out of it and that it has a continual battle of a healthy and humanlike kind to wage with surrounding elements  but the crabby or insectlike joint which you get in seaweeds and cacti means either that the plant is to be dragged and wagged here and there at the will of waves and to have no spring nor mind of its own or else that it has at least no springy intention and elasticity of purpose but only a knobby knotty prickly malignant stubbornness and incoherent opiniativeness crawling about and coggling and grovelling and aggregating 161 anyhow like the minds of so many people whom one knows  8 returning then to our grasses in which the real rooting and junction of the leaves with each other is at these joints we find that therefore every leaf of grass may be thought of as consisting of two main parts for which we shall want two separate names the lowest part which wraps itself round to become strong we will call the staff and for the freefloating outer part we will take specially the name given at present carelessly to a large number of the plants themselves flag this will give a more clear meaning to the words rod virga and staff baculus when they occur together as in the 23rd psalm and remember the distinction is that a rod bends like a switch but a staff is stiff i keep the wellknown name blade for grassleaves in their fresh green state  9 you felt as you were bending down the paper into the form d fig 21 the difficulty and awkwardness of the transition from the tubular form of the staff to the flat one of the flag the mode in which this change is effected is one of the most interesting features in plants for you will find presently that the leafstalk in ordinary leaves is only a means of accomplishing the same change from round to flat but you know i said just now that some leaves were not flat but set upright edgeways it is not a common position in twoleaved trees but if you can run out and look at an arbor vitæ it may interest you 162 to see its hatchetshaped vertically crested cluster of leaves transforming themselves gradually downwards into branches and in oneleaved trees the vertically edged group is of great importance  illustration fig 23  10 cut out another piece of paper like a in fig 21 but now instead of merely giving it nicks at a b cut it into the shape a fig 23 roll the lower part up as before but instead of pulling the upper part down pinch its back at the dotted line and bring the two points a and b forward so that they may touch each other b shows the look of the thing halfdone before the points a and b have quite met pinch them close and stitch the two edges neatly together all the way from a to the point c then roll and tie up the lower part as before you will find then that the back or spinal line of the whole leaf is bent forward as at b now go out to the garden and gather the green leaf of a fleurdelys and look at it and your piece of disciplined paper together and i fancy you will probably find out several things for yourself that i want you to know  11 you see for one thing at once how strong the fleurdelys leaf is and that it is just twice as strong as a blade of grass for it is the substance of the staff with its sides flattened together while the grass blade is a staff cut 163 open and flattened out and you see that as a grass blade necessarily flaps down the fleurdelys leaf as necessarily curves up owing to that inevitable bend in its back and you see with its keen edge and long curve and sharp point how like a sword it is the botanists would for once have given a really good and right name to the plants which have this kind of leaf ensatæ from the latin ensis a sword if only sata had been properly formed from sis we cant let the rude latin stand but you may remember that the fleurdelys which is the flower of chivalry has a sword for its leaf and a lily for its heart  12 in case you cannot gather a fleurdelys leaf i have drawn for you in plate vi a cluster of such leaves which are as pretty as any and so small that missing the points of a few i can draw them of their actual size you see the pretty alternate interlacing at the bottom and if you can draw at all and will try to outline their curves you will find what subtle lines they are i did not know this name for the strongedged grass leaves when i wrote the pieces about shield and sword leaves in modern painters i wish i had chanced in those passages on some other similitude but i cant alter them now and my trustful pupils may avoid all confusion of thought by putting gladius for ensis and translating it by the word scymitar which is also more accurate in expressing the curvature blade so we will call the ensatæ instead gladiolæ translating scymitargrasses and having 164 now got at some clear idea of the distinction between outlaid and inlaid growth in the stem the reader will find the elementary analysis of forms resulting from outlaid growth in modern painters and i mean to republish it in the sequel of this book but must go on to other matters here the growth of the inlaid stem we will follow as far as we need for english plants in examining the glasses  florence 11th september 1874  as i correct this chapter for press i find it is too imperfect to be let go without a word or two more in the first place i have not enough in distinguishing the nature of the living yearly shoot with its cluster of fresh leafage from that of the accumulated mass of perennial trees taken notice of the similar power even of the annual shoot to obtain some manner of immortality for itself or at least of usefulness after death a tuscan woman stopped me on the path up to fiesole last night to beg me to buy her plaited straw i wonder how long straw lasts if one takes care of it a leghorn bonnet if now such things are carefully put awayeven properly taken care of when it is wornhow long will it last young ladies  i have just been reading the fifth chapter of ii esdras and am fain to say with less discomfort than otherwise i might have felt the example being set me by the archangel uriel i am not sent to tell thee for i do not know how old is the oldest straw known the oldest 165 linen the oldest hemp we have mummy wheatcloth of papyrus which is a kind of straw the paper reeds by the brooks the flaxflower in the field leave such imperishable frame behind them and pontedellapaglia in venice and straw street of paris remembered in heaventhere is no occasion to change their names as one may have to change waterloo bridge or the rue de limpératrice poor empress had she but known that her true dominion was in the straw streets of her fields not in the stone streets of her cities  but think how wonderful this imperishableness of the stem of many plants is even in their annual work how much more in their perennial work the noble stability between death and life of a piece of perfect wood it cannot grow but will not decay keeps record of its years of life but surrenders them to become a constantly serviceable thing which may be sailed in on the sea built with on the land carved by donatello painted on by fra angelico and it is not the woods fault but the fault of florence in not taking proper care of it that the panel of sandro botticellis loveliest picture has cracked not with heat i believe but blighting frost a quarter of an inch wide through the madonnas face  but what is this strange state of undecaying wood what sort of latent life has it which it only finally parts with when it rots  nay what is the law by which its natural life is measured what makes a tree old one sees the 166 spanishchesnut trunks among the apennines growing into caves instead of logs vast hollows confused among the recessed darknesses of the marble crags surrounded by mere laths of living stem each with its coronal of glorious green leaves why cant the tree go on and onhollowing itself into a fairynoa dryad ringtill it becomes a perfect stonehenge of a tree truly i am not sent to tell thee for i do not know  the worst of it is however that i dont know one thing which i ought very thoroughly to have known at least thirty years ago namely the true difference in the way of building the trunk in outlaid and inlaid wood i have an idea that the stem of a palmtree is only a heap of leafroots built up like a tower of bricks year by year and that the palm tree really grows on the top of it like a bunch of fern but ive no books here and no time to read them if i had if only i were a strong giant instead of a thin old gentleman of fiftyfive how i should like to pull up one of those little palmtrees by the rootsby the way what are the roots of a palm like and how does it stand in sand where it is wanted to stand mostly fancy not knowing that at fiftyfivethat grow all along the riviera and snap its stem in two and cut it down the middle but i suppose there are sections enough now in our grand botanical collections and you can find it all out for yourself that you should be able to ask a question clearly is twothirds of the way to getting it answered and i think this chapter of mine will at 167 least enable you to ask some questions about the stem though what a stem is truly i am not sent to tell thee for i do not know  knaresborough 30th april 1876  i see by the date of last paragraph that this chapter has been in my good aylesbury printers type for more than a year and a half at this rate proserpina has a distant chance of being finished in the spiritland with more accurate information derived from the archangel uriel himself not that he is likely to know much about the matter if he keeps on letting himself be prevented from ever seeing foliage in springtime by the black demonwinds about the year 2000 in the meantime feeling that perhaps i am sent to tell my readers a little more than is above told i have had recourse to my botanical friend good mr oliver of kew who has taught me first of palms that they actually stitch themselves into the ground with a long dipping loop up and down of the root fibres concerning which sempstresswork i shall have a months puzzlement before i can report on it secondly that all the increment of tree stem is by division and multiplication of the cells of the wood a process not in the least to be described as sending down roots from the leaf to the ground i suspected as much in beginning to revise this chapter but hold to my judgment in not cancelling it for this multiplication of the cells is at least compelled by an influence which passes from the leaf to the ground and vice versa and which is at present best 168 conceivable to me by imagining the continual and invisible descent of lightning from electric cloud by a conducting rod endowed with the power of softly splitting the rod into two rods each as thick as the original one studying microscopically we should then see the molecules of copper as we see the cells of the wood dividing and increasing each one of them into two but the visible result and mechanical conditions of growth would still be the same as if the leaf actually sent down a new root fibre and more than this the currents of accumulating substance marked by the grain of the wood are i think quite plainly and absolutely those of streams flowing only from the leaves downwards never from the root up nor of mere lateral increase i must look over all my drawings again and at tree stems again with more separate study of the bark and pith in those museum sections before i can assert this but there will be no real difficulty in the investigation if the increase of the wood is lateral only the currents round the knots will be compressed at the sides and open above and below but if downwards compressed above the knot and open below it the nature of the force itself and the manner of its ordinances in direction remain and must for ever remain inscrutable as our own passions in

language or the origin of unfinished in the imitation of natural sounds but such collections give an entirely false idea of the real power of language unless they are balanced by an opponent list of the words which signally fail of any such imitative virtue and whose sound if one dwelt upon it is destructive of their meaning  2 for instance few sounds are more distinct in their kind or one would think more likely to be vocally reproduced in the word which signified them than that of a swift rent in strongly woven cloth and the english word rag and ragged with the greek greek rhêgnumi do indeed in a measure recall the tormenting effect upon the ear but it is curious that the verb which is meant to express the actual origination of rags should rhyme with two words entirely musical and peacefulwords indeed which i always reserve for final resource in passages which i want to be soothing as well as prettyfair and 171 air while in its orthography it is identical with the word representing the bodily sign of tenderest passion and grouped with a multitude of others44 in which the mere insertion of a consonant makes such wide difference of sentiment as between dear and drear or pear and spear the greek root on the other hand has persisted in retaining some vestige of its excellent dissonance even where it has parted with the last vestige of the idea it was meant to convey

will ye go   to the birks of aberfeldy  he certainly had little thought that the delicately crisp final k in birk was the remnant of a magnificent greek effort to express the rending of the earth by earthquake in the wars of the giants in the middle of that word esmaragese we get our own beggars rag for a pure root which afterwards through the latin frango softens into our break and barkthe broken thing that idea of its rending around the trees stem having been in the very earliest human efforts at botanical description 172 attached to it by the pure aryan race watching the strips of rosy satin break from the birch stems in the aberfeldys of imaus  3 that this tree should have been the only one which the aryans coming as conquerors from the north were able to recognize in hindustan45 and should therefore also be the only one whose name is common to sanskrit and to the languages of europe delighted me greatly for two reasons the first for its proof that in spite of the development of species the sweet gleaming of birch stem has never changed its argent and sable for any unchequered heraldry and the second that it gave proof of a much more important fact the keenly accurate observation of aryan foresters at that early date for the fact is that the breaking of the thinbeaten silver of the birch trunk is so delicate and its smoothness so graceful that until i painted it with care i was not altogether clearheaded myself about the way in which the chequering was done nor until fors today brought me to the house of one of my fathers friends at carshalton and gave me three birch stems to look at just outside the window did i perceive it to be a primal question about them what it is that blanches that dainty dress of theirs or anticipatorily weaves what difference is there between the making of the corky excrescence of other 173 trees and of this almost transparent fine white linen i perceive that the older it is within limits the finer and whiter hoary tissue instead of hoary hairhonouring the trees aged body the outer sprays have no silvery light on their youth does the membrane thin itself into whiteness merely by stretching or produce an outer film of new substance46  4 and secondly this investiture why is it transverse to the trunkswathing it as it were in bands above allwhen it breakswhy does it break round the tree instead of down all other bark breaks as anything would naturally round a swelling rod but this as if the stem were growing longer until indeed it reaches farthest heroic old age when the whiteness passes away again and the rending is like that of other trees downwards so that as it were in a changing language we have the great botanical fact twice taught us by this tree of eden that the skins of trees differ from the skins of the higher animals in that for the most part they wont stretch and must be worn torn  so that in fact the most popular arrangement of vegetative adult costume is irish a normal investiture in honourable rags and decorousness of tattering as of a banner borne in splendid ruin through storms of war  5 now therefore if we think of it we have five 174 distinct orders of investiture for organic creatures first mere secretion of mineral substance chiefly lime into a hard shell which if broken can only be mended like chinaby sticking it together secondly organic substance of armour which grows into its proper shape at once for good and all and cant be mended at all if broken as of insects thirdly organic substance of skin which stretches as the creatures grows by cracking over a fresh skin which is supplied beneath it as in bark of trees fourthly organic substance of skin cracked symmetrically into plates or scales which can increase all round their edges and are connected by softer skin below as in fish and reptiles divided with exquisite lustre and flexibility in feathers of birds and lastly true elastic skin extended in soft unison with the creatures growthblushing with its blood fading with its fear breathing with its breath and guarding its life with sentinel beneficence of pain  6 it is notable in this higher and lower range of organic beauty that the decoration by pattern and colour which is almost universal in the protective coverings of the middle ranks of animals should be reserved in vegetables for the most living part of them the flower only and that among animals few but the malignant and senseless are permitted in the corrugation of their armour to resemble the halfdead trunk of the tree as they float beside it in the tropical river i must however leave the scale patterns of the palms and other inlaid tropical 175 stems for afterexaminationcontent at present with the general idea of the bark of an outlaid tree as the successive accumulation of the annual protecting film rent into ravines of slowly increasing depth and coloured like the rock whose stability it begins to emulate with the grey or gold of clinging lichen and embroidering moss                                       176  chapter xi  genealogy  1 returning after more than a years sorrowful interval to my sicilian fieldsnot incognisant now of some of the darker realms of proserpina and with feebler heart and it may be feebler wits for wandering in her brighter onesi find what i had written by way of sequel to the last chapter somewhat difficult and extremely tiresome not the less after giving fair notice of the difficulty and asking due pardon for the tiresomeness i am minded to let it stand trusting to end with it once for all investigations of the kind but in finishing this first volume of my school botany i must try to give the reader some notion of the plan of the book as it now during the time for thinking over it which illness left me has got itself arranged in my mind within limits of possible execution and this the rather because i wish also to state somewhat more gravely than i have yet done the grounds on which i venture here to reject many of the received names of plants and to substitute others for them relating to entirely different attributes 177 from those on which their present nomenclature is confusedly edified  i have already in some measure given the reasons for this change47 but i feel that for the sake of those among my scholars who have laboriously learned the accepted names i ought now also to explain its method more completely  2 i call the present system of nomenclature confusedly edified because it introduceswithout apparently any consciousness of the inconsistency and certainly with no apology for itnames founded sometimes on the history of plants sometimes on their qualities sometimes on their forms sometimes on their products and sometimes on their poetical associations  on their historyas gentian from king gentius and funkia from dr funk  on their qualitiesas scrophularia from its quite uncertified use in scrofula  on their formsas the caryophylls from having petals like husks of nuts  on their productsas cocos nucifera from its nuts  and on their poetical associationsas the star of bethlehem from its imagined resemblance to the light of that seen by the magi  3 now this variety of grounds for nomenclature might patiently and even with advantage be permitted 178 provided the grounds themselves were separately firm and the inconsistency of method advisedly allowed and in each case justified if the histories of king gentius and dr funk are indeed important branches of human knowledgeif the scrophulariaceæ do indeed cure kings evilif pinks be best described in their likeness to nutsand the star of bethlehem verily remind us of christs nativityby all means let these and other such names be evermore retained but if dr funk be not a person in any special manner needing either stellification or florification if neither herb nor flower can avail more than the touch of monarchs against hereditary pain if it be no better account of a pink to say it is nutleaved than of a nut to say it is pinkleaved and if the modern mind incurious respecting the journeys of wise men has already confused in its bradshaws bible the station of bethlehem with that of bethel48 it is certainly time to take some order with the partly false partly useless and partly forgotten literature of the fields and before we bow our childrens memories to the burden of it ensure that there shall be matter worth carriage in the load  4 and farther in attempting such a change we must be clear in our own minds whether we wish our nomenclature to tell us something about the plant itself or only to tell us the place it holds in relation to other plants as for instance in the herbrobert would it be well to 179 christen it shortly rob roy because it is preeminently red and so have done with itor rather to dwell on its family connections and call it macgregoraceous  5 before we can wisely decide this point we must resolve whether our botany is intended mainly to be useful to the vulgar or satisfactory to the scientific élite for if we give names characterizing individuals the circle of plants which any country possesses may be easily made known to the children who live in it but if we give names founded on the connexion between these and others at the antipodes the parish schoolmaster will certainly have double work and it may be doubted greatly whether the parish schoolboy at the end of the lecture will have half as many ideas  6 nevertheless when the features of any great order of plants are constant and on the whole represented with great clearness both in cold and warm climates it may be desirable to express this their citizenship of the world in definite nomenclature but my own method so far as hitherto developed consists essentially in fastening the thoughts of the pupil on the special character of the plant in the place where he is likely to see it and therefore in expressing the power of its race and order in the wider world rather by reference to mythological associations than to botanical structure  7 for instance plate vii represents of its real size an ordinary spring flower in our english mountain fields it is an average examplenot one of rare size under rare 180 conditionsrather smaller than the average indeed that i might get it well into my plate it is one of the flowers whose names i think good to change but i look carefully through the existing titles belonging to it and its fellows that i may keep all i expediently can i find in the first place that linnæus called one group of its relations ophryds from ophrysgreek for the eyebrowon account of their resemblance to the brow of an animal frowning or to the overshadowing casque of a helmet i perceive this to be really a very general aspect of the flower and therefore no less than in respect to linnæus i adopt this for the total name of the order and call them ophrydæ or shortly ophryds  8 secondly so far as i know these flowers myself i perceive them to fall practically into three divisionsone growing in english meadows and alpine pastures and always adding to their beauty another growing in all sorts of places very ugly itself and adding to the ugliness of its indiscriminated haunts and a third growing mostly up in the air with as little root as possible and of gracefully fantastic forms such as this kind of nativity and habitation might presuppose for the present i am satisfied to give names to these three groups only there may be plenty of others which i do not know and which other people may name according to their knowledge but in all these three kinds known to me i perceive one constant characteristic to be some manner of distortion and i desire that factmarking a 181 spiritual in my sense of the word character of extreme mysteryto be the first enforced on the mind of the young learner it is exhibited to the english child primarily in the form of the stalk of each flower attaching it to the central virga this stalk is always twisted once and a half round as if somebody had been trying to wring the blossom off and the name of the family in proserpina will therefore be contorta49 in latin and wreathewort in english  farther the beautiful power of the one i have drawn in its spring life is in the opposition of its dark purple to the primrose in england and the pale yellow anemone in the alps and its individual name will be therefore contorta purpureapurple wreathewort  and in drawing it i take care to dwell on this strength of its color and to show thoroughly that it is a dark blossom50 before i trouble myself about its minor characters  9 the second group of this kind of flowers live as i said in all sorts of places but mostly i think in disagreeable onestorn and irregular ground under alternations of unwholesome heat and shade and among swarms of nasty insects i cannot yet venture on any bold general statement about them but i think that is mostly their way and at all events they themselves are in the 182 habit of dressing in livid and unpleasant colors and are distinguished from all other flowers by twisting not only their stalks but one of their petals not once and a half only but two or three times round and putting it far out at the same time as a foul jester would put out his tongue while also the singular power of grotesque mimicry which though strong also in the other groups of their race seems in the others more or less playful is in these definitely degraded and in aspect malicious  10 now i find the latin name satyrium attached already to one sort of these flowers and we cannot possibly have a better one for all of them it is true that in its first greek form dioscorides attaches it to a white not a livid flower and i dare say there are some white ones of the breed but in its full sense the term is exactly right for the entire group of ugly blossoms of which the characteristic is the spiral curve and protraction of their central petal and every other form of satyric ugliness which i find among the ophryds whatever its color will be grouped with them and i make them central because this humour runs through the whole order and is indeed their distinguishing sign  11 then the third group living actually in the air and only holding fast by without nourishing itself from the ground rock or treetrunk on which it is rooted may of course most naturally and accurately be called aeria as it has long been popularly known in english by the name of airplant 183  thus we have one general name for all these creatures ophryd and three family or group names contorta satyrium and aeriaevery one of these titles containing as much accurate fact about the thing named as i can possibly get packed into their syllables and i will trouble my young readers with no more divisions of the order and if their parents tutors or governors after this fair warning choose to make them learn instead the seventyseven different names with which botanistheraldries have beautifully ennobled the familyall i can say is let them at least begin by learning them themselves they will be found in due order in pages 1084 1085 of loudons cyclopædia51  12 but now farther the student will observe that the name of the total order is greek while the three family ones are latin although the central one is originally greek also  i adopt this as far as possible for a law through my whole plant nomenclature  13 farther the terminations of the latin family names will be for the most part of the masculine 184 feminine and neuter forms us a um with these following attached conditions  i those terminating in us though often of feminine words as the central arbor will indicate either real masculine strength quereus laurus or conditions of dominant majesty cedrus of stubbornness and enduring force crataegus or of peasantlike commonalty and hardship juncus softened as it may sometimes happen into gentleness and beneficence thymus the occasional forms in er and il will have similar power acer basil  ii names with the feminine termination a if they are real names of girls will always mean flowers that are perfectly pretty and perfectly good lucia viola margarita clarissa names terminating in a which are not also accepted names of girls may sometimes be none the less honourable primula campanula but for the most part will signify either plants that are only good and worthy in a nursy sort of way salvia or that are good without being pretty lavandula or pretty without being good kalmia but no name terminating in a will be attached to a plant that is neither good nor pretty  iii the neuter names terminating in um will always indicate some power either of active or suggestive evil conîum solanum satyrium or a relation more or less definite to death but this relation to death may sometimes be noble or patheticwhich 185 today is and tomorrow is cast into the ovenlilium  but the leading position of these neuters in the plants double name must be noticed by students unacquainted with latin in order to distinguish them from plural genitives which will always of course be the second word francesca fontium francesca of the springs  14 names terminating in is and e if definitely names of women iris amaryllis alcestis daphne will always signify flowers of great beauty and noble historic association if not definitely names of women they will yet indicate some specialty of sensitiveness or association with legend berberis clematis no neuters in e will be admitted  15 participial terminations impatiens with neuters in en cyclamen will always be descriptive of some special quality or formleaving it indeterminate if good or bad until explained it will be manifestly impossible to limit either these neuters or the feminines in is to latin forms but we shall always know by their termination that they cannot be generic names if we are strict in forming these last on a given method  16 how little method there is in our present formation of them i am myself more and more surprised as i consider a child is shown a rose and told that he is to call every flower like that rosaceous52 he is next 186 shown a lily and told that he is to call every flower like that liliaceousso far well but he is next shown a daisy and is not at all allowed to call every flower like that daisaceous but he must call it like the fifth order of architecture composite and being next shown a pink he is not allowed to call other pinks pinkaceous but nutleafed and being next shown a peaseblossom he is not allowed to call other peaseblossoms peasaceous but in a brilliant burst of botanical imagination he is incited to call it by two names instead of one butterflyaceous from its flower and podaceous from its seedthe inconsistency of the terms thus enforced upon him being perfected in their inaccuracy for a daisy is not one whit more composite than queen of the meadow or jura jacinth53 and legumen is not latin for a pod but siliquaso that no good scholar could remember virgils siliqua quassante legumen without overthrowing all his pisan nomenclature  17 farther if we ground our names of the higher orders on the distinctive characters of form in plants these are so many and so subtle that we are at once involved in more investigations than a young learner has ever time to follow successfully and they must be at all times liable to dislocations and rearrangements on the discovery of any new link in the infinitely entangled 187 chain but if we found our higher nomenclature at once on historic fact and relative conditions of climate and character rather than of form we may at once distribute our flora into unalterable groups to which we may add at our pleasure but which will never need disturbance far less reconstruction  18 for instanceand to beginit is an historical fact that for many centuries the english nation believed that the founder of its religion spiritually by the mouth of the king who spake of all herbs had likened himself to two flowersthe rose of sharon and lily of the valley the fact of this belief is one of the most important in the history of englandthat is to say of the mind or heart of england and it is connected solemnly with the heart of italy also by the closing cantos of the paradiso  i think it well therefore that our two first generic or at least commandant names heading the outlaid and inlaid divisions of plants should be of the rose and lily with such meaning in them as may remind us of this fact in the history of human mind  it is also historical that the personal appearing of this master of our religion was spoken of by our chief religious teacher in these terms the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared unto all men and it is a constant fact that this grace or favor of god is spoken of as giving us to eat of the tree of life  19 now comparing the botanical facts i have to express with these historical ones i find that the rose tribe 188 has been formed among flowers not in distant and monstrous geologic æras but in the human epochthat its grace or favor has been in all countries so felt as to cause its acceptance everywhere for the most perfect physical type of womanhoodand that the characteristic fruit of the tribe is so sweet that it has become symbolic at once of the subtlest temptation and the kindest ministry to the earthly passion of the human race comfort me with apples for i am sick of love  20 therefore i shall call the entire order of these flowers charites graces and they will be divided into these five genera rosa persica pomum rubra and fragaria which sequence of names i do not think the young learner will have difficulty in remembering nor in understanding why i distinguish the central group by the fruit instead of the flower and if he once clearly master the structure and relations of these five genera he will have no difficulty in attaching to them in a satellitic or subordinate manner such inferior groups as that of the silverweed or the tormentilla but all he will have to learn by heart and rote will be these six names the greek mastername charites and the five generic names in each case belonging to plants as he will soon find of extreme personal interest to him  21 i have used the word order as the name of our widest groups in preference to class because these widest groups will not always include flowers like each other in form or equal to each other in vegetative rank 189 but they will be orders literally like those of any religious or chivalric association having some common link rather intellectual than nationalthe charites for instance linked by their kindnessthe oreiades by their mountain seclusion as sisters of charity or monks of the chartreuse irrespective of ties of relationship then beneath these orders will come what may be rightly called either as above in greek derivation genera or in latin gentes for which however i choose the latin word because genus is disagreeably liable to be confused on the ear with genius but gens never and also nomen gentile is a clearer and better expression than nomen generosum and i will not coin the barbarous one genericum the name of the gens as lucia with an attached epithet as verna will in most cases be enough to characterize the individual flower but if farther subdivision be necessary the third order will be that of families indicated by a nomen familiare added in the third place of nomenclature as lucia vernaborealis and no farther subdivision will ever be admitted i avoid the word speciesoriginally a bad one and lately vulgarized beyond endurancealtogether and varieties belonging to narrow localities or induced by horticulture may be named as they please by the people living near the spot or by the gardener who grows them but will not be acknowledged by proserpina nevertheless the arbitrary reduction under ordines gentes and familiæ 190 is always to be remembered as one of massive practical convenience only and the more subtle arborescence of the infinitely varying structures may be followed like a human genealogy as far as we please afterwards when once we have got our common plants clearly arranged and intelligibly named  22 but now we find ourselves in the presence of a new difficulty the greatest we have to deal with in the whole matter  one new nomenclature to be thoroughly good must be acceptable to scholars in the five great languages greek latin french italian and english and it must be acceptable by them in teaching the native children of each country i shall not be satisfied unless i can feel that the little maids who gather their first violets under the acropolis rock may receive for them Æschylean words again with joy i shall not be content unless the mothers watching their children at play in the ceramicus of paris under the scarred ruins of her kings palace may yet teach them there to know the flowers which the maid of orleans gathered at domremy i shall not be satisfied unless every word i ask from the lips of the children of florence and rome may enable them better to praise the flowers that are chosen by the hand of matilda54 and bloom around the tomb of virgil  191  23 now in this first example of nomenclature the mastername being pure greek may easily be accepted by greek children remembering that certain also of their own poets if they did not call the flower a grace itself at least thought of it as giving gladness to the three in their dances55 but for french children the word grâce has been doubly and trebly corrupted first by entirely false theological scholarship mistaking the favor or grace done by god to good men for the misericordia or mercy shown by him to bad ones and so in practical life finally substituting grâce as a word of extreme and mortal prayer for merci and of late using merci in a totally ridiculous and perverted power for the giving of thanks or refusal of offered good while the literally derived word charite has become in the modern mind a gift whether from god or man only to the wretched never to the happy and lastly grâce in its physical sense has been perverted by their social vulgarity into an idea whether with respect to form or motion commending itself rather to the balletmaster than either to the painter or the priest  for these reasons the master name of this family for my french pupils must be simply rhodiades which will bring for them the entire group of names into easily remembered symmetry and the english form of 192 the same name rhodiad is to be used by english scholars also for all tribes of this group except the five principal ones  24 farther in every gens of plants one will be chosen as the representative which if any will be that examined and described in the course of this work if i have opportunity of doing so  this representative flower will always be a wild one and of the simplest form which completely expresses the character of the plant existing divinely and unchangeably from age to age ungrieved by mans neglect and inflexible by his power  and this divine character will be expressed by the epithet sacred taking the sense in which we attach it to a dominant and christened majesty when it belongs to the central type of any forceful orderquercus sacra laurus sacra etcthe word benedicta or benedictus being used instead if the plant be too humble to bear without some discrepancy and unbecomingness the higher title as carduus benedictus holy thistle  25 among the gentes of flowers bearing girls names the dominant one will be simply called the queen rose regina rose the queen the english wild rose clarissa regina clarissa the queen mountain pink lucia regina lucy the queen spring gentian or in simpler english lucy of teesdale as harry of monmouth the ruling flowers of groups 193 which bear names not yet accepted for names of girls will be called simply domina or shortly donna rubra domina wild raspberry the wild strawberry because of her use in heraldry will bear a name of her own exceptional cora coronalis  26 these main points being understood and concessions made we may first arrange the greater orders of land plants in a group of twelve easily remembered and with very little forcing there must be some forcing always to get things into quite easily tenable form for nature always has her ins and outs but it is curious how fitly and frequently the number of twelve may be used for memoria technica and in this instance the greek derivative names fall at once into harmony with the most beautiful parts of greek mythology leading on to early christian tradition  27 their series will be therefore as follows the principal subordinate groups being at once placed under each of the great ones the reasons for occasional appearance of inconsistency will be afterwards explained and the english and french forms given in each case are the terms which would be used in answering the rapid question of what order is this flower the answer being it is a cyllenid a pleiad or a vestal as one would answer of a person he is a knight of st john or monk of st benedict while to the question of what gens we answer a stella or an erica as one would answer of a person a stuart or plantagenet 194    i charites   eng charis fr rhodiade   rosa persica pomum rubra fragaria

note the changes of name in their twelve orders and the reasons for them  i charitesthe only change made in the nomenclature of this order is the slight one of rubra for rubus partly to express true sisterhood with the other charites partly to enforce the idea of redness as characteristic of the race both in the lovely purple and russet of their winter leafage and in the exquisite bloom of scarlet on the stems in strong young shoots they have every right to be placed among the charites first because the raspberry is really a more important fruit in domestic economy than the strawberry and secondly because the wild bramble is often in its wandering sprays even more graceful than the rose and in blossom and 196 fruit the best autumnal gift that english nature has appointed for her village children  ii uranidesnot merely because they are all of the color of the sky but also sacred to urania in their divine purity convoluta instead of convolvulus chiefly for the sake of euphony but also because pervinca is to be included in this group  iii cyllenidesnamed from mount cyllene in arcadia because the three races included in the order alike delight in rocky ground and in the cold or moist air of mountainclouds  iv oreiadesdescribed in next chapter  v pleiadesfrom the habit of the flowers belonging to this order to get into bright local clusters silvia for the woodsorrel will i hope be an acceptable change to my girlreaders  vi artemidesdedicate to artemis for their expression of energy no less than purity this character was rightly felt in them by whoever gave the name dianthus to their leading race a name which i should have retained if it had not been bad greek i wish them by their name clarissa to recall the memory of st clare as francesca that of st francis56 the 197 issa not without honour to the greatest of our english moral storytellers is added for the practical reason that i think the sound will fasten in the minds of children the essential characteristic of the race the cutting of the outer edge of the petal as if with scissors  vii vestalesi allow this latin form because hestiades would have been confused with heliades the order is named of the hearth from its manifold domestic use and modest blossoming  viii cytheridesdedicate to venus but in all purity and peace of thought giulietta for the coarse and more than ordinarily false polygala  ix heliadesthe sunflowers57 in english alcestid in honour to chaucer and the daisy  x delphidessacred to apollo granata changed from punica in honor to granada and the moors  xi hesperidesalready a name given to the order 198 aegle prettier and more classic than limonia includes the idea of brightness in the blossom  xii athenaidesi take fraxinus into this group because the mountain ash in its hawthornscented flower scarletest of berries and exquisitely formed and finished leafage belongs wholly to the floral decoration of our native rocks and is associated with their human interests though lightly not less spiritually than the olive with the mind of greece  28 the remaining groups are in great part natural but i separate for subsequent study five orders of supreme domestic utility the mallows currants pease58 cresses and cranesbills from those which either in fruit or blossom are for finer pleasure or higher beauty i think it will be generally interesting for children to learn those five names as an easy lesson and gradually discover wondering the world that they include i will give their terminology at length separately  29 one cannot in all groups have all the divisions of equal importance the mallows are only placed with the other four for their great value in decoration of cottage gardens in autumn and their softly healing 199 qualities as a tribe they will mentally connect the whole useful group with the three great Æsculapiadæ cinchona coffea and camellia  30 taking next the waterplants crowned in the drosidÆ which include the five great families juncus jacinthus amaryllis iris and lilium and are masculine in their greek name because their two first groups juncus and jacinthus are masculine i gather together the three orders of tritonides which are notably trefoil the naiades notably quatrefoil but for which i keep their present pretty name and the batrachides59 notably cinqfoil for which i keep their present ugly one only changing it from latin into greek  31 i am not sure of being forgiven so readily for putting the grasses sedges mosses and lichens together under the great general head of demetridæ but it seems to me the mosses and lichens belong no less definitely to demeter in being the first gatherers of earth on rock and the first coverers of its sterile surface than the grass which at last prepares it to the foot and to the food of man and with the mosses i shall take all the especially mossplants which otherwise are homeless or companionless drosera and the like and as a connecting link with the flowers belonging to the dark 200 kora the two strange orders of the ophryds and agarics  32 lastly will come the orders of flowers which may be thought of as belonging for the most part to the dark kora of the lower worldhaving at least the power of death if not its terror given them together with offices of comfort and healing in sleep or of strengthening if not too prolonged action on the nervous power of life of these the first will be the dionysidÆhedera vitis liana then the draconidÆatropa digitalis linaria and lastly the moiridÆconîum papaver solanum arum and nerium  33 as i see this scheme now drawn out simple as it is the scope of it seems not only far too great for adequate completion by my own labour but larger than the time likely to be given to botany by average scholars would enable them intelligently to grasp and yet it includes i suppose not the tenth part of the varieties of plants respecting which in competitive examination a student of physical science is now expected to know or at least assert on hearsay something  so far as i have influence with the young myself i would pray them to be assured that it is better to know the habits of one plant than the names of a thousand and wiser to be happily familiar with those that grow in the nearest field than arduously cognisant of all that plume the isles of the pacific or illumine the mountains of the moon 201  nevertheless i believe that when once the general form of this system in proserpina has been well learned much other knowledge may be easily attached to it or sheltered under the eaves of it and in its own development i believe everything may be included that the student will find useful or may wisely desire to investigate of properly european botany but i am convinced that the best results of his study will be reached by a resolved adherence to extreme simplicity of primal idea and primal nomenclature  34 i do not think the need of revisal of our present scientific classification could be more clearly demonstrated than by the fact that laurels and roses are confused even by dr lindley in the mind of his feminine readers the english word laurel in the index to his first volume of ladies botany referring them to the cherries under which the common laurel is placed as prunus laurocerasus while the true laurel laurus nobilis must be found in the index of the second volume under the latin form laurus  this accident however illustrates another and a most important point to be remembered in all arrangements whether of plants minerals or animals no single classification can possibly be perfect or anything like perfect it must be at its best a ground or warp of arrangement only through which or over which the cross threads of anotheryes and of many othersmust be woven in our minds thus the almond though in 202 the form and colour of its flower and method of its fruit rightly associated with the roses yet by the richness and sweetness of its kernel must be held mentally connected with all plants that bear nuts these assuredly must have something in their structure common justifying their being gathered into a conceived or conceivable group of nuciferæ in which the almond hazel walnut cocoanut and such others would be considered as having relationship at least in their power of secreting a crisp and sweet substance which is not wood nor bark nor pulp nor seedpabulum reducible to softness by boilingbut quite separate substance for which i do not know that there at present exists any botanical nameof which hitherto i find no general account and can only myself give so much on reflection as that it is crisp and close in texture and always contains some kind of oil or milk  35 again suppose the arrangement of plants could with respect to their flowers and fruits be made approximately complete they must instantly be broken and reformed by comparison of their stems and leaves the three creeping families of the charitesrosa rubra and fragariamust then be frankly separated from the elastic persica and knotty pomum of which one wild and lovely species the hawthorn is no less notable for the massive accumulation of wood in the stubborn stem of it than the wild rose for her lovely power of wreathing her garlands at pleasure wherever they are 203 fairest the stem following them and sustaining where they will  36 thus as we examine successively each part of any plant new sisterhoods and unthoughtof fellowships will be found between the most distant orders and ravines of unexpected separation open between those otherwise closely allied few botanical characters are more definite than the leaf structure illustrated in plate vi which has given to one group of the drosidæ the descriptive name of ensatæ see above chapter ix § 11 but this conformation would not be wisely permitted to interfere in the least with the arrangement founded on the much more decisive floral aspects of the iris and lily so in the fifth volume of modern painters the swordlike or rather rapierlike leaves of the pine are opposed for the sake of more vivid realization to the shieldlike leaves of the greater number of inland trees but it would be absurd to allow this difference any share in botanical arrangementelse we should find ourselves thrown into sudden discomfiture by the widewaving and opening foliage of the palms and ferns  37 but through all the defeats by which insolent endeavors to sum the orders of creation must be reproved and in the midst of the successes by which patient insight will be surprised the fact of the confirmation of species in plants and animals must remain always a miraculous one what outstretched sign of constant omnipotence can be more awful than that the susceptibility to 204 external influences with the reciprocal power of transformation in the organs of the plant and the infinite powers of moral training and mental conception over the nativity of animals should be so restrained within impassable limits and by inconceivable laws that from generation to generation under all the clouds and revolutions of heaven with its stars and among all the calamities and convulsions of the earth with her passions the numbers and the names of her kindred may still be counted for her in unfailing truthstill the fifth sweet leaf unfold for the rose and the sixth spring for the lily and yet the wolf rave tameless round the folds of the pastoral mountains and yet the tiger flame through the forests of the night                                       205  chapter xii  cora and kronos  1 of all the lovely wild plantsand few mountainbred in britain are other than lovelythat fill the clefts and crest the ridges of my brantwood rock the dearest to me by far are the clusters of whortleberry which divide possession of the lower slopes with the wood hyacinth and pervenche they are personally and specially dear to me for their association in my mind with the woods of montanvert but the plant itself irrespective of all accidental feeling is indeed so beautiful in all its waysso delicately strong in the spring of its leafage so modestly wonderful in the formation of its fruit and so pure in choice of its haunts not capriciously or unfamiliarly but growing in luxuriance through all the healthiest and sweetest seclusion of mountain territory throughout europethat i think i may without any sharp remonstrance be permitted to express for this once only personal feeling in my nomenclature calling it in latin myrtilla cara and in french myrtille chérie but retaining for it in english its simply classic name blue whortle 206  2 it is the most common representative of the group of myrtillæ which on reference to our classification will be found central between the ericæ and auroræ the distinctions between these three families may be easily remembered and had better be learned before going farther but first let us note their fellowship they are all oreiades mountain plants in specialty they are all strong in stem low in stature and the ericæ and auroræ glorious in the flush of their infinitely exulting flowers the rapture of the heathabove spoken of p 96 but all the essential loveliness of the myrtillæ is in their leaves and fruit the first always exquisitely finished and grouped like the most precious decorative work of sacred painting the second red or purple like beads of coral or amethyst their minute flowers have rarely any general part or power in the colors of mountain ground but examined closely they are one of the chief joys of the travellers rest among the alps and full of exquisiteness unspeakable in their several bearings and miens of blossom so to speak plate viii represents however feebly the proud bending back of her head by myrtilla regina60 an action as beautiful in her as it is terrible in the kingly serpent of egypt  3 the formal differences between these three families are trenchant and easily remembered the ericæ 207 are all quatrefoils and quatrefoils of the most studied and accomplished symmetry and they bear no berries but only dry seeds the myrtillæ and auroræ are both cinqfoil but the myrtillæ are symmetrical in their blossom and the auroræ unsymmetrical farther the myrtillæ are not absolutely determinate in the number of their foils this being essentially a characteristic of flowers exposed to much hardship and are thus sometimes quatrefoil in sympathy with the ericæ but the auroræ are strictly cinqfoil these last are the only european form of a larger group well named azalea from the greek greek aza dryness and its adjective greek azalea dry or parched and this name must be kept for the worldwide group including under it rhododendron but not kalmia because there is an undermeaning in the word aza enabling it to be applied to the substance of dry earth and indicating one of the great functions of the oreiades in common with the mossesthe collection of earth upon rocks  4 neither the ericæ as i have just said nor auroræ bear useful fruit and the ericæ are named from their consequent worthlessness in the eyes of the greek farmer they were the plants he tore up for his bed or signalfire his word for them including a farther sense of crushing or bruising into a heap the westmoreland shepherds now alas burn them remorselessly on the ground and a year since had nearly set the copse of brantwood on fire just above the house the sense of 208 parched and fruitless existence is given to the heaths with beautiful application of the context in our english translation of jeremiah xvii 6 but i find the plant there named is in the septuagint wild tamarisk the mountains of palestine being i suppose in that latitude too low for heath unless in the lebanon  5 but i have drawn the readers thoughts to this great race of the oreiades at present because they place for us in the clearest light a question which i have finally to answer before closing the first volume of proserpina namely what is the real difference between the three ranks of vegetative humility and noblessethe herb the shrub and the tree  6 between the herb which perishes annually and the plants which construct year after year an increasing stem there is of course no difficulty of discernment but between the plants which like these oreiades construct for themselves richest intricacy of supporting stem yet scarcely rise a fathoms height above the earth they gather and adornbetween these and the trees that lift cathedral aisles of colossal shade on andes and lebanonwhere is the limit of kind to be truly set  7 we have the three orders given as no botanist could in twelve lines by milton   then herbs of every leaf that sudden flowrd   opning their various colours and made gay   her bosom smelling sweet and these scarce blown   forth flourishd thick the clustring vine forth crept   209   the swelling gourd up stood the corny reed   embatteld in her field and th humble shrub   and bush with frizzled hair implicit last   rose as in dance the stately trees and spread   their branches hung with copious fruits or gemmd   their blossoms with high woods the hills were crownd   with tufts the valleys and each fountain side   with borders long the rivers  only to learn and be made to understand these twelve lines thoroughly would teach a youth more of true botany than an entire cyclopædia of modern nomenclature and description they are like all miltons work perfect in accuracy of epithet while consummate in concentration exquisite in touch as infinite in breadth they gather into their unbroken clause of melodious compass the conception at once of the columbian prairie the english cornfield the syrian vineyard and the indian grove but even milton has left untold and for the instant perhaps unthought of the most solemn difference of rank between the low and lofty trees not in magnitude only nor in grace but in duration  8 yet let us pause before passing to this greater subject to dwell more closely on what he has told us so clearlythe difference in grace namely between the trees that rise as in dance and the bush with frizzled hair for the bush form is essentially one taken by vegetation in some kind of distress scorched by heat discouraged by darkness or bitten by frost it is the form in which isolated knots of earnest plant life stay 210 the flux of fiery sands bind the rents of tottering crags purge the stagnant air of cave or chasm and fringe with sudden hues of unhoped spring the arctic edge of retreating desolation  on the other hand the trees which as in sacred dance make the borders of the rivers glad with their procession and the mountain ridges statelier with their pride are all expressions of the vegetative power in its accomplished felicities gathering themselves into graceful companionship with the fairest arts and serenest life of man and providing not only the sustenance and the instruments but also the lessons and the delights of that life in perfectness of order and unblighted fruition of season and time  9 interiturayet these not today nor tomorrow nor with the decline of the summers sun we describe a plant as small or great and think we have given account enough of its nature and being but the chief question for the plant as for the human creature is the number of its days for to the tree as to its master the words are forever trueas thy day is so shall thy strength be  10 i am astonished hourly more and more at the apathy and stupidity which have prevented me hitherto from learning the most simple facts at the base of this question here is this myrtille bush in my handits cluster of some fifteen or twenty delicate green branches knitting themselves downwards into the stubborn brown 211 of a stem on which my knife makes little impression i have not the slightest idea how old it is still less how old it might one day have been if i had not gathered it and less than the least what hinders it from becoming as old as it likes what doom is there over these bright green sprays that they may never win to any height or space of verdure nor persist beyond their narrow scope of years  11 and the more i think the more i bewilder myself for these bushes which are pruned and clipped by the deathless gardener into these lowly thickets of bloom do not strew the ground with fallen branches and faded clippings in any wiseit is the pining umbrage of the patriarchal trees that tinges the ground and betrays the foot beneath them but under the heather and the alpine rosewell what is under them then i never saw nor thought of lookingwill look presently under my own bosquets and beds of lingering heatherblossom beds indeed they were only a month since a foot deep in flowers and close in tufted cushions and the mountain air that floated over them rich in honey like a draught of metheglin  12 not clipped nor pruned i think after allnor dwarfed in the gardeners sense but pausing in perpetual youth and strength ordained out of their lips of roseate infancy rosetreesthe botanists have falsely called the proudest of them yet not trees in any wise they nor doomed to know the edge of axe at their 212 roots nor the hoary waste of time or searing thunderstroke on sapless branches continual morning for them and in them they themselves an aurora purple and cloudless stayed on all the happy hills that shall be our name for them in the flushed phoenician colour of their height in calm or tempest of the heavenly sea how much holier than the depth of the tyrian and the queen of them on our own alps shall be aurora alpium61  13 there is one word in the miltonian painting of them which i must lean on specially for the accurate english of it hides deep morality no less than botany with hair implicit the interweaving of complex band which knits the masses of heath or of alpine rose into their dense tufts and spheres of flower is to be noted both in these and in stem structure of a higher order like that of the stone pine for an expression of the instinct of the plant gathering itself into protective unity whether against cold or heat while the forms of the trees which have no hardship to sustain are uniformly based on the effort of each spray to separate itself from its fellows to the utmost and obtain around its own leaves the utmost space of air  in vulgar modern english the term implicit used of trust or faith has come to signify only its serenity but the miltonian word gives the reason of serenity 213 the root and branch intricacy of closest knowledge and fellowship  14 i have said that milton has told us more in these few lines than any botanist could i will prove my saying by placing in comparison with them two passages of description by the most imaginative and generally welltrained scientific man since linnæushumboldtwhich containing much that is at this moment of special use to us are curious also in the confusion even of the two orders of annual and perennial plants and show therefore the extreme need of most careful initial work in this distinction of the reign of cora from that of kronos  the disk of the setting sun appeared like a globe of fire suspended over the savannah and its last rays as they swept the earth illumined the extremities of the grass strongly agitated by the evening breeze in the low and humid places of the equinoxial zone even when the gramineous plants and reeds present the aspect of a meadow of turf a rich decoration of the picture is usually wanting i mean that variety of wild flowers which scarcely rising above the grass seem to lie upon a smooth bed of verdure between the tropics the strength and luxury of vegetation give such a development to plants that the smallest of the dicotyledonous family become shrubs62 it would seem as if the 214 liliaceous plants mingled with the gramina assumed the place of the flowers of our meadows their form is indeed striking they dazzle by the variety and splendor of their colours but too high above the soil they disturb that harmonious relation which exists among the plants that compose our meadows and our turf nature in her beneficence has given the landscape under every zone its peculiar type of beauty  after proceeding four hours across the savannahs we entered into a little wood composed of shrubs and small trees which is called el pejual no doubt because of the great abundance of the pejoa gaultheria odorata a plant with very odoriferous leaves the steepness of the mountain became less considerable and we felt an indescribable pleasure in examining the plants of this region nowhere perhaps can be found collected together in so small a space of ground productions so beautiful and so remarkable in regard to the geography of plants at the height of a thousand toises the lofty savannahs of the hills terminate in a zone of shrubs which by their appearance their tortuous branches their stiff leaves and the dimensions and beauty of their purple flowers remind us of what is called in the cordilleras of the andes the vegetation of the paramos63 and the punas we find there the 215 family of the alpine rhododendrons the thibaudias the andromedas the vacciniums and those befarias64 with resinous leaves which we have several times compared to the rhododendron of our european alps  even when nature does not produce the same species in analogous climates either in the plains of isothermal parallels or on tablelands the temperature of which resembles that of places nearer the poles we still remark a striking resemblance of appearance and physiognomy in the vegetation of the most distant countries this phenomenon is one of the most curious in the history of organic forms i say the history for in vain would reason forbid man to form hypotheses on the origin of things he is not the less tormented with these insoluble problems of the distribution of beings  15 insolubleyes assuredly poor little beaten phantasms of palpitating clay that we areand who asked us to solve it even this humboldt quiethearted and modest watcher of the ways of heaven in the real make of him came at last to be so far puffed up by his vain science in declining years that he must needs write a kosmos of things in the universe forsooth as if he knew all about them when he was not able meanwhile and does not seem even to have desired the ability to put the slightest kosmos into his own personal narrative but leaves one to gather what one wants out of 216 its wild growth or rather to wash or winnow what may be useful out of its débris without any vestige either of reference or index and i must look for these fragmentary sketches of heath and grass through chapter after chapter about the races of the indian and religion of the spaniardthese also of great intrinsic value but made useless to the general reader by interspersed experiment on the drifts of the wind and the depths of the sea  16 but one more fragment out of a note vol iii p 494 i must give with reference to an order of the rhododendrons as yet wholly unknown to me  the name of vine tree uvas camaronas shrimp grapes is given in the andes to plants of the genus thibaudia on account of their large succulent fruit thus the ancient botanists give the name of bears vine uva ursi and vine of mount ida vitis idea to an arbutus and myrtillus which belong like the thibaudiæ to the family of the ericineæ  now though i have one entire bookcase and half of another and a large cabinet besides or about fifteen feet square of books on botany beside me here and a quantity more at oxford i have no means whatever in all the heap of finding out what a thibaudia is like loudons cyclopædia the only general book i have tells me only that it will grow well in camellia houses that its flowers develope at christmas and that they are beautifully varied like a fritillary whereupon i am very anxious to see them and taste their fruit and be able to 217 tell my pupils something intelligible of thema new order as it seems to me among my oreiades but for the present i can make no room for them and must be content for england and the alps with my single class myrtilla including all the fruitbearing and more or less myrtleleaved kinds and azalea for the fruitless flushing of the loftier tribes taking the special name aurora for the red and purple ones of europe and resigning the already accepted rhodora to those of the andes and himalaya  17 of which also with help of earnest indian botanists i hope nevertheless to add some little history to that of our own oreiades but shall set myself on the most familiar of them first as i partly hinted in taking for the frontispiece of this volume two unchecked shoots of our commonest heath in their state of full lustre and decline and now i must go out and see and thinkand for the first time in my lifewhat becomes of all these fallen blossoms and where my own mountain cora hides herself in winter and where her sweet body is laid in its death  think of it with me for a moment before i go that harvest of amethyst bells over all scottish and irish and cumberland hill and moorland what substance is there in it yearly gathered out of the mountain windsstayed there as if the morning and evening clouds had been caught out of them and woven into flowers ropes of seasandbut that is childs magic 218 merely compared to the weaving of the heath out of the cloud and once woven how much of it is forever worn by the earth what weight of that transparent tissue half crystal and half comb of honey lies strewn every year dead under the snow  i must go and look and can write no more today nor tomorrow neither i must gather slowly what i see and remember and meantime leaving to be dealt with afterwards the difficult and quite separate question of the production of wood i will close this first volume of proserpina with some necessary statements respecting the operations serviceable to other creatures than themselves in which the lives of the noblest plants are ended honourable in this service equally though evanescent somein the passing of a breezeor the dying of a dayand patient some of storm and time serene in fruitful sanctity through all the uncounted ages which man has polluted with his tears                                       219  chapter xiii  the seed and husk  1 not the least sorrowful nor least absurd of the confusions brought on us by unscholarly botanists blundering into foreign languages when they do not know how to use their own is that which has followed on their practice of calling the seedvessels of flowers eggvessels65 in latin thus involving total loss of the power of the good old english word husk and the good old french one cosse for all the treasuries of plants see chapter iv § 17 may be best conceived and described generally as consisting of seed and huskfor the most part two or more seeds in a husk composed of two or more parts as pease in their shell pips in an orange or kernels in a walnut but whatever their number or the method of their enclosure let the student keep clear in his mind for the base of all study of fructification the broad distinction between the seed as one thing and the husk as another the seed essential to the continuance of the plants race and the husk 220 adapted primarily to its guard and dissemination but secondarily to quite other and far more important functions  2 for on this distinction follows another practical one of great importance a seed may serve and many do mightily serve for the food of man when boiled crushed or otherwise industriously prepared by man himself for his mere sustenance but the husk of the seed is prepared in many cases for the delight of his eyes and the pleasure of his palate by nature herself and is then called a fruit  3 the varieties of structure both in seed and husk and yet more the manner in which the one is contained and distributed by the other are infinite and in some cases the husk is apparently wanting or takes some unrecognizable form but in far the plurality of instances the two parts of the plants treasury are easily distinguishable and must be separately studied whatever their apparent closeness of relation or as in all natural things the equivocation sometimes taking place between the one and the other to me the especially curious point in this matter is that while i find the most elaborate accounts given by botanists of the stages of growth in each of these parts of the treasury they never say of what use the guardian is to the guarded part irrespective of its service to man the mechanical action of the husk in containing and scattering the seeds they indeed often notice and insist on but they do not tell 221 us of what if any nutritious or fostering use the rind is to a chestnut or an oranges pulp to its pips or a peachs juice to its stone  4 putting aside this deeper question for the moment let us make sure we understand well and define safely the separate parts themselves a seed consists essentially of a store or sack containing substance to nourish a germ of life which is surrounded by such substance and in the process of growth is first fed by it the germ of life itself rises into two portions and not more than two in the seeds of twoleaved plants but this symmetrical dualism must not be allowed to confuse the students conception of the three organically separate partsthe tough skin of a bean for instance the softer contents of it which we boil to eat and the small germ from which the root springs when it is sown a bean is the best type of the whole structure an almond out of its shell a peachkernel and an applepip are also clear and perfect though varied types  5 the husk or seedvessel is seen in perfect simplicity of type in the pod of a bean or the globe of a poppy there are i believe flowers in which it is absent or imperfect and when it contains only one seed it may be so small and closely united with the seed it contains that both will be naturally thought of as one thing only thus in a dandelion the little brown grains which may be blown away each with its silken parachute are every one of them a complete husk and 222 seed together but the majority of instances and those of plants the most serviceable to man in which the seedvessel has entirely a separate structure and mechanical power justify us in giving it the normal term husk as the most widely applicable and intelligible  6 the change of green hard and tasteless vegetable substance into beautifully coloured soft and delicious substance which produces what we call a fruit is in most cases of the husk only in others of the part of the stalk which immediately sustains the seed and in a very few instances not properly a change but a distinct formation of fruity substance between the husk and seed normally however the husk like the seed consists always of three parts it has an outer skin a central substance of peculiar nature and an inner skin which holds the seed the main difficulty in describing or thinking of the completely ripened product of any plant is to discern clearly which is the inner skin of the husk and which the outer skin of the seed the peach is in this respect the best general typethe woolly skin being the outer one of the husk the part we eat the central substance of the husk and the hard shell of the stone the inner skin of the husk the bitter kernel within is the seed  7 in this case and in the plum and cherry the two parts under present examinationhusk and seedseparate naturally the fruity part which is the body of the husk adhering firmly to the shell which is its inner 223 coat but in the walnut and almond the two outer parts of the husk separate from the interior one which becomes an apparently independent shell so that when first i approached this subject i divided the general structure of a treasury into three partshusk shell and kernel and this division when we once have mastered the main one will be often useful but at first let the student keep steadily to his conception of the two constant parts husk and seed reserving the idea of shells and kernels for one group of plants only  8 it will not be always without difficulty that he maintains the distinction when the tree pretends to have changed it thus in the chestnut the inner coat of the husk becomes brown adheres to the seed and seems part of it and we naturally call only the thick green prickly coat the husk but this is only one of the deceiving tricks of nature to compel our attention more closely the real place of separation to her mind is between the mahoganycoloured shell and the nut itself and that more or less silky and flossy coating within the brown shell is the true lining of the entire husk the paler brown skin following the rugosities of the nut is the true sack or skin of the seed similarly in the walnut and almond  9 but in the apple two new tricks are played us first in the brown skin of the ripe pip we might imagine we saw the part correspondent to the mahogany skin of the chestnut and therefore the inner coat of the 224 husk but it is not so the brown skin of the pips belongs to them properly and is all their own it is the true skin or sack of the seed the inner coat of the husk is the smooth white scaly part of the core that holds them  thenfor trick number two we should as naturally imagine the skin of the apple which we peel off to be correspondent to the skin of the peach and therefore to be the outer part of the husk but not at all the outer part of the husk in the apple is melted away into the fruity mass of it and the red skin outside is the skin of its stalk not of its seedvessel at all  10 i say of its stalkthat is to say of the part of the stalk immediately sustaining the seed commonly called the torus and expanding into the calyx in the apple this torus incorporates itself with the husk completely then refines its own external skin and colours that variously and beautifully like the true skin of the husk in the peach while the withered leaves of the calyx remain in the eye of the apple  but in the hip of the rose the incorporation with the husk of the seed does not take place the torus oras in this flower from its peculiar form it is calledthe tube of the calyx alone forms the frutescent part of the hip and the complete seeds husk and all the firm triangular husk enclosing an almondshaped kernel are grouped closely in its interior cavity while the calyx remains on the top in a large and scarcely withering star 225 in the nut the calyx remains green and beautiful forming what we call the husk of a filbert and again we find nature amusing herself by trying to make us think that this strict envelope almost closing over the single seed is the same thing to the nut that its green shell is to a walnut  11 with still more capricious masquing she varies and hides the structure of her berries  the strawberry is a hip turned insideout the frutescent receptacle changed into a scarlet ball or cone of crystalline and delicious coral in the outside of which the separate seeds husk and all are imbedded in the raspberry and blackberry the interior mound remains sapless and the rubied translucency of dulcet substance is formed round each separate seed upon its husk not a part of the husk but now an entirely independent and added portion of the plants bodily form  12 what is thus done for each seed on the outside of the receptacle in the raspberry is done for each seed inside the calyx in a pomegranate which is a hip in which the seeds have become surrounded with a radiant juice richer than claret wine while the seed itself within the generous jewel is succulent also and spoken of by tournefort as a baie succulente the tube of the calyx brownrusset like a large hip externally is yet otherwise divided and separated wholly from the cinquefoiled and cinquecelled rose both in number of petal and division of treasuries the calyx has eight points and nine cells 226  13 lastly in the orange the fount of fragrant juice is interposed between the seed and the husk it is wholly independent of both the aurantine rind with its white lining and divided compartments is the true husk the orange pips are the true seeds and the eatable part of the fruit is formed between them in clusters of delicate little flasks as if a fairys store of scented wine had been laid up by her in the hollow of a chestnut shell between the nut and rind and then the green changed to gold  14 i have said lastlyof the orange for fear of the readers weariness only not as having yet represented far less exhausted the variety of frutescent form but these are the most important types of it and before i can explain the relation between these and another too often confounded with themthe granular form of the seed of grassesi must give some account of what to man is far more important than the formthe gift to him in fruitfood and trial in fruittemptation                                       227  chapter xiv  the fruit gift  1 in the course of the preceding chapter i hope that the reader has obtained or may by a little patience both obtain and secure the idea of a great natural ordinance which in the protection given to the part of plants necessary to prolong their race provides for happier living creatures food delightful to their taste and forms either amusing or beautiful to their eyes whether in receptacle calyx or true huskin the cup of the acorn the fringe of the filbert the down of the apricot or bloom of the plum the powers of nature consult quite other ends than the mere continuance of oaks and plum trees on the earth and must be regarded always with gratitude more deep than wonder when they are indeed seen with human eyes and human intellect  2 but in one family of plants the contents also of the seed not the envelope of it merely are prepared for the support of the higher animal life and their grain filled with the substance which for universally understood name may best keep the latin one of farinabecoming in french farine and in english flourboth in the perfectly nourishing elements of it and its 228 easy and abundant multiplicability becomes the primal treasure of human economy  3 it has been the practice of botanists of all nations to consider the seeds of the grasses together with those of roses and pease as if all could be described on the same principles and with the same nomenclature of parts but the grain of corn is a quite distinct thing from the seed of pease in it the husk and the seed envelope have become inextricably one all the exocarps endocarps epicarps mesocarps shells husks sacks and skins are woven at once together into the brown bran and inside of that a new substance is collected for us which is not what we boil in pease or poach in eggs or munch in nuts or grind in coffeebut a thing which mixed with water and then baked has given to all the nations of the world their prime word for food in thought and prayerbread their prime conception of the mans and womans labor in preparing itwhoso putteth hand to the ploughtwo women shall be grinding at the milltheir prime notion of the means of cooking by firewhich today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven and their prime notion of culinary officethe chief baker cook or pastrycookcompare bedreddin hassan in the arabian nights and finally to modern civilization the saxon word lady with whatever it imports  4 it has also been the practice of botanists to confuse all the ripened products of plants under the general term 229 fruit but the essential and separate fruitgift is of two substances quite distinct from flour namely oil and wine under the last term including for the moment all kinds of juice which will produce alcohol by fermentation of these oil may be produced either in the kernels of nuts as in almonds or in the substance of berries as in the olive date and coffeeberry but the sweet juice which will become medicinal in wine can only be developed in the husk or in the receptacle  5 the office of the chief butler as opposed to that of the chief baker and the office of the good samaritan pouring in oil and wine refer both to the total fruitgift in both kinds but in the study of plants we must primarily separate our notion of their gifts to men into the three elements flour oil and wine and have instantly and always intelligible names for them in latin french and english  and i think it best not to confuse our ideas of pure vegetable substance with the possible process of fermentationso that rather than wine for a constant specific term i will take nectarthis term more rightly including the juices of the peach nectarine and plum as well as those of the grape currant and apple  our three separate substances will then be easily named in all three languages    farina            oleum             nectar   farine            huile             nectare   flour             oil               nectar  230  there is this farther advantage in keeping the third common term that it leaves us the words succus jus juice for other liquid products of plants watery milky sugary or resinousoften indeed important to man but often also without either agreeable flavor or nutritious power and it is therefore to be observed with care that we may use the word juice of a liquid produced by any part of a plant but nectar only of the juices produced in its fruit  6 but the good and pleasure of fruit is not in the juice onlyin some kinds and those not the least valuable as the date it is not in the juice at all we still stand absolutely in want of a word to express the more or less firm substance of fruit as distinguished from all other products of a plant and with the usual illlucki advisedly think of it as demoniacal misfortuneof botanical science no other name has been yet used for such substance than the entirely false and ugly one of fleshfr chair with its still more painful derivation charnu and in england the monstrous scientific term sarcocarp  but under the housewifery of proserpina since we are to call the juice of fruit nectar its substance will be as naturally and easily called ambrosia and i have no doubt that this with the other names defined in this chapter will not only be found practically more convenient than the phrases in common use but will more securely fix in the students mind a true conception of 231 the essential differences in substance which ultimately depend wholly on their pleasantness to human perception and offices for human good and not at all on any otherwise explicable structure or faculty it is of no use to determine by microscope or retort that cinnamon is made of cells with so many walls or grapejuice of molecules with so many sideswe are just as far as ever from understanding why these particular interstices should be aromatic and these special parallelopipeds exhilarating as we were in the savagely unscientific days when we could only see with our eyes and smell with our noses but to call each of these separate substances by a name rightly belonging to it through all the past variations of the language of educated man will probably enable us often to discern powers in the thing itself of affecting the human body and mind which are indeed qualities infinitely more its own than any which can possibly be extracted by the point of a knife or brayed out with a mortar and pestle  7 thus to take merely instance in the three main elements of which we have just determined the namesflour oil and ambrosiathe differences in the kinds of pleasure which the tongue received from the powderiness of oatcake or a wellboiled potatoin the days when oatcake and potatoes werefrom the glossilysoftened crispness of a wellmade salad and from the cool and fragrant amber of an apricot are indeed distinctions between the essential virtues of things which 232 were made to be tasted much more than to be eaten and in their various methods of ministry to and temptation of human appetites have their part in the history not of elements merely but of souls and of the soulvirtues which from the beginning of the world have bade the barrel of meal not waste nor the cruse of oil fail and have planted by waters of comfort the fruits which are for the healing of nations  8 and again therefore i must repeat with insistance the claim i have made for the limitation of language to the use made of it by educated men the word carp could never have multiplied itself into the absurdities of endocarps and epicarps but in the mouths of men who scarcely ever read it in its original letters and therefore never recognized it as meaning precisely the same thing as fructus which word being a little more familiar with they would have scarcely abused to the same extent they would not have called a walnut shell an intrafructor a grape skin an extrafruct but again because though they are accustomed to the english fructify frugivorousand usufruct they are unaccustomed to the latin fruor and unconscious therefore that the derivative fructus must always in right use mean an enjoyed thing they generalize every mature vegetable product under the term and we find dr gray coolly telling us that there is no fruit so likely to be mistaken for a seed as a grain of corn a grain whether of corn or any other 233 grass being precisely the vegetable structure to which frutescent change is forever forbidden and to which the word seed is primarily and perfectly applicablethe thing to be sown not grafted  9 but to mark this total incapability of frutescent change and connect the form of the seed more definitely with its dusty treasure it is better to reserve when we are speaking with precision the term grain for the seeds of the grasses the difficulty is greater in french than in english because they have no monosyllabic word for the constantly granular seed but for us the terms are all simple and already in right use only not quite clearly enough understood and there remains only one real difficulty now in our system of nomenclature that having taken the word husk for the seedvessel we are left without a general word for the true fringe of a filbert or the chaff of a grass i dont know whether the french frange could be used by them in this sense if we took it in english botany but for the present we can manage well enough without it one general term chaff serving for all the grasses cup for acorns and fringe for nuts  10 but i call this a real difficulty because i suppose among the myriads of plants of which i know nothing there may be forms of the envelope of fruits or seeds which may for comfort of speech require some common generic name one unreal difficulty or shadow of difficulty remains in our having no entirely comprehensive 234 name for seed and seedvessel together than that the botanists now use fruit but practically even now people feel that they cant gather figs of thistles and never speak of the fructification of a thistle or of the fruit of a dandelion and reassembling now in one view the words we have determined on they will be found enough for all practical service and in such service always accurate and usually suggestive i repeat them in brief order with such farther explanation as they need  11 all ripe products of the life of flowers consist essentially of the seed and huskthese being in certain cases sustained surrounded or provided with means of motion by other parts of the plant or by developments of their own form which require in each case distinct names thus the white cushion of the dandelion to which its brown seeds are attached and the personal parachutes which belong to each must be separately described for that species of plants it is the little brown thing they sustain and carry away on the wind which must be examined as the essential product of the floretthe seed and husk  12 every seed has a husk holding either that seed alone or other seeds with it  every perfect seed consists of an embryo and the substance which first nourishes that embryo the whole enclosed in a sack or other sufficient envelope three essential parts altogether 235  every perfect husk vulgarly pericarp or roundfruitas periwig roundwigconsists of a shell vulgarly endocarp rind vulgarly mesocarp and skin vulgarly epicarp three essential parts altogether but one or more of these parts may be effaced or confused with another and in the seeds of grasses they all concentrate themselves into bran  13 when a husk consists of two or more parts each of which has a separate shaft and volute uniting in the pillar and volute of the flower each separate piece of the husk is called a carpel the name was first given by de candolle and must be retained but it continually happens that a simple husk divides into two parts corresponding to the two leaves of the embryo as in the peach or symmetrically holding alternate seeds as in the pea the beautiful drawing of the peashell with its seeds in rousseaus botany is the only one i have seen which rightly shows and expresses this arrangement  14 a fruit is either the husk receptacle petal or other part of a flower external to the seed in which chemical changes have taken place fitting it for the most part to become pleasant and healthful food for man or other living animals but in some cases making it bitter or poisonous to them and the enjoyment of it depraved or deadly but as far as we know it is without any definite office to the seed it contains and the change takes 236 place entirely to fit the plant to the service of animals66  in its perfection the fruit gift is limited to a temperate zone of which the polar limit is marked by the strawberry and the equatorial by the orange the more arctic regions produce even the smallest kinds of fruit with difficulty and the more equatorial in coarse oleaginous or overluscious masses  15 all the most perfect fruits are developed from exquisite forms either of foliage or flower the vine leaf in its generally decorative power is the most important both in life and in art of all that shade the habitations of men the olive leaf is without any rival the most beautiful of the leaves of timber trees and its blossom though minute of extreme beauty the apple is essentially the fruit of the rose and the peach of her only rival in her own colour the cherry and orange blossom are the two types of floral snow  16 and lastly let my readers be assured the economy of blossom and fruit with the distribution of water 237 will be found hereafter the most accurate test of wise national government  for example of the action of a national government rightly so called in these matters i refer the student to the mariegolas of venice translated in fors clavigera and i close this chapter and this first volume of proserpina not without pride in the words i wrote on this same matter eighteen years ago so far as the labourers immediate profit is concerned it matters not an iron filing whether i employ him in growing a peach or in forging a bombshell but the difference to him is final whether when his child is ill i walk into his cottage and give it the peachor drop the shell down his chimney and blow his roof off                                       238  index i  descriptive nomenclature  plants in perfect form are said at page 26 to consist of four principal parts root stem leaf and flower compare chapter v § 2 the reader may have been surprised at the omission of the fruit from this list but a plant which has borne fruit is no longer of perfect form its flower is dead and observe it is further said at page 65 and compare chapter iii § 2 that the use of the fruit is to produce the flower not of the flower to produce the fruit therefore the plant in perfect blossom is itself perfect nevertheless the formation of the fruit practically is included in the flower and so spoken of in the fifteenth line of the same page  each of these four main parts of a plant consist normally of a certain series of minor parts to which it is well to attach easily remembered names in this section of my index i will not admit the confusion of idea involved by alphabetical arrangement of these names but will sacrifice facility of reference to clearness of explanation and taking the four great parts of the plant in 239 succession i will give the list of the minor and constituent parts with their names as determined in proserpina and reference to the pages where the reasons for such determination are given endeavouring to supply at the same time any deficiencies which i find in the body of the text  i the root

animation                       2734    the essential parts of a root are two the limbs   and fibres                                                  33    i the limb is the gathered mass of fibres or at   least of fibrous substance which extends itself   in search of nourishment                                    32    ii the fibre is the organ by which the nourishment   is received                                                 32    the inessential or accidental parts of roots which   are attached to the roots of some plants but   not to those of others and are indeed for the   most part absent are three namely storehouses   refuges and ruins                                          34    iii storehouses contain the food of the future   plant

here given   though the ordinary botanical onescorm bulb tuber   etcwill be severally explained in connection with the   plants which they specially characterize     ii the stem    derivation of word                                         137    the channel of communication between leaf and   root                                                       153    in a perfect plant it consists of three parts    i the stem stemma propera growing or advancing   shoot which sustains all the other   organs of the plant                                        136    it may grow by adding thickness to its sides without   advancing but its essential characteristic is   the vital power of advance                                 136   241    it may be round square or polygonal but is always   roundly minded                                             136    its structural power is spiral                             137    it is essentially branched having subordinate leafstalks   and flowerstalks if not larger branches                  139    it developes the buds leaves and flowers of the   plant    this power is not yet properly defined or explained   and referred to only incidentally throughout   the eighth chapter                                     134138    ii the leafstalk cymba sustains and expands   itself into the leaf                                 133 134    it is essentially furrowed above and convex below         134    it is to be called in latin the cymba in english   the leafstalk                                             135    iii the flowerstalk petiolus    it is essentially round                                    130    it is usually separated distinctly at its termination   from the flower                                       130 131    it is to be called in latin petiolus in english   flowerstalk                                               130    these three are the essential parts of a stem but   242   besides these it has when largely developed a   permanent form namely    iv the trunka nonadvancing mass of collected   stem arrested at a given height from the   ground                                                     139       the stems of annual plants are either leafy as of a   thistle or bare sustaining the flower or flowercluster at   a certain height above the ground receiving therefore   these following names       v the virgathe leafy stem of an annual plant   not a grass yet growing upright                           147    vi the virgulathe leafless flowerstem of an   annual plant not a grass as of a primrose or   dandelion                                                  147    vii the filumthe running stem of a creeping   plant       it is not specified in the text for use but will be necessary   so also perhaps the stelechos or stalk proper 26   the branched stem of an annual plant not a grass one   cannot well talk of the virga of hemlock the stolon   is explained in its classical sense at page 158 but i believe   botanists use it otherwise i shall have occasion   to refer to and complete its explanation in speaking of   bulbous plants       viii the caudexthe essentially ligneous and   compact part of a stem                                     149    243       this equivocal word is not specified for use in the text   but i mean to keep it for the accumulated stems of inlaid   plants palms and the like for which otherwise we have   no separate term       ix the avenanot specified in the text at all   but it will be prettier than baculus which is   that i had proposed for the staff of grasses   see page 179       these ten names are all that the student need remember   but he will find some interesting particulars respecting   the following three noticed in the text       stipsthe origin of stipend stupid and stump           148    stipulathe subtlest latin term for straw                148    caulis kalethe peculiar stem of branched eatable   vegetables

                    26    the latin form folium                                     41    the greek form petalos                                    42    veins and ribs of leaves to be usually summed under   the term rib                                              44    chemistry of leaves                                         46   244       the nomenclature of the leaf consists in botanical   books of little more than barbarous and for the general   reader totally useless attempts to describe their   forms in latin but their forms are infinite and indescribable   except by the pencil i will give central types of   form in the next volume of proserpina which so that   the reader sees and remembers he may call anything he   likes but it is necessary that names should be assigned   to certain classes of leaves which are essentially different   from each other in character and tissue not merely   in form of these the two main divisions have been   already given but i will now add the less important   ones which yet require distinct names       i apollinetypically represented by the laurel           51    ii arethusanrepresented by the alisma                   52       it ought to have been noticed that the character of serration   within reserved limits is essential to an apolline   leaf and absolutely refused by an arethusan one       iii dryadof the ordinary leaf tissue neither   manifestly strong nor admirably tender but   serviceably consistent which we find generally   to be the substance of the leaves of forest trees   typically represented by those of the oak    iv abietineshaft or swordshape as the leaves   of firs and pines    v cressicdelicate and light with smooth tissue   as the leaves of cresses and clover   245    vi salviansoft and woolly like miniature   blankets easily folded as the leaves of sage    vii caulinesoftly succulent with thick central   ribs as of the cabbage    viii aloeineinflexibly succulent as of the   aloe or houseleek       no rigid application of these terms must ever be attempted   but they direct the attention to important general   conditions and will often be found to save time and   trouble in description     iv the flower    its general nature and function                             65    consists essentially of corolla and treasury                78    has in perfect form the following parts    i the torusnot yet enough described in the   text it is the expansion of the extremity of   the flowerstalk in preparation for the support   of the expanding flower                                66 224    ii the involucrumany kind of wrapping or   propping condition of leafage at the base of a   flower may properly come under this head but   the manner of prop or protection differs in different   kinds and i will not at present give generic   names to these peculiar forms    246   iii the calyx the hidingplacethe outer   whorl of leaves under the protection of which   the real flower is brought to maturity its separate   leaves are called sepals                                    80    iv the corolla the cupthe inner whorl of   leaves forming the flower itself its separate   leaves are called petals                                    71    v the treasurythe part of the flower that   contains its seeds    vi the pillarthe part of the flower above its   treasury by which the power of the pollen is   carried down to the seeds                                   78    it consists usually of two partsthe shaft and   volute                                                      78    when the pillar is composed of two or more shafts   attached to separate treasurycells each cell   with its shaft is called a carpel                          235    vii the stamensthe parts of the flower which   secrete its pollen                                          78    they consist usually of two parts the filament and   anther not yet described    viii the nectarythe part of the flower containing   its honey or any other special product   of its inflorescence the name has often been   247   given to certain forms of petals of which the   use is not yet known no notice has yet been   taken of this part of the flower in proserpina       these being all the essential parts of the flower itself   other forms and substances are developed in the seed as it   ripens which i believe may most conveniently be arranged   in a separate section though not logically to be   considered as separable from the flower but only as   mature states of certain parts of it     v the seed  i must once more desire the reader to take notice that under the four sections already defined the morphology of the plant is to be considered as complete and that we are now only to examine and name farther its product and that not so much as the germ of its own future descendant flower but as a separate substance which it is appointed to form partly to its own detriment for the sake of higher creatures this product consists essentially of two parts the seed and its husk    i the seeddefined                                      220    it consists in its perfect form of three parts           222       these three parts are not yet determinately named in   the text but i give now the names which will be usually   attached to them       a the sacquethe outside skin of a seed               221    248    b the nutrinea word which i coin for general   applicability whether to the farina of   corn the substance of a nut or the parts that   become the first leaves in a bean                          221    c the germthe origin of the root                     221    ii the huskdefined                                     222    consists like the seed when in perfect form of   three parts    a the skinthe outer envelope of all the   seed structures                                            222    b the rindthe central body of the husk          222235    c the shellnot always shelly yet best described   by this general term and becoming   a shell so called in nuts peaches dates and   other such kernelfruits                                   222    the products of the seed and husk of plants for   the use of animals are practically to be massed   under the three heads of bread oil and fruit   but the substance of which bread is made is   more accurately described as farina and the   pleasantness of fruit to the taste depends on two   elements in its substance the juice and the   pulp containing it which may properly be   called nectar and ambrosia we have therefore   in all four essential products of the seed   and husk    249   a farina    flour                                        227    b oleum     oil                                          229    c nectar    fruitjuice                                  229    d ambrosia  fruitsubstance                              230   besides these allimportant products of the seed others are formed in the stems and leaves of plants of which no account hitherto has been given in proserpina i delay any extended description of these until we have examined the structure of wood itself more closely this intricate and difficult task having been remitted p 195 to the days of coming spring and i am well pleased that my younger readers should at first be vexed with no more names to be learned than those of the vegetable productions with which they are most pleasantly acquainted but for older ones i think it well before closing the present volume to indicate with warning some of the obscurities and probable fallacies with which this vanity of science encumbers the chemistry no less than the morphology of plants  looking back to one of the first books in which our new knowledge of organic chemistry began to be displayed thirty years ago i find that even at that period the organic elements which the cuisine of the laboratory had already detected in simple indigo were the following 250    isatine bromisatine bidromisatine   chlorisatine bichlorisatine   chlorisatyde bichlorisatyde   chlorindine chlorindoptene chlorindatmit   chloranile chloranilam and chloranilammon  and yet with all this practical skill in decoction and accumulative industry in observation and nomenclature so far are our scientific men from arriving by any decoctive process of their own knowledge at general results useful to ordinary human creatures that when i wish now to separate for young scholars in first massive arrangement of vegetable productions the substances of plants from their essences that is to say the weighable and measurable body of the plant from its practically immeasurable if not imponderable spirit i find in my three volumes of closeprinted chemistry no information what ever respecting the quality of volatility in matter except this one sentence  the disposition of various substances to yield vapour is very different and the difference depends doubtless on the relative power of cohesion with which they are endowed67  even in this not extremely pregnant though extremely 251 cautious sentence two conditions of matter are confused no notice being taken of the difference in manner of dissolution between a vitally fragrant and a mortally putrid substance  it is still more curious that when i look for more definite instruction on such points to the higher ranks of botanists i find in the index to dr lindleys introduction to botanyseven hundred pages of close printnot one of the four words volatile essence scent or perfume i examine the index to grays structural and systematic botany with precisely the same success i next consult professors balfour and grindon and am met by the same dignified silence finally i think over the possible chances in french and try in figuiers indices to the histoire des plantes for odeurno such word parfumno such word essenceno such word encensno such word i try at last pois de senteur at a venture and am referred to a page which describes their going to sleep  left thus to my own resources i must be content for the present to bring the subject at least under safe laws of nomenclature it is possible that modern chemistry may be entirely right in alleging the absolute identity of substances such as albumen or fibrine whether they occur in the animal or vegetable economies but i do not choose to assume this identity in my nomenclature it may perhaps be very fine and very instructive to 252 inform the pupils preparing for competitive examination that the main element of milk is milkine and of cheese cheesine but for the practical purposes of life all that i think it necessary for the pupil to know is that in order to get either milk or cheese he must address himself to a cow and not to a pump and that what a chemist can produce for him out of dandelions or cocoanuts however milky or cheesy it may look may more safely be called by some name of its own  this distinctness of language becomes every day more desirable in the face of the refinements of chemical art which now enable the ingenious confectioner to meet the demands of an unscientific person for suppose a lemon drop with a mixture of nitric acid sulphur and stewed bones it is better whatever the chemical identity of the products may be that each should receive a distinctive epithet and be asked for and supplied in vulgar english and vulgar probity either as essence of lemons or skeletons  i intend thereforeand believe that the practice will be found both wise and convenientto separate in all my works on natural history the terms used for vegetable products from those used for animal or mineral ones whatever may be their chemical identity or resemblance in aspect i do not mean to talk of fat in seeds nor of flour in eggs nor of milk in rocks pace my prelatical friends i mean to use the word alb for vegetable albumen and although i cannot without pedantry avoid 253 using sometimes the word milky of the white juices of plants i must beg the

product and when i have occasion to speak of petroleum tallow or blubber i shall generally call these substances by their right names  there are also a certain number of vegetable materials more or less prepared secreted or digested for us by animals such as wax honey silk and cochineal the properties of these require more complex definitions but they have all very intelligible and wellestablished names tea must be a general term for an extract of any plant in boiling water though when standing alone the word will take its accepted chinese meaning and essence the general term for the condensed dew of a vegetable vapour which is with grace and fitness called the being of a plant because its properties are almost always characteristic of the species and it is not like leaf tissue or wood fibre approximately the same material in different shapes but a separate element in each family of flowers of a mysterious delightful or dangerous influence logically inexplicable

pretty way a real lily cant branch i believe but if not what is the use of the botanical books saying on an unbranched stem  2 i have by happy chance just added to my oxford library the poet grays copy of linnæus with its exquisitely written latin notes exemplary alike to scholar and naturalist  3 it was in the year 1860 in june  4 admirably engraved by mr burgess from my pen drawing now at oxford by comparing it with the plate of the same flower in sowerbys work the student will at once see the difference between attentive drawing which gives the cadence and relation of masses in a group and the mere copying of each flower in an unconsidered huddle  5 histoire des plantes ed 1865 p 416  6 the like of it i have now painted number 281 case xii in the educational series of oxford

small specimen of this mineral it is a useful type of many structures  12 lucca aug 9th 1874i have left this passage as originally written but i believe the dome is of accumulated earth bringing home here evening after evening heaps of all kinds of mosses from the hills among which the archbishop ruggieri was hunting the wolf and her whelps in ugolinos dream i am more and more struck every day with their special function as earthgatherers and with the enormous importance to their own brightness and to our service of that dark and degraded state of the inferior leaves and it fastens itself in my mind mainly as their distinctive character that as the leaves of a tree become wood so the leaves of a moss become earth while yet a normal part of the plant here is a cake in my hand weighing half a pound bright green on the surface with minute crisp leaves but an inch thick beneath in what looks at first like clay but is indeed knitted fibre of exhausted moss also i dont at all find the generalization i made from the botanical books likely to have occurred to me from the real things no moss leaves that i can find here give me the idea of resemblance to pineapple leaves nor do i see any through my weak lens clearly serrated but i do find a general tendency to run into a silky filamentous structure and in some especially on a small one gathered from the fissures in the marble of the cathedral white threads of considerable length at the extremities of the leaves of which threads i remember no drawing or notice in the botanical books figure 1 represents magnified a cluster of these leaves with the germinating stalk springing from their centre but my scrawl was tired and careless and for once mr burgess has copied too accurately  13 learn this word at any rate and if you know any greek learn also this group of words greek hôs rhiza en gê dipsôsêi which you may chance to meet with and even to think about some day  14 duhamel botanist of the last century tells us that wishing to preserve a field of good land from the roots of an avenue of elms which were exhausting it he cut a ditch between the field and avenue to intercept the roots but he saw with surprise those of the roots which had not been cut go down behind the slope of the ditch to keep out of the light go under the ditch and into the field again and the swiss naturalist bonnet said wittily apropos of a wonder of this sort that sometimes it was difficult to distinguish a cat from a rosebush  15 as the first great office of the mosses is the gathering of earth so that of the grasses is the binding of it theirs the enchanters toil not in vainmaking ropes out of seasand  16 drosidæ in our school nomenclature is the general name including the four great tribes iris asphodel amaryllis and lily see reason for this name given in the queen of the air section ii  17 the only use of a great part of our existing nomenclature is to enable one botanist to describe to another a plant which the other has not seen when the science becomes approximately perfect all known plants will be properly figured so that nobody need describe them and unknown plants be so rare that nobody will care to learn a new and difficult language in order to be able to give an account of what in all probability he will never see  18 an excellent book nevertheless  19 lindley introduction to botany vol i p 21 the terms

alonístena which is on our right the latter is much higher than kastaniá and like the other peaked summits of the mænalian range is covered with firs and deeply at present with snow the snow lies also in our pass at a fountain in the road the small village of bazeníko is half a mile on the right standing at the foot of the mænalian range and now covered with snow  saetá is the most lofty of the range of mountains which are in face of levídhi to the northward and eastward they are all a part of the chain which extends from mount khelmós and connects that great summit with artemisium parthenium and parnon mount saetá is covered with firs the mountain between the plain of levídhi and alonístena or to speak by the ancient nomenclature that part of the mænalian range which separates the orchomenia from the valleys of helisson and methydrium is clothed also with large forests of the same trees the road across this ridge from lavídhi to alonístena is now impracticable on account of the snow  i am detained all day at levídhi by a heavy fall of snow which before the evening has covered the ground to half a foot in depth although the village is not much elevated above the plain nor in a more lofty situation than tripolitzá  march 4thyesterday afternoon and during the night the snow fell in such quantities as to cover all the plains and adjacent mountains and the country exhibited this morning as fine a snowscene as norway could supply as the day advanced and the sun appeared the snow melted rapidly but the sky was soon overcast again and the snow began to fall  23 just in time finding a heap of gold under an oak tree some thousand years old near arundel ive made them out eight divided by three that is to say three couples of petals with two odd little ones

26 the mathematical term is rhomb  27 greek hês to sperma artopoieitai  28 greek epimêkes echousa to kephalion dioscorides makes no effort to distinguish species but gives the different names as if merely used in different places  29 it is also used sometimes of the garden poppy says dioscorides greek dia to rhein ex autês ton oponbecause the sap opium flows from it  30 see all the passages quoted by liddell  31 i find this chapter rather tiresome on rereading it myself and cancel some farther criticism of the imitation of this passage by virgil one of the few pieces of the Æneid which are purely and vulgarly imitative rendered also false as well as weak by the introducing sentence volvitur euryalus leto after which the simile of the drooping flower is absurd of criticism the chief use of which is to warn all sensible men from such business the following abstract of diderots notes on the passage given in the saturday review for april 29th 1871 is worth preserving was the french critic really not aware that homer had written the lines his own way  diderot illustrates his theory of poetical hieroglyphs by no quotations but we can show the manner of his minute and sometimes fanciful criticism by repeating his analysis of the passage of virgil wherein the death of euryalus is described                   pulchrosque per artus   it cruor inque humeros cervix collapsa recumbit   purpureus veluti cum flos succisus aratro   languescit moriens lassove papavera collo   demisere caput pluvia cum forte gravantur  the sound of it cruor according to diderot suggests the image of a jet of blood cervix collapsa recumbit the fall of a dying mans head upon his shoulder succisus imitates the use of a cutting scythe not plough demisere is as soft as the eye of a flower gravantur on the other hand has all the weight of a calyx filled with rain collapsa marks an effort and a fall and similar double duty is performed by papavera the first two syllables symbolizing the poppy upright the last two the poppy bent while thus pursuing his minute investigations diderot can scarcely help laughing at himself and candidly owns that he is open to the suspicion of discovering in the poem beauties which have no existence he therefore qualifies his eulogy by pointing out two faults in the passage gravantur notwithstanding the praise it has received is a little too heavy for the light head of a poppy even when filled with water as for aratro coming as it does after the hiss of succisus it is altogether abominable had homer written the lines he would have ended with some hieroglyph which would have continued the hiss or described the fall of a flower to the hiss of succisus diderot is warmly attached not by mistake but in order to justify the sound he ventures to translate aratrum into scythe boldly and rightly declaring in a marginal note that this is not the meaning of the word  32 and i have too harshly called our english vines wicked weeds of kent in fors clavigera xxvii 11 much may be said for ale when we brew it for our people honestly  33 has my reader ever thoughti never did till this momenthow it perfects the exquisite character which scott himself loved as he invented till he changed the form of the novel that his habitual interjection should be this wordnot but that the oath by conscience was happily still remaining then in scotland taking the place of the mediæval by st andrew we in england long before the scot having lost all sense of the puritanical appeal to private conscience as of the catholic oath by st george and our uncanonized by george in sonorous rudeness ratifying not now our common conscience but our individual opinion  34 jotham sum perfectio eorum or consummatio eorum interpretation of name in vulgate

creeping in it than in a furzebush but it especially haunts foul and neglected ground so i keep the latin name translating wastethistle i could not show the variety of the curves of the involucre without enlarging and if on this much increased scale i had tried to draw the flower it would have taken mr allen and me a good months more work and i had no more a month than a life to spare so the action only of the spreading flower is indicated but the involucre drawn with precision  39 the florets gathered in the daisy are cinquefoils examined closely no system founded on colour can be very general or unexceptionable but the splendid purples of the pansy and thistle which will be made one of the lower composite groups under margarita may justify the general assertion of this orders being purple  40 see miss yonges exhaustive account of the name history of christian names vol i p 265  41 du cange the word margarete is given as heraldic english for pearl by lady juliana berners in the book of st albans  42 recent botanical research makes this statement more than dubitable nevertheless on no other supposition can the forms and action of treebranches so far as at present known to me be yet clearly accounted for  43 not always in muscular power but the framework on which strong muscles are to act as that of an insects wing or its jaw is never insectile  44 it is one of the three

cantando e scegliendo fior di fiore   onde era picta tutta la sua viapurg xxviii 35  55 greek kai theoisi terpna  56 the four races of this order are more naturally distinct than botanists have recognized in clarissa the petal is cloven into a fringe at the outer edge in lychnis the petal is terminated in two rounded lobes and the fringe withdrawn to the top of the limb in scintilla the petal is divided into two sharp lobes without any fringe of the limb and in mica the minute and scarcely visible flowers have simple and far separate petals the confusion of these four great natural races under the vulgar or accidental botanical names of spittleplant shoreplant sand plant etc has become entirely intolerable by any rational student but the names scintilla substituted for stellaria and mica for the utterly ridiculous and probably untrue sagina connect themselves naturally with lychnis in expression of the luminous power of the white and sparkling blossoms  57 clytia will include all the true sunflowers and falconia the hawkweeds but i have not yet completed the analysis of this vast and complex order so as to determine the limits of margarita and alcestis  58 the reader must observe that the positions given in this more developed system to any flower do not interfere with arrangements either formerly or hereafter given for memoria technica the name of the pea for instance alata is to be learned first among the twelve cinqfoils p 214 above then transferred to its botanical place  59 the amphibious habit of this race is to me of more importance than its outlaid structure  60 arctostaphylos alpina i believe but scarcely recognize the flower in my botanical books  61 aurora regina changed from rhododendron ferrugineum  62 i do not see what this can mean primroses and
