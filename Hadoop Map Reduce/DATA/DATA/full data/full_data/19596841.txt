19596841	the ancient allan  by h rider haggard  first published 1920     chapter i an old friend  now i allan quatermain come to the weirdest with one or two exceptions perhaps of all the experiences which it has amused me to employ my idle hours in recording here in a strange land for after all england is strange to me i grow elderly i have as i suppose passed the period of enterprise and adventure and i should be well satisfied with the lot that fate has given to my unworthy self  to begin with i am still alive and in health when by all the rules i should have been dead many times over i suppose i ought to be thankful for that but before expressing an opinion on the point i should have to be quite sure whether it is better to be alive or dead the religious plump for the latter though i have never observed that the religious are more eager to die than the rest of us poor mortals  for instance if they are told that their holy hearts are wrong they spend time and much money in rushing to a place called nauheim in germany to put them right by means of waterdrinking thereby shortening their hours of heavenly bliss and depriving their heirs of a certain amount of cash the same thing applies to buxton in my own neighbourhood and gout especially when it threatens the stomach or the throat even archbishops will do these things to say nothing of such small fry as deans or stout and prominent lay figures of the church  from common sinners like myself such conduct might be expected but in the case of those who are obviously poised on the topmost rungs of the jacobeani mean the heavenlyladder it is legitimate to inquire why they show such reluctance in jumping off as a matter of fact the only persons that individually i have seen quite willing to die except now and again to save somebody else whom they were so foolish as to care for more than they did for themselves have been not those upon whom the light has shined to quote an earnest paper i chanced to read this morning but to quote again the sinful heathen wandering in their native blackness by which i understand the writer to refer to their moral state and not to their sable skins wherein for the most part they are also condemned to wander that is if they happen to have been born south of a certain degree of latitude  to come to facts the staff of faith which each must shape for himself is often hewn from unsuitable kinds of wood yes even by the very best among us willow for instance is pretty and easy to cut but try to support yourself with it on the edge of a precipice and see where you are then of a truth you will long for ironbark or even homely oak i might carry my parable further some allusions to the proper material of which to fashion the helmet of salvation suggest themselves to me for example but i wont  the truth is that we fear to die because all the religions are full of uncomfortable hints as to what may happen to us afterwards as a reward for our deviations from their laws and we half believe in something whereas often the savage not being troubled with religion fears less because he half believes in nothing for very few inhabitants of this earth can attain either to complete belief or to its absolute opposite they can seldom lay their hands upon their hearts and say they know that they will live for ever or sleep for ever there remains in the case of most honest men an element of doubt in either hypothesis  that is what makes this story of mine so interesting at any rate to me since it does seem to suggest that whether or no i have a future as personally i hold to be the case and not altogether without evidence certainly i have had a past though so far as i know in this world only a fact if it be a fact from which can be deduced all kinds of arguments according to the taste of the reasoner  and now for my experience which it is only fair to add may after all have been no more than a long and connected dream yet how was i to dream of lands events and people where of i have only the vaguest knowledge or none at all unless indeed as some say being a part of this world we have hidden away somewhere in ourselves an acquaintance with everything that has ever happened in the world however it does not much matter and it is useless to discuss that which we cannot prove  here at any rate is the story   in a book or a record which i have written down and put away with others under the title of the ivory child i have told the tale of a certain expedition i made in company with lord ragnall its object was to search for his wife who was stolen away while travelling in egypt in a state of mental incapacity resulting from shock caused by the loss of her child under tragic and terrible circumstances the thieves were the priests of a certain bastard arab tribe who on account of a birthmark shaped like the young moon which was visible above her breast believed her to be the priestess or oracle of their worship this worship evidently had its origin in ancient egypt since although they did not seem to know it the priestess was nothing less than a personification of the great goddess isis and the ivory child their fetish was a statue of the infant horus the fabled son of isis and osiris whom the egyptians looked upon as the overcomer of set or the devil the murderer of osiris before his resurrection and ascent to heaven to be the god of the dead  i need not set down afresh all that happened to us on this remarkable adventure suffice it to say that in the end we recovered the lady and that her mind was restored to her before she left the kendah country however the priesthood presented her with two ancient rolls of papyrus also with a quantity of a certain herb not unlike tobacco in appearance which by the kendah was called taduki once before we took our great homeward journey across the desert lady ragnall and i had a curious conversation about this herb whereof the property is to cause the person who inhales its fumes to become clairvoyant or to dream dreams whichever the truth may be it was used for this purpose in the mystical ceremonies of the kendah religion when under its influence the priestess or oracle of the ivory child was wont to announce divine revelations during her tenure of this office lady ragnall was frequently subjected to the spell of the taduki vapour and said strange things some of which i heard with my own ears also myself once i experienced its effects and saw a curious vision whereof many of the particulars were afterwards translated into facts  now the conversation which i have mentioned was shortly to the effect that she lady ragnall believed a time would come when she or i or both of us were destined to imbibe these taduki fumes and see wonderful pictures of some past or future existence in which we were both concerned this knowledge she declared had come to her while she was officiating in an apparently mindless condition as the priestess of the kendah god called the ivory child  at the time i did not think it wise to pursue so exciting a subject with a woman whose mind had been recently unbalanced and afterwards in the stress of new experiences i forgot all about the matter or at any rate only thought of it very rarely  once however it did recur to me with some force shortly after i came to england to spend my remaining days far from the temptations of adventure i was beguiled into becoming a steward of a charity dinner and what was worse into attending the said dinner although its objects were admirable it proved one of the most dreadful functions in which i was ever called upon to share there was a vast number of people some of them highly distinguished who had come to support the charity or to show off their orders i dont know which and others like myself not at all distinguished just common subscribers who had no orders and stood about the crowded room like waiters looking for a job  at the dinner which was very bad i sat at a table so remote that i could hear but little of the interminable speeches which was perhaps fortunate for me in these circumstances i drifted into conversation with my neighbour a queer wizened blackbearded man who somehow or other had found out that i was acquainted with the wilder parts of africa he proved to be a wealthy scientist whose passion it was to study the properties of herbs especially of such as grow in the interior of south america where he had been travelling for some years  presently he mentioned a root named yagé known to the indians which when pounded up into a paste and taken in the form of pills had the effect of enabling the patient to see events that were passing at a distance indeed he alleged that a vision thus produced had caused him to return home since in it he saw that some relative of his i think a twinsister was dangerously ill in fact however he might as well have stayed away as he only arrived in london on the day after her funeral  as i saw that he was really interested in the subject and observed that he was a very temperate man who did not seem to be romancing i told him something of my experiences with taduki to which he listened with a kind of rapt but suppressed excitement when i affected disbelief in the whole business he differed from me almost rudely asking why i rejected phenomena simply because i was too dense to understand them i answered perhaps because such phenomena were inconvenient and upset ones ideas to this he replied that all progress involved the upsetting of existent ideas moreover he implored me if the chance should ever come my way to pursue experiments with taduki fumes and let him know the results  here our conversation came to an end for suddenly a band that was braying near by struck up god save the queen and we hastily exchanged cards and parted i only mention it because had it not occurred i think it probable that i should never have been in a position to write this history  the remarks of my acquaintance remained in my mind and influenced it so much that when the occasion came i did as a kind of duty what however much i was pressed i am almost sure i should never have done for any other reason just because i thought that i ought to take an opportunity of trying to discover what was the truth of the matter as it chanced it was quick in coming  here i should explain that i attended the dinner of which i have spoken not very long after a very lengthy absence from england whither i had come to live when king solomons mines had made me rich therefore it happened that between the conclusion of my kendah adventure some years before and this time i saw nothing and heard little of lord and lady ragnall once a rumour did reach me however i think through sir henry curtis or captain good that the former had died as a result of an accident what the accident was my informant did not know and as i was just starting on a far journey at the time i had no opportunity of making inquiries my talk with the botanical scientist determined me to do so indeed a few days later i discovered from a book of reference that lord ragnall was dead leaving no heir also that his wife survived him  i was working myself up to write to her when one morning the postman brought me here at the grange a letter which had ragnall castle printed on the flap of the envelope i did not know the writing which was very clear and firm for as it chanced to the best of my recollection i had never seen that of lady ragnall here is a copy of the letter it contained    my dear mr quatermainvery strangely i have just seen at a   meeting of the horticultural society a gentleman who declares   that a few days ago he sat next to you at some public dinner   indeed i do not think there can be any doubt for he showed me your   card which he had in his purse with a yorkshire address upon it   a dispute had arisen as to whether a certain variety of crinum   lily was first found in africa or southern america this   gentleman an authority upon south american flora made a speech   saying that he had never met with it there but that an   acquaintance of his mr quatermain to whom he had spoken on the   subject said that he had seen something of the sort in the   interior of africa this was quite true for i remembered the   incident at the tea which followed the meeting i spoke to this   gentleman whose name i never caught and to my astonishment learnt   that he must have been referring to you whom i believed to be   dead for so we were told a long time ago this seemed certain   for in addition to the evidence of the name he described your   personal appearance and told me that you had come to live in   england   my dear friend i can assure you it is long since i heard anything   which rejoiced me so much oh as i write all the past comes back   flowing in upon me like a pentup flood of water but i trust that   of this i shall soon have an opportunity of talking to you so let   it be for a while   alas my friend since we parted on the shores of the red sea   tragedy has pursued me as you will know for both my husband and   i wrote to you although you did not answer the letters i never   received them we reached england safely and took up our old   life again though to tell you the truth after my african   experiences things could never be quite the same to me or for the   matter of that to george either to a great extent he changed his   pursuits and certain political ambitions which he once cherished   seemed no longer to appeal to him he became a student of past   history and especially of egyptology which under all the   circumstances you may think strange as i did however it suited   me well enough since i also have tastes that way so we worked   together and i can now read hieroglyphics as well as most people   one year he said that he would like to go to egypt again if i   were not afraid i answered that it had not been a very lucky   place for us but that personally i was not in the least afraid   and longed to return there for as you know i have or think i   have ties with egypt and indeed with all africa well we went   and had a very happy time although i was always expecting to see   old harût come round the corner   after this it became a custom with us who since george   practically gave up shooting and attending the house of lords had   nothing to keep us in england to winter in egypt we did this for   five years in succession living in a bungalow which we built at a   place in the desert not far from the banks of the nile about   half way between luxor which was the ancient thebes and assouan   george took a great fancy to this spot when first he saw it and   so in truth did i for like memphis it attracted me so much that   i used to laugh and say i believed that once i had something to do   with it   now near to our villa that we called ragnall after this house   are the remains of a temple which were almost buried in the sand   this temple george obtained permission to excavate it proved to   be a long and costly business but as he did not mind spending the   money that was no obstacle for four winters we worked at it   employing several hundred men as we went on we discovered that   although not one of the largest the temple owing to its having   been buried by the sand during or shortly after the roman epoch   remained much more perfect than we had expected because the early   christians had never got at it with their chisels and hammers   before long i hope to show you pictures and photographs of the   various courts etc so i will not attempt to describe them now   it is a temple to isisbuilt or rather rebuilt over the remains   of an older temple on a site that seems to have been called amada   at any rate in the later days and so named after a city in nubia   apparently by one of the amenhetep pharaohs who had conquered it   its style is beautiful being of the best period of the egyptian   renaissance under the last native dynasties   at the beginning of the fifth winter at length we approached the   sanctuary a difficult business because of the retaining walls   that had to be built to keep the sand from flowing down as fast as   it was removed and the great quantities of stuff that must be   carried off by the tramway in so doing we came upon a shallow   grave which appeared to have been hastily filled in and roughly   covered over with paving stones like the rest of the court as   though to conceal its existence in this grave lay the skeleton of   a large man together with the rusted blade of an iron sword and   some fragments of armour evidently he had never been mummified   for there were no wrappings canopic jars ushapti figures or   funeral offerings the state of the bones showed us why for the   right forearm was cut through and the skull smashed in also an   iron arrowhead lay among the ribs the man had been buried   hurriedly after a battle in which he had met his death searching   in the dust beneath the bones we found a gold ring still on one of   the fingers on its bezel was engraved the cartouche of peroa   beloved of ra now peroa probably means pharaoh and perhaps he   was khabasha who revolted against the persians and ruled for a   year or two after which he is supposed to have been defeated and   killed though of his end and place of burial there is no record   whether these were the remnants of khabasha himself or of one of   his high ministers or generals who wore the kings cartouche upon   his ring in token of his office of course i cannot say   when george had read the cartouche he handed me the ring which i   slipped upon the first finger of my left hand where i still wear   it then leaving the grave open for further examination we went   on with the work for we were greatly excited at length this was   towards evening we had cleared enough of the sanctuary which was   small to uncover the shrine that if not a monolith was made of   four pieces of granite so wonderfully put together that one could   not see the joints on the curved architrave as i think it is   called was carved the symbol of a winged disc and beneath in   hieroglyphics as fresh as though they had only been cut yesterday   an inscription to the effect that peroa royal son of the sun   gave this shrine as an excellent eternal work together with the   statues of the holy mother and the holy child to the emanations   of the great goddess isis and the god horus amada royal lady   being votaress or highpriestess   we only read the hieroglyphics very hurriedly being anxious to   see what was within the shrine that the cedar door having rotted   away was filled with fine drifted sand basketful by basketful   we got it out and then my friend there appeared the most   beautiful lifesized statue of isis carved in alabaster that ever   i have seen she was seated on a thronelike chair and wore the   vulture cap on which traces of colour remained her arms were held   forward as though to support a child which perhaps she was   suckling as one of the breasts was bare but if so the child had   gone the execution of the statue was exquisite and its tender and   mystic face extraordinarily beautiful so lifelike also that i   think it must have been copied from a living model oh my friend   when i looked upon it which we did by the light of the candles   for the sun was sinking and shadows gathered in that excavated   hole i feltnever mind what i feltperhaps you can guess who   know my history   while we stared and stared i longing to go upon my knees i knew   not why suddenly i felt a faint trembling of the ground at the   same moment the head overseer of the works a man called achmet   rushed up to us shouting outback back the wall has burst   the sand runs   he seized me by the arm and dragged me away beside of and behind   the grave george turning to follow next instant i saw a kind of   wave of sand on the crest of which appeared the stones of the   wall curl over and break it struck the shrine overturned and   shattered it which makes me think it was made of four pieces and   shattered also the alabaster statue within for i saw its head   strike george upon the back and throw him forward he reeled and   fell into the open grave which in another moment was filled and   covered with the débris that seemed to grip me to my middle in its   flow after this i remembered nothing more until hours later i   found myself lying in our house   achmet and his egyptians had done nothing indeed none of them   could be persuaded to approach the place till the sun rose   because as they said the old gods of the land whom they looked   upon as devils were angry at being disturbed and would kill them   as they had killed the bey meaning george then distracted as i   was i went myself for there was no other european there to find   that the whole site of the sanctuary was buried beneath hundreds   of tons of sand that beginning at the gap in the broken wall   had flowed from every side indeed it would have taken weeks to   dig it out since to sink a shaft was impracticable and so   dangerous that the local officials refused to allow it to be   attempted the end of it was that an english bishop came up from   cairo and consecrated the ground by special arrangement with the   government which of course makes it impossible that this part of   the temple should be further disturbed after this he read the   burial service over my dear husband   so there is the end of a very terrible story which i have written   down because i do not wish to have to talk about it more than is   necessary when we meet for dear mr quatermain we shall meet   as i always knew that we shouldyes even after i heard that you   were dead you will remember that i told you so years ago in   kendah land and that it would happen after a great change in my   life though what that change might be i could not say   this is the end of the letter except for certain suggested dates for the visit which she took for granted i should make to ragnall     chapter ii ragnall castle  when i had finished reading this amazing document i lit my pipe and set to work to think it over the hypothetical inquirer might ask why i thought it amazing there was nothing odd in a dilettante englishman of highly cultivated mind taking to egyptology and being as it chanced one of the richest men in the kingdom spending a fraction of his wealth in excavating temples nor was it strange that he should have happened to die by accident when engaged in that pursuit which i can imagine to be very fascinating in the delightful winter climate of egypt he was not the first person to be buried by a fall of sand why only a little while ago the same fate overtook a nurserygoverness and the child in her charge who were trying to dig out a martins nest in a pit in this very parish their operations brought down a huge mass of the overhanging bank beneath which the sandvein had been hollowed by workmen who deserted the pit when they saw that it had become unsafe next day i and my gardeners helped to recover their bodies for their whereabouts was not discovered until the following morning and a sad business it was  yet taken in conjunction with the history of this couple the whole ragnall affair was very strange when but a child lady ragnall then the hon miss holmes had been identified by the priests of a remote african tribe as the oracle of their peculiar faith which we afterwards proved to be derived from old egypt in short the worship of isis and horus subsequently they tried to steal her away and through the accident of my intervention failed later on after her marriage when shock had deprived her of her mind these priests renewed the attempt this time in egypt and succeeded in the end we rescued her in central africa where she was playing the part of the mothergoddess isis and even wearing her ancient robes next she and her husband came home with their minds turned towards a branch of study that took them back to egypt here they devote themselves to unearthing a temple and find out that among all the gods of egypt who seem to have been extremely numerous it was dedicated to isis and horus the very divinities with whom they recently they had been so intimately concerned if in traditional and degenerate forms  moreover that was not the finish of it they come to the sanctuary they discover the statue of the goddess with the child gone as their child was gone a disaster occurs and both destroys and buries ragnall so effectually that nothing of him is ever seen again he just vanishes into another mans grave and remains there  a common sort of catastrophe enough it is true though people of superstitious mind might have thought that it looked as though the goddess or whatever force was behind the goddess was working vengeance on the man who desecrated her ancient shrine and by the way though i cannot remember whether or no i mentioned it in the ivory child i recall that the old priest of the kendah harût once told me he was sure ragnall would meet with a violent death this seemed likely enough in that country under our circumstances there still i asked him why he answered  because he has laid hands on that which is holy and not meant for man and he looked at lady ragnall  i remarked that all women were holy whereon he replied that he did not think so and changed the subject  well ragnall who had married the lady who once served as the last priestess of isis upon earth was killed whereas she the priestess was almost miraculously preserved from harm andoh the whole story was deuced odd and that is all poor ragnall he was a great english gentleman and one whom when first i knew him i held to be the most fortunate person i ever met endowed as he was with every advantage of mind body and estate yet in the end this did not prove to be the case well while he lived he was a good friend and a good fellow and none can hope for a better epitaph in a world where all things are soon forgotten  and now what was i to do to tell the truth i did not altogether desire to reopen this chapter in past history or to have to listen to painful reminiscences from the lips of a bereaved woman moreover beautiful as she had been for doubtless she was passée now and charming as of course she remainedi do not think i ever knew anyone who was quite so charmingthere was something about lady ragnall which alarmed me she did not resemble any other woman of course no woman is ever quite like another but in her case the separateness if i may so call it was very marked it was as though she had walked out of a different age or even world and been but superficially clothed with the attributes of our own i felt that from the first moment i set eyes upon her and while reading her letter the sensation returned with added force  also for me she had a peculiar attraction and not one of the ordinary kind it is curious to find oneself strangely intimate with a person of whom after all one does not know much just as if one really knew a great deal that was shut off by a thin but quite impassable door if so i did not want to open that door for who could tell what might be on the other side of it and intimate conversations with a lady in whose company one has shared very strange experiences not infrequently lead to the opening of every kind of door  further i had made up my mind some time ago to have no more friendships with women who are so full of surprises but to live out the rest of my life in a kind of monastery of men who have few surprises being creatures whose thoughts are nearly always open and whose actions can always be foretold  lastly there was that taduki business well there at any rate i was clear and decided no earthly power would induce me to have anything more to do with taduki smoke of course i remembered that lady ragnall once told me kindly but firmly that i would if she wished but that was just where she made a mistake for the rest it seemed unkind to refuse her invitation now when she was in trouble especially as i had once promised that if ever i could be of help she had only to command me no i must go but if that wordtadukiwere so much as mentioned i would leave again in a hurry moreover it would not be for doubtless she had forgotten all about the stuff by now even if it were not lost  the end of it was that as i did not wish to write a long letter entering into all that lady ragnall had told me i sent her a telegram saying that if convenient to her i would arrive at the castle on the following saturday evening and adding that i must be back here on the tuesday afternoon as i had guests coming to stay with me on that day this was perfectly true as the season was midnovember and i was to begin shooting my coverts on the wednesday morning a function that once fixed cannot be postponed  in due course an answer arriveddelighted but hoped that you would have been able to stay longer    behold me then about six oclock on the said saturday evening being once more whirled by a splendid pair of horses through the gateway arch of ragnall castle the carriage stopped beneath the portico the great doors flew open revealing the glow of the hall fire and lights within the footman sprang down from the box and two other footmen descended the steps to assist me and my belongings out of the carriage these i remember consisted of a handbag with my dress clothes and a yellowbacked novel  so one of them took the handbag and the other had to content himself with the novel which made me wish i had brought a portmanteau as well if only for the look of the thing the pair thus burdened escorted me up the steps and delivered me over to the butler who scanned me with a critical eye i scanned him also and perceived that he was a very fine specimen of his class indeed his stately presence so overcame me that i remarked nervously as he helped me off with my coat that when last i was here another had filled his office  indeed sir he said and what was his name sir  savage i replied  and where might he be now sir  inside a snake i answered at least he was inside a snake but now i hope he is waiting upon his master in heaven  the man recoiled a little pulling off my coat with a jerk then he coughed rubbed his bald head stared and recovering himself with an effort said  indeed sir i only came to this place after the death of his late lordship when her ladyship changed all the household alfred show this gentleman up to her ladyships boudoir and william take hisbaggageto the blue room her ladyship wishes to see you at once sir before the others come  so i went up the big staircase to a part of the castle that i did not remember wondering who the others might be almost could i have sworn that the shade of savage accompanied me up those stairs i could feel him at my side  presently a door was thrown open and i was ushered into a room somewhat dimly lit and full of the scent of flowers by the fire near a teatable stood a lady clad in some dark dress with the light glinting on her richhued hair she turned and i saw that she still wore the necklace of red stones and beneath it on her breast a single red flower for this was lady ragnall about that there was no doubt at all so little doubt indeed that i was amazed i had expected to see a stout elderly woman whom i should only know by the colour of her eyes and her voice and perhaps certain tricks of manner but this was the mischief of it i could not perceive any change at any rate in that light she was just the same perhaps a little fuller in figure which was an advantage perhaps a little more considered in her movements perhaps a little taller or at any rate more stately and that was all  these things i learned in a flash then with a murmured mr quatermain my lady the footman closed the door and she saw me  moving quickly towards me with both her hands outstretched she exclaimed in that honeysoft voice of hers  oh my dear friend stopped and added why you havent changed a bit  fossils wear well i replied but that is just what i was thinking of you  then it is very rude of you to call me a fossil when i am only approaching that stage oh i am glad to see you i am glad and she gave me both the outstretched hands  upon my word i felt inclined to kiss her and have wondered ever since if she would have been very angry i am not certain that she did not divine the inclination at any rate after a little pause she dropped my hands and laughed then she said  i must tell you at once a most terrible catastrophe has happened  instantly it occurred to me that she had forgotten having informed me by letter of all the details of her husbands death such things chance to people who have once lost their memory so i tried to look as sympathetic as i felt sighed and waited  its not so bad as all that she said with a little shake of her head reading my thought as she always had the power to do from the first moment we met we can talk about that afterwards its only that i hoped we were going to have a quiet two days and now the atterbysmiths are coming yes in half an hour five of them  the atterbysmiths i exclaimed for somehow i too felt disappointed who are the atterbysmiths  cousins of georges his nearest relatives they think he ought to have left them everything but he didnt because he could never bear the sight of them you see his property was unentailed and he left it all to me now the entire family is advancing to suggest that i should leave it to them as perhaps i might have done if they had not chosen to come just now  why didnt you put them off i asked  because i couldnt she answered with a little stamp of her foot otherwise do you suppose they would have been here they were far too clever they telegraphed after lunch giving the train by which they were to arrive but no address save charing cross i thought of moving up to the berkeley square house but it was impossible in the time also i didnt know how to catch you oh its most vexatious  perhaps they are very nice i suggested feebly  nice wait till you have seen them besides if they had been angels i did not want them just now but how selfish i am come and have some tea and you can stop longer that is if you live through the atterbysmiths who are worse than both the kendah tribes put together indeed i wish old harût were coming instead i should like to see harût again wouldnt you and suddenly the mystical look i knew so well gathered on her face  yes perhaps i should i replied doubtfully but i must leave by the first train on tuesday morning it goes at eight oclock i looked it up  then the atterbysmiths leave on monday if i have to turn them out of the house so we shall get one evening clear at any rate stop a minute and she rang the bell  the footman appeared as suddenly as though he had been listening at the door  alfred she said tell moxley he i discovered was the butler that when mr and mrs atterbysmith the two misses atterbysmith and the young mr atterbysmith arrive they are to be shown to their rooms tell the cook also to put off dinner till halfpast eight and if mr and mrs scroope arrive earlier tell moxley to tell them that i am sorry to be a little late but that i was delayed by some parish business now do you understand  yes my lady said alfred and vanished  he doesnt understand in the least remarked lady ragnall but so long as he doesnt show the atterbysmiths up here in which case he can go away with them on monday i dont care it will all work out somehow now sit down by the fire and lets talk weve got nearly an hour and twenty minutes and you can smoke if you like i learnt to in egypt and she took a cigarette from the mantelpiece and lit it  that hour and twenty minutes went like a flash for we had so much to say to each other that we never even got to the things we wanted to say for instance i began to tell her about king solomons mines which was a long story and she to tell me what happened after we parted on the shores of the red sea at least the first hour and a quarter went when suddenly the door opened and alfred in a somewhat frightened voice announcedmr and mrs atterbysmith the misses atterbysmith and mr atterbysmith junior  then he caught sight of his mistresss eye and fled  i looked and felt inclined to do likewise if only there had been another door but there wasnt and that which existed was quite full in the forefront came as senior like a bull leading the herd indeed his appearance was bulllike as my eye travelling from the expanse of white shirtfront they were all dressed for dinner to his red and massive countenance surmounted by two hornlike tufts of carroty hair informed me at a glance followed mrs as the british matron incarnate literally there seemed to be acres of her black silk below and white skin above on which set in filigree floated big green stones like islands in an ocean her countenance too though stupid was very stern and frightened me followed the progeny of this formidable pair they were tall and thin also red haired the girls whose age i could not guess in the least were exactly like each other which was not strange as afterwards i discovered that they were twins they had pale blue eyes and somehow reminded me of fish both of them were dressed in green and wore topaz necklaces the young man who seemed to be about one or two and twenty had also pale blue eyes in one of which he wore an eyeglass but his hair was sandy as though it had been bleached parted in the middle and oiled down flat  for a moment there was a silence which i felt to be dreadful then in a big pompous voice as père said  how do you do my dear luna as i ascertained from the footman that you had not yet gone to dress i insisted upon his leading us here for a little private conversation after we have been parted for so many years we wished to offer you our condolences in person on your and our still recent loss  thank you said lady ragnall but i think we have corresponded on the subject which is painful to me  i fear that we are interrupting a smoking party thomas said mrs as in a cold voice sniffing at the air for all the world like a suspicious animal whereon the five of them stared at lady ragnalls cigarette which she held between her fingers  yes said lady ragnall wont you have one mr quatermain hand mrs smith the box please  i obeyed automatically proffering it to the lady who nearly withered me with a glance and then to each to each in turn to my relief the young man took one  archibald said his mother you are surely not going to make your sisters dresses smell of tobacco just before dinner  archibald sniggered and replied  a little more smoke will not make any difference in this room ma  that is true darling said mrs as and was straightway seized with a fit of asthma  after this i am sure i dont know what happened for muttering something about its being time to dress i rushed from the room and wandered about until i could find someone to conduct me to my own where i lingered until i heard the dinnerbell ring but even this retreat was not without disaster for in my hurry i trod upon one of the young ladys dresses i dont know whether it was dollys or pollys they were named dolly and polly and heard a dreadful crack about her middle as though she were breaking in two thereon archibald giggled again and dolly and polly remarked with one voicethey always spoke together  oh clumsy  to complete my misfortunes i missed my way going downstairs and strayed to and fro like a lost lamb until i found myself confronted by a green baize door which reminded me of something i stood staring at it till suddenly a vision arose before me of myself following a bell wire through that very door in the darkness of the night when in search for the late mr savage upon a certain urgent occasion yes there could be no doubt about it for look there was the wire and strange it seemed to me that i should live to behold it again curiosity led me to push the door open just to ascertain if my memory served me aright about the exact locality of the room next moment i regretted it for i fell straight into the arms of either polly or dolly  oh said she ive just been sewn up  i reflected that this was my case also in another sense but asked feebly if she knew the way downstairs  she didnt neither of us did till at length we met mrs smith coming to look for her  if i had been a burglar she could not have regarded me with graver suspicions but at any rate she knew the way downstairs and there to my joy i found my old friend scroope and his wife both of them grown stout and elderly but as jolly as ever after which the smith family ceased to trouble me  also there was the rector of the parish dr jeffreys and an absurdly young wife whom he had recently married a fluffyheaded little thing with round eyes and a cheerful perky manner the two of them together looked exactly like a turkeycock and a chicken i remembered him well enough and to my astonishment he remembered me perhaps because lady ragnall when she had hastily invited him to meet the smith family mentioned that i was coming lastly there was the curate a dark young man who seemed to be always brooding over the secrets of time and eternity though perhaps he was only thinking about his dinner or the next days services  well there we stood in that wellremembered drawingroom in which first i had made the acquaintance of harût and marût also of the beautiful miss holmes as lady ragnall was then called the scroopes the jeffreys and i gathered in one group and the atterbysmiths in another like a force about to attack while between the two brooding and indeterminate stood the curate a neutral observer  presently lady ragnall arrived apologizing for being late for some reason best known to herself she had chosen to dress as though for a great party i believe it was out of mischief and in order to show mrs atterbysmith some of the diamonds she was firmly determined that family should never inherit at any rate there she stood glittering and lovely and smiled upon us  then came dinner and once more i marched to the great hall in her company dr jeffreys got mrs smith papa smith got mrs jeffreys who looked like a grecian maiden walking into dinner with the minotaur scroope got one of the miss smiths she who wore a pink bow the gloomy curate got the other with a blue bow and archibald got mrs scroope who departed making faces at us over his shoulder  you look very grand and nice i said to lady ragnall as we followed the others at a discreet distance  i am glad she answered as to the nice i mean as for the grand that dreadful woman is always writing to me about the ragnall diamonds so i thought that she should see some of them for the first and last time do you know i havent worn these things since george and i went to court together and i daresay shall never wear them again for there is only one ornament i care for and i have got that on under my dress  i stared and her and with a laugh said that she was very mischievous  i suppose so she replied but i detest those people who are pompous and rude and have spoiled my party do you know i had half a mind to come down in the dress that i wore as isis in kendah land i have got it upstairs and you shall see me in it before you go for old times sake only it occurred to me that they might think me mad so i didnt dr jeffreys will you say grace please  well it was a most agreeable dinner so far as i was concerned for i sat between my hostess and mrs scroope and the rest were too far off for conversation moreover as archibald developed an unexpected quantity of small talk and scroope on the other side amused himself by filling pinkbow miss smiths innocent mind with preposterous stories about africa as had happened to me once before at this table lady ragnall and i were practically left undisturbed  isnt it strange that we should find ourselves sitting here again after all these years except that you are in my poor mothers place oh when that scientific gentleman convinced me the other day that you whom i had heard were dead were not only alive and well but actually in england really i could have embraced him  i thought of an answer but did not make it though as usual she read my mind for i saw her smile  the truth is she went on i am an only child and really have no friends though of course beingwell you know and she glanced at the jewels on her breast i have plenty of acquaintances  and suitors i suggested  yes she replied blushing as many as penelope not one of whom cares twopence about me any more than i care for them the truth is mr quatermain that nobody and nothing interest me except a spot in the churchyard yonder and another amid ruins in egypt  you have had sad bereavements i said looking the other way  very sad and they have left life empty still i should not complain for i have had my share of good also it isnt true to say that nothing interests me egypt interests me though after what has happened i do not feel as though i could return there all africa interests me and she added dropping her voice i can say it because i know you will not misunderstand you interest me as you have always done since the first moment i saw you  i i exclaimed staring at my own reflection in a silver plate which made me lookwell more unattractive than usual its very kind of you to say so but i cant understand why i should you have seen very little of me lady ragnall except in that long journey across the desert when we did not talk much since you were otherwise engaged  i know thats the odd part of it for i feel as though i had seen you for years and years and knew everything about you that one human being can know of another of course too i do know a good lot of your life through george and harût  harût was a great liar i said uneasily  was he i always thought him painfully truthful though how he got at the truth i do not know anyhow she added with meaning dont suppose i think the worse of you because others have thought so well women who seem to be all different generally i notice have this in common if one or two of them like a man the rest like him also because something in him appeals to the universal feminine instinct and the same applies to their dislike now men i think are different in that respect  perhaps because they are more catholic and charitable i suggested or perhaps because they like those who like them  she laughed in her charming way and said  however these remarks do not apply to you and me for as i think i told you once before in that cedar wood in kendah land where you feared lest i should catch a chill or becomeodd again it is another you with whom something in me seems to be so intimate  thats fortunate for your sake i muttered still staring at and pointing to the silver plate  again she laughed do you remember the taduki herb she asked i have plenty of it safe upstairs and not long ago i took a whiff of it only a whiff because you know it had to be saved  and what did you see  never mind the question is what shall we both see  nothing i said firmly no earthly power will make me breathe that unholy drug again  except me she murmured with sweet decision no dont think about leaving the house you cant there are no sunday trains besides you wont if i ask you not  in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird i replied firm as a mountain  is it then why are so many caught  at that moment the bull of bashani mean smith began to bellow something at his hostess from the other end of the table and our conversation came to an end  i say old chap whispered scroope in my ear when we stood up to see the ladies out i suppose you are thinking of marrying again well you might do worse and he glanced at the glittering form of lady ragnall vanishing through the doorway behind her guests  shut up you idiot i replied indignantly  why he asked with innocence marriage is an honourable estate especially when there is lots of the latter i remember saying something of the sort to you years ago and at this table when as it happened you also took in her ladyship only there was george in the wind then now it has carried him away  without deigning any reply i seized my glass and went to sit down between the canon and the bull of bashan     chapter iii allan gives his word  mr atterbysmith proved on acquaintance to be even worse than unfond fancy painted him he was a gentleman in a way and of good family whereof the real name was atterby the smith having been added to secure a moderate fortune left to him on that condition his connection with lord ragnall was not close and through the mothers side for the rest he lived in some southcoast wateringplace and fancied himself a sportsman because he had on various occasions hired a scottish moor or deer forest evidently he had never done anything nor earned a shilling during all his life and was bringing his family up to follow in his useless footsteps the chief note of his character was that intolerable vanity which so often marks men who have nothing whatsoever about which to be vain also he had a great idea of his rights and what was due to him which he appeared to consider included upon what ground i could not in the least understand the reversal of all the ragnall properties and wealth i do not think i need say any more about him except that he bored me to extinction especially after his fourth glass of port  perhaps however the son was worse for he asked questions without number and when at last i was reduced to silence lectured me about shooting yes this callow youth who was at sandhurst instructed me allan quatermain how to kill elephants he who had never seen an elephant except when he fed it with buns at the zoo at last mr smith who to scroopes great amusement had taken the end of the table and assumed the position of host gave the signal to move and we adjourned to the drawingroom  i dont know what had happened but there we found the atmosphere distinctly stormy the ample mrs smith sat in a chair fanning herself which caused the barbaric ornaments she wore to clank upon her fat arm upon either side of her pale and indeterminate stood polly and dolly each pretending to read a book somehow the three of them reminded me of a coatofarms seen in a nightmare british matron sejant with modesty and virtue as supporters opposite on the other side of the fire and evidently very angry stood lady ragnall regardant  do i understand you to say luna i heard mrs as ask in resonant tones as i entered the room that you actually played the part of a heathen goddess among these savages clad in a transparent bedrobe  yes mrs atterbysmith replied lady ragnall and a nightcap of feathers i will put it on for you if you wont be shocked or perhaps one of your daughters  oh said both the young ladies together please be quiet here come the gentlemen  after this there was a heavy silence broken only by the stifled giggles in the background of mrs scroope and the canons fluffyheaded wife who to do her justice had some fun in her thank goodness the evening or rather that part of it did not last long since presently mrs atterbysmith after studying me for a long while with a cold eye rose majestically and swept off to bed followed by her offspring  afterwards i ascertained from mrs scroope that lady ragnall had been amusing herself by taking away my character in every possible manner for the benefit of her connections who were left with a general impression that i was the chief of a native tribe somewhere in central africa where i dwelt in light attire surrounded by the usual accessories no wonder therefore that mrs as thought it best to remove her twin pets as she called them out of my ravening reach  then the scroopes went away having arranged for me to lunch with them on the morrow an invitation that i hastily accepted though i heard lady ragnall muttermean beneath her breath with them departed the canon and his wife and the curate being as they said early birds with duties to perform after this lady ragnall paid me out by going to bed having instructed moxley to show us to the smoking room where she whispered as she said good night i hope you will enjoy yourself  over the rest of the night i draw a veil for a solid hour and threequarters did i sit in that room between this dreadful pair being alternately questioned and lectured at length i could stand it no longer and while pretending to help myself to whiskey and soda slipped through the door and fled upstairs  i arrived late to breakfast purposely and found that i was wise for lady ragnall was absent upstairs recovering from a headache mr asmith was also suffering from a headache downstairs the result of champagne port and whisky mixed and all his family seemed to have pains in their tempers having ascertained that they were going to the church in the park i departed to one two miles away and thence walked straight on to the scroopes where i had a very pleasant time remaining till five in the afternoon i returned to tea at the castle where i found lady ragnall so cross that i went to church again to the six oclock service this time only getting back in time to dress for dinner here i was paid out for i had to take in mrs atterbysmith oh what a meal was that we sat for the most part in solemn silence broken only by requests to pass the salt i observed with satisfaction however that things were growing lively at the other end of the table where asmith père was drinking a good deal too much wine at last i heard him say  we had hoped to spend a few days with you my dear luna but as you tell us that your engagements make this impossibleand he paused to drink some port whereon lady ragnall remarked inconsequently  i assure you the ten oclock train is far the best and i have ordered the carriage at halfpast nine which is not very early  as your engagements make this impossible he repeated we would ask for the opportunity of a little family conclave with you tonight  here all of them turned and glowered at me  certainly said lady ragnall the sooner tis over the sooner to sleep mr quatermain i am sure will excuse us will you not i have had the museum lit up for you mr quatermain you may find some egyptian things there that will interest you  oh with pleasure i murmured and fled away  i spent a very instructive two hours in the museum studying various egyptian antiquities including a couple of mummies which rather terrified me they looked so very corpselike standing there in their wrappings one was that of a lady who was a singer of amen i remember i wondered where she was singing now and what song presently i came to a glass case which riveted my attention for above it was a label bearing the following words two papyri given to lady ragnall by the priests of the kendah tribe in africa within were the papyri unrolled and beneath each of the documents its translation so far as they could be translated for they were somewhat broken no 1 which was dated in the first year of peroa appeared to be the official appointment of the royal lady amada to be the prophetess to the temple of isis and horus the child which was also called amada and situated on the east bank of the nile above thebes evidently this was the same temple of which lady ragnall had written to me in her letter where her husband had met his death by accident a coincidence which made me start when i remembered how and where the document had come into her hands and what kind of office she filled at the time  the second papyrus or rather its translation contained a most comprehensive curse upon any man who ventured to interfere with the personal sanctity of this same royal lady of amada who apparently in virtue of her office was doomed to perpetual celibacy like the vestal virgins i do not remember all the terms of the curse but i know that it invoked the vengeance of isis the mother lady of the moon and horus the child upon anyone who should dare such a desecration and in so many words doomed him to death by violence far from his own country where first he had looked on ra ie the sun and also to certain spiritual sufferings afterwards  the document gave me the idea that it was composed in troubled days to protect that particularly sacred person the prophetess of isis whose cult as i have since learned was rising in egypt at the time from threatened danger perhaps at the hands of some foreign man it occurred to me even that this princess for evidently she was a descendant of kings had been appointed to a most sacred office for that very purpose men who shrink from little will often fear to incur the direct curse of widely venerated gods in order to obtain their desires even if they be not their own gods such were my conclusions about this curious and ancient writing which i regret i cannot give in full as i neglected to copy it at the time  i may add that it seemed extremely strange to me that it and the other which dealt with a particular temple in egypt should have passed into lady ragnalls hands over two thousand years later in a distant part of africa and that subsequently her husband should have been killed in her presence whilst excavating the very temple to which they referred whence too in all probability they were taken moreover oddly enough lady ragnall had herself for a while filled the rôle of isis in a shrine whereof these two papyri had been part of the sacred appurtenances for unknown ages and one of her official titles there was prophetess and lady of the moon whose symbol she wore upon her breast  although i have always recognized that there are a great many more things in the world than are dreamt of in our philosophy i say with truth and confidence that i am not a superstitious man yet i confess that these papers and the circumstances connected with them made me feel afraid  also they made me wish that i had not come to ragnall castle  well the atterbysmiths had so far effectually put a stop to any talk of such matters and even if lady ragnall should succeed in getting rid of them by that morning train as to which i was doubtful there remained but a single day of my visit during which it ought not to be hard to stave off the subject thus i reflected standing face to face with those mummies till presently i observed that the singer of amen who wore a staring gold mask seemed to be watching me with her oblong painted eyes to my fancy a sardonic smile gathered in them and spread to the mouth  thats what you think this smile seemed to say as once before you thought that fate could be escaped wait and see my friend wait and see  not in this room any way i remarked aloud and departed in a hurry down the passage which led to the main staircase  before i reached its end a remarkable sight caused me to halt in the shadow the atterbysmith family were going to bed en bloc they marched in single file up the great stair each of them carrying a hand candle papa led and young hopeful brought up the rear their countenances were full of war even the twins looked like angry lambs but something written on them informed me that they had suffered defeat recent and grievous so they vanished up the stairway and out of my ken for ever  when they had gone i started again and ran straight into lady ragnall if her guests had been angry it was clear that she was furious almost weeping with rage indeed moreover she turned and rent me  you are a wretch she said to run away and leave me all day long with those horrible people well they will never come here again for i have told them that if they do the servants have orders to shut the door in their faces  not knowing what to say i remarked that i had spent a most instructive evening in the museum which seemed to make her angrier than ever at any rate she whisked off without even saying good night and left me standing there afterwards i learned that the ass had calmly informed lady ragnall that she had stolen their property and demanded that as an act of justice she should make a will leaving everything she possessed to them and meanwhile furnish them with an allowance of £4000 a year what i did not learn were the exact terms of her answer  next morning alfred when he called me brought me a note from his mistress which i fully expected would contain a request that i should depart by the same train as her other guests its real contents however were very different    my dear friend it ran i am so ashamed of myself and so sorry   for my rudeness last night for which i deeply apologise if you   knew all that i had gone through at the hands of those dreadful   mendicants you would forgive melr   psi have ordered breakfast at 10 dont go down much before   for your own sake   somewhat relieved in my mind for i thought she was really angry with me not altogether without cause i rose dressed and set to work to write some letters while i was doing so i heard the wheels of a carriage beneath and opening my window saw the atterbysmith family in the act of departing in the castle bus smith himself seemed to be still enraged but the others looked depressed indeed i heard the wife of his bosom say to him  calm yourself my dear remember that providence knows what is best for us and that beggars on horseback are always unjust and ungrateful  to which her spouse replied  hold your infernal tongue will you and then began to rate the servants about the luggage  well off they went glaring through the door of the bus mr smith caught sight of me leaning out of the window seeing which i waved my hand to him in adieu his only reply to this courtesy was to shake his fist though whether at me or at the castle and its inhabitants in general i neither know nor care  when i was quite sure that they had gone and were not coming back again to find something they had forgotten i went downstairs and surprised a conclave between the butler moxley and his satellites reinforced by lady ragnalls maid and two other female servants  gratuities moxley was exclaiming which i thought a fine word for tips not a smell of them his gratuities weredamn your eyes you fat bottlewasher being his name for butler my eyes mind you ann not alfreds or williams and that because he had tumbled over his own rugs gentleman why i name him a hog with his litter  hogs dont have litters mr moxley observed ann smartly  well young woman if there werent no hogs thered be no litters so there however he wont root about in this castle no more for i happened to catch a word or two of what passed between him and her ladyship last night he said straight out that she was making love to that little mr quatermain who wanted her money and probably not for the first time as they had forgathered in africa a gentleman mind you ann who although peculiar i like and who the keeper charles tells me is the best shot in the whole world  and what did she say to that asked ann  what did she say what didnt she say thats the question it was just as though all the furniture in the room got up and went for them smiths well having heard enough and more than i wanted i stepped off with the tray and next minute out they all come and grab the bedroom candlesticks thats all and theres her ladyships bell alfred dont stand gaping there but go and light the hotplates  so they melted away and i descended from the landing indignant but laughing no wonder that lady ragnall lost her temper  ten minutes later she arrived in the diningroom waving a lighted ribbon that disseminated perfume  what on earth are you doing i asked  fumigating the house she said it is unnecessary as i dont think they were infectious but the ceremony has a moral significancelike incense anyway it relieves my feelings  then she laughed and threw the remains of the ribbon into the fire adding  if you say a word about those people ill leave the room  i think we had one of the jolliest breakfasts i ever remember to begin with we were both hungry since our miseries of the night before had prevented us from eating any dinner indeed she swore that she had scarcely tasted food since saturday then we had such a lot to talk about with short intervals we talked all that day either in the house or while walking through the gardens and grounds passing through the latter i came to the spot on the back drive where once i had saved her from being abducted by harût and marût and as i recognized it uttered an exclamation she asked me why and the end of it was that i told her all that story which to this moment she had never heard for ragnall had thought well to keep it from her  she listened intently then said  so i owe you more than i knew yet im not sure for you see i was abducted after all also if i had been taken there probably george would never have married me or seen me again and that might have been better for him  why i asked you were all the world to him  is any woman ever all the world to a man mr quatermain  i hesitated expecting some attack  dont answer she went on it would be too long and you wouldnt convince me who have been in the east however he was all the world to me therefore his welfare was what i wished and wish and i think he would have had more of it if he had never married me  why i asked again  because i brought him no good luck did i i neednt go through all the story as you know it and in the end it was through me that he was killed in egypt  or through the goddess isis i broke in rather nervously  yes the goddess isis a part i have played in my time or something like it and he was killed in the temple of the goddess isis and those papyri of which you read the translations in the museum which were given to me in kendah land seem to have come from that same temple andhow about the ivory child isis in the temple evidently held a child in her arms but when we found her it had gone supposing this child was the same as that of which i was guardian it might have been since the papyri came from that temple what do you think  i dont think anything i answered except that it is all very odd i dont even understand what isis and the child horus represent they were not mere images either in egypt or kendah land there must be an idea behind them somewhere  oh there was isis was the universal mother nature herself with all the powers seen and unseen that are hidden in nature love personified also although not actually the queen of love like hathor her sister goddess the horus child whom the old egyptians called heruhennu signified eternal regeneration eternal youth eternal strength and beauty also he was the avenger who overthrew set the prince of darkness and thus in a way opened the door of life to men  it seems to me that all religions have much in common i said  yes a great deal it was easy for the old egyptians to become christian since for many of them it only meant worshipping isis and horus under new and holier names but come in it grows cold  we had tea in lady ragnalls boudoir and after it had been taken away our conversation died she sat there on the other side of the fire with a cigarette between her lips looking at me through the perfumed smoke till i began to grow uncomfortable and to feel that a crisis of some sort was at hand this proved perfectly correct for it was presently she said  we took a long journey once together mr quatermain did we not  undoubtedly i answered and began to talk of it until she cut me short with a wave of her hand and went on  well we are going to take a longer one together after dinner tonight  what where how i exclaimed much alarmed  i dont know where but as for howlook in that box and she pointed to a little carved eastern chest made of rose or sandal wood that stood upon a table between us  with a groan i rose and opened it inside was another box made of silver this i opened also and perceived that within lay bundles of dried leaves that looked like tobacco from which floated an enervating and wellremembered scent that clouded my brain for a moment then i shut down the lids and returned to my seat  taduki i murmured  yes taduki and i believe in perfect order with all its virtue intact  virtue i exclaimed i dont think there is any virtue about that hateful and magical herb which i believe grew in the devils garden moreover lady ragnall although there are few things in the world that i would refuse you i tell you at once that nothing will induce me to have anything more to do with it  she laughed softly and asked why not  because i find life so full of perplexities and memories that i have no wish to make acquaintance with any more such as i am sure lie hid by the thousand in that box  if so dont you think that they might clear up some of those which surround you today  no for in such things there is no finality since whatever one saw would also require explanation  dont let us argue she replied it is tiring and i daresay we shall need all our strength tonight  i looked at her speechless why could she not take no for an answer as usual she read my thought and replied to it  why did not adam refuse the apple that eve offered him she inquired musingly or rather why did he eat it after many refusals and learn the secret of good and evil to the great gain of the world which thenceforward became acquainted with the dignity of labour  because the woman tempted him i snapped  quite so it has always been her business in life and always will be well i am tempting you now and not in vain  do you remember who was tempting the woman  certainly also that he was a good schoolmaster since he caused the thirst for knowledge to overcome fear and thus laid the foundationstone of all human progress that allegory may be read two ways as one of a rise from ignorance instead of a fall from innocence  you are too clever for me with your perverted notions also you said we were not to argue i have therefore only to repeat that i will not eat your apple or rather breathe your taduki  adam over again she replied shaking her head the same old beginning and the same old end because you see at last you will do exactly what adam did  here she rose and standing over me looked me straight in the eyes with the curious result that all my will power seemed to evaporate then she sat down again laughing softly and remarked as though to herself  who would have thought that allan quatermain was a moral coward  coward i repeated coward  yes thats the right word at least you were a minute ago now courage has come back to you why its almost time to dress for dinner but before you go listen i have some power over you my friend as you have some power over me for i tell you frankly if you wished me very much to do anything i should have to do it and the same applies conversely now tonight we are as i believe going to open a great gate and to see wonderful things glorious things that will thrill us for the rest of our lives and perhaps suggest to us what is coming after death you will not fail me will you she continued in a pleading voice if you do i must try alone since no one else will serve and then i knowhow i cannot saythat i shall be exposed to great danger yes i think that i shall lose my mind once more and never find it again this side the grave you would not have that happen to me would you just because you shrink from digging up old memories  of course not i stammered i should never forgive myself  yes of course not there was really no need for me to ask you then you promise you will do all i wish and once more she looked at me adding dont be ashamed for you remember that i have been in touch with hidden things and am not quite as other women are you will recollect i told you that which i have never breathed to any other living soul years ago on that night when first we met  i promise i answered and was about to add something i forget what when she cut me short saying  thats enough for i know your word is rather better than your bond now dress as quickly as you can or the dinner will be spoiled     chapter iv through the gates  short as was the time at my disposal before the dinnergong sounded it proved ample for reflection with every article of attire that i discarded went some of that boudoir glamour till its last traces vanished with my walkingboots i was fallen indeed i who had come to this place so full of virtuous resolutions could now only reflect upon the true and universal meaning of our daily prayer that we might be kept from temptation and yet what had tempted me for my lifes sake i could not say the desire to please a most charming woman and to keep her from making solitary experiments of a dangerous nature i suppose though whether they should be less dangerous carried out jointly remained to be seen certainly it was not any wish to eat of her proffered apple of knowledge for already i knew a great deal more than i cared for about things in general oh the truth was that woman is the mightiest force in the world at any rate where the majority of us poor men is concerned she commanded and i must obey  i grew desperate and wondered if i could escape perhaps i might slip out of the back door and run for it without my great coat or hat although the night was so cold and i should probably be taken up as a lunatic no it was impossible for i had forged a chain that might not be broken i had passed my word of honour well i was in for it and after all what was there of which i need be afraid that i should tremble and shrink back as though i were about to run away with somebodys wife or rather to be run away with quite contrary to my own inclination nothing at all a mere nonsensical ordeal much less serious than a visit to the dentist  probably that stuff had lost its strength by nowthat is unless it had grown more powerful by keeping as is the case with certain sorts of explosives and if it had not the worst to be expected was a silly dream followed perhaps by headache that is unless i did not chance to wake up again at all in this world which was a most unpleasant possibility another thing suppose i woke and she didnt what should i say then of a certainty i should find myself in the dock yes and there were further dreadful eventualities quite conceivable every one of them the very thought of which plunged me into a cold perspiration and made me feel so weak that i was obliged to sit down  then i heard the gong to me it sounded like the execution bell to a prisoner under sentence of death i crept downstairs feebly and found lady ragnall waiting for me in the drawingroom clothed with gaiety as with a garment i remember that it made me most indignant that she could be so happy in such circumstances but i said nothing she looked me up and down and remarked  really from your appearance you might have seen the ragnall ghost or be going to be married against your will ori dont know what also you have forgotten to fasten your tie  i looked in the glass it was true for there hung the ends down my shirt front then i struggled with the wretched thing until at last she had to help me which she did laughing softly somehow her touch gave me confidence again and enabled me to say quite boldly that i only wanted my dinner  yes she replied but you are not to eat much and you must only drink water the priestesses in kendah land told me that this was necessary before taking taduki in its strongest form as we are going to do tonight you know the prophet harût only gave us the merest whiff in this room years ago  i groaned and she laughed again  that dinner with nothing to drink although to avoid suspicion i let moxley fill my glass once or twice and little to eat for my appetite had vanished went by like a bad dream i recall no more about it until i heard lady ragnall tell moxley to see that there was a good fire in the museum where we were going to study that night and must not be disturbed  another minute and i was automatically opening the door for her as she passed she paused to do something to her dress and whispered  come in a quarter of an hour mindno port which clouds the intellect  i have none left to cloud i remarked after her  then i went back and sat by the fire feeling most miserable and staring at the decanters for never in my life do i remember wanting a bottle of wine more the big clock ticked and ticked and at last chimed the quarter jarring on my nerves in that great lonely banqueting hall then i rose and crept upstairs like an evildoer and it seemed to me that the servants in the hall looked on me with suspicion as well they might  i reached the museum and found it brilliantly lit but empty except for the cheerful company of the two mummies who also appeared to regard me with gleaming but doubtful eyes so i sat down there in front of the fire not even daring to smoke lest tobacco should complicate taduki  presently i heard a low sound of laughter looked up and nearly fell backwards that is metaphorically for the chair prevented such a physical collapse  it was not wonderful since before me like a bride of ancient days adorned for her husband stood the goddess isiswhite robes feathered headdress ancient bracelets goldstudded sandals on bare feet scented hair ruby necklace and all the rest i stared then there burst from me words which were the last i meant to say  great heavens how beautiful you are  am i she asked i am glad and she glided across the room and locked the door  now she said returning we had better get to business that is unless you would like to worship the goddess isis a little first to bring yourself into a proper frame of mind you know  no i replied my dignity returning to me i do not wish to worship any goddess especially when she isnt a goddess it was not a part of the bargain  quite so she said nodding but who knows what you will be worshipping before an hour is over oh forgive me for laughing at you but i cant help it you are so evidently frightened  who wouldnt be frightened i answered looking with gloomy apprehension at the sandalwood box which had appeared upon a case full of scarabs look here lady ragnall i added why cant you leave all this unholy business alone and let us spend a pleasant evening talking now that those smith people have gone i have lots of stories about my african adventures which would interest you  because i want to hear my own african adventures and perhaps yours too which i am sure will interest me a great deal more she exclaimed earnestly you think it is all foolishness but it is not those kendah priestesses told me much when i seemed to be out of my mind for a long time i did not remember what they said but of late years especially since george and i began to excavate that temple plenty has come back to me bit by bit fragments you know that make me desire to learn the rest as i never desired anything else on earth and the worst of it has always been that from the beginning i have knownand knowthat this can only happen with you and through you why i cannot say or have forgotten thats what sent me nearly wild with joy when i heard that you were not only alive but in this country you wont disappoint me will you there is nothing i can offer you which would have any value for you so i can only beg you not to disappoint mewell because i am your friend  i turned away my head hesitating and when i looked up again i saw that her beautiful eyes were full of tears naturally that settled the matter so i only said  let us get on with the affair what am i to do stop a bit i may as well provide against eventualities and going to a table i took a sheet of notepaper and wrote    lady ragnall and i allan quatermain are about to make an   experiment with an herb which we discovered some years ago in   africa if by any chance this should result in accident to either   or both of us the coroner is requested to understand that it is   not a case of murder or of suicide but merely of unfortunate   scientific research   this i dated adding the hour 947 pm and signed requesting her to do the same  she obeyed with a smile saying it was strange that one who had lived a life of such constant danger as myself should be so afraid to die  look here young lady i replied with irritation doesnt it occur to you that i may be afraid lest you should dieand i be hanged for it i added by an afterthought  oh i see she answered that is really very nice of you but of course you would think like that it is your nature  yes i replied nature not merit  she went to a cupboard which formed the bottom of one of the mahogany museum cases and extracted from it first of all a bowl of ancient appearance made of some black stone with projecting knobs for handles that were carved with the heads of women wearing ceremonial wigs and next a low tripod of ebony or some other black wood i looked at these articles and recognized them they had stood in front of the sanctuary in the temple in kendah land and over them i had once seen this very woman dressed as she was tonight bend her head in the magic smoke before she had uttered the prophecy of the passing of the kendah god  so you brought these away too i said  yes she replied with solemnity that they might be ready at the appointed hour when we needed them  then she spoke no more for a while but busied herself with certain rather eerie preparations first she set the tripod and its bowl in an open space which i was glad to note was at some distance from the fire since if either of us fell into that who would there be to take us off before cremation ensued then she drew up a curved settee with a back and arms a comfortablelooking article having a seat that sloped backwards like those in clubs and motioned to me to sit down this i did with much the same sensations that are evoked by taking ones place upon an operationtable  next she brought that accursed taduki box i mean the inner silver one the contents of which i heartily wished i had thrown upon the fire and set it down open near the tripod lastly she lifted some glowing embers of wood from the grate with tongs and dropped them into the stone bowl  i think thats all now for the great adventure she said in a voice that was at once rapt and dreamy  what am i to do i asked feebly  that is quite simple she replied as she sat herself down beside me well within reach of the taduki box the brazier being between us with its tripod stand pressed against the edge of the couch and in its curve so that we were really upon each side of it when the smoke begins to rise thickly you have only to bend your head a little forward with your shoulders still resting against the settee and inhale until you find your senses leaving you though i dont know that this is necessary for the stuff is subtle then throw your head back go to sleep and dream  what am i to dream about i inquired in a vacuous way for my senses were leaving me already  you will dream i think of past events in which both of us played a part at least i hope so i dreamt of them before in kendah land but then i was not myself and for the most part they are forgotten moreover i learned that we can only see them all when we are together now speak no more  this command by the way at once produced in me an intense desire for prolonged conversation it was not to be gratified however for at that moment she stood up again facing the tripod and me and began to sing in a rich and thrilling voice what she sang i do not know for i could not understand the language but i presume it was some ancient chant that she learned in kendah land at any rate there she stood a lovely and inspired priestess clad in her sacerdotal robes and sang waving her arms and fixing her eyes upon mine presently she bent down took a little of the taduki weed and with words of incantation dropped it upon the embers in the bowl twice she did this then sat herself upon the couch and waited  a clear flame sprang up and burned for thirty seconds or so i suppose while it consumed the volatile oils in the weed then it died down and smoke began to come white rich and billowy with a very pleasant odour resembling that of hothouse flowers it spread out between us like a fan and though its veil i heard her say  the gates are wide enter  i knew what she meant well enough and though for a moment i thought of cheating there is no other word for it knew also that she had detected the thought and was scorning me in her mind at any rate i felt that i must obey and thrust my head forward into the smoke as a green ham is thrust into a chimney the warm vapour struck against my face like fog or rather steam but without causing me to choke or my eyes to smart i drew it down my throat with a deep inhalationonce twice thrice then as my brain began to swim threw myself back as i had been instructed to do a deep and happy drowsiness stole over me and the last thing i remember was hearing the clock strike the first two strokes of the hour of ten the third stroke i heard also but it sounded like to that of the richestthroated bell that ever boomed in all the world i remember becoming aware that it was the signal for the rolling up of some vast proscenium revealing behind it a stage that was the worldnothing less    what did i see what did i see let me try to recall and record  first of all something chaotic great rushes of vapour driven by mighty winds great seas for the most part calm then upheavals and volcanoes spouting fire then tropic scenes of infinite luxuriance terrific reptiles feeding on the brinks of marshes and huge elephantlike animals moving between palms beyond then in a glade rough huts and about them a jabbering crowd of creatures that were only half human for sometimes they stood upright and sometimes ran on their hands and feet also they were almost covered with hair which was all they had in the way of clothes and at the moment that i met them were terribly frightened by the appearance of a huge mammoth if that is the right name for it which walked into the glade and looked at us at any rate it was a beast of the elephant tribe which i judged to be nearly twenty feet high with enormous curving tusks  the point of the vision was that i recognized myself among those hairy jabberers not by anything outward and visible but by something inward and spiritual moreover i was being urged by a female of the race i can scarcely call her a woman to justify my existence by tackling the mammoth in her particular interest or to give her up to someone who would in the end i tackled it rushing forward with a weapon i think it was a sharp stone tied to a stick though how i could expect to hurt a beast twenty feet high with such a thing is more than i can understand unless perhaps the stone was poisoned  at any rate the end was sudden i threw the stone whereat a great trunk shot out from between the tusks and caught me round and round i went in the air reflecting as i did so for i suppose at the time my normal consciousness had not quite left me that this was my first encounter with the elephant jana also that it was very foolish to try to oblige a female regardless of personal risk  all became dark as no doubt it would have done but presently that is after a lapse of a great many thousands of years or so it appeared to me light grew again this time i was a black man living in something not unlike a kaffir kraal on the top of a hill  there was shouting below and enemies attacked us a woman rushed out of a hut and gave me a spear and a shield the latter made of wood with white spots on it and pointed to the path of duty which ran down the hill i followed in company with others though without enthusiasm and presently met a roaring giant of a man at the bottom i stuck my spear into him and he stuck his into me through the stomach which hurt me most abominably after this i retired up the hill where the woman pulled the spear out and gave it to another man i remember no more  then followed a whole maze of visions but really i cannot disentangle them nor is it worth while doing so since after all they were only of the nature of an overture jumbled incidents of former lives real or imaginary or so i suppose having to do all of them with elementary things such as hunger and wounds and women and death  at length these broken fragments of the past were swept away out of my consciousness and i found myself face to face with something connected and tangible not too remote or unfamiliar for understanding it was the beginning of the real story    i please remember always that i knew it was i allan and no one else that is the same personality or whatever it may be which makes each man different from any other man saw myself in a chariot drawn by two horses with arched necks and driven by a charioteer who sat on a little seat in front it was a highly ornamented springless vehicle of wood and gilded something like a packingcase with a pole or as we should call it in south africa a disselboom to which the horses were harnessed in this cart i stood arrayed in flowing robes fastened round my middle by a studded belt with strips of coloured cloth wound round my legs and sandals on my feet to my mind the general effect of the attire was distinctly feminine and i did not like it at all  i was glad to observe however that the i of those days was anything but feminine indeed i could never have believed that once i was so goodlooking even over two thousand years ago i was not very tall but extremely stalwart burly almost with an arm that as i could observe since it projected from the sleeve of my ladys gown would have done no discredit to a prizefighter and a chest like a bull  the face also i admired very much the brow was broad the black eyes were full and proudlooking the features somewhat massive but wellcut and highly intelligent the mouth firm and shapely with lips that were perhaps a trifle too thick the hairwell there was rather a failure in the hair at least according to modern ideas for it curled so beautifully as to suggest that one of my ancestors might have fallen in love with a person of negroid origin however there was lots of it hanging down almost to the shoulders and bound about the brow by a very neat fillet of blue cloth with silver studs the colour of my skin i was glad to note was by no means black only a light and pleasing brown such as might have been produced by sunburn my age i might add was anywhere between five and twenty and five and thirty perhaps nearer the latter than the former at any rate the very prime of life  for the rest i held in my left hand a very stout long bow of black wood which seemed to have seen much service with a string of what looked like catgut on which was set a broadfeathered barbed arrow this i kept in place with the fingers of my right hand on one of which i observed a handsome gold ring with strange characters carved upon the bezel  now for the charioteer  he was black as night black as a sunday hat with yellow rolling eyes set in a countenance of extraordinary ugliness and i may add extraordinary humour his big wide mouth with thick lips ran up the left side of his face towards an ear that was also big and projecting his hair that had a feather stuck in it was real nigger wool covering a skull like a cannon ball and i should imagine as hard this head by the way was set plumb upon the shoulders as though it had been driven down between them by a pile hammer they were very broad shoulders suggesting enormous strength but the gailyclad body beneath which was supported by two bowed legs and large flat feet was that of a dwarf who by the proportions of his limbs nature first intended for a giant yes an ethiopian dwarf  looking through this remarkable exterior as it were i recognized that inside of it was the soul or animating principle ofwhom do you think none other than my beloved old servant and companion the hottentot hans whose loss i had mourned for years hans himself who died for me slaying the great elephant jana in kendah land the elephant i could not hit and thereby saving my life oh although i had been obliged to go back to the days of i knew not what ancient empire to do so in my trance or whatever it was i could have wept with joy at finding him again especially as i knew by instinct that as he loved the allan quatermain of today so he loved this egyptian in a wheeled packingcase for i may as well say at once that such was my nationality in the dream  now i looked about me and perceived that my chariot was the second of a cavalcade immediately in front of it was one infinitely more gorgeous in which stood a person who even if i had not known it i should have guessed to be a king and who as a matter of fact was none other than the king of kings at that time the absolute master of most of the known world though what his name may have been i have no notion he wore a long flowing robe of purple silk embroidered with gold and bound in at the waist by a jewelled girdle from which hung the private sacred seal the little white seal that as i learned afterwards was famous throughout the earth  on his head was a stiff cloth cap also purple in colour round which was fastened a fillet of light blue stuff spotted with white the best idea that i can give of its general appearance is to liken it to a tall hat of fashionable shape without a brim slightly squashed in so that it bulged at the top and surrounded by a rather sporting necktie really however it was the kitaris or headdress of these monarchs worn by them alone if anyone else had put on that hat even by mistake in the dark well his head would have come off with it that is all  this king held a bow in his hand with an arrow set upon its string just as i did for we were out hunting and as i shall have to narrate presently lions are no respecters of persons by his side leaning against the back of the chariot was a tall sharppointed wand of cedar wood with a knob of some green precious stone probably an emerald fashioned to the likeness of an apple this was the royal sceptre immediately behind the chariot walked several great nobles one of them carried a golden footstool another a parasol furled at the moment another a spare bow and a quiver of arrows and another a jewelled flywhisk made of palm fibre  the king i should add was young handsome with a curled beard and clearcut highbred looking features his face however was bad cruel and stamped with an air of weariness or rather satiety which was emphasized by the black circles beneath his fine dark eyes moreover pride seemed to emanate from him and yet there was something in his bearing and glances which suggested fear he was a god who knows that he is mortal and is therefore afraid lest at any moment he may be called upon to lose his godship in his mortality  not that he dreaded the perils of the chase he was too much of a man for that but how could he tell lest among all that crowd of crawling nobles there was not one who had a dagger ready for his back or a phial of poison to mix with his wine or water he with all the world in the hollow of his hand was filled with secret terrors which as i learned since first i seemed to see him thus fulfilled themselves at the appointed time for this man of blood was destined to die in blood though not by murder    the cavalcade halted presently a fat eunuch glittering in his goldwrought garments like some bronzed beetle in the sunlight came waddling back towards me he was odious and i knew that we hated each other  greeting egyptian he said mopping his brow with his sleeve for the sun was hot an honour for you a great honour the king of kings commands your presence yes he would speak with you with his own lips and with that abortion of a servant of yours also come come swiftly  swift as an arrow houman i answered laughing seeing that for three moons i like an arrow have rested upon the string and flown no nearer to his majesty  three moons screeched the eunuch why many wait three years and many go to the grave still waiting bigger men than you egyptian though i hear you do claim to be of royal blood yonder on the nile but talk not of arrows flying towards the most high for surely it is illomened and might earn you another honour that of the string and he made a motion suggestive of a cord encircling his throat man leave your bow behind would you appear before the king armed yes and your dagger also  perchance a lion might appear before the king and he does not leave his claws and teeth behind i answered drily as i divested myself of my weapons  then we started the three of us leaving the chariot in charge of a soldier  draw your sleeves over your hands said the eunuch none must appear before the king showing his hands and dwarf since you have no sleeves thrust yours into your robe  what am i to do with my feet he answered in a thick guttural voice will it offend the king of kings to see my feet most noble eunuch  certainly certainly answered houman since they are ugly enough to offend even me hide them as much as possible now we are near down on your faces and crawl forward slowly on your knees and elbows as i do down i say  so down i went though with anger in my heart for be it remembered that i the modern allan quatermain knew every thought and feeling that passed through the mind of my prototype  it was as though i were a spectator at a play with this difference i could read the motives and reflections of this former ego as well as observe his actions also i could rejoice when he rejoiced weep when he wept and generally feel all that he felt though at the same time i retained the power of studying him from my own modern standpoint and with my own existing intelligence being two we still were one or being one we still were two whichever way you like to put it lastly i lacked these powers with reference to the other actors in the piece of these i knew just as much or as little as my former self knew that is if he ever really existed there was nothing unnatural in my faculties where they were concerned i had no insight into their souls any more than i have into those of the people about me today now i hope that i have made clear my somewhat uncommon position with reference to these pages from the book of the past  well preceded by the eunuch and followed by the dwarf i crawled though the sand in which grew some thorny plants that pricked my knees and fingers towards the person of the monarch of the world he had descended from his chariot by help of a footstool and was engaged in drinking from a golden cup while his attendants stood around in various attitudes of adoration he who had handed him the cup being upon his knees presently he looked up and saw us  who are these he asked in a high voice that yet was not unmusical and why do you bring them into my presence  may it please the king answered our guide knocking his head upon the ground in a very agony of humiliation may it please the king  it would please me better dog if you answered my question who are they  may it please the king this is the egyptian hunter and noble shabaka  i hear said his majesty with a gleam of interest in his tired eyes and what does this egyptian here  may it please the king the king bade me bring him to the presence but now when the chariots halted  i forgot you are forgiven but who is that with him is it a man or an ape  here i screwed my head round and saw that my slave in his efforts to obey the eunuchs instructions and hide his feet had made himself into a kind of ball much as a hedgehog does except that his big head appeared in front of the ball  o king that i understand is the egyptians servant and charioteer  again he looked interested and exclaimed  is it so then egypt must be a stranger country than i thought if such apemen live there stand up egyptian and bid your ape stand up also for i cannot hear men who speak with their mouths in the dust  so i rose and saluted by lifting both my hands and bowing as i had observed others do trying however to keep them covered by my sleeves the king looked me up and down then said briefly  set out your name and the business that brought you to my city  may the king live for ever i replied as this lord said and i pointed to the eunuch  he is not a lord but a dog interrupted the monarch who wears the robe of women but continue  as this dog who wears the robe of women saidhere the king laughed but the eunuch houman turned green with rage and glowered at memy name is shabaka i am a descendant of the ethiopian king of egypt of that same name  it seems from all i hear that there are too many descendants of kings in egypt when i visit that land which perhaps soon i must do with an army at my back here he stared at me coldly it may be well to lessen their number there is a certain peroa for instance  he paused but i made no answer since peroa was my fathers cousin and of the fallen royal house also the protector of my youth  well shabaka he went on in persia royal blood is common also though some of us think it looks best when it is shed what else are you  a slayer of royal beasts o king of kings a hunter of lions and of elephants this statement interested me allan quatermain intensely showing me as it did that our tastes are very persistent also when i am at home a breeder of cattle and a grower of grain  good trades all of them shabaka but why came you here  idernes the satrap of egypt servant of the king of kings sought for one who would travel to the east because the king of kings desired to hear of the hunting of lions in the lands that lie to the south of egypt towards the beginnings of the great river then i who desired to see new countries said here am i send me so i came and for three moons have dwelt in the royal city but till this hour have scarcely so much as seen the face of the great king although by many messengers i have announced my presence showing them the letters of idernes giving me safeconduct therefore i propose tomorrow or the next day to return to egypt  the king said a word and a scribe appeared whom he commanded to take note of my words and let the matter be inquired of since some should suffer for this neglect a saying at which i saw houman and certain of the nobles turn pale and whisper to each other  now i remember he exclaimed that i did desire idernes to send me an egyptian hunter well you are here and we are about to hunt the lion of which there are many in yonder reeds hungry and fierce beasts since for three days they have been herded in so that they can kill no food how many lions have you slain shabaka  fifty and three in all o king not counting the cubs  he stared at me answering with a sneer  you egyptians have large mouths i have always heard it of you well today we will see whether you can kill a fiftyfourth in an hour when the sun begins to sink the hounds will be loosed in yonder reeds and since the water is behind them the lions will come out and then we shall see  now i saw that the king thought me to be a liar and the blood rose to my head  why wait till the sun begins to sink o king of kings i said why not enter the reeds as is our fashion in the land of kush and rouse the lions from sleep in their own lair  now the king laughed outright and called in a loud voice to his courtiers  do ye hear this boasting egyptian who talks of entering the reeds and facing the lions in their lair a thing that no man dare do where none can see to shoot what say ye now shall we ask him to prove his words  some great lord stepped forward one who was a hunter though he looked little like it for the scent on his hair reached me from four paces away and there was paint upon his face  yes o king he said in a mincing voice let him enter and kill a lion but if he fail then let a lion kill him there are some hungry in the palace den and it is not fit that the kings ears should be filled with empty words by foreigners from egypt  so be it said the king egyptian you have brought it on your own head prove that you can do what you say and i will give you great honour fail and to the lions with him who lies of lions still he added it is not right that you should go alone choose therefore one of these lords to keep you company he who would put you to the test if you will  now i looked at the scented noble who turned pale beneath his paint then i looked at the fat eunuch houman who opened his mouth and gasped like a fish and when i had looked i shook my head and said as though to myself  not so no woman and no eunuch shall be my companion on this quest whereat the king and all the rest laughed out loud the dwarf and i will go alone  the dwarf said the king can he hunt lions also  no o king but perchance he can smell them for otherwise how shall i find them in that thicket within an hour  perchance they can smell him how is the apeman named asked the king  bes o king after the god of the egyptians whom he resembles  dare you accompany your master on this hunt o bes inquired the king  then bes looked up rolling his yellow eyes and answered in his thick and guttural voice  i am my masters slave and dare i refuse to accompany him if i did he might kill me as the king of kings kills his slaves it is better to die with honour by the teeth of a lion than with dishonour beneath the whip of a master so at least we think in ethiopia  well spoken dwarf bes exclaimed the king so would i have all men think throughout the east let the words of this ethiop be written down and copies of them sent to the satraps of all the provinces that they may be read to the peoples of the earth i the king have decreed it     chapter v the wager  while the scribes were at their work i bowed before the king and prayed his leave and i and the dwarf bes might get to ours  go he said and return here within an hour if you do not return tidings of your death shall be sent to the satrap of egypt to be told to your wives  i thank the king but it is needless for i have no wives which are ill company for a hunter  strange he said since many women would be glad to name such a man their husband at least here among us easterns  walking backwards and bowing as we went bes and i returned to our chariot there we stripped off our outer garments till bes was naked save for his waistcloth and i was clad only in a jerkin then i took my bow my arrows and my knife and bes took two spears one light for throwing and the other short broad and heavy for stabbing thus armed we passed back before the easterns who stared at us and advanced to the edge of the thicket of tall reeds that was full of lions  here bes took dust and threw it into the air that we might learn from which quarter the light wind blew  we will go against the breeze lord he said that i may smell the lions before they smell us  i nodded and answered  hearken bes well may it be that we kill no lions in this place where it is hard to shoot yet i would not return to be thrown to wild beasts by yonder evil king therefore if we fail in this or in any other way do you kill me if you still live  he rolled his eyes and grinned  not so master then we will win through the reeds and lie hid in their edge till darkness comes for in them those halfmen will never dare to seek for us afterwards we will swim the water and disguise ourselves as jugglers and try to reach the coast and so back to egypt having learned much never stretch out your hand to death till he stretches out his to you which he will do soon enough master  again i nodded and said  and if a lion should kill me bes what then  then master i will kill that lion if i can and go report the matter to the king  and if he should wish to throw you to the beasts bes what then  then first i will drag him down to the greatest of all beasts he who waits to devour evildoers in the underworld be they kings or slaves and he stretched out his long arms and made a motion as of clutching a man by the throat oh have no fear master i can break him like a stick and afterwards we will talk the matter over among the dead for i shall swallow my tongue and die also it is a good trick master which i wish you would learn  then he took my hand and kissed it and we entered the reeds i who was a hunter feeling more happy than i had done since we set foot in the east  yet the quest was desperate for the reeds were tall and often i could not see more than a bows length in front of me presently however we found a path made perchance by game coming down to drink or by crocodiles coming up to sleep and followed it i with an arrow on my string and bes with the throwing spear in his right hand and the stabbing spear in his left half a pace ahead of me on we crept bes drawing in the air through his great nostrils as a hound might do till suddenly he stopped and sniffed towards the north  i smell lion near he whispered searching among the reed stems with his eyes i see lion he whispered again and pointed but i could see nothing save the stems of the reeds  rouse him i whispered back and i will shoot as he bounds  then bes poised the spear shook it till it quivered and threw there was a roar and a lioness appeared with the spear fast in her flank i loosed the arrow but it cut into the thick reeds and stuck there  forward whispered bes for where woman is there look for man the lion will be near  we crept on bes stopping to cut the arrow from a reed and set it back in the quiver for it was a good arrow made by himself but now he shifted the broad spear to his right hand and in his left held his knife we heard the wounded lioness roar not far away  she calls her man to help her whispered bes and as the words left his lips the reeds down wind began to sway for we were smelt  they swayed they parted and half seen half hid between their stems appeared the head of a great blackmaned lion i drew the string and shot this time not in vain for i heard the arrow thud upon his hide then before i could set another he was on us reared upon his hind legs and roaring as i drew my dagger he struck at me but i bent down and his paw went over my head then his weight came against me and i fell beneath him stabbing him in the belly as i fell i saw his mighty jaws open to crush my head then they shut again and through them burst a whine like that of a hurt dog  bes had driven his spear into the lions breast so deep that the point of it came out through the back still he was not dead only now it was bes he sought the dwarf ran at him as he reared up again and casting his great arms about the brutes body wrestled with him as man with man  then it was for the first time i think that i learned all the ethiopians strength for he a dwarf threw that lion on its back and thrusting his big head beneath the jaws struggled with it madly i was up the knife still in my hand and oh i too was strong into the throat i drove it dragging it this way and that and lo the lion moaned and died and his blood gushed out over both of us then bes sat up and laughed and i too laughed since neither of us had more than scratches and we had done what men could scarcely do  do you remember master said bes when he had finished laughing as he wiped his brow with some damp moss how once far away up the nile you charged a mad elephant with a spear and saved me who had fallen from being trampled to death  i shabaka answered that i did and i allan quatermain observing all these things in my psychic trance in the museum of ragnall castle reflected that i also remembered how a certain hans had saved me from a certain mad elephant to wit jana not so long before which just shows how things come round  yes went on bes you saved me from that elephant though it seemed death to you and master i will tell you something now that very morning i had tried to poison you only you would not wait to eat because the elephants were near  did you i asked idly why  because two years before you captured me in battle with some of my people and as i was misshapen or for pitys sake spared my life and made me your slave well i who had been a chief a very great chief master did not wish to remain a slave and did wish to avenge my peoples blood therefore i tried to poison you and that very day you saved my life offering for it your own  i think it was because i wanted the tusks of the elephant bes  perhaps master only you will remember that this elephant was a young cow and had no tusks worth anything still had it carried tusks it might have been so since one white tusk is worth many black dwarfs well today i have paid you back i say it lest you should forget that had it not been for me that lion would have eaten you  yes bes you have paid me back and i thank you  master hitherto i always thought you one who worshipped maat goddess of truth now i see that you worship the god of lies whoever he may be that god who dwells in the breasts of women and most men but has no name for master it was you who saved me from the lion and not i you since you cut its throat at the last so that debt of mine is still to pay and by the great grasshopper which we worship in my country who is much better than all the gods of the egyptians put together i swear that i will pay it soon or mayhap ten thousand years hence at the last it shall be paid  why do you worship a grasshopper and why is he better than the gods of the egyptians i asked carelessly for i was tired and his talk amused me while we rested  we worship the grasshopper master because he jumps with mens spirits from one life to another or from this world to the next yes right through the blue sky and he is better than your egyptian gods because they leave you to find your own way there and then eat you alive that is if you have tried to poison people as of course we have all done but master we are fresh again now so let us be going for the hour will soon be finished also when she has eaten the spear handle that lioness may return  yes i said let us go and report to the king of kings that we have killed a lion  master it is not enough even common kings believe little that they do not see wherefore it is certain that a king of kings will believe nothing and still more certain that he will not come here to look so as we cannot carry the lion we must take a bit of it and straightway he cut off the end of the brutes tail  following the crocodile path presently we reached the edge of the reeds opposite to the camp where the king now sat in state beneath a purple pavilion that had been reared eating a meal with his courtiers standing at a distance and looking very hungry  out of the reeds bounded bes naked and bloody waving the lions tail and singing some wild ethiopian chant while i also bloody and half naked for the lions claws had torn my jerkin off me followed with bow unstrung  the king looked up and saw us  what do you live egyptian he asked of a surety i thought that by now you would be dead  it was the lion that died o king i answered pointing to bes who having ceased from his song was jumping about carrying the beasts tail in his mouth as a dog carries a bone  it seems that this egyptian has killed a lion said the king to one of his lords him of the painted face and scented hair  may be please the king he answered bowing a tail is not the whole beast and may have been taken thither or cut from a lion lying dead already the king knows that the egyptians are great liars  so he spoke because he was jealous of the deed  these men look as though they had met a live one not one that is dead said the king scanning our bloodstained shapes still as you doubt it you will wish to put the matter to the proof therefore cousin take six men with you enter the reeds and search in that soft ground it will be easy to follow their footmarks  it is dangerous o king began the prince for such he was no less  and therefore the task will be the more to your taste cousin go now and be swift  so six hunters were called and the prince went cursing me beneath his breath as he passed us for he was terribly afraid and with reason suddenly bes ceased from his antics and prostrating himself cried  a boon o king this noble lord throws doubt upon my masters word suffer that i may lead him to where the lion lies dead since otherwise wandering in those reeds the great kings cousin might come to harm and the great king be grieved  i have many cousins said the king still go if you wish dwarf  so bes ran after the prince and catching him up tapped him on the shoulder with the lions tail to point out the way then they vanished into the reeds and i went to the chariot to wash off the blood from my body and clothes as i fastened my robe i heard a sound of roaring then one scream after which all grew still now i drew near to the reeds and stood between them and the kings camp  presently on their edge appeared bes dancing and singing as before but this time he held a lions tail in either hand after him came the six hunters dragging between them the body of the lion we had killed they staggered with it towards the king and i followed  i see the dwarf he said i see the dead lion and i see the hunters but where is my cousin make report o bes  o king of kings replied bes the mighty prince your cousin lies flat yonder beneath the body of that lions wife she sprang upon him and killed him and i sprang upon her and killed her with my spear here is her tail o king of kings  is this true he asked of the hunters  it is true o king answered their captain the lioness which was wounded leapt upon the prince choosing him although he was behind us all then this dwarf leapt upon the lioness being behind the prince and nearest to him and drove his spear through her shoulders to her heart so we brought the first lion as the king commanded us since we could carry no more  the face of the king grew red with rage  seven of my people and one black dwarf he exclaimed yet the lioness kills my cousin and the dwarf kills the lioness such is the tale that will go to egypt concerning the hunters of the king of the world seize those men guards and let them be fed to the wild beasts in the palace dens  at once the unfortunates were seized and led away then the king called bes to him and taking the gold chain he wore about his neck threw it over his head thereby though i knew nothing of it at the time conferring upon him some noble rank next he called to me and said  it would seem that you are skilled in the use of the bow and in the hunting of lions egyptian therefore i will honour you for this afternoon your chariot shall drive with my chariot and we will hunt side by side moreover i will lay you a wager as to which of us will kill the most lions for know shabaka that i also am skilled in the use of the bow more skilled than any among the millions of my subjects  then o king it is of little use for me to match myself against you seeing that i have met men who can shoot better than i do or since in the east all must speak nothing but the truth not being liars as the dead prince said we egyptians are one man  who was that man shabaka  the prince peroa o king  the king frowned as though the name displeased him then answered  am i not greater than this peroa and cannot i therefore shoot better  doubtless o king of kings and therefore how can i who shoot worse than peroa match myself against you  for which reason i will give you odds shabaka behold this rope of rosehued pearls i wear they are unequalled in the whole world for twenty years the merchants sought them in the days of my father half of them would buy a satrapy i wager themhere the listening nobles gasped and the fat eunuch houman held up his hands in horror  against what o king  your slave bes to whom i have taken a fancy  now i trembled and bes rolled his yellow eyes  your pardon o king of kings i said but it is not enough i am a hunter and to such priceless pearls are of little use but to me that dwarf is of much use in my hunting  so be it shabaka then i will add to the wager if you win together with the pearls i will give you the dwarfs weight in solid gold  the king is bountiful i answered but it is not enough for even if i win against one who can shoot better than peroa which is impossible what should i do with so much gold surely for the sake of it i should be murdered or ever i saw the coasts of egypt  what shall i add then asked the king the most beauteous maiden in the house of women  i shook my head not so o king for then i must marry who would remain single  there is no need you might sell her to your friend peroa a satrapy  not so o king for then i must govern it which would keep me from my hunting until it pleased the king to take my head  by the name of the holy ones i worship what then do you ask added to the pearls and the pure gold  now i tried to bethink me of something that the king could not grant since i had no wish for this match which my heart warned me would end in trouble as no thought came to me i looked at bes and saw that he was rolling his eyes towards the six doomed hunters who were being led away also in pretence of driving off a fly pointing to them with one of the lion tails then i remembered that a decree once uttered by the king of the east could not be altered and saw a road of escape  o king i said together with the pearls and the gold i ask that the lives of those six hunters be added to the wager to be spared if by chance i should win  why asked the king amazed  because they are brave men o king and i would not see the bones of such cracked by tame beasts in a cage  is my judgment registered asked the king  not yet o king answered the head scribe  then it has no weight and can be suspended without the breaking of the law shabaka thus stands our wager if i kill more lions than you do this day or should but two be slain i kill the first or should none be slain i plant more arrows in their bodies i take your slave bes the dwarf to be my slave but should you have the better of me in any of these ways then i give to you this girdle of rose pearls and the weight of the dwarf bes in gold and the six hunters free of harm to do with what you will let it be recorded and to the hunt    soon bes and i were in our chariot which by command took place in line with that of the king but at a distance of some thirty steps bending over the dwarf who drove i spoke with him saying  our luck is ill today bes seeing that before the end of it we may well be parted  not so master our luck is good today seeing that before the end of it you will be the richer by the finest pearls in the whole world by my weight in pure gold and master i am twice as heavy as the king thought and will stuff myself with twenty pounds of meat before the weighing if i have the chance or at least with water though in this hot place that will not last for long and by six picked huntsmen brave men as you thought who will serve to escort us and our treasure to the coast  first i must win the match bes  which you could do with one eye blinded master and a sore finger kings think that they can shoot because all the worms that crawl about them and are named men dare not show themselves their betters oh i have heard tales in yonder city there have been days when this lord of the world has missed six lions with as many arrows and they seated smiling in his face being but tamed brutes brought from far in cages of wood yes smiling like cats in the sun look you master he drinks too much wine and sits up too late in his womens housethere are three hundred of them there masterto shoot as you and i can if you doubt it look at his eyes and hands oh the pearls and the gold and the men are yours and that painted prince who mocked us is where he ought to bedead in the mud  did i tell you how i managed that master as you know better than i do lions hate those that have on them the smell of their own blood therefore while i pointed out the way to him i touched the painted prince with the bleeding tail of that which we killed pretending that it was by chance for which he cursed me as well he might so when we came to the dead lion and as i had expected met there the lioness you had wounded she charged through the hunters at him who smelt of her husband and bit his head off  but bes you smelt of him also and worse  yes master but that painted cousin of the king came first i kept well behind him pretending to be afraid and he chuckled quietly adding i expect that he is now telling an angry tale about me to osiris or to the grasshopper that takes him there as it may happen  these easterns worship neither osiris nor your grasshopper bes but a flame of fire  then he is telling the tale to the fire and i hope that it will get tired and burn him  so we talked merrily enough because we had done great deeds and thought that we had outwitted the easterns and the king not knowing all their craft for none had told us that that man who hunted with the king and yet dared to draw arrow upon the quarry before the king should be put to death as one who had done insult to his majesty this that royal fox remembered and therefore was sure that he would win the wager  now the chariots turned and passing down a path came to an open space that was cleared of reeds here they halted that of the king and my own side by side with ten paces between them and those of the court behind meanwhile huntsmen with dogs entered the great brake far away to the right and left of us also in front so that the lions might be driven backwards and forwards across the open space  soon we heard the hounds baying on all sides then bes made a sucking noise with his great lips and pointed to the edge of the reeds in front of us some sixty paces away looking i saw a yellow shape creeping along between their dark stems and although the shot was far forgetting all things save i was a hunter and there was my game i drew the arrow to my ear aimed and loosed making allowance for its fall and for the wind  oh that shot was good it struck the lion in the body and pierced him through out he came roaring rolling and tearing at the ground but by now i had another arrow on the string and although the king lifted his bow i loosed first again it struck this time in the throat and that lion groaned and died  the king looked at me angrily and from the court behind rose a murmur of wonder mingled with wrath wonder at my marksmanship and wrath because i had dared to shoot before the king  the wager looks well for us muttered bes but i bade him be silent for more lions were stirring  now one leapt across the open space passing in front of the king and within thirty paces of us he shot and missed it sending his shaft two spans above its back then i shot and drove the arrow through it just where the head joins the neck cutting the spine so that it died at once  again that murmur went up and the king struck the charioteer on the head with his clenched fist crying out that he had suffered the horses to move and should be scourged for causing his hand to shake  this charioteer although he was a lordsince in the east men of high rank waited on the king like slaves and even clipped his nails and beardcraved pardon humbly admitting his fault  it is a lie whispered bes the horses never stirred how could they with those grooms holding their heads nevertheless master the pearls are as good as round your neck  silence i answered as we have heard in the east all men speak the truth it is only egyptians who lie also in the east mens necks are encircled with bowstrings as well as pearls and ears are long  the hounds continued to bay drawing nearer to us a lioness bounded out of the reeds ran towards the kings chariot and as though amazed sat down like a dog so near that a man might have hit it with a stone the king shot short striking it in the forepaw only whereon it shook out the arrow and rushed back into the reeds while the court behind cried  may the king live for ever the beast is dead  we shall see if it is dead presently said bes and i nodded  another lion appeared to the right of the king again he shot and missed it whereon he began to curse and to swear in his own royal oaths and the charioteer trembled then came the end  one of the hounds drew quite close and roused the lioness that had been pricked in the foot she turned and killed it with a blow of her paw then being mad charged straight at the kings chariot the horses reared lifting the grooms off their feet the king shot wildly and fell backwards out of the chariot as even kings of the world must do when they have nothing left to stand on the lioness saw that he was down and leapt at him straight over the chariot as she leapt i shot at her in the air and pierced her through the loins paralysing her so that although she fell down near the king she could not come at him to kill him  i sprang from my chariot but before i could reach the lioness hunters had run up with spears and stabbed her which was easy as she could not move  the king rose from the ground for he was unharmed and said in a loud voice  had not that shaft of mine gone home i think that the east would have bowed to another lord tonight  now forgetting that i was speaking to the king of the earth forgetting the wager and all besides i exclaimed  nay your shaft missed mine went home whereon one of the courtiers cried  this egyptian is a liar and calls the king one  a liar i said astonished look at the arrow and see from whose quiver it came and i drew one from my own of the egyptian make and marked with my mark  then a tumult broke out all the courtiers and eunuchs talking at once yet all bowing to the mudstained person of the king like ears of wheat to a tree in a storm not wishing to urge my claims further for my part i returned to the chariot and the hunting being done as i supposed unstrung my bow which i prized above all things and set it in its case  while i was thus employed the eunuch houman approached me with a sickly smile saying  the king commands your presence egyptian that you may receive your reward  i nodded saying that i would come and he returned  bes i said when he was out of hearing my heart sinks i do not trust that king who i think means mischief  so do i master oh we have been great fools when a god and a man climb a tree together the man should allow the god to come first to the top and thence tell the world that he is a god  yes i answered but who ever sees wisdom until she is flying away now perhaps the god being the stronger will cast down the man  then both together we advanced towards the king leaving the chariot in charge of soldiers he was seated on a gilded chair which served him as a throne and behind him were his officers eunuchs and attendants though not all of them since at a little distance some of them were engaged in beating the lord who had served as his charioteer upon the feet with rods we prostrated ourselves before him and waited till he spoke at length he said  shabaka the egyptian we made a wager with you of which you will remember the terms it seems that you have won the wager since you slew two lions whereas we the king slew but one that which leapt upon us in the chariot  here bes groaned at my side and i looked up  fear nothing he went on it shall be paid here he snatched off the girdle of priceless rosehued pearls and threw it in my face  at the palace too he went on the dwarf shall be set in the scales and his full weight in pure gold shall be given to you moreover the lives of the six hunters are yours and with them the men themselves  may the king live for ever i exclaimed feeling that i must say something  i hope so he answered cruelly but egyptian you shall not who have broken the laws of the land  in what way o king i asked  by shooting at the lions before the king had time to draw his bow and by telling the king that he lied to his face for both of which things the punishment is death  now my heart swelled till i thought it would burst with rage then of a sudden a certain spirit entered into me and i rose to my feet and said  o king you have declared that i must die and as this is so i will kneel to you no more who soon shall sup at the table of osiris and there be far greater than any king going before him with clean hands is it not your law that he who is condemned to die has first the right to set out his case for the honour of his name  it is said the king i think because he was curious to hear what i had to say speak on  o king although my blood is as high as your own of that i say nothing for at the wish of your satrap i came to the east from egypt as a hunter to show you how we of egypt kill lions and other beasts for three months i have waited in the royal city seeking admission to the presence of the king and in vain at length i was bidden to this hunt when i was about to depart to my own land and being taunted by your servants entered the reeds with my slave and there slew a lion then it pleased you to thrust a wager upon me which i did not wish to take as to which of us would shoot the most lions a wager as i now understand you did not mean that i should win whatever might be my skill since you thought i knew that i must shoot at nothing till you had first shot and killed the beasts or scared them away  so i matched myself against you as hunter against hunter for in the field as before the gods all are equal not as a slave against a king who is determined to avenge defeat by death we were posted and the lions came i shot at those which appeared opposite to me or upon my side leaving those that appeared opposite to you or on your side unshot at as is the custom of hunters my skill or my fortune was better than yours and i killed whereas you missed or only wounded in the end a lioness sprang at you and i shot it lest it should kill you as could easily be proved by the arrow in its body now you say that i must die because i have broken some laws of yours which men should be ashamed to make and to save your honour pay me what i have won knowing that pearls and gold and slaves are of no value to a dying man and can be taken back again that is all the story  yet i would add one word you easterns have two sayings which you teach to your children that they should learn to shoot with the bow and to tell the truth o king they are my last lessons to you learn to shoot with the bowwhich you cannot do and to tell the truth which you have not done now i have spoken and am ready to die and i thank you for the patience with which you have heard my words that as the king does not live for ever i hope one day to repeat to you more fully beyond the grave  now at this bold speech of mine all those nobles and attendants gasped for never had they heard such words addressed to his majesty the king turned red as though with shame but made no answer only he asked of those about him  what fate for this man  death o king they cried with one voice  what death he asked again  then his councillors consulted together and one of them answered  the slowest known to our law death by the boat  hearing this and not knowing what was meant it came into my mind that i was to be turned adrift in a boat and there left to starve  behold the reward of good hunting i mocked in my rage o king because of this deed of shame i call upon you the curse of all the gods of all the peoples henceforth may your sleep be ever haunted by evil dreams of what shall follow the last sleep and in the end may you also die in blood  the king opened his mouth as though to answer but from it came nothing but a low cry of fear then guards rushed up and seized me     chapter vi the doom of the boat  the guards led me to my chariot and thrust me into it and with me bes i asked them if they would murder him also to which the eunuch houman answered no since he had committed no crime but that he must go with me to be weighed then soldiers took the horses by the bridles and led them while others having first snatched away my bow and all our other weapons surrounded the chariot lest we should escape so bes and i were able to talk together in a libyan tongue that none of them understood even if they heard our words  your life is spared i said to him that the king may take you as a slave  then he will take an ill slave master since i swear by the grasshopper that within a moon i will find means to kill him and afterwards come to join you in a land where men hunt fair  i smiled and bes went on  now i wish i had time to teach you that trick of swallowing your own tongue since perhaps you will need it in this boat of which they talk  did you not say to me an hour or two ago bes that we are fools to stretch out our hands to death until he stretches out his to us i will not die until i mustnow  why now master seeing that only this afternoon you bade me kill you rather than let you be thrown to the wild beasts he asked peering at me curiously  do you remember the old hermit the holy tanofir who dwells in a cell over the sepulchre of the apis bulls in the burial ground of the desert near to memphis bes  the magician and prophet who is the brother of your grandfather master and the son of a king he who brought you up before he became a hermit yes i know him well though i have seldom been very near to him because his eyes frighten me as they frightened cambyses the persian when tanofir cursed him and foretold his doom after he had stabbed the holy apis saying that by a wound from that same sword in his own body he should die himself which thing came to pass as they have frightened many another man also  well bes when yonder king told me that i must die fear filled me who did not wish to die thus and after the fear came a blackness in my mind then of a sudden in that blackness i saw a picture of tanofir my great uncle seated in a sepulchre looking towards the east moreover i heard him speak and to me saying shabaka my fosterson fear nothing you are in great danger but it will pass speak to the great king all that rises in your heart for the gods of vengeance make use of your tongue and whatever you prophesy to him shall be fulfilled so i spoke the words you heard and i feared nothing  is it so master then i think that the holy tanofir must have entered my heart also know that i was minded to leap upon that king and break his neck so that all three of us might end together but of a sudden something seemed to tell me to leave him alone and let things go as they are fated but how can the holy tanofir who grows blind with age see so far  i do not know bes save that he is not as are other men for in him is gathered all the ancient wisdom of egypt moreover he lives with the gods while still upon earth and like the gods can send his ka as we egyptians call the spirit or invisible self which companions all from the cradle to the grave and afterwards whither he will so doubtless today he sent it hither to me whom he loves more than anything on earth also i remember that before i entered on this journey he told me that i should return safe and sound therefore bes i say i fear nothing  nor do i master yet if you see me do strange things or hear me speak strange words take no note of them since i shall be but playing a part as i think wisest  after this we talked of that days adventure with the lions and of others that we had shared together laughing merrily all the while till the soldiers stared at us as though we were mad also the fat eunuch houman who was mounted on an ass rode up and said  what egyptian who dared to twist the beard of the great king you laugh do you well you will sing a different song in the boat to that which you sing in the chariot think of my words on the eighth day from this  i will think of them eunuch i answered looking at him fiercely in the eyes but who knows what kind of a song you will be singing before the eighth day from this  what i do is done under the authority of the ancient and holy seal of seals he answered in a quavering voice touching the little cylinder of white shell which i had noted upon the person of the king but that now hung from a gold chain about the eunuchs neck  then he made the sign which easterns use to avert evil and rode off again looking very frightened  so we came to the royal city and went up to a wonderful palace here we were taken from the chariot and led into a room where food and drink in plenty were given to me as though i were an honoured guest which caused me to wonder bes also seated on the ground at a distance ate and drank for his own reasons filling himself to the throat as though he were a wineskin until the serving slaves mocked at him for a glutton  when we had finished eating slaves appeared bearing a wooden framework from which hung a great pair of scales also there appeared officers of the kings treasury carrying leather bags which they opened breaking the seals to show that the contents were pure gold coin they set a number of these bags on one of the scales and then ordered bes to seat himself in the other so much heavier did he prove than they expected him to be that they were obliged to send back to the treasury to fetch more bags of gold for although bes was so short in height his weight was that of a large man one of the treasurers grumbled saying he should have been weighed before he had eaten and drunk but the officer to whom he spoke grinned and answered that it mattered little since the king was heir to criminals and that these bags would soon return to the treasury only they would need washing first a remark that made me wonder  at length when the scales were even the six hunters whose lives i had won and who had been given to me as slaves were brought in and ordered to shoulder the bags of gold i too was seized and my hands were bound behind me then i was led out in charge of the eunuch houman who informed me with a leer that it would be his duty to attend to my comfort till the end with him were four black men all dressed in the same way these he said were the executioners lastly came bes watched by three of the kings guards armed with spears lest he should attempt to rescue me or to do anyone a mischief  now my heart began to sink and i asked houman what was to happen to me  this o egyptian slayer of lions you will be laid upon a bed in a little boat upon the river and another boat will be placed over you for these boats are called the twins egyptian in such a fashion that your head and your hands will project at one end and your feet at the other there you will be left comfortable as a baby in its cradle and twice every day the best of food and drink will be brought to you should your appetite fail moreover it will be my duty to revive it by pricking your eyes with the point of a knife until it returns also after each meal i shall wash your face your hands and your feet with milk and honey lest the flies that buzz about them should suffer hunger and to preserve your skin from burning by the sun thus slowly you will grow weaker and at length fall asleep the last one who went into the boathe unlucky man had by accident wandered into the court of the house of women and seen some of the ladies there unveiledonly lived for twelve days but you being so strong may hope to last for eighteen is there anything more that i can tell you if so ask it quickly for we draw near to the river  now when i heard this and understood all the horror of my fate i forgot the vision of my great uncle the holy tanofir and his comfortable prophecies and my heart failed me altogether so that i stood stock still  what lionhunter and bearder of kings do you think it is too early to go to bed mocked this devilish eunuch on with you and he began to beat me about the face with the handle of his flywhisk  then my manhood came back to me  when did the king tell you to touch me you fatted swine i roared and turning since i could not reach him with my bound hands kicked him in the body with all my strength so that he fell down writhing and screaming with agony indeed had not the executioners leapt upon me i would have trampled the life out of him where he lay but they held me fast and presently after he had been sick houman recovered enough to come forward leaning on the shoulders of two guards only now he mocked me no more  we reached a quay just as the sun was setting there in charge of a oneeyed black slave a little squareended boat floated at the rivers edge while on the quay itself lay a similar but somewhat shorter boat bottom uppermost now the hunters whom i had won in the wager with many glances of compassion for they were brave men and knew that it was i who had saved their lives placed the bags of gold in the bottom of the floating boat and on the top of these a mattress stuffed with straw then the girdle of rosehued pearls was made fast about my middle my hands were untied i was seized by the executioners and laid on my back on the mattress and my wrists and ankles were fixed by cords to iron rings that were screwed to the thwarts of the boat after this the other shorter boat was laid over me in such a manner that it did not touch me leaving my head my hands and my feet exposed as the eunuch had said  while this wicked work was going forward bes sat on the quay watching till presently after i had been made fast and covered up he burst into shouts of laughter clapped his hands and began to dance about as though with joy till the eunuch who had now recovered somewhat from my kick grew curious and asked him why he behaved thus  o noble eunuch he answered once i was free and that man made me a slave so that for many years i have been obliged to toil for him whom i hate moreover often he has beaten me and starved me which was why you saw me eat so much not long ago and threatened to kill me and now at last i have my revenge upon him who is about to die miserably that is why i laugh and sing and dance and clap my hands o most noble eunuch i who shall become the follower and servant of the glorious king of all the earth and perhaps your friend too o eunuch of eunuchs whose sacred person my brutal master dared to kick  i understand said houman smiling though with a twisted face and will make report of all you say to the king and ask him to grant that you shall sometimes prick this egyptian in the eye now go spit in his face and tell him what you think of him  so bes waded into the water which was quite shallow here and spat into my face or pretended to while amid a torrent of vile language he interpolated certain words in the libyan tongue which meant  o my most beloved father mother and other relatives have no fear though things look very black remember the vision of the holy tanofir who doubtless allows these things to happen to you to try your faith by direct order of the gods be sure that i will not leave you to perish or if there should be no escape that i will find a way to put you out of your misery and to avenge you yes yes i will yet see that accursed swine houman take your place in this boat now i go to the court to which it seems that this gold chain gives me a right of entry or so the eunuch says but soon i will be back again  then followed another stream or most horrible abuse and more spitting after which he waded back to land and embraced houman calling him his best friend  they went leaving me alone in the boat save for the guard upon the quay who now that darkness had come soon grew silent it was lonely very lonely lying there staring at the empty sky with only the stinging gnats for company and soon my limbs began to ache i thought of the poor wretches who had suffered in this same boat and wondered if their lot would be my lot  bes was faithful and clever but what could a single dwarf do among all these blackhearted fiends and if he could do nothing oh if he could do nothing  the seconds seemed minutes the minutes seemed hours and the hours seemed years what then would the days be passed in torture and agony while waiting for a filthy death where now were the gods i had worshipped andwas there any god or was man but a selfdeceiver who created gods instead of the gods creating him because he did not love to think of an eternal blackness in which he would soon be swallowed up and lost well at least that would mean sleep and sleep is better than torment of mind or body  it came to me i think who was so weary at any rate i opened my eyes to see that the low moon had vanished and that some of the stars which i knew as a hunter who had often steered his way by them had moved a little while i was wondering idly why they moved i heard the tramp of soldiers on the quay and the voice of an officer giving a command then i felt the boat being drawn in by the cord with which it was attached to the quay next the other boat that lay over me was lifted off the ropes that bound we were undone and i was set upon my feet for already i was so stiff that i could scarcely stand a voice which i recognised as that of the eunuch houman addressed me in respectful tones which made me think i must be dreaming  noble shabaka said the voice the great king commands your presence at his feast  is it so i answered in my dream then my absence from their feast will vex the gnats of the river a saying at which houman and others with him laughed obsequiously  next i heard the bags of gold being removed from the boat after which we walked away guards supporting me by either elbow until i found my strength again and houman following just behind perhaps because he feared my foot if he went in front  what has chanced eunuch i asked presently that i am disturbed from the bed where i was sleeping so well  i do not know lord he answered i only know that the king of kings has suddenly commanded that you should be brought before him as a guest clothed in a robe of honour even if to do so you must be awakened from your rest yes to his own royal table for he holds a feast this night lord he went on in a whining voice if perchance fortune should have changed her face to you i pray you bear no malice to those who when she frowned were forced yes under the private seal of seals against their will to carry out the commands of the king be just o lord shabaka  say no more i will try to be just i answered but what is justice in the east i only know of it in egypt  now we reached one of the doors of the palace and i was taken to a chamber where slaves who were waiting washed and anointed me with scents after which they clad me in a beautiful robe of silk setting the girdle of rosehued pearls about me  when they had finished preceded by houman i was led to a great pillared hall closed in with silk hangings where many feasted through them i went to a dais at the head of the hall where between halfdrawn curtains surrounded by cupbearers and other officers the king sat in all his glory upon a cushioned golden throne he had a glittering winecup in his hand and at a glance i saw that he was drunk as it is the fashion for these easterns to be at their great feasts for he looked happy and human which he did not do when he was sober or perchance as sometimes i thought afterwards he only pretended to be drunk also i saw something else namely bes wondrously attired with the gold chain about his neck and wearing a red headdress he was seated on the carpet before the throne and saying things that made the king laugh and even caused the grave officers behind to smile  i came to the dais and at a little sign from bes who yet did not seem to see me such a sign as he often made when he caught sight of game before i did i prostrated myself the king looked at me then asked  who is this adding oh i remember the egyptian whose arrows do not miss the wonderful hunter whom idernes sent to me from memphis which i hope to visit ere long we quarrelled did we not egyptian something about a lion  not so king i answered the king was angry and with justice because i could not kill a lion before it frightened his horses  this i said because my hours in the boat had made me humble also because the words came to my lips  yes yes something like that or at least you lie well whatever it may have been it is done with now a mere hunters difference and taking from his side his long sceptre that was headed with the great emerald he stretched it out for me to touch in token of pardon  then i knew that i was safe for he to whom the king has extended his sceptre is forgiven all crimes yes even if he had attempted the royal life the court knew it also for every man who saw bowed towards me yes even the officers behind the king one of the cupbearers too brought me a goblet of the kings own wine which i drank thankfully calling down health on the king  that was a wonderful shot of yours egyptian he said when you sent an arrow through the lioness that dared to attack my majesty yes the king owes his life to you and he is grateful as you shall learn this slave of yours and he pointed to bes in his gaudy attire has brought the whole matter to my mind whence it had fallen and shabaka here he hiccupped you may have noted how differently things look to the naked eye and when seen through a wine goblet he has told me a wonderful storywhat was the story dwarf  may it please the great king answered bes rolling his big eyes only a little tale of another king of my own country whom i used to think great until i came to the east and learned what kings could be that king had a servant with whom he used to hunt indeed he was my own father one day they were out together seeking a certain elephant whose tusks were bigger than those of any other then the elephant charged the king and my father at the risk of his life killed it and claimed the tusks as is the custom among the ethiopians but the king who greatly desired those tusks caused my father to be poisoned that he might take them as his heir only before he died my father who could talk the elephant language told all the other elephants of this wickedness at which they were very angry because they knew well that from the beginning of time their tusks have belonged to him who killed them and the elephants are a people who do not like ancient laws to be altered so the elephants made a league together and when the king next went out hunting taking heed of nothing else they rushed at the king and tore him into pieces no bigger than a finger and then killed the prince his son who was behind him that is the tale of the elephants who love law o king  yes yes said his majesty waking up from a little doze but what became of the great tusks i should like to have them  i inherited them as my fathers son o king and gave them to my master who doubtless will send them to you when he gets back to egypt  a strange tale said the king a very strange tale which seems to remind me of something that happened not long ago what was it well it does not matter egyptian do you seek any reward for that shot of yours at the lioness if so it shall be given to you have you a grudge against anyone for instance  o king i answered i do seek justice against a certain man this evening i was led to the bank of the river in charge of the eunuch houman who desired to take me for a row in a boat on the road for no offence he struck me on the head with the handle of his flywhip see here are the marks of it o king unless the king commanded him to strike me which i do not remember i seek justice against this eunuch  now the king grew very angry and cried  what did the dog dare to strike a freeborn noble egyptian  here houman threw himself upon his face in terror and began to babble out i know not what about the punishment of the boat which was unlucky for him for it put the matter into the kings mind  the boat he cried ah yes the boat being so fat you will fit it well eunuch to the boat with him and before he enters it a hundred blows upon the feet with the rods and he pointed at him with his sceptre  then guards sprang upon houman and dragged him away as he went he clutched at bes but hissing something into his ear the dwarf bit him through the hand till he let go so houman departed and the kings guests laughed at the sight for he had worked mischief to many  when he had gone the king stared at me and asked  but why did i disturb you from your sleep egyptian oh i remember this dwarf says that he has seen the fairest woman in the whole world and the most learned some lady of egypt but that he does not know her name that you alone know her name i disturbed you that you might tell it to me but if you have forgotten it you can go back to your bed and rest there till it returns to you there are plenty of boats in the river egyptian  the fairest and most learned woman in the world i said astonished who can that be unless he means the lady amada and i paused wishing i had bitten out my tongue before i spoke for i smelt a trap  yes master said bes in a clear voice that was the name the lady amada  who is this lady amada asked the king seeming to grow suddenly sober and what is she like  i can tell you that o king said bes she is like a willow shaken in the wind for slenderness and grace she has eyes like those of a buck at gaze she has lips like rosebuds she has hair black as the night and soft as silk the odour of which floats round her like that of flowers she has a voice that whispers like the evening wind and yet is rich as honey oh she is beautiful as a goddess and when men see her their hearts melt like wax in the sun and for a long while they can look upon no other woman not till the next day indeed if they meet her in the evening and bes smacked his thick lips and gazed upwards  by the holy fire laughed the king i feel my heart melting already say shabaka what do you know of this amada is she married or a maiden  now i answered because i must for after all that boat was not far away nor did i dare to lie  she is married o king of kings to the goddess isis whom she loves alone  a woman married to a woman or rather to the queen of women he answered laughing well that matters little  nay o king it matters much since she is under the protection of isis and inviolate  that remains to be seen shabaka i think that i would dare the wrath of every false goddess in heaven to win such a prize learned also you say shabaka  aye o king full of learning to the finger tips a prophetess also one in whom the divine fire burns like a lamp in a vase of alabaster one to whom visions come and who can read the future and the past  still better said the king one then who would be a fitting consort for the king of kings who wearies of fat roundeyed sweetmeatsucking fools whereof there are hundreds yonder and he pointed towards the house of women who is this maids father  he is dead but she is the niece of the prince peroa and by birth the royal lady of egypt o king  good then she is well born also hearken o shabaka tomorrow you start back to egypt bearing letters from me to my vassal peroa and to my satrap idernes bidding peroa to hand over this lady amada to idernes and bidding idernes to send her to the east with all honour and without delay that she may enter my household as one of my wives  now i was filled with rage and horror and about to refuse this mission when bes broke in swiftly  will the king of kings be pleased to give command as to my masters safe and honourable escort to egypt  it is commanded with all things necessary for shabaka the egyptian and the dwarf his servant with the gold and gems and slaves he won from me in a wager and everything else that is his let it be recorded  scribes sprang forward and wrote the kings words down while like one in a dream i thought to myself that they could not now be altered the king watched them sleepily for a while then seemed to wake up and grow clearminded again at least he said to me  fortune has shown you smiles and frowns today egyptian and the smiles last yet remember that she has teeth behind her lips wherewith to tear out the throat of the faithless man if you play me false or fail in your mission be sure that you shall die and in such a fashion that will make you think of yonder boat as a pleasant bed and with you this woman amada and her uncle peroa and all your kin and hers yes he added with a burst of shrewdness and even that abortion of a dwarf to whom i have listened because he amused me but who perhaps is more cunning than he seems  o king of kings i said i will not be false but i did not add to whom i would be true  good ere long i shall visit egypt as i have told you and there i shall pass judgment on you and others till then farewell fear nothing for you have my safeconduct begone both of you for you weary me but first drink and keep the cup and in exchange give me that bow of yours which shoots so far and straight  it is the kings i answered as i pledged him in the golden jewelled cup which a butler had handed to me  then the curtain fell in front of the throne and chamberlains came forward to lead me and bes back to our lodging one of whom took the cup and bore it in front of us down the hall we went between the feasting nobles who all bowed to one to whom the great king had shown favour and so out of the palace through the quiet night back to the house where i had dwelt while waiting audience of the king here the chamberlains bade me farewell giving the cup to bes to carry and saying that on the morrow early my gold should be brought to me together with all that was needed for my journey also one who would receive the bow i had promised to the king which had already been returned to my lodgings with everything that was ours then they bowed and went  we entered the house climbing a stair to an upper chamber here bes barred the door and the shutters making sure that none could see or hear us  then he turned threw his arms about me kissed my hand and burst into tears     chapter vii bes steals the signet  oh my master gulped bes i weep because i am tired so take no notice the day was long and during it twice at least there has been but the twinkling of an eyelid but the thickness of a finger nail but the weight of a hair between you and death  yes i said and you were the eyelid the finger nail and the hair  no master not i but something beyond me the tool carves the statue and the hand holds the tool but the spirit guides the hand not once only since the sun rose has my mind been empty as a drum then something struck on it perhaps the holy tanofir perhaps another and it knew what note to sound so it was when i cursed you in the boat so it was when i walked back with the eunuch meaning to kill him on the road and then remembered that the death of one vile eunuch would not help you at all whereas alive he could bring me to the presence of the king if i paid him as i did out of the gold in your purse which i carried moreover he earned his hire for when the king grew dull wine not yet having taken a hold on him it was he who brought me to his mind as one who might amuse him being so ugly and different from others if only for a few minutes after the women dancers had failed to do so  and what happened then bes  then i was fetched and did my juggling tricks with that snake i caught and tamed which is in my pouch now you should not hate it any more master for it played your game well after this the king began to talk to me and i saw that his mind was ill at ease about you whom he knew that he had wronged so i told him that story of an elephant that my father killed to save a kingit grew up in my mind like a toadstool in the night master did this story of an ungrateful king and what befell him then the king became still more unquiet in his heart about you and asked the eunuch houman where you were to which he answered that by his order you were sleeping in a boat and might not be disturbed so that arrow of mine missed its mark because the king did not like to eat his own words and cause you to be brought from out the boat whither he had sent you now when everything seemed lost some god or perhaps the holy tanofir who is ever present with me to see that i have not forgotten him put it into the kings mouth to begin to talk about women and to ask me if i had ever seen any fairer than those dancers whom i met going out as i came in i answered that i had not noticed them much because they were so ugly as indeed all women had seemed to me since once upon the banks of nile i had looked upon one who was as hathor herself for beauty the king asked me who this might be and i answered that i did not know since i had never dared to ask the name of one whom even my master held to be as a goddess although as boy and girl they had been brought up together  then the king saw his opportunity to ease his conscience and inquired of an old councillor if there were not a law which gave the king power to alter his decree if thereby he could satisfy his soul and acquire knowledge the councillor answered that there was such a law and began to give examples of its working till the king cut him short and said that by virtue of it he commanded that you should be brought out of your bed in the boat and led before him to answer a question  so you were sent for master but i did not go with the messengers fearing lest if i did the king would forget all about the matter before you came therefore i stayed and amused him with tales of hunting till i could not think of any more for you were long in coming indeed i began to fear lest he should declare the feast at an end but at the last just as he was yawning and spoke to one of his councillors bidding him send to the house of women that they might make ready to receive him there you came and the rest you know  now i looked at bes and said  may the blessing of all the gods of all the lands be on your head since had it not been for you i should now lie in torment in that boat hearken friend if ever we reach egypt again you will set foot on it not as a slave but as a free man you will be rich also bes that is if we can take the gold i won with us since half of it is yours  bes squatted down upon the floor and looked up at me with a strange smile on his ugly face  you have given me three things master he said gold which i do not want at present freedom which i do not want at present and mayhap never shall while you live and love me and the title of friend this i do want though why i should care to hear it from your lips i am not sure seeing that for a long while i have known that it was spoken in your heart since you have said it however i will tell you something which hitherto i have hid even from you i have a right to that name for if your blood is high o shabaka so is mine know that this poor dwarf whom you took captive and saved long years ago was more than the petty chief which he declared himself to be he was and is by right the king of the ethiopians and that throne with all its wealth and power he could claim tomorrow if he would  the king of the ethiopians i said oh friend bes i pray you to remember that we no longer stand in yonder court lying for our lives  i speak no lie o shabaka i before you am king of the ethiopians moreover i laid that kingship down of my own will and should i so desire can take it up again when i will since the ethiopians are faithful to their kings  why i asked astonished  master for so i will still call you who am not yet upon the land of egypt where you have promised me freedom do you remember anything strange about the people of that tribe from among whom you and the egyptian soldiers captured me by surprise because they wished to drive you and your following from their country  now i thought and answered  yes one thing i saw no women in their camp nor any sign of children this i know because i gave orders that such were to be spared and it was reported to me that there were none so i supposed that they had fled away  there were none to fly master that tribe was a brotherhood which had abjured women look on me now i am misshapen hideous am i not born thus it is said because before my birth my mother was frightened by a dwarf yet the law of the ethiopians is that their kings must marry within a year of their crowning therefore i chose a woman to be the queen whom i had long desired in secret she scorned me vowing that not for all the thrones of all the world would she be mated to a monster and that if it were done by force she would kill herself a saying that went abroad throughout the land i said that she had spoken well and sent her in safety from the country after which i too laid down my crown and departed with some who loved me to form a brotherhood of womenhaters further down the nile beyond the borders of ethiopia there the egyptian force of which you were in command attacked us unprepared and you made me your slave that is all  but why did you do this bes seeing that maidens are many and all would not have thought thus  because i wished for that one only master also i feared lest i should become the father of a breed of twisted dwarfs so i who was a king am now a slave and yet who knows which way the grasshopper will jump one day from a slave i may again grow into a king and now let us seek that wherein kings are as slaves and slaves as kingssleep  so we lay down and slept i thanking the gods that my bed was not yonder in the boat upon the great river  when i woke refreshed though after all i had gone through on the yesterday my brain still swam a little the light was pouring through the carved work of the shuttered windows by it i saw bes seated on the floor engaged in doing something to his bow which as i have said had been restored to us with our other weapons and asked him sleepily what it was  master he said yonder king demanded your bow and therefore a bow must be sent to him but there is no need for it to be that with which you shot the lions which too you value above anything you have seeing that it came down to you from your forefather who was a pharaoh of egypt and has been your companion from boyhood ever since you were strong enough to draw it as you may remember i copied that bow out of a somewhat lighter wood which i could bend with ease and it is the copy that we will give to the king only first i must set your string upon it for that may have been noted also make one or two marks that are on your bow which i am finishing now having begun the task with the dawn  you are clever i said laughing and i am glad the holy tanofir looking on my bow once had a vision it was that an arrow loosed from it would drink the blood of a great king and save egypt but what king and when he did not see  the dwarf nodded and answered  i have heard that tale and so have others therefore i play this trick since it is better that yonder palace dweller should get the arrow than the bow there it is finished to the last scratch and none save you and i would know them apart till we are clear of this cursed land your bow is mine master and you must find you another of the eastern make  master i repeated after him say bes did i dream or did you in truth tell me last night that you are by birth and right the king of a great country  i told you that master and it is true no dream since joy and suffering mixed unseal the lips and from them comes that at times which the heart would hide now i ask a favour of you that you will speak no more of this matter either to me or to any other man or woman unless i should speak of it first let it be as though it were indeed a dream  it is granted i said as i rose and clothed myself not in my own garments which had been taken from me in the palace but in the splendid silken robes that had been set upon me after i was loosed from the boat when this was done and i had washed and combed my long curling hair we descended to a lower chamber and called for the woman of the house to bring us food of which i ate heartily as we finished our meal we heard shouts in the street outside of make way for the servants of the king and looking through the windowplace saw a great cavalcade approaching headed by two princes on horseback  now i pray that yonder tyrant has not changed his mind and that these do not come to take me back to the boat i said in a low voice  have no fear master answered bes seeing that you have touched his sceptre and drunk from his cup which he gave to you after these things no harm can happen to you in any land he rules therefore be at ease and deal with these fellows proudly  a minute later two princes entered followed by slaves who bore many things among them those hide bags filled with gold that had been set beneath me in the boat the elder of them bowed greeting me with the title of lord and i bowed back to him then he handed me certain rolls tied up with silk and sealed which he said i was to deliver as the king had commanded to the kings satrap in egypt and to the prince peroa also he gave me other letters addressed to the kings servants on the road and written on tablets of clay in a writing i could not read with all of which i touched my forehead in the eastern fashion  after this he told me that by noon all would be ready for my journey which i should make with the rank of the kings envoy duly provisioned and escorted by his servants with liberty to use the royal horses from post to post then he ordered the slaves to bring in the gifts which the king sent to me and these were many including even suits of flexible armour that would turn any swordthrust or arrow  i thanked him saying that i would be ready to start by noon and asked whether the king wished to see me before i rode he replied that he had so wished but that as he was suffering in his head from the effects of the sun he could not he bade me however remember all that he had said to me and to be sure that the beauteous lady amada of whom i had spoken was sent to him without delay in that case my reward should be great but if i failed to fulfil his commands then his wrath would be greater and i should perish miserably as he had promised  i bowed and made no answer after which he and his companions opened the bags of gold to show me that it was there offering to weigh it again against my servant the dwarf so that i could see that nothing had been taken away  i replied that the kings word was truer than any scale whereon the bags were tied up again and sealed then i produced the bow or rather its counterfeit and having shown it to the princes wrapped it and six of my own arrows in a linen cloth to be taken to the king with a message that though hard to draw it was the deadliest weapon in the world the elder of them took it bowed and bade me farewell saying that perhaps we should meet again ere long in egypt if my gods gave me a safe journey so we parted and i was glad to see the last of them  scarcely had they gone when the six hunters whom i had won in the wager and thereby saved from death entered the chamber and fell upon their knees before me asking for orders as to making ready my gear for the journey i inquired of them if they were coming also to which their spokesman replied that they were my slaves to do what i commanded  do you desire to come i inquired  o lord shabaka answered their spokesman we do though some of us must leave wives and children behind us  why i asked  for two reasons lord here we are men disgraced though through no fault of our own and if you were to leave us in this land soon the anger of the king would find us out and we should lose not only our wives and children but with them our lives whereas in another land we may get other wives and more children but never shall we get another life therefore we would leave those dear ones to our friends knowing that soon the women will forget and find other husbands and that the children will grow up to whatever fate is appointed them thinking of us their fathers as dead secondly we are hunters by trade and we have seen that you are a great hunter one whom we shall always be proud to serve in the chase or in war one too who went out of his path to save our lives because he saw that we had been unjustly doomed to a cruel death therefore we desire nothing better than to be your slaves hoping that perchance we may earn our liberty from you in days to come by our good service  is that the wish of all of you i asked  speaking one by one they said that it was though tears rose in the eyes of some of them who were married at the thought of parting from their women and their little ones who it seemed might not be brought with them because they were the people of the king and had not been named in the bet moreover horses could not be found for so many nor could they travel fast  come then i said and know that while you are faithful to me i will be good to you men of my own trade and perhaps in the end set you free in a land where brave fellows are not given to be torn to pieces by wild beasts at the word of any kind but if you fail me or betray me then either i will kill you or sell you to those who deal in slaves to work at the oar or in the mines till you die  henceforth we have no lord but you o shabaka they said and one after another took my hand and pressed it to their foreheads vowing to be true to me in all things while we lived  so i bade them begone to bid farewell to those they loved and return again within half an hour of noon never expecting to tell the truth that they would come indeed i did this to give them the opportunity of escaping if they saw fit and hiding themselves where they would but as i have often noted the trade of hunting breeds honesty in the blood and at the hour appointed all of these men appeared one of them with a woman who carried a child in her arms clinging to him and weeping bitterly when her veil slipped aside i saw that she was young and very fair to look on    so at noon we left the city of the great king in the charge of two of his officers who brought me his thanks for the bow i had sent him which he said he should treasure above everything he possessed a saying at which bes rolled his yellow eyes and grinned we were mounted on splendid stallions from the royal stables and clad in the shirts of mail that had been presented to us though when we were clear of the city we took these off because of the heat also because that which bes wore chafed him being too long for his squat shape our goods together with the bags of gold were laden on sumpter horses which were led by my six hunter slaves four picked soldiers brought up the rear mighty men from the kings own bodyguard and two of the royal postmen who served us as guides also there were cooks and grooms with spare horses  thus we started in state and a great crowd watched us go our road ran by the river which we must cross in barges lower down so that in a few minutes we came to that quay whither i had been led on the previous night to die yes there were the watching guards and there floated the hateful double boat at the prow of which appeared the tortured face of the eunuch houman who rolled his head from side to side to rid himself of the torment of the flies he caught sight of us and began to scream for pity and forgiveness whereat bes smiled the officers halted our cavalcade and one of them approaching me said  it is the kings command o lord shabaka that you should look upon this villain who traduced you to the king and afterwards dared to strike you if you will enter the water and blind him that your face may be the last thing he sees before he passes into darkness  i shook my head but bes into whose mind some thought had come whispered to me  i wish to speak with yonder eunuch so give me leave and fear nothing i will do him no hurt only good if i find the chance  then i said to the officer  it is not for great lords to avenge themselves upon the fallen yet my slave here was also wronged and would say a word to yonder houman  so be it said the officer only let him be careful not to hurt him too sorely lest he should die before the time and escape his punishment  then bes tucked up his robes and waded into the river flourishing a great knife while seeing him come houman began to scream with fear he reached the boat and bent over the eunuch talking to him in a low voice what he did there i could not see because his cloak was spread out on either side of the mans head presently however i caught sight of the flash of a knife and heard yells of agony followed by groans whereat i called to him to return and let the fellow be for when i remembered that his fate was near to being my own those sounds made me sick at heart and i grew angry with bes though the cruel easterns only laughed  at length he came back grinning and washing the blade of his knife in the water i spoke fiercely to him in my own language and still he grinned on making no answer when we were mounted again and riding away from that horrible boat with its groaning prisoner watching bes whose behaviour and silence i could not understand i saw him sweep his hand across his great mouth and thrust it swiftly into his bosom after this he spoke readily enough though in a low voice lest someone who understood egyptian should overhear him  you are a fool master he said to think that i should wish to waste time in torturing that fat knave  then why did you torture him i asked  because my god the grasshopper when he fashioned me a dwarf gave me a big mouth and good teeth he answered whereon i stared at him thinking that he had gone mad  listen master i did not hurt houman all i did was to cut his cords nearly through from the under side so that when night comes he can break them and escape if he has the wit now master you may not have noticed but i did that before the king doomed you to death by the boat yesterday he took a certain round white seal a cylinder with gods and signs cut on it which hung by a gold chain from his girdle and gave it to houman to be his warrant for all he did this seal houman showed to the treasurer whereon they produced the gold that was weighed in the scales against me and to others when he ordered the boat to be prepared for you to lie in moreover he forgot to return it for when he himself was dragged off to the boat by direct command of the king i caught sight of the chain beneath his robe can you guess the rest  not quite i answered for i wished to hear the tale in his own words  well master when i was walking with houman after he had put you in the boat i asked him about this seal he showed it to me and said that he who bore it was for the time the king of all the empire of the east it seems that there is but one such seal which has descended from ancient days from king to king and that of it every officer great or small has an impress in all lands if the seal is produced to him he compares it with the impress and should the two agree he obeys the order that is brought as though the king had given it in person when we reached the court doubtless houman would have returned the seal but seeing that the king was or feigned to be drunk waited for fear lest it should be lost and with it his life then he was seized as you saw and in his terror forgot all about the seal as did the king and his officers  but surely bes those who took houman to the boat would have removed it  master even the most clearsighted do not see well at night at any rate my hope was that they had not done so and that is why i waded out to prick the eyes of houman moreover as i had hoped so it was there beneath his robe i saw the chain then i spoke to him saying  i am come to put out your eyes as you deserve seeing how you have treated my master still i will spare you at a price give me the kings ancient white seal that opens all doors and i will only make a pretence of blinding you moreover i will cut your cords nearly through so that when the night comes you can break them roll into the river and escape  take it if you can he said and use it to injure or destroy that accursed one  so you took it bes  yes master but not easily remember it was on a chain about the mans neck and i could not draw it over his head for like his hands his throat was tied by a cord as you remember yours was  i remember very well i said for my throat is still sore from the rope that ran to the same staples to which my hands were fastened  yes master and therefore if i drew the chain off his neck it would still have been on the ropes i thought of trying to cut it with the knife but this was not easy because it is thick and if i had dragged it up on the blade of the knife it would have been seen for many eyes were watching me master then i took another counsel while i pretended to be putting out the eyes of houman i bent down and getting the chain between my teeth i bit it through one tooth brokesee but the next finished the business i ate through the soft gold master and then sucked up the chain and the round white seal into my mouth and that is why i could not answer you just now because my cheeks were full of chain so we have the kings seal that all the subject countries know and obey it may be useful yonder in egypt and at least the gold is of value  clever i exclaimed very clever but you have forgotten something bes when that knave escapes he will tell the whole story and the king will send after us and kill us who have stolen his royal seal  i dont think so master first it is not likely that houman will escape he is very fat and soft and already suffers much after a day in the sun also he will be weak moreover i do not think that he can swim for eunuchs hate the water so if he gets out of the boat it is probable that he will drown in the river since he dare not wade to the quay where the guards will be waiting but if he does escape by swimming across the river he will hide for his lifes sake and never be seen again and if by chance he is caught he will say that the seal fell into the water when he was taken to the boat or that one of the guards had stolen it what he will not say is that he had bargained it away with someone who in return cut his cords since for that crime he must die by worse tortures than those of the boat lastly we shall ride so fast that with six hours start none will catch us or if they do i can throw away the chain and swallow the seal  as bes said so it happened the fate of houman i never learned and of the theft of the seal i heard no more until a proclamation was issued to all the kingdoms that a new one was in use but this was not until long afterwards when it had served my turn and that of egypt     chapter viii the lady amada  now day by day hour by hour and minute by minute every detail of that journey appeared before me but to set it all down is needless as i allan quatermain write the record of my vision still i seem to hear the thunder of our horses hoofs while we rushed forward at full gallop over the plains over the mountain passes and by the banks of rivers the speed at which we travelled was wonderful for at intervals of about forty miles were posthouses and at these whatever might be the hour of day or night we found fresh horses from the kings stud awaiting us moreover the postmasters knew that we were coming which astonished me until we discovered that they had been warned of our arrival by two kings messengers who travelled ahead of us  these men it would seem although our officers and guides professed ignorance of the matter must have left the kings palace at dawn on the day of our departure whereas we did not mount in the city till a little after noon therefore they had six hours good start of us and what is more travelled lighter than we did having no sumpter beasts with them and no cooks or servants moreover always they had the pick of the horses and chose the three swiftest beasts leading the third in case one of their own should founder or meet with accident thus it came about that we never caught them up although we covered quite a hundred miles a day only once did i see them far off upon the skyline of a mountain range which we had to climb but by the time we had reached its crest they were gone  at length we came to the desert without accident and crossed it though more slowly but even here the king had his posts which were in charge of arabs who lived in tents by wells of water or sometimes where there was none save what was brought to them so still we galloped on parched by the burning sand beneath and the burning sand above and reached the borders of egypt  here upon the very boundary line the two officers halted the cavalcade saying that their orders were to return thence and make report to the king there then we parted bes and i with the six hunters who still chose to cling to me going forward and the officers of the king with the guides and servants going back the good horses that we rode from the last post they gave to us by the kings command together with the sumpter beasts since horses broken to the saddle were hard to come by in egypt where they were trained to draw chariots these we took sending back my thanks to the king and started on once more bes leading that beast which bore the gold and the hunters serving as a guard  indeed i was glad to see the last of those easterns although they had brought us safely and treated us well for all the while i was never sure but that they had some orders to lead us into a trap or perhaps to make away with us in our sleep and take back the gold and the priceless rosehued pearls any two of which were worth it all but such was not their command nor did they dare to steal them on their own account since then even if they escaped the vengeance of the king their wives and all their families would have paid the price    now we entered egypt near the salt lakes that are not far from the head of the gulf crossing the canal that the old pharaohs had dug which proved easy for it was silted up before we reached it we found some peasant folk labouring in their gardens and i heard one of them call to another  here come more of the easterns what is toward think you neighbour  i do not know answered the other but when i passed down the canal this morning i saw a body of the great kings guards gathering from the fort doubtless it is to meet these men of whose coming the other two who went by fifty hours ago have warned the officers  now what does that mean i asked of bes  neither more nor less than we have heard master the two kings messengers who have gone ahead of us all the way from the city have told the officer of the frontier fort that we are coming so he has advanced to the ford to meet us for what purpose i do not know  nor do i i said but i wish we could take another road if there were one  there is none master for above and below the canal is full of water and the banks are too steep for horses to climb also we must show no doubt or fear  he thought a while then added  take the royal seal master it may be useful  he gave it to me and i examined it more closely than i had done before it was a cylinder of plain white shell hung on a gold chain that which bes had bitten through but now mended again by taking out the broken link on this cylinder were cut figures as i think of a priest presenting a noble to a god over whom was the crescent of the moon while behind the god stood a man or demon with a tall spear also between the figures were mystic signs meaning i know not what the workmanship of the carving was grown shallow with time and use for the cylinder seemed to be very ancient a sacred thing that had descended from generation to generation and was threaded through with a bar of silver on which it turned  i put the seal which was like no other that i had seen being the work of an early and simpler age round my neck beneath my mail and we went on  descending the steep bank of the canal we came to the ford where the sand that had silted in was covered by not more than a foot of water as we entered it on the top of the further bank appeared a body of about thirty armed and mounted men one of whom carried the great kings banner on which i noted was blazoned the very figures that were cut upon the cylinder now it was too late to retreat so we rode through the water and met the soldiers their officer advanced crying  in the name of the great king greeting my lord shabaka  in the name of the great king greeting i answered what would you with shabaka officer of the king  only to do him honour the word of the king has reached us and we come to escort you to the court of idernes the satrap of the king and governor of egypt who sits at sais  that is not my road officer i travel to memphis to deliver the commands of the king to my cousin peroa the ruler of egypt under the king afterwards perchance i shall visit the high idernes  to whom our commands are to take you now my lord shabaka not afterwards said the officer sternly glancing round at his armed escort  i come to give commands not to receive them captain of the king  seize shabaka and his servants said the officer briefly whereon the soldiers rode forward to surround us  i waited till they were near at hand then suddenly i plunged my hand beneath my robe and drew out the small white seal which i held before the eyes of the officer saying  who is it that dares to lay a finger upon the holder of the kings white seal surely that man is ready for death  the officer stared at it then leapt from his horse and flung himself face downwards on the ground crying  it is the ancient signet of the kings of the east given to their first forefather by samas the sungod on which hangs the fortunes of the great house pardon my lord shabaka  it is granted i answered because what you did you did in ignorance now go to the satrap idernes and say to him that if he would have speech with the bearer of the kings seal which all must obey he will find him at memphis farewell and with bes and the six hunters i rode through the guards none striving to hinder me  that was well done master said bes  yes i said those two messengers who went ahead of us brought orders to the frontier guard of idernes that i should be taken to him as a prisoner i do not know why but i think because things are passing in egypt of which we know nothing and the king did not desire that i should see the prince peroa and give him news that i might have gathered mayhap we have been outwitted bes and the business of the lady amada is but a pretext to pick a quarrel suddenly before peroa can strike the first blow  perhaps master for these easterns are very crafty but master what happens to those who make a false use of the kings ancient sacred signet i think they have cut the ropes which tie them to earth and he looked upwards to the sky rolling his yellow eyes  they must find new ropes bes and quickly before they are caught hearken you have sat upon a throne and i can speak out to you think you that my cousin the prince peroa loves to be the servant of this distant eastern king he who by right is pharaoh of egypt peroa must strike or lose his niece and perchance his life forward that we may warn him  and if he will not strike master knowing the kings might and being somewhat slow to move  then bes i think that you and i had best go hunting far away in those lands you know where even the great king cannot follow us  and where if only i can find a woman who does not make me ill to look on and whom i do not make ill i too can once more be a king master and the lord of many thousand brave armed men i must speak of that matter to the holy tanofir  who doubtless will know what to advise you bes or if he dies not i shall  for a while we rode on in silence each thinking his own thoughts then bes said  master before so very long we shall reach the nile and having with us gold in plenty can buy boats and hire crews it comes into my mind that we should do well for our own safety and comfort to start at once on a hunting journey far from egypt in the land of the ethiopians master there perchance i could gather together some of the wise men in whose hands i left the rule of my kingdom and submit to them this question of a woman to marry me the ethiopians are a faithful people master and will not reject me because i have spent some years seeing the world afar that i might learn how to rule them better  i have remembered that it cannot be bes i said  why not master  for this reason you left your country because of a woman i cannot leave mine again because of a woman  bes rolled his eyes around as though he thought to see that woman in the desert not discovering her he stared upwards and there found light  is she perchance named the lady amada master  i nodded  so the lady amada who you told the great king is the most beautiful one in the whole world causing the fire of love to burn up in his royal heart and with it many other things of which we do not know at present  you told him bes i said angrily  i told him of a beautiful one i did not tell him her name master and although i never thought of it at the time perhaps she will be angry with him who told her name  now fear took hold of me and bes saw it in my face  do not be afraid master if there is trouble i will swear that i told the great king that ladys name  yes bes but how would that fit in with the story seeing that i was brought out of the boat for this very purpose  quite easily master since i will say that you were led from the boat to confirm my tale oh she will be angry with me no doubt but in egypt even a dwarf cannot be killed because he has declared a certain lady to be the most beautiful in the world but master tell me when did you learn to love her  when we were boy and girl bes we used to play together being cousins and i used to hold her hand then suddenly she refused to let me hold her hand any more and i being quite grown up then though she was younger understood that i had better go away  i should have stopped where i was master  no bes she was studying to be a priestess and my great uncle the holy tanofir told me that i had better go away so i went down south hunting and fighting in command of the troops and met you bes  which perhaps was better for you master than to stop to watch the lady amada acquire learning still i wonder whether the holy tanofir is always right you see master he thinks a great deal of priests and priestesses and is so very old that he has forgotten all about love and that without it there never would have been a holy tanofir  the holy tanofir thinks of souls not of bodies bes  yes master still oil is of no use without a lamp or a soul without a body at least here underneath the sun or so we were taught who worship the grasshopper but master when you came back from all your hunting what happened then  then i found bes that the lady amada having acquired all the learning possible had taken her first vows to isis which she said she would not break for any man on earth although she might have done so without crime therefore although i was dear to her as a brother would have been had she had one and she swore that she had never even thought of another man she refused so much as to think of marrying who dreamed only of the heavenly perfections of the lady isis  ump said bes we ethiopians have priestesses of the grasshopper or the grasshoppers wife but they do not think of her like that i hope that one day something stronger than herself will not cause the lady amada to break her vows to the heavenly isis only then perhaps it may be for the sake of another man who did not go off to the east on account of such fools talk but here is a village and the horses are spent let us stop and eat as i suppose even the lady amada does sometimes    on the following afternoon we crossed the nile and towards sunset entered the vast and ancient city of memphis on its white walls floated the banners of the great king which bes pointed out to me saying that wherever we went in the whole world it seemed that we could never be free from those accursed symbols  may i live to spit upon them and cast them into the moat i answered savagely for as i drew near to amada they grew ten times more hateful to me than they had been before  in truth i was nearer to amada than i thought for after we had passed the enclosure of the temple of ptah the most wonderful and the mightiest in the whole world we came to the temple of isis there near to the pylon gate we met a procession of her priests and priestesses advancing to offer the evening sacrifice of song and flowers clad all of them in robes of purest white it was a day of festival so singers went with them after the singers came a band of priestesses bearing flowers in front of whom walked another priestess shaking a sistrum that made a little tinkling music  even at a distance there was something about the tall and slender shape of this priestess that stirred me when we came nearer i saw why for it was amada herself through the thin veil she wore i could see her dark and tender eyes set beneath the broad brow that was so full of thought and the sweet curved mouth that was like no other womans moreover there could be no doubt since the veil parting above her breast showed the birthmark for which she was famous the mark of the young moon the sign of isis  i sprang from my horse and ran towards her she looked up and saw me at first she frowned then her face grew wondering then tender and i thought that her red lips shaped my name moreover in her confusion she let the sistrum fall  i muttered amada and stepped forward but priests ran between us and thrust me away next moment she had recovered the sistrum and passed on with her head bowed nor did she lift her eyes to look back  begone man cried a priest begone whoever you may be because you wear eastern armour do you think that you can dare the curse of isis  then i fell back the holy image of the goddess passed and the procession vanished through the pylon gate i shabaka the egyptian stood by my horse and watched it depart i was happy because the lady amada was alive well and more beautiful than ever also because she had shown signs of joy and confusion at seeing me again yet i was unhappy because i met her still filling a holy office which built a wall between us also because it seemed to me an evil omen that i should have been repelled from her by a priest of isis who talked of the curse of the goddess moreover the sacred statue i suppose by accident turned towards me as it passed and perhaps by the chance of light seemed to frown upon me  thus i thought as shabaka hundreds of years before the christian era but as allan quatermain the modern man to whom it was given so marvellously to behold all these things and who in beholding them yet never quite lost the sense of his own identity of today i was amazed for i knew that this lady amada was the same being though clad in different flesh as that other lady with whom i had breathed the magical taduki fumes which had power to rend the curtain of the past or perhaps only to breed dreams of what it might have been  to the outward eye indeed she was different as i was different taller more slender largereyed with longer and slimmer hands than those of any western woman and on the whole even more beautiful and alluring moreover that mysterious look which from time to time i had seen on lady ragnalls face was more constant on that of the lady amada it brooded in the deep eyes and settled in a curious smile about the curves of the lips a smile that was not altogether human such a smile as one might wear who had looked on hidden things and heard voices that spoke beyond the limits of the world  somehow neither then nor at any other time during all my dream could i imagine this amada this daughter of a hundred kings whose blood might be traced back through dynasty on dynasty as nothing but a woman who nurses children upon her breast it was as though something of our common nature had been bred out of her and something of another nature whereof we have no ken had entered to fill its place and yet these two women were the same that i knew or at any rate much of them was the same for who can say what part of us we leave behind as we flit from life to life to find it again elsewhere in the abysms of time and change one thing too was quite identicalthe birthmark of the new moon above the breast which the priests of the kendah had declared was always the seal that marked their prophetess the guardian of the holy child    when the procession had quite departed and i could no longer hear the sound of singing i remounted and rode on to my house or rather to that of my mother the great lady tiu which was situated beneath the wall of the old palace facing towards the nile indeed my heart was full of this mother of mine whom i loved and who loved me for i was her only child and my father had been long dead so long that i could not remember him eight months had gone by since i saw her face and in eight months who knew what might have happened the thought made me cold for she who was aged and not too strong perhaps had been gathered to osiris oh if that were so  i shook my tired horse to a canter bes riding ahead of me to clear a road through the crowded street in which at this hour of sundown all the idlers of memphis seemed to have gathered they stared at me because it was not common to see men riding in memphis and with little love since from my dress and escort they took me to be some envoy from their hated master the great king of the east some even threatened to bar the way but we thrust through and presently turned into a thoroughfare of private houses standing in their own gardens ours was the third of these at its gate i leapt from my horse pushed open the closed door and hastened in to seek and learn  i had not far to go for there in the courtyard standing at the head of our modest household and dressed in her festal robes was my mother the stately and whitehaired lady tiu as one stands who awaits the coming of an honoured guest i ran to her and kneeling kissed her hand saying  my mother my mother i have come safe home and greet you  i greet you also my son she answered bending down and kissing me on the brow who have been in far lands and passed so many dangers i greet you and thank the guardian gods who have brought you safe home again rise my son  i rose and kissed her on the face then looked at the servants who were bowing their welcome to me and said  how comes it lady of the house that all are gathered here did you await some guest  we awaited you my son for an hour have we stood here listening for the sound of your feet  me i exclaimed that is strange seeing that i have ridden fast and hard from the east tarrying only a few minutes and those since i entered memphis when i met and i stopped  met whom shabaka  the lady amada walking in the procession of isis  ah the lady amada the mother waits that the son may stop to greet the lady amada  but why did you wait my mother who but a spirit or a bird of the air could have told you that i was coming seeing that i sent no messenger before me  you must have done so shabaka since yesterday one came from the holy tanofir our relative who dwells in the desert in the burialground of sekera he bore a message from tanofir to me telling me to make ready since before sundown tonight you my son would be with me having escaped great dangers accompanied by the dwarf bes your servant and six strange eastern men so i made ready and waited also i prepared lodging for the six strange men in the outbuildings behind the house and sent a thank offering to the temple for know my son i have suffered much fear for you  and not without cause as you will say when i tell you all i answered laughing but how tanofir knew that i was coming is more than i can guess come my mother greet bes here for had it not been for him never should i have lived to hold your hand again  so she greeted him and thanked him whereon bes rolled his eyes and muttered something about the holy tanofir after which we entered the house thence i despatched a messenger to the prince peroa saying that if it were his pleasure i would wait on him at once seeing that i had much to tell him this done i bathed and caused my hair and beard to be trimmed and discarding the eastern garments clothed myself in those of egypt and so felt that i was my own man again then i came out refreshed and drank a cup of syrian wine and the night having fallen sat down by my mother in the chamber with a lamp between us and holding her hand told her something of my story showing her the sacks of gold that had come with me safely from the east and the chain of priceless rosehued pearls that i had won in a wager from the great king  now when she learned how bes by his wit had saved me from a death of torment in the boat my mother clapped her hands to summon a servant and sent for bes and said to him  bes hitherto i have looked on you as a slave taken by my son the noble shabaka in one of his far journeys that it pleases him to make to fight and to hunt but henceforth i look upon you as a friend and give you a seat at my table moreover it comes into my mind that although so strangely shaped by some evil god perhaps you are more than you seem to be  now bes looked at me to see if i had told my mother anything and when i shook my head answered  i thank you o lady of the house who have but done my duty to my master still it is true that as a goatskin often holds good wine so a dwarf should not always be judged by what can be seen of him  then he went away  it seems that we are rich again son who have been somewhat poor of late years said my mother looking at the bags of gold also there are the pearls which doubtless are worth more than the gold what are you going to do with them shabaka  i thought of offering them as a gift to the lady amada i replied hesitatingly that is unless you  i no i am too old for such gems yet son it might be well to keep them for a time seeing that while they are your own they may give you more weight in the eyes of the prince peroa and others whereas if you gave them the lady amada and she took them perchance it might only be to see them return to the east whither you tell me she is summoned by one whose orders may not be disobeyed  now i turned white with rage and answered  while i live mother amada shall never go to the east to be the woman of yonder king  while you live son but those who cross the will of a great king are apt to die also this is a matter which her uncle the prince peroa must decide as policy dictates now as ever the woman is but a pawn in the game oh my son she went on do not pin all your heart to the robe of this amada she is very fair and very learned but is she one who will love moreover if so she is a priestess and it would be difficult for her to wed who is sworn to isis lastly remember this if egypt were free she would be its heiress not her uncle peroa for hers is the true blood not his would he therefore be willing to give her to any man who according to the ancient custom through her would acquire the right to rule  i do not seek to rule mother i only seek to wed amada whom i love  amada whom you love and whose name you or rather your servant bes which is the same thing since it will be held that he did it by your order gave to the king of the east or so i understand here is a pretty tangle shabaka and rather would i be without all that gold and those priceless pearls than have the task of its unravelling  before i could answer and explain all the truth to her the curtain was swung aside and through it came a messenger from the prince peroa who bade me come to eat with him at once at the palace since he must see me this night  so my mother having set the rope of rosehued pearls in a double chain about my neck i kissed her and went with bes who was also bidden outside a chariot was waiting into which we entered  now master said bes to me as we drove to the palace i almost wish that we were back in another chariot hunting lions in the east  why i asked  because then although we had much to fear there was no woman in the story now the woman has entered it and i think that our real troubles are about to begin oh tomorrow i go to seek counsel of the holy tanofir  and i come with you i answered for i think it will be needed     chapter ix the messengers  we descended at the great gate of the palace and were led through empty halls that were no longer used now when there was no king in egypt to the wing of the building in which dwelt the prince peroa here we were received by a chamberlain for the prince of egypt still kept some state although it was but small and had about him men who bore the old highsounding titles of the officers of pharaoh  the chamberlain led me and bes to an antechamber of the banqueting hall and left us saying that he would summon the prince who wished to see me before he ate this however was not necessary since while he spoke peroa who as i guessed had been waiting for me entered by another door he was a majesticlooking man of middle age for grey showed in his hair and beard clad in white garments with a purple hem and wearing on his brow a golden circlet from the front of which rose the uræus in the shape of a hooded snake that might be worn by those of royal blood alone his face was full of thought and his black and piercing eyes looked heavy as though with sleeplessness indeed i could see that he was troubled his gaze fell upon us and his features changed to a pleasant smile  greeting cousin shabaka he said i am glad that you have returned safe from the east and burn to hear your tidings i pray that they may be good for never was good news more needed in egypt  greeting prince i answered bowing my knee i and my servant here are returned safe but as for our tidings well judge of them for yourself and drawing the letter of the great king from my robe i touched my forehead with the roll and handed it to him  i see that you have acquired the eastern customs shabaka he said as he took it but here in my own house which once was the palace of our forefathers the pharaohs of egypt by your leave i will omit them amen be my witness he added bitterly i cannot bear to lay the letter of a foreign king against my brow in token of my countrys vassalage  then he broke the silk of the seals and read and as he read his face grew black with rage  what he cried casting down the roll and stamping on it what does this dog of an eastern king bid me send my niece by birth the royal princess of egypt to be his toy until he wearies of her first i will choke her with my own hands how comes it shabaka that you care to bring me such a message were i pharaoh now i think your life would pay the price  as it would certainly have paid the price had i not done so prince i brought the letter because i must also a copy of it has gone i believe to idernes the satrap at sais it is better to face the truth prince and i think that i may be of more service to you alive than dead if you do not wish to send the lady amada to the king marry her to someone else after which he will seek her no more  he looked at me shrewdly and said  to whom then i cannot marry her being her uncle and already married do you mean to yourself shabaka  i have loved the lady amada from a child prince i answered boldly also i have high blood in me and having brought much gold from the east am rich again and one accustomed to war  so you have brought gold from the east how well you can tell me afterwards but you fly high you a count of egypt wish to marry the royal lady of egypt for such she is by birth and rank which if ever egypt were free again would give you a title to the throne  i ask no throne prince if there were one to fill i should be content to leave that to you and your heirs  so you say no doubt honestly but would the children of amada say the same would you even say it if you were her husband and would she say it moreover she is a priestess sworn not to wed though perhaps that trouble might be overcome if she wishes to wed which i doubt mayhap you might discover well you are hungry and worn with long travelling come let us eat and afterwards you can tell your story amada and the others will be glad to hear it as i shall follow me count shabaka  so we went to the lesser banquetinghall i filled with joy because i should see amada and yet much afraid because of that story which i must tell gathered there waiting for the prince we found the princess his wife a large and kindly woman also his two eldest daughters and his young son a lad of about sixteen moreover there were certain officers while at the tables of the lower hall sat others of the household men of smaller rank and their wives since peroa still maintained some kind of a shadow of the court of old egypt  the princess and the others greeted me and bes also who had always been a favourite with them before he went to take his seat at the lowest table and i greeted them looking all the while for amada whom i did not see presently however as we took our places on the couches she entered dressed not as a priestess but in the beautiful robes of a great lady of egypt and wearing on her head the uræus circlet that signified her royal blood as it chanced the only seat left vacant was that next to myself which she took before she recognized me for she was engaged in asking pardon for her lateness of the prince and princess saying that she had been detained by the ceremonies at the temple seeing suddenly that i was her neighbour she made as though she would change her place then altered her mind and stayed where she was  greeting cousin shabaka she said though not for the first time today oh my heart was glad when looking up outside the temple i caught sight of you clad in that strange eastern armour and knew that you had returned safe from your long wanderings yet afterwards i must do penance for it by saying two added prayers since at such a time my thoughts should have been with the goddess only  greeting cousin amada i answered but she must be a jealous goddess who grudges a thought to a relativeand friendat such a time  she is jealous shabaka as being the queen of women she must be who demands to reign alone in the hearts of her votaries but tell me of your travels in the east and how you came by that rope of wondrous pearls if indeed there can be pearls so large and beautiful  this at the time i had little chance of doing however since the young princess on the other side of her began to talk to amada about some forthcoming festival and the princes son next to me who was fond of hunting to question me about sport in the east and when unhappily i said that i had shot lions there gave me no peace for the rest of that feast also the princess opposite was anxious to learn what food noble people ate in the east and how it was cooked and how they sat at table and what was the furniture of their rooms and did women attend feasts as in egypt and so forth so it came about that what between these things and eating and drinking which being wellnigh starved i was obliged to do for save a cup of wine i had taken nothing in my mothers house i found little chance of talking with the lovely amada although i knew that all the while she was studying me out of the corners of her large eyes or perhaps it was the rosehued pearls she studied i was not sure  only one thing did she say to me when there was a little pause while the cup went round and she pledged me according to custom and passed it on it was  you look well shabaka though somewhat tired but sadder than you used i think  perhaps because i have seen things to sadden me amada but you too look well but somewhat lovelier than you used i think if that be possible  she smiled and blushed as she replied  the eastern ladies have taught you how to say pretty things but you should not waste them upon me who have done with womens vanities and have given myself to learning andreligion  have learning and religion no vanities of their own i began when suddenly the prince gave a signal to end the feast  thereon all the lower part of the hall went away and the little tables at which we ate were removed by servants leaving us only winecups in our hands which a butler filled from time to time mixing the wine with water this reminded me of something and having asked leave i beckoned to bes who still lingered near the door and took from him that splendid golden goblet which the great king had given me that by my command he had brought wrapped up in linen and hidden beneath his robe having undone the wrappings i bowed and offered it to the prince peroa  what is this wondrous thing asked the prince when all had finished admiring its workmanship is it a gift that you bring me from the king of the east shabaka  it is a gift from myself o prince if you will be pleased to accept it i answered adding yet it is true that it comes from the king of the east since it was his own drinkingcup that he gave me in exchange for a certain bow though not the one he sought after he had pledged me  you seem to have found much favour in the eyes of this king shabaka which is more than most of us egyptians do he exclaimed then went on hastily still i thank you for your splendid gift and however you came by it shall value it much  perhaps my cousin shabaka will tell us his story broke in amada her eyes still fixed upon the rosehued pearls and of how he came to win all the beauteous things that dazzle our eyes tonight  now i thought of offering her the pearls but remembering my mothers words also that the princess might not like to see another woman bear off such a prize did not do so so i began to tell my story instead bes seated on the ground near to me by the princes wish that he might tell his  the tale was long for in it was much that went before the day when i saw myself in the chariot hunting lions with the king of kings which i the modern man who set down all this vision now learned for the first time it told of the details of my journey to the east of my coming to the royal city and the rest all of which it is needless to repeat then i came to the lion hunt to my winning of the wager and all that happened to me of my being condemned to death of the weighing of bes against the gold and of how i was laid in the boat of torment a story at which i noticed amada turn pale and tremble  here i ceased saying that bes knew better than i what had chanced at the court while i was pinned in the boat whereon all present cried out to bes to take up the tale this he did and much better than i could have done bringing out many little things which made the scene appear before them as ethiopians have the art of doing at last he came to the place in his story where the king asked him if he had ever seen a woman fairer than the dancers and went on thus  o prince i told the great king that i had that there dwelt in egypt a lady of royal blood with eyes like stars with hair like silk and long as an unbridled horses tail with a shape like to that of a goddess with breath like flowers with skin like milk with a voice like honey with learning like to that of the god thoth with wit like a razors edge with teeth like pearls with majesty of bearing like to that of the king himself with fingers like rosebuds set in pink seashells with motion like that of an antelope with grace like that of a swan floating upon water andi dont remember the rest o prince  perhaps it is as well exclaimed peroa but what did the king say then  he asked her name o prince  and what name did you give to this wondrous lady who surpasses all the goddesses in loveliness and charm o dwarf bes inquired amada much amused  what name o highborn one is it needful to ask why what name could i give but your own for is there any other in the world of whom a man whose heart is filled with truth could speak such things  now hearing this i gasped but before i could speak amada leapt up crying  wretch you dared to speak my name to this king surely you should be scourged till your bones are bare  and why not lady would you have had me sit still and hear those fat trollops of the east exalted above you would you have had me so disloyal to your royal loveliness  you should be scourged repeated amada stamping her foot my uncle i pray you cause this knave to be scourged  nay nay said peroa moodily poor simple man he knew no better and thought only to sing your praises in a far land be not angry with the dwarf niece had it been shabaka who gave your name the thing would be different what happened next bes  only this prince said bes looking upwards and rolling his eyes as was his fashion when unloading some great lie from his heart the king sent his servants to bring my master from the boat that he might inquire of him whether he had always found me truthful for prince those easterns set much store by truth which here in egypt is worshipped as a goddess there they do not worship her because she lives in the heart of every man and some women  now all stared at bes who continued to stare at the ceiling and i rose to say something i know not what when suddenly the doors opened and through them appeared heralds crying  hearken peroa prince of egypt by grace of the great king a message from the great king read and obey o peroa prince of egypt by grace of the great king  as they cried thus from between them emerged a man whose long eastern robes were stained with the dust of travel advancing without salute he drew out a roll touched his forehead with it bowing deeply and handed it to the prince saying  kiss the word read the word obey the word o servant of our master the king of kings beneath whose feet we are all but dust  peroa took the roll made a semblance of lifting it to his forehead opened and read it as he did so i saw the veins swell upon his neck and his eyes flash but he only said  o messenger tonight i feast tomorrow an answer shall be given to you to convey to the satrap idernes my servants will find you food and lodging you are dismissed  let the answer be given early lest you also should be dismissed o peroa said the man with insolence  then he turned his back upon the prince as one does on an inferior and walked away accompanied by the herald  when they were gone and the doors had been shut peroa spoke in a voice that was thick with fury saying  hearken all of you to the words of the writing  then he read it    from the king of kings the ruler of all the earth to peroa one   of his servants in the satrapy of egypt   deliver over to my servant idernes without delay the person of   amada a lady of the blood of the old pharaohs of egypt who is   your relative and in your guardianship that she may be numbered   among the women of my house   now all present looked at each other while amada stood as though she had been frozen into stone before she could speak peroa went on  see how the king seeks a quarrel against me that he may destroy me and bray egypt in his mortar and tan it like a hide to wrap about his feet nay hold your peace amada have no fear you shall not be sent to the east first will i kill you with my own hands but what answer shall we give for the matter is urgent and on it hang all our lives bethink you idernes has a great force yonder at sais and if i refuse outright he will attack us which indeed is what the king means him to do before we can make preparation say then shall we fight or shall we fly to upper egypt abandoning memphis and there make our stand  now the councillors present seemed to find no answer for they did not know what to say but bes whispered in my ear  remember master that you hold the kings seal let an answer be sent to idernes under the white seal bidding him wait on you  then i rose and spoke  o peroa i said as it chances i am the bearer of the private signet of the great king which all men must obey in the north and in the south in the east and in the west wherever the sun shines over the dominions of the king look on it and taking the ancient white seal from about my neck i handed it to him  he looked and the councillors looked then they said almost with one voice  it is the white seal the very signet of the great kings of the east and they bowed before the dreadful thing  how you came by this we do not know shabaka said peroa that can be inquired of afterwards yet in truth it seems to be the old signet of signets that which has come down from father to son for countless generations that which the king of kings carries on his person and affixes to his private orders and to the greatest documents of state which afterwards can never be recalled that of which a copy is emblazoned on his banner  it is i answered and from the kings person it came to me for a while if any doubt let the impress be brought that is furnished to all the officers throughout the empire and let the seal be set in the impress  now one of the officers rose and went to bring the impress which was in his keeping but peroa continued  if this be the true seal how would you use it shabaka to help us in our present trouble  thus prince i answered i would send a command under the seal to idernes to wait upon the holder of the seal here in memphis he will suspect a trap and will not come until he has gathered a great army then he will come but meanwhile you prince can also collect an army  that needs gold shabaka and i have little the king of kings takes all in tribute  i have some prince to the weight of a heavy man and it is at the service of egypt  i thank you shabaka believe me such generosity shall not go unrewarded and he glanced at amada who dropped her eyes but if we can collect the army what then  then you can put memphis into a state of defence then too when idernes comes i will meet him and as the bearer of the seal command him under the seal to retreat and disperse his army  but if he does shabaka it will only be until he has received fresh orders from the great king whereon he will advance again  no prince he will not advance or that army either for when they are in retreat we will fall on them and destroy them and declare you o prince pharaoh of egypt though what will happen afterwards i do not know  when they heard this all gasped only amada whispered  well said and bes clapped his big hands softly in the ethiopian fashion  a bold counsel said peroa and one on which i must have the night to think return here shabaka an hour after sunrise tomorrow by which time i can gather all the wisest men in memphis and we will discuss this matter ah here is the impress now let the seal be tried  a box was brought and opened in it was a slab of wood on which was an impress of the kings seal in wax surrounded by those of other seals certifying that it was genuine also there was a writing describing the appearance of the seal i handed the signet to peroa who having compared it with the description in the writing fitted it to the impress on the wax  it is the same he said see all of you  they looked and nodded then he would have given it back to me but i refused to take it saying  it is not well that this mighty symbol should hang about the neck of a private man whence it might be stolen or lost  or who might be murdered for its sake interrupted peroa  yes prince therefore take it and hide it in the safest and most secret place in the palace and with it these pearls that are too priceless to be flaunted about the streets of memphis at night unless indeed and i turned to look for amada but she was gone  so the seal and the pearls were taken and locked in the box with the impress and borne away nor was i sorry to see the last of them wisely as it happened then i bade the prince and his company good night and presently was driving homeward with bes in the chariot  our way led us past some large houses once occupied by officers of the court of pharaoh but now that there was no court fallen into ruins suddenly from out of these houses sprang a band of men disguised as common robbers whose faces were hidden by cloths with eyeholes cut in them they seized the horses by the bridles and before we could do anything leapt upon us and held us fast then a tall man speaking with a foreign accent said  search that officer and the dwarf take from them the seal upon a gold chain and a rope of rosehued pearls which they have stolen but do them no harm  so they searched us the tall man himself helping and aided by others holding bes who struggled with them and searched the chariot also by the light of the moon but found nothing the tall man muttered that i must be the wrong officer and at a sign they left us and ran away  that was a wise thought of mine bes which caused me to leave certain ornaments in the palace i said as it is they have taken nothing  yes master he answered though i have taken something from them a saying that i did not understand at the time those easterns whom we met by the canal told idernes about the seal and he ordered this to be done that tall man was one of the messengers who came tonight to the palace  then why did they not kill us bes  because murder especially of one who holds the seal is an ugly business that is easily tracked down whereas thieves are many in memphis and who troubles about them when they have failed oh the grasshopper or amen or both have been with us tonight  so i thought although i said nothing for since we had come off scatheless what did it matter well this it showed me that the signet of the great king was indeed to be dreaded and coveted even here in egypt if idernes could get it into his possession what might he not do with it cause himself to be proclaimed pharaoh perhaps and become the forefather of an independent dynasty why not when the empire of the east was taxed with a great war elsewhere and if this was so why should not peroa do the same he who had behind him all old egypt maddened with its wrongs and foreign rule  that same night before i slept but after bes and i had hidden away the bags of gold by burying them beneath the clay floor i laid the whole matter before my mother who was a very wise woman she heard me out answering little then said  the business is very dangerous and of its end i will not speak until i have heard the counsel of your greatuncle the holy tanofir still things having gone so far it seems to me that boldness may be the best course since the great king has his grecian wars to deal with and whatever he may say cannot attack egypt yet awhile therefore if peroa is able to overcome idernes and his army he may cause himself to be proclaimed pharaoh and make egypt free if only for a time  such is my mind mother  not all your mind son i think she answered smiling for you think more of the lovely amada than of these high policies at any rate tonight well marry your amada if you can though i misdoubt me somewhat of a woman who is so lost in learning and thinks so much about her soul at least if you marry her and egypt should become free as it was for thousands of years you will be the next heir to the throne as husband of the great royal lady  how can that be mother seeing that peroa has a son  a vain youth with no more in him than a childs rattle if once amada ceases to think about her soul she will begin to think about her throne especially if she has children but all this is far away and for the present i am glad that neither she nor the thieves have got those pearls though perhaps they might be safer here than where they are and now my son go rest for you need it and dream of nothing not even amada who for her part will dream of isis if at all i will wake you before the dawn  so i went being too tired to talk more and slept like a crocodile in the sun till as it seemed to me but a few minutes later i saw my mother standing over me with a lamp saying that it was time to rise i rose unwillingly enough but refreshed washed and dressed myself by which time the sun had begun to appear then i ate some food and calling bes made ready to start for the palace  my son said my mother the lady tiu before we parted while you have been sleeping i have been thinking as is the way of the old peroa your cousin will be glad enough to make use of you but he does not love you over much because he is jealous of you and fears lest you should become his rival in the future still he is an honest man and will keep a bargain which he once has made now it seems that above everything on earth you desire amada on whom you have set your heart since boyhood but who has always played with you and spoken to you with her arm stretched out also life is short and may come to an end any day as you should know better than most men who have lived among dangers and therefore it is well that a man should take what he desires even if he finds afterwards that the rose he crushes to his breast has thorns for then at least he will have smelt the rose not only have looked on and longed to smell it therefore before you hand over your gold and place your wit and strength at the service of peroa make your bargain with him namely that if thereby you save amada from the kings house of women and help to set peroa on the throne he shall promise her to you free of any priestly curse you giving her as dowry the priceless rosehued pearls that are worth a kingdom so you will get your rose till it withers and if the thorns prick do not blame me and one day you may become a kingor a slave amen knows which  now i laughed and said that i would take her counsel who desired amada and nothing else as for all her talk about thorns i paid no heed to it knowing that she loved me very much and was jealous of amada who she thought would take her place with me     chapter x shabaka plights his troth  bes and i went armed to the palace walking in the middle of the road but now that the sun was up we met no more robbers at the gate a messenger summoned me alone to the presence of peroa who he said wished to talk with me before the sitting of the council i went and found him by himself  i hear that you were attacked last night he said after greeting me  i answered that i was and told him the story adding that it was fortunate i had left the white seal and the pearls in safe keeping since without doubt the wouldbe thieves were easterns who desired to recover them  ah the pearls he said one of those who handled them who was once a dealer in gems says that they are without price unmatched in the whole world and that never in all his life has he seen any to equal the smallest of them  i replied that i believed this was so then he asked me of the value of the gold of which i had spoken i told him and it was a great sum for gold was scarce in egypt his eyes gleamed for he needed wealth to pay soldiers  and all this you are ready to hand over to me shabaka  now i bethought me of my mothers words and answered  yes prince at a price  what price shabaka  the price of the hand of the royal lady amada freed from her vows moreover i will give her the pearls as a marriage dowry and place at your service my sword and all the knowledge i have gained in the east swearing to stand or fall with you  i thought it shabaka well in this world nothing is given for nothing and the offer is a fair one you are well born too as well as myself and a brave and clever man further amada has not taken her final vows and therefore the high priests can absolve her from her marriage to the goddess or to her son horus whichever it may be for i do not understand these mysteries but shabaka if fortune should chance to go with us and i should became the first pharaoh of a new dynasty in egypt he who was married to the royal princess of the true blood might become a danger to my throne and family  i shall not be that man prince who am content with my own station and to be your servant  and my sons shabaka you know that i have but one lawful son  and your sons prince  you are honest shabaka and i believe you but how about your sons if you have any and how about amada herself well in great businesses something must be risked and i need the gold and the rest which i cannot take for nothing for you won them by your skill and courage and they are yours but how you won the seal you have not told us nor is there time for you to do so now  he thought a little walking up and down the chamber then went on  i accept your offer shabaka so far as i can  so far as you can prince  yes i can give you amada in marriage and make that marriage easy but only if amada herself consents the will of a royal princess of egypt of full age cannot be forced save by her father if he reigns as pharaoh and i am not her father but only her guardian therefore it stands thus are you willing to fulfil your part of the bargain save only as regards the pearls if she does not marry you and to take your chance of winning amada as a man wins a woman i on my part promising to do all in my power to help your suit  now it was my turn to think for a moment what did i risk the gold and perhaps the pearls no more for in any case i should fight for peroa against the eastern king whom i hated and through him for egypt well these came to me by chance and if they went by chance what of it also i was not one who desired to wed a woman however much i worshipped her if she desired to turn her back on me if i could win her in fair lovewell if not it was my misfortune and i wanted her in no other way lastly i had reason to think that she looked on me more favourably than she had ever done on any other man and that if it had not been for what my mother called her soul and its longings she would have given herself to me before i journeyed to the east indeed once she had said as much and there was something in her eyes last night which told me that in her heart she loved me though with what passion at the time i did not know so very swiftly i made up my mind and answered  i understand and i accept the gold shall be delivered to you today prince the pearls are already in your keeping to await the end  good he exclaimed then let the matter be reduced to writing and at once that afterwards neither of us may have cause to complain of the other  so he sent for his secret scribe and dictated to him briefly but clearly the substance of our bargain nothing being added and nothing taken away this roll written on papyrus was afterwards copied twice peroa taking one copy i another and a third being deposited according to custom in the library of the temple of ptah  when all was done and peroa and i had touched each others breasts and given our word in the name of amen we went to the hall in which we had dined where those whom the prince had summoned were assembled altogether there were about thirty of them great citizens of memphis or landowners from without who had been called together in the night some of these men were very old and could remember when egypt had a pharaoh of its own before the east set its heel upon her neck of noble blood also  others were merchants who dealt with all the cities of egypt others hereditary generals or captains of fleets of ships others grecians officers of mercenaries who were supposed to be in the pay of the king of kings but hated him as did all the greeks then there were the high priests of ptah of amen of osiris and others who were still the most powerful men in the land since there was no village between thebes and the mouths of the nile in which they had not those who were sworn to the service of their gods  such was the company representing all that remained or could be gathered there of the greatness of egypt the ancient and the fallen  to these when the doors had been closed and barred and trusty watchmen set to guard them peroa expounded the case in a low and earnest voice he showed them that the king of the east sought a new quarrel against egypt that he might grind her to powder beneath his heel and that he did this by demanding the person of amada his own niece and the royal lady of egypt to be included in his household like any common woman if she were refused then he would send a great army under pretext of taking her and lay the land waste as far as thebes and if she were granted some new quarrel would be picked and in the person of the royal amada all of them be for ever shamed  next he showed the seal telling them that iwho was known to many of them at least by reputehad brought it from the east and repeating to them the plan that i had proposed upon the previous night after this he asked their counsel saying that before noon he must send an answer to idernes the kings satrap at sais  then i was called upon to speak and in answer to questions answered frankly that i had stolen the ancient white seal from the kings servant who carried it as a warrant for the kings private vengeance on one who had bested him how i did not mention i told them also of the state of the great kings empire and that i had heard that he was about to enter upon a war with the greeks which would need all its strength and that therefore if they wished to strike for liberty the time was at hand  then the talk began and lasted for two hours each man giving his judgment according to precedence some one way and some another when all had done and it became clear that there were differences of opinion some being content to live on in slavery with what remained to them and others desiring to strike for freedom among whom were the high priests who feared lest the eastern heretics should utterly destroy their worship peroa spoke once more  elders of egypt he said briefly certain of you think one way and certain another but of this be sure such talk as we have held together cannot be hid it will come to the ears of spies and through them to those of the great king and then all of us alike are doomed if you refuse to stir this very day i with my family and household and the royal lady amada and all who cling to me fly to upper egypt and perhaps beyond it to ethiopia leaving you to deal with the great king as you will or to follow me into exile that he will attack us there is no doubt either over the pretext of amada or some other since shabaka has heard as much from his own lips now choose  then after a little whispering together every man of them voted for rebellion though some of them i could see with heavy hearts and bound themselves by a great oath to cling together to the last  the matter being thus settled such a letter was written to idernes as i had suggested on the night before and sealed with the signet of signets of the yielding up of amada it said nothing but commanded idernes under the private white seal that none dared disobey to wait upon the prince peroa at memphis forthwith and there learn from him the holder of the seal what was the will of the great king then the council was adjourned till one hour after noon and most of them departed to send messengers bearing secret word to the various cities and nomes of egypt  before they went however i was directed to wait upon my relative the holy tanofir whom all acknowledged to be the greatest magician in egypt and to ask of him to seek wisdom and an oracle from his spirit as to the future and whether in it we should fare well or ill this i promised to do  when most of the council were gone the messengers of idernes were summoned and came proudly and with them or rather before them bes for whom i had sent as he was not present at the council  master he whispered to me the tallest of those messengers is the man who captained the robbers last night wait and i will prove it  peroa gave the roll to the head messenger bidding him bear it to the satrap in answer to the letter which he had delivered to him the man took it insolently and thrust it into his robe as he did so revealing a silver chain that had been broken and knotted together and asked whether there were words to bear besides those written in the roll before peroa could answer bes sprang up saying  o prince a boon the boon of justice on this man last night he and others with him attacked my master and myself seeking to rob us but finding nothing let us go  you lie abortion said the eastern  oh i lie do i mocked bes well let us see and shooting out his long arm he grasped the chain about the messengers neck and broke it with a jerk look o prince he said you may have noted last night when that man entered the hall that there hung about his neck this chain to which was tied a silver key  i noted it said peroa  then ask him o prince where is the key now  what is that to you dwarf broke in the man the key is my mark of office as chief butler to the high satrap must i always bear it for your pleasure  not when it has been taken from you butler answered bes see here it is and from his sleeve he produced the key hanging to a piece of the chain listen o prince he said i struggled with this man and the key was in my left hand though he did not know it at the time and with it some of the chain compare them and judge also his mask slipped and i saw his face and knew him again  peroa laid the pieces of the chain together and observed the workmanship which was eastern and rare then he clapped his hands at which sign armed men of his household entered from behind him  it is the same he said butler of idernes you are a common thief  the man strove to answer but could not for the deed was proved against him  then o prince asked bes what is the punishment of those thieves who attack passersby with violence in the streets of memphis for such i demand on him  the cutting off of the right hand and scourging answered peroa at which words the butler turned to fly but bes leapt on him like an ape upon a bird and held him fast  seize that thief said peroa to his servants and let him receive fifty blows with the rods his hand i spare because he must travel  they laid the man down and the rods having been fetched gave him the blows until at the thirtieth he howled for mercy crying out that it was true and that it was he who had captained the robbers words which peroa caused to be written down then he asked him why he a messenger from the satrap had robbed in the streets of memphis and as he refused to answer commanded the officer of justice to lay on after three more blows the man said  o prince this was no common robbery for gain i did what i was commanded to do because yonder noble had about him the ancient white seal of the great king which he showed to certain of the satraps servants by the banks of the canal that seal is a holy token o prince which it is said has descended for twice a thousand years in the family of the great king and as the satrap did not know how it had come into the hands of the noble shabaka he ordered me to obtain it if i could  and the pearls too butler  yes o prince since those gems are a great possession with which any satrap could buy a larger satrapy  let him go said peroa and the man rose rubbing himself and weeping in his pain  now butler he went on return to your master with a grateful heart since you have been spared much that you deserve say to him that he cannot steal the signet but that if he is wise he will obey it since otherwise his fate may be worse than yours and to all his servants say the same foolish man how can you or your master guess what is in the mind of the great king or for what purpose the signet of signets is here in egypt beware lest you fall into a pit all of you together and let idernes beware lest he find himself at the very bottom of that pit  o prince i will beware said the humbled butler and whatever is written over the seal that i will obey like many others  you are wise answered peroa i pray for his own sake that the satrap idernes may be as wise now begone thanking whatever god you worship that your life is whole in you and that your right hand remains upon your wrist  so the butler and those with him prostrated themselves before peroa and bowed humbly to me and even to bes because in their hearts now they believed that we were clothed by the great king with terrible powers that might destroy them all if so we chose then they went the butler limping a little and with no pride left in him  that was good work said peroa to me afterwards when we were alone for now yonder knave is frightened and will frighten his master  yes i answered you played that pipe well prince still there is no time to lose since before another moon this will all be reported in the east whence a new light may arise and perchance a new signet  you say you stole the white seal he asked  nay prince the truth is that bes bought itin a certain fashionand i used it perhaps it is well that you should know no more at present  perhaps he answered and we parted for he had much to do  that afternoon the council met again at it i gave over the gold and by help of it all was arranged within a week ten thousand armed men would be in memphis and a hundred ships with their crews upon the nile also a great army would be gathering in upper egypt officered for the most part by greeks skilled in war the greek cities too at the mouths of the nile would be ready to revolt or so some of their citizens declared for they hated the great king bitterly and longed to cast off his yoke  for my part i received the command of the bodyguard of peroa in which were many greeks and a generalship in the army while to bes at my prayer was given the freedom of the land which he accepted with a smile he who was a king in his own country  at length all was finished and i went out into the palace garden to rest myself before i rode into the desert to see my great uncle the holy tanofir i was alone for bes had gone to bring our horses on which we were to ride and sat myself down beneath a palmtree thinking of the great adventure on which we had entered with a merry heart for i loved adventures  next i thought of amada and was less merry then i looked up and lo she stood before me unaccompanied and wearing the dress not of a priestess but of an egyptian lady with the little circlet of her rank upon her hair i rose and bowed to her and we began to walk together beneath the palms my heart beating hard within me for i knew that my hour had come to speak  yet it was she who spoke the first saying  i hear that you have been playing a high part shabaka and doing great things for egypt  for egypt and for you who are egypt i answered  so i should have been called in the old days cousin because of my blood and the rank it gives though now i am but as any other lady of the land  and so you shall be called in days to come amada if my sword and wit can win their way  how so cousin seeing that you have promised certain things to my uncle peroa and his son  i have promised those things amada and i will abide by my promise but the gods are above all and who knows what they may decree  yes cousin the gods are above all and in their hands we will let these matters rest provoking them in no manner and least of all by treachery to our oaths  we walked for a little way in silence then i spoke  amada there are more things than thrones in the world  yes cousin there is that in which all thrones enddeath which it seems we court  and amada there is that in which all thrones beginlove which i court from you  i have known it long she said considering me gravely and been grateful to you who are more to me than any man has been or ever will be but shabaka i am a priestess bound to set the holy one i serve above a mortal  that holy one was wed and bore a child amada who avenged his father as i trust that we shall avenge egypt therefore she looks with a kind eye upon wives and mothers also you have not taken your final vows and can be absolved  yes she said softly  then amada will you give yourself into my keeping  i think so shabaka though it has been in my mind for long as you know well to give myself only to learning and the service of the heavenly lady my heart calls me to you it is true day and night it calls how loudly i will not tell yet i would not yield myself to that alone but egypt calls me also since i have been shown in a dream while i watched in the sanctuary that you are the only man who can free her and i think that this dream came from on high therefore i will give myself but not yet  not yet i said dismayed when  when i have been absolved from my vows which must be done on the night of the next new moon which is twentyseven days from this then if nothing comes between us during those twentyseven days it shall be announced that the royal lady of egypt is to wed the noble shabaka  twentyseven days in such times much may happen in them amada still except death what can come between us  i know of nothing shabaka whose past is shadowless as the noon  or i either i replied  now we were standing in the clear sunlight but as i said the words a wind stirred the palmtrees and the shadow from one of them fell full upon me and she who was very quick noted it  some might take that for an omen she said with a little laugh pointing to the line of the shadow oh shabaka if you have aught to confess say it now and i will forgive it but do not leave me to discover it afterwards when i may not forgive perchance during your journeyings in the east  nothing nothing i exclaimed joyfully who during all that time had scarcely spoken to a youthful woman  i am glad that nothing happened in the east that could separate us shabaka though in truth my thought was not your own for there are more things than women in the world only it seems strange to me that you should return to egypt laden with such priceless gifts from him who is egypts greatest enemy  have i not told you that i put my country before myself those gifts were won fairly in a wager amada whereof you heard the story but last night moreover you know the purpose to which they are to be put i replied indignantly  yes i know and now i am sure be not angry shabaka with her who loves you truly and hopes ere long to call you husband but till that day take it not amiss if i keep somewhat aloof from you who must break with the past and learn to face a future of which i did not dream  for the rest she stretched out her hand and i kissed it for while she was still a priestess her lips she would not suffer me to touch another moment and smiling happily she had glided away leaving me alone in the garden  then it was for the first time that i bethought me of the warnings of bes and remembered that it was i not he who had told the great king the name of the most beautiful woman in egypt although in all innocence yes i remembered and felt as if all the shadows on the earth had wrapped me round i thought of finding her but she had gone whither i knew not in that great palace so i determined that the next time we were alone i would tell her of the matter explaining all and with this thought i comforted myself who did not know that until many days were past we should be alone no more  after this i went home and told my mother all my joy for in truth there was no happier man in egypt she listened then answered smiling a little  when your father wished to take me to wife shabaka it was not my hand that i gave him to kiss and as you know i too have the blood of kings in me but then i was not a priestess of isis so doubtless all is well only in twentyseven days much may happen as you said to amada now i wonder why did she well no matter since priestesses are not like other women who only think of the man they have won and of naught before or after the blessing of the gods and mine be on you both my son and she went away to attend to her household matters  as we rode to sekera to find the holy tanofir i told bes also adding that i had forgotten to reveal that it was i who had spoken amadas name to the king but that i intended to do so ere long  bes rolled his eyes and answered  if i were you master as i had forgotten i should continue to forget for what is welcome in one hour is not always welcome in another why speak of the matter at all which is one hard to explain to a woman however wise and royal i have already said that i spoke the name to the king and that you were brought from the boat to say whether i was noted for my truthfulness is not that enough  while i considered bes went on  you may remember master that when i told wellthe truth about this story the lady amada asked earnestly that i should be scourged even to the bones now if you should tell another truth which will make mine dull as tarnished silver she will not leave me even my bones for i shall be proved a liar and what will happen to you i am sure i do not know and master as i am no longer a slave here in egypt to say nothing of what i may be elsewhere i have no fancy for scourgings who may not kiss the hand that smites me as you can  but bes i said what is is and may always be learned in this way or in that  master if what is were always learned i think the world would fall to pieces or at least there would be no men left on it why should this matter be learned it is known to you and me alone leaving out the great king who probably has forgotten as he was drunk at the time oh master when you have neither bow nor spear at hand it is not wise to kick a sleeping lion in the stomach for then he will remember its emptiness and sup off you beside when first i told you that tale i made a mistake i did tell the great king as i now remember quite clearly that the beautiful lady was named amada and he only sent for you to ask if i spoke the truth  bes i exclaimed you worshippers of the grasshopper wear virtue easily  easily as an old sandal master or rather not at all since the grasshopper has need of none for ages they have studied the ways of those who worship the gods of egypt and from them have learned  what  amongst other things master that woman being modest is shocked at the sight of the naked truth     chapter xi the holy tanofir  we entered the city of graves that is called sekera in the centre towered pyramids that hid the bones of ancient and forgotten kings and everywhere around upon the desert sands was street upon street of monuments but save for a priest or two hurrying to patter his paid office in the funeral chapels of the departed never a living man bes looked about him and sniffed with his wide nostrils  is there not death enough in the world master he asked that the living should wish to proclaim it in this fashion rolling it on their tongues like a morsel they are loth to swallow because it tastes so good oh what a waste is here all these have had their day and yet they need houses and pyramids and painted chambers in which to sleep whereas if they believed the faith they practised they would have been content to give their bones to feed the earth they fed on and fill heaven with their souls  do your people thus bes  for the most part master our dead kings and great ones we enclose in pillars of crystal but we do this that they may serve a double purpose one is that the pillars may support the roof of their successors and the other that those who inherit their goods may please themselves by reflecting how much handsomer they are than those who went before them for no mummy looks really nice master at least with its wrappings off and our kings are put naked into the crystal  and what becomes of the rest bes  their bodies go to the earth or the water and the grasshopper carries off their souls towhere master  i do not know bes  no master no one knows except the lady amada and perhaps the holy tanofir here i think is the entrance to his hole and he pulled up his beast with a jerk at what looked like the doorway of a tomb  apparently we were expected for a tall and proudlooking girl clad in white and with extraordinarily dark eyes appeared in the doorway and asked in a soft voice if we were the noble shabaka and bes his slave  i am shabaka i answered and this is bes who is not my slave but a free citizen of egypt  the girl contemplated the dwarf with her big eyes then said  and other things i think  what things inquired bes with interest as he stared at this beautiful lady  a very brave and clever man and one perhaps who is more than he seems to be  who has been telling you about me exclaimed bes anxiously  no one o bes at least not that i can remember  not that you can remember then who and what are you who learn things you know not how  i am named karema and desertbred and my office is that of cup to the holy tanofir  if hermits drink from such a cup i shall turn hermit said bes laughing but how can a woman be a mans cup and what kind of a wine does he drink from her  the wine of wisdom o bes she replied colouring a little for like many arabs of high blood she was very fair in hue  wine of wisdom said bes from such cups most drink the wine of folly or sometimes of madness  the holy tanofir awaits you she interrupted and turning entered the doorway  a little way down the passage was a niche in which stood three lamps ready lighted one of these she took and gave the others to us then we followed her down a steep incline of many steps till at length we found ourselves in a hot and enormous hall hewn from the living rock and filled with blackness  what is this place said bes who looked frightened and although he spoke in a low whisper our guide overheard him and turning answered  this is the burial place of the apis bulls see here lies the last not yet closed in and holding up her lamp she revealed a mighty sarcophagus of black granite set in a niche of the mausoleum  so they make mummies of bulls as well as of men groaned bes oh what a land but when i have seen the holy tanofir it was in a brick cell beneath the sky  doubtless that was at night o bes answered karema for in such a house he sleeps spending his days in the apis tomb because of all the evil that is worked beneath the sun  hump said bes i should have thought that more was worked beneath the moon but doubtless the holy tanofir knows better or being asleep does not mind  now in front of each of the walledup niches was a little chapel and at the fourth of these whence a light came the maiden stopped saying  enter here dwells the holy tanofir he tended this god during its lifedays in his youth and now that the god is dead he prays above its bones  prays to the bones of a dead bull in the dark well give me a live grasshopper in the light he is more cheerful muttered bes  o dwarf cried a deep and resounding voice from within the chapel talk no more of things you do not understand i do not pray to the bones of a dead bull as you in your ignorance suppose i pray to the spirit whereof this sacred beast was but one of the fleshly symbols which in this haunted place you will do well not to offend  then for once i saw bes grow afraid for his great jaw dropped and he trembled  master he said to me when next you visit tombs where maidens look into your heart and hermits hear your very thoughts i pray you leave me behind the holy tanofir i love if from afar but i like not his house or his here he looked at karema who was regarding him with a sweet smile over the lamp flame and added there is something the matter with me master i cannot even lie  cease from talking follies o shabaka and bes and enter said the tremendous voice from within  so we entered and saw a strange sight against the back wall of the chapel which was lit with lamps stood a lifesized statue of maat goddess of law and truth fashioned of alabaster on her head was a tall feather her hair was covered with a wig on her neck lay a collar of blue stones on her arms and wrists were bracelets of gold a tight robe draped her body in her right hand that hung down by her side she held the looped cross of life and in her left which was advanced a long lotusheaded sceptre while her painted eyes stared fixedly at the darkness crouched upon the ground at the feet of the statue scribe fashion sat my greatuncle tanofir a very aged man with sightless eyes and long hands so thin that one might see through them against the lampflame his head was shaven his beard was long and white white too was his robe in front of him was a low altar on which stood a shallow silver vessel filled with pure water and on either side of it a burning lamp  we knelt down before him or rather i knelt for bes threw himself flat upon his face  am i the king of kings whom you have so lately visited that you should prostrate yourselves before me said tanofir in his great voice which coming from so frail and aged a man seemed most unnatural or is it to the goddess of truth beyond that you bow yourselves if so that is well since one if not both of you greatly needs her pardon and her help or is it to the sleeping god beyond who holds the whole world on his horns or is it to the darkness of this hallowed place which causes you to remember the nearness of the awaiting tomb  nay my uncle i said we would greet you no more who are so worthy of our veneration seeing we believe both of us that you saved us yonder in the east from that tomb of which you speak or rather from the jaws of lions or a cruel death by torments  perchance i did i or the gods of which i am the instrument at least i remember that i sent you certain messages in answer to a prayer for help that reached me here in my darkness for know that since we parted i have gone quite blind so that i must use this maidens eyes to read what is written in yonder diviningcup well it makes the darkness of this sepulchre easier to bear and prepares me for my own tis full a hundred and twenty years since first i looked upon the light and now the time of sleep draws near come hither my nephew and kiss me on the brow remembering in your strength that a day will dawn when as i am so shall you be if the gods spare you so long  so i kissed him not without fear for the old man was unearthly then he sent karema from the place and bade me tell him my story which i did why he did this i cannot say since he seemed to know it already and once or twice corrected me in certain matters that i had forgotten for instance as to the exact words that i had used to the great king in my rage and as to the fashion in which i was tied in the boat when i had done he said  so you gave the name of amada to the great king did you well you could have done nothing else if you wished to go on living and therefore cannot be blamed yet before all is finished i think it will bring you into trouble shabaka since among many gifts the gods did not give that of reason to women if so bear it since it is better to have trouble and be alive than to have none and be dead that is for those whose work is still to do in the world and you or rather bes stole the white signet of signets of which although it is so simple and ancient there is not the like for power in the whole world that was well done since it will be useful for a while and now peroa has determined to rebel against the king which also is well done oh trouble not to tell me of that business for i know all but what would you learn of me shabaka  i am instructed to learn from you the end of these great matters my uncle  are you mad shabaka that you should think me a god who can read the future  not at all my uncle who know that you can if you will  call the maiden he said  so bes went out and brought her in  be seated karema there in front of the altar and look into my eyes  she obeyed and presently seemed to go to sleep for her head nodded then he said  wake woman look into the water in the bowl upon the altar and tell me what you see  she appeared to wake though i perceived that this was not really so for she seemed a different woman with a fixed face that frightened me and wide and frozen eyes she stared into the silver bowl then spoke in a new voice as though some spirit used her tongue  i see myself crowned a queen in a land i hate she said coldly a saying at which i gasped i am seated on a throne beside yonder dwarf a saying at which bes gasped although so hideous this dwarf is a great man with a good heart a cunning mind and the courage of a lion also his blood is royal  here bes rolled his eyes and smiled but tanofir did not seem in the least astonished and said  much of this is known to me and the rest can be guessed pass on to what will happen in egypt before the spirit leaves you  there will be war in egypt she answered i see fightings shabaka and others lead the egyptians the easterns are driven away or slain peroa rules as pharaoh i see him on his throne shabaka is driven away in his turn i see him travelling south with the dwarf and with myself looking very sad time passes i see the moons float by i see messengers reach shabaka sent by peroa and you o holy tanofir they tell of trouble in egypt i see shabaka and the dwarf coming north at the head of a great army of black men armed with bows with them i come rejoicing for my heart seems to shine he reaches a temple on the nile about which is camped another great army a countless army of easterns under the command of the king of kings shabaka and the dwarf give battle to that army and the fray is desperate they destroy it they drive it into the nile the nile runs red with blood the great king falls an arrow from the bow of shabaka is in his heart he enters the temple a conqueror and there lies peroa dying or dead a veiled priestess is there before an image i cannot see her face shabaka looks on her she stretches out her arms to him her eyes burn with womans love her breast heaves and above the image frowns and threatens all is done for tanofir master of spirits you die yonder in the temple on the nile and therefore i can see no more the power that comes through you has left me  then once more she became as a woman asleep  you have heard shabaka and bes said tanofir quietly and stroking his long white beard and what that maiden seemed to read in the water you may believe or disbelieve as you will  what do you believe o holy tanofir i asked  the only part of the story whereof i am sure he replied evading a direct answer is that which said that i shall die and that when i am dead i shall no longer be able to cause the maiden karema to see visions for the rest i do not know these things may happen or they may not but he added with a note of warning in his voice whether they happen or not my counsel to you both is that you say nothing of them beforehand  what then shall we report to those who bid me seek the oracle of your wisdom o tanofir  you can tell them that my wisdom declared that the omens were mixed with good and evil but that time would show the truth hush now the maiden is about to awake and must not be frightened also it is time for me to be led from this sepulchre to where i sleep for i think that ra has set and i am weary oh shabaka why do you seek to peer into the future which from day to day will unroll itself as does a scroll be content with the present man and take what fate gives you of good or ill not seeking to learn what offerings he hides beneath his robe in the days and the years and the centuries to come  yet you have sought to learn those things o tanofir and not in vain  aye and what have they made of me a blind old hermit weighed down with the weight of years and holding in my fingers but some few threads that with pain and grief i have plucked from the fringe of wisdoms robe be warned by me nephew while you are a man live the life of a man and when you become a spirit live the life of a spirit but do not seek to mix the two together like oil and wine and thus spoil both i am glad to learn o bes that you are going to make a kings or a slaves wife whichever it may be of this maiden seeing that i love her well and hold this trade unwholesome for her she will be better bearing babes than reading visions in a diviners cup and i will pray the gods that they may not be dwarfs as you are but take on the likeness of their mother who tells me that she is fair hush she stirs  karema are you awake good then lead me from the sepulchre that i may make my evening prayer beneath the stars go shabaka and bes you are brave men both of you and i am glad to have the one for nephew and the other for pupil my greetings to your mother tiu she is a good woman and a true one to whom you will do well to hearken to the lady amada also and bid her study her beauteous face in a mirror and not be holy overmuch since too great holiness often thwarts itself and ends in trouble for the unholy flesh still she loves pearls like other women does she not and even the statue of isis likes to be adorned as for you bes though i think that is not your name do not lie except when you are obliged for jugglers who play with too many knives are apt to cut their fingers also give no more evil counsel to your master on matters that have to do with woman now farewell let me hear how fortune favours you from time to time shabaka for you take part in a great game such as i loved in my youth before i became a holy hermit oh if they had listened to me things would have been different in egypt today but it was written otherwise and as ever women were the scribes good night good night good night i am glad that my thought reached you yonder in the east and taught you what to say and do it is well to be wise sometimes for others sake but not for our own oh not for our own    master said bes as we ambled homewards beneath the stars the holy tanofir is a man for thought to feed on since having climbed to the topmost peak of holiness he does not seem to like its cold air and warns off those who would follow in his footsteps  then he might have spared himself the pains in your case bes or in my own for that matter since we shall never come so high  no master and i am glad to have his leave to stay lower down since that hot place of dead bulls is not one which i wish to inhabit in my age making use of a maiden to stare into a pot of water and there read marvels which i could invent better for myself after a jug or two of wine oh the holy tanofir is quite right if these things are going to happen let them happen for we cannot change them by knowing of them beforehand who wishes to know master if his throat will be cut  or that he will be married i suggested  just so master seeing that such prophecies end in becoming truths because we make them true feeling that we must thus now i must marry yonder karema if she will marry me for fear lest i should prove the holy tanofir to be what he called mea liar  i laughed and then asked bes if he had taken note of what the seeress said of our flight south and our return thence with a great army of black men armed with bows  yes master he answered gravely and i think this army can be none other than that of the ethiopians of whom by right i am the king this very night i send messengers to tell those who rule in my place that i still live and am changing my mind on the matter of marriage also that if i do change it i may return to them the wisest man who ever wore the crown of ethiopia having journeyed all about the world and collected much knowledge  perhaps bes those who rule in your place may not wish to give it up to you perhaps they will kill you  have no fear master as i have told you the ethiopians are a faithful people moreover they know that such a deed would bring the curse of the grasshopper on them since then the locusts would appear and eat up all their land and when they were starving their enemies would attack them lastly they are a very tall folk and simpleminded and would not wish to miss the chance of being ruled over by the wisest dwarf in all the world if only because it would be something new to them master  again i laughed thinking that bes was jesting according to his fashion but when that night chancing to go round the corner of the house i came upon him with a circlet of feathers round his head and his big bow in his hand addressing three great black men who knelt before him as though he were a god i changed my mind as i withdrew he caught sight of me and said  i pray you my lord shabaka stay one moment then he spoke to the three men in his own language translating sentence by sentence to me what he said to them briefly it was this  say to the lords and councillors of the ancient kingdom that i the karoon for such it seemed was his title have a friend named the lord shabaka he whom you see before you who again and again has saved my life nursing me in his arms as a mother nurses her babe and who is after me the bravest and the wisest man in all the world say to them that if indeed i double myself by marriage and return having fulfilled the law i will beg this mighty prince to accompany me and that if he consents that will be the most joyful day which the ethiopians have seen for a thousand years since he will teach them wisdom and lead their armies in great and glorious battles let the priests of the grasshopper pray therefore that he may consent to do so now salute the mighty lord shabaka who can send one arrow through all three of you and two more behind and depart tarrying not day or night till you reach the land of ethiopia then when you have delivered the message of karoon to the captains and the councillors return or let others return and seek me out wherever i may be bringing of the gold of ethiopia and other gifts together with their answer seeing that i and the lord shabaka who have the world beneath our feet will not come to a land where we are not welcome  so these great men saluted me as though i were the king of kings himself after which they rubbed their foreheads in the dust before bes said something which i did not understand leapt to their feet crying karoon and sprang away into the night  it is good to have been a slave master said bes when they had gone since it teaches one that it is even better to be a king at least sometimes  here i may add that during the days which followed bes was often absent when i asked him where he had gone he would answer to drink in the wisdom of the holy tanofir by help of a certain silver vessel that the maiden karema held to his lips from all of which i gathered that he was wooing the lady who had called herself the cup of tanofir and wondered how the business went though as he said no more i did not ask him  indeed i had little time to talk with bes about such light matters since things moved apace in memphis within six days all the great lords left in upper egypt were sworn to the revolt under the leadership of peroa and hour by hour their vassals or hired mercenaries flowed into the city these it was my duty to weld into an army and at this task i toiled without cease separating them into regiments and drilling them also arranging for the arming and victualling of the boats of war then news came that idernes was advancing from sais with a great force of easterns all the garrison of lower egypt indeed as his messengers said to answer the summons conveyed to him under the private seal of seals  of amada during this time i saw little only meeting her now and again at the table of peroa or elsewhere in public for the rest it pleased her to keep away from me once or twice i tried to find her alone only to discover that she was engaged in the service of the goddess once too as she left peroas table i whispered into her ear that i wished to speak with her but she shook her head saying  after the new moon shabaka then you shall speak with me as much as you wish  thus it came about that never could i find opportunity to tell her of that matter of what had happened at the court of the great king still every morning she sent me some token flowers or trifling gifts and once a ring that must have belonged to her forefathers since on its bezel was engraved the royal uræus together with the signs of long life and health which ring i wore hung about my neck but not upon my finger fearing lest that emblem of royalty might offend peroa or some of his house if they chanced to see it so in answer i also sent her flowers and other gifts and for the rest was content to wait  all of which things my mother noted with a smile saying that the lady amada showed a wonderful discretion such as any man would value in a wife of so much beauty which also must be most pleasing to her mistress the goddess isis to this i answered that i valued it less as a lover than i might do as a husband my mother smiled again and spoke of something else  thus things went on while the stormclouds gathered over egypt  one night i could not sleep it was that of the new moon and i knew that during those hours of darkness before the solemn conclave of the high priests with pomp and ceremony in the sanctuary of the temple amada had undergone absolution of her vows to isis and been given liberty to wed as other women do indeed my mother in virtue of her rank as a singer of amen had been present at the rite and returning told me all that happened  she described how amada had appeared clad as a priestess how she had put up her prayer to the four high priests seated in state demanding to be loosed from her vow for the sake of her heart and of egypt  then one of the high priests he of amen i think as the chief of them all had advanced to the statue of the goddess isis and whispered the prayer to it whereon after a pause the goddess nodded thrice in the sight of all present thereby signifying her assent this done the high priest returned and proclaimed the absolution in the ancient words for the sake of the suppliants heart and of egypt and with it the blessing of the goddess on her union adding however the formula at thy prayer daughter and spouse i the goddess isis cut the rope that binds thee to me on earth yet if thou shouldst tie it again know that it may never more be severed for if thou strivest so to do it shall strangle thee in whatever shape thou livest on the earth throughout the generations and with thee the man thou choosest and those who give thee to him thus saith isis the queen of heaven  what does that mean i asked my mother  it means my son that if having broken her vows to isis a woman should repeat them and once more enter the service of the goddess and then for the second time seek to break them she and the man for whom she did this thing would be like flies in a spiders web and that not only in this life but in any other that may be given to them in the world  it seems that isis has a long arm i said  without doubt a very long arm my son since isis by whatever name she is called is a power that does not die or forget  well mother in this case she can have no reason to remember since never again will amada be her priestess  i think not shabaka yet who can be sure of what a woman will or will not do now or hereafter for my part i am glad that i have served amen and not isis and that after i was wed     chapter xii the slaying of idernes  whilst i was still talking to my mother i received an urgent summons to the palace i went and in a little antechamber met amada alone who i could see was waiting there for me she was arrayed in her secular dress and wore the insignia of royalty looking exceedingly beautiful moreover her whole aspect had changed for now she was no longer a priestess sworn to mysteries but just a lovely and a loving woman  it is done shabaka she whispered and thou art mine and i am thine  then i opened my arms and she sank upon my breast and for the first time i kissed her on the lips kissed her many times and oh my heart almost burst with joy but all too fleeting was that sweet moment of loves first fruits whereon i had sown the seed so many years ago for while we yet clung together whispering sweet things into each others ears i heard a voice calling me and was forced to go away before i had even time to ask when we might be wed  within the council was gathered the news before it was that the satrap idernes lay camped upon the nile with some ten thousand men not far from the great pyramids that is within striking distance of memphis moreover his messengers announced that he purposed to visit the prince peroa that day with a small guard only to inquire into this matter of the signet for which visit he demanded a safeconduct sworn in the name of the great king and in those of the gods of egypt and the east failing this he would at once attack memphis notwithstanding any commands that might be given him under the signet which until he beheld it with his own eyes he believed to be a forgery  the question waswhat answer should be sent to him the debate that followed proved long and earnest some were in favour of attacking idernes at once although his camp was reported to be strongly entrenched and flanked on one side by the nile and on the other by the rising ground whereon stood the great sphinx and the pyramids others among whom i was numbered thought otherwise for i hold that some evil god led me to give counsel that day which if it were good for egypt was most ill for my own fortunes perchance this god was isis angry at the loss of her votary  i pointed out that by receiving idernes peroa would gain time which would enable a body of three thousand men if not more who were advancing down the nile to join us before they were perhaps cut off from the city and thus give us a force as large as his or larger also i showed that having summoned idernes under the signet we should put ourselves in the wrong if we refused to receive him and instead attacked him at once  a third party was in favour of allowing him to enter memphis with his guard and then making him prisoner or killing him as to this i pointed out again that not only would it involve the breaking of a solemn oath which might bring the curse of the gods upon our cause and proclaim us traitors to the world but it would also be foolish since idernes was not the only general of the easterns and if we cut off him and his escort it would avail us little for then the rest of the easterns would fight in a just cause  so in the end it was agreed that the safeconduct should be sent and that peroa should receive idernes that very day at a great feast given in his honour accordingly it was sent in the ancient form the oaths being taken before the messengers that neither he nor those with him who must not number more than twenty men would be harmed in memphis and that he would be guarded on the road back until he reached the outposts of his own camp  this done i was despatched up the nile bank in a chariot accompanied only by bes to hurry on the march of those troops of which i have spoken so that they might reach memphis by sundown before i went however i had some words alone with peroa he told me that my immediate marriage with the lady amada would be announced at the feast that night thereon i prayed him to deliver to amada the rope of priceless rosehued pearls which was in his keeping as my betrothal gift with the prayer that she would wear them at the feast for my sake there was no time for more  the journey up nile proved long for the road was bad being covered with drifted sand in some places and deep in mud from the inundation waters in others at length i found the troops just starting forward after their rest and rejoiced to see that there were more of them than i had thought i told the case to their captains who promised to make a forced march and to be in memphis two hours before midnight  as we drove back bes said to me suddenly  do you know why you could not find me this morning  i answered that i did not  because a good slave should always run a pace ahead of his master to clear the road and tell him of its pitfalls i was being married the cup of the holy tanofir is now by law and right queen of the ethiopians so when you meet her again you must treat her with great respect as i do already  indeed bes i said laughing and how did you manage that business you must have wooed her well during these days which have been so full for both of us  i did not woo her over much master indeed the time was lacking i wooed the holy tanofir which was more important  the holy tanofir bes i exclaimed  yes master you see this beautiful cup of his is after allhis beautiful cup her mind is the shadow of his mind and from her he pours out his wisdom so i told him all the case at first he was angry for notwithstanding the words he spoke to you and me when it came to a point the holy tanofir being after all much like other men did not wish to lose his cup indeed had he been a few score of years younger i am not sure but that he would have forgotten some of his holiness because of her still he came to see matters in the true light at lastfor your sake master not for mine since his wisdom told him it was needful that i should become king of the ethiopians again to do which i must be married at any rate he worked upon the mind of that cup of hishaving first settled that she should procure a younger sister of her own to fill her placein such fashion that when at length i spoke to her on the matter she did not say no  no doubt because she was fond of you for yourself bes a woman would not marry even to please the holy tanofir  oh master he replied in a new voice a very sad voice i would that i could think so but look at me a misshapen dwarf accursed from birth could a fair lady like this karema wed such a one for his own sake  well bes there might be other reasons besides the holy tanofir i said hurriedly  master there were no other reasons unless the cup when it is awake remembers what it has held in trance which i do not believe i wooed her as i was not telling her that i am also king of the ethiopians or any more than i seem to be moreover the holy tanofir told her nothing for he swore as much to me and he does not lie  and what did she say to you bes i asked for i was curious  she lied fast enough master she saidwell what she said when first we met her that there was more in me than the eye saw and that she who had lived so much with spirits looked to the spirit rather than to the flesh and that dwarf or no she loved me and desired nothing better than to marry me and be my true and faithful wife and helpmeet she lied so well that once or twice almost i believed her at any rate i took her at her word not altogether for myself believe me master but because without doubt what the holy tanofir has shown us will come to pass and it is necessary to you that i should be married  you married her to help me bes  that is so masterafter all but a little thing seeing that she is beautiful well born and very pleasant and i am fond of her also i do her no wrong for she has bought more than she bargained for and if she has any that are not dwarfs her children may be kings i do not think he added reflectively that even the faithful ethiopians could accept a second dwarf as their king one is very well for a change but not two or three the stomach of a tall people would turn against them  i took bess hand and pressed it understanding the depth of his love and sacrifice also some spiritdoubtless it came from the holy tanofirmoved me to say  be comforted bes for i am sure of this your children will be strong and straight and tall more so than any of their forefathers that went before them  this indeed proved to be the case for their fathers deformity was but an accident not born in his blood  those are goodomened words master for which i thank you though the holy tanofir said the like when he wed us with the sacred words this morning and gave us his blessing endowing my wife with certain gifts of secret wisdom which he said would be of use to her and me  where is she now bes  with the holy tanofir master until i fetch her training her younger sister to be a diviners worthy cup only perhaps i shall never send seeing that i think there will be fighting soon  yes bes but being newly married you will do well to leave it to others  no no master battle is better than wives moreover could you think that i would leave you to stand alone in the fray why if i did and harm came to you i should die of shame or hang myself and then karema would never be a queen so both her trades would be gone since after marriage she cannot be a cup and her heart would break but here are the gates of memphis so we will forget love and think of war    an hour later i and my mother the lady tiu stood in the banqueting hall of the palace with many others and learned that the satrap idernes and his escort had reached memphis and would be present at the feast a while later trumpets blew and a glittering procession entered the hall at the head of it was peroa who led idernes by the hand this eastern was a big strong man with tired and anxious eyes such as i had noted were common among the servants of the great king who from day to day never knew whether they would fill a satrapy or a grave he was clad in gorgeous silks and wore a cap upon his head in which shone a jewel but beneath his robes i caught the glint of mail  as he came into the hall and noted the number and quality of the guests and the stir and the expectant look upon their faces he started as though he were afraid but recovering himself murmured some courteous words to his host and advanced towards the seat of honour which was pointed out to him upon the princes right after these two followed the wife of peroa with her son and daughters then walking alone in token of her high rank appeared amada the royal lady of egypt wonderfully arrayed now however she wore no emblems of royalty either because it was not thought wise that these should be shown in the presence of the satrap or because she was about to be given in marriage to one who was not royal indeed as i noted with joy her only ornament was the rope of rosehued pearls which were arranged in a double row upon her breast  she searched me out with her eyes smiled touching the pearls with her finger and passed on to her place next to the daughters of peroa at one end of the head table which was shaped like a horses hoof  after her came the nobles who had accompanied idernes grave eastern men one of these a tall captain with eyes like a hawk seemed familiar to me nor was i mistaken for bes who stood behind me and whose business it would be to wait on me at the feast whispered in my ear  note that man he was present when you were brought before the great king from the boat and saw and heard all that passed  then i wish he were absent now i whispered back for at the words a sudden fear shot through me of what i could not say  by degrees all were seated in their appointed places mine was by that of my mother at a long table that stood as it were across the ends of the high table but at a little distance from them so that i was almost opposite to peroa and idernes and could see amada although she was too far away for me to be able to speak to her  the feast began and at first was somewhat heavy and silent since save for the talk of courtesy none spoke much at length wine whereof i noted that idernes drank a good deal as did his escort but peroa and the egyptians little loosened mens tongues and they grew merrier for it was the custom of the people of the great king to discuss both private and public business when full of strong drink but of the egyptians when they were quite sober this was well known to peroa and many of us especially to myself who had been among them which was one of the reasons why idernes had been asked to meet us at a feast where we might have the advantage of him in debate  presently the satrap noted the splendid cup from which he drank and asked some question concerning it of the hawkeyed noble of whom i have spoken when it had been answered he said in a voice loud enough for me to overhear  tell me o prince peroa was this cup ever that of the great king which it so much resembles  so i understand o idernes answered peroa that is until it became mine by gift from the lord shabaka who received it from the great king  an expression of horror appeared upon the face of the satrap and upon those of his nobles  surely he answered this shabaka must hold the kings favours lightly if he passes them on thus to the firstcomer at the least let not the vessel which has been hallowed by the lips of the king of kings be dishonoured by the humblest of his servants i pray you o prince that i may be given another cup  so a new goblet was brought to him peroa trying to pass the matter off as a jest by appealing to me to tell the story of the cup then i said while all listened  o prince the most high satrap is mistaken the king of kings did not give me the cup i bought it from him in exchange for a certain famous bow and therefore held it not wrong to pass it on to you my lord  idernes made no answer and seemed to forget the matter  a while later however his eye fell upon amada and the rosehued pearls she wore and again he asked a question of the hawkeyed captain then said  think me not discourteous o prince if i seem to look upon yonder lovely lady which in our country where women do not appear in public we should think it an insult to do but on her fair breast i see certain pearls like to some that are known throughout the world which for many years have been worn by those who sit upon the throne of the east i would ask if they are the same or others  i do not know o idernes answered peroa i only know that the lord shabaka brought them from the east inquire of him if it be your pleasure  shabaka again began idernes but i cut him short saying  yes o satrap shabaka again i won those pearls in a bet from the great king and with them a certain weight of gold this i think you knew before since your messenger of a while ago was whipped for trying to steal them which under the rods he said he did by command o satrap  to this bold speech idernes made no answer only his captains frowned and many of the egyptians murmured approval  after this the feast went on without further incident for a while the easterns always drinking more wine till at length the tables were cleared and all of the meaner sort departed from the hall save the butlers and the personal servants such as bes who stood behind the seats of their masters there came a silence such as precedes the bursting of a storm and in the midst of it idernes spoke somewhat thickly  i did not come here o peroa he said from the seat of government at sais to eat your meats and drink your wine i came to speak of high matters with you  it is so o satrap answered peroa and now what may be your will would you retire to discuss them with me and my councillors  where is the need o peroa seeing that i have naught to say which may not be heard by all  as it pleases you speak on o satrap  i have been summoned here prince peroa by a writing under what seems to be the signet of signetsthe ancient white seal that for generations unknown has been worn by the forefathers of the king of kings where is this signet  here said the prince opening his robe look on it satrap and let your lords look but let none of you dare to touch it  idernes looked long and earnestly and so did some of his people especially the lord with the hawk eyes then they stared at each other bewildered and whispered together  it seems to be the very sealthe white seal itself exclaimed idernes at length tell me now peroa how came this sacred thing that dwells in the east hither into egypt  the lord shabaka brought it to me with certain letters from the great king o satrap  shabaka for the third time by the holy fire cried idernes he brought the cup he brought the famous pearls he brought the gold and he brought the signet of signets what is there then that he did not bring perchance he has the person of the king of kings himself in his keeping  not that o satrap only the commands of the king of kings which are prepared ready to deliver to you under the white seal that you acknowledge  and what may they be egyptian  this o satrap that you and all the army which you have brought with you retire to sais and thence out of egypt as quickly as you may or pay for disobedience with your lives  now idernes and his captains gasped  why this is rebellion he said  no o satrap only the command of the great king given under the white seal and drawing a roll from his breast peroa laid it on his brow and cast it down before idernes adding  obey the writing and the signet or by virtue of my commission as soon as you are returned to your army and your safeconduct is expired i fall upon you and destroy you  idernes looked about him like a wolf in a trap then asked  do you mean to murder me here  not so answered peroa for you have our safeconduct and egyptians are honourable men but you are dismissed your office and ordered to leave egypt  idernes thought a little while then said  if i leave egypt there is at least one whom i am commanded to take with me under orders and writings that you will not dispute a maiden named amada whom the great king would number among his women i am told it is she who sits yondera jewel indeed fair as the pearls upon her breast which thus will return into the kings keeping let her be handed over for she rides with me at once  now in the midst of an intense silence peroa answered  amada the royal lady of egypt cannot be sent to dwell in the house of women of the great king without the consent of the lord shabaka whose she is  shabaka for the fourth time said idernes glaring at me then let shabaka come too or his head in a basket will suffice since that will save trouble afterwards also some pain to shabaka why now i remember it was this very shabaka whom the great king condemned to death by the boat for a crime against his majesty and who bought his life by promising to deliver to him the fairest and most learned woman in the worldthe lady amada of egypt and thus does the knave keep his oath  now i leapt to my feet as did most of those present only amada kept her seat and looked at me  you lie i cried and were it not for your safeconduct i would kill you for the lie  i lie do i sneered idernes speak then you who were present and tell this noble company whether i lie and he pointed to the hawkeyed lord  he does not lie said the captain i was in the court of the great king and heard yonder shabaka purchase pardon by promising to hand over his cousin the lady amada to the king the pearls were entrusted to him as a gift to her and i see she wears them the gold also of which mention has been made was to provide for her journey in state to the east or so i heard the cup was his guerdon also a sum for his own purse  it is false i shouted the name of amada slipped my lips by chanceno more  so it slipped your lips by chance did it sneered idernes now if you are wise you will suffer the lady amada to slip your hand and not by chance but let us have done with this cunning knave prince will you hand over yonder fair woman or will you not  satrap i will not answered peroa the demand is an insult put forward to force us to rebellion since there is no man in egypt who will not be ready to die in defence of the royal lady of egypt  this statement was received with a shout of applause by every egyptian in the hall idernes waited until it had died away then said  prince peroa and egyptians you have conveyed to me certain commands sealed with the signet of signets which i think was stolen by yonder shabaka now hearken until this matter is made clear i will obey those commands thus far i will return with my army to sais and there wait until i have received the orders of the great king after report made to him if so much as an arrow is shot at us on our march it will be open rebellion as the price of which egypt shall be crushed as she was never crushed before and every one of you here present shall lose his head save only the lady amada who is the property of the great king now i thank you for your hospitality and demand that you escort me and those with me back to my camp since it seems that here we are in the midst of enemies  before you go idernes i shouted know that you and your lying captain shall pay with your lives for your slander on me  many will pay with their lives for this nights work o thief of pearls and seals answered the satrap and turning left the hall with his company  now i searched for amada but she also had gone with the ladies of peroas household who feared lest the feast should end in blows and bloodshed also lest she should be snatched away indeed of all the women in the hall only my mother remained  search out the lady amada i said to her and tell her the truth  yes my son she answered thoughtfully but what is the truth i understood it was bes who first gave the name of the lady amada to the great king now we learn from your own lips that it was you wise would you have been my son if you had bitten out your tongue before you said it since this is a matter that any woman may well misunderstand  her name was surprised out of me mother it was bes who spoke to the king of the beauty of a certain lady of egypt  and i think my son it was bes who told peroa and his guests that he and not you had given the king her name which you do not seem to have denied well doubtless both of you are to blame for foolishness no more since well i know that you would have died ten times over rather than buy your life at the price of the honour of the lady of egypt this i will say to her as soon as i may praying that it may not be too late and afterwards you shall tell me everything which you would have done well to do at first if bes as i think had not been over cunning after the fashion of black people and counselled you otherwise see peroa calls you and i must go for there are greater matters afoot than that of who let slip the name of the lady amada to the king of kings  so she went and there followed a swift council of war the question being whether we were to strike at the satraps army or to allow it to retreat to sais in my turn i was asked for my judgment of the issue and answered  strike and at once since we cannot hope to storm sais which is far away moreover such strength as we have is now gathered and if it is idle and perhaps unpaid will disperse again but if we can destroy idernes and his army it will be long before the king of kings who is sending all his multitudes against the greeks can gather another and during this time egypt may again become a nation and able to protect herself under peroa her own pharaoh  in the end i and those who thought like me prevailed so that before the dawn i was sailing down the nile with the fleet having two thousand men under my command also i took with me the six hunters whom i had won from the great king since i knew them to be faithful and thought that their knowledge of the easterns and their ways might be of service our orders were to hold a certain neck of land between the river and the hills where the army of idernes must pass until peroa and all his strength could attack him from behind  four hours later the wind being very favourable to us we reached that place and there took up our station and having made all as ready as we could rested  in the early afternoon bes awakened me from the heavy sleep into which i had fallen and pointed to the south i looked and through the desert haze saw the chariots of idernes advancing in ordered ranks and after them the masses of his footmen  now we had no chariots only archers and two regiments armed with long spears and swords also the sailors on the boats had their slings and throwing javelins lastly the ground was in our favour since it sloped upwards and the space between the river and the hills was narrow somewhat boggy too after the inundation of the nile which meant that the chariots must advance in a column and could not gather sufficient speed to sweep over us  idernes and his captains noted all this also and halted then they sent a herald forward to ask who we were and to command us in the name of the great king to make way for the army of the great king  i answered that we were egyptians ordered by peroa to hold the road against the satrap who had done affront to egypt by demanding that its royal lady should be given over to him to be sent to the east as a womanslave and that if the satrap wished to clear a road he could come and do so or if it pleased him he could go back towards memphis or stay where he was since we did not wish to strike the first blow i added this  i who speak on behalf of the prince peroa am the lord shabaka that same man whom but last night the satrap and a certain captain of his named a liar now the easterns are brave men and we of egypt have always heard that among them none is braver than idernes who gained his advancement through courage and skill in war let him therefore come out together with the lord who named me a liar armed with swords only and i who being a liar must also be a coward together with my servant a black dwarf will meet them man to man in the sight of both the armies and fight them to the death or if it pleases idernes better let him not come and i will seek him and kill him in the battle or by him be killed  the herald having taken stock of me and of bes at whom he laughed returned with the message  will he come think you master asked bes  mayhap i answered since it is a shame for an eastern to refuse a challenge from any man whom he calls barbarian and if he did so it might cost him his life afterwards at the hands of the great king also if he should fall there are others to take his command but none who can wipe away the stain upon his honour  yes said bes also they will think me a dwarf of no account which makes the task of killing you easy well they shall see  now when i sent this challenge i had more in my mind than a desire to avenge myself upon idernes and his captain for the public shame they had put upon me i wished to delay the attack of their host upon our little band and give time for the army of peroa to come up behind moreover if i fell it did not greatly matter except as an omen seeing that i had good officers under me who knew all my plans  we saw the herald reach the satraps army and after a while return towards us again which made us think my challenge had been refused especially as with him was an officer who i took it was sent to spy out our strength but this was not so for the man said  the satrap idernes has sworn by the great king to kill the thief of the signet and send his head to the great king and fears that if he waits to meet him in battle he may slip away therefore he is minded to accept your challenge o shabaka and put an end to you and indeed under the laws of the east he may not refuse but a noble of the great king may not fight against a black slave save with a whip so how can that noble accept the challenge of the dwarf bes  quite well answered bes seeing that i am no slave but a free citizen of egypt moreover in my own country of ethiopia i am of royal blood lastly tell the man this that if he does not come and afterwards falls into my hands or into those of the lord shabaka he who talks of whips shall be scourged with them till his life creeps out from between his bare bones  thus spoke bes rolling his great eyes and looking so terrible that the herald and the officer fell back a step or two then i told them that if my offer did not please them i myself would fight first idernes and then the noble so they returned  the end of it was that we saw idernes and his captain advancing followed by a guard of ten men then after i had explained all things to my officers i also advanced with bes followed by a guard of ten picked men we met between the armies on a little sandy plain at the foot of the rise and there followed talk between the captains of our guards as to arms and so forth but we four said nothing to each other since the time for words was past only bes and i sat down upon the sand and spoke a little together of amada and karema and of how they would receive the news of our victory or deaths  it does not much matter master said bes at last seeing that if we die we shall never know and if we live we shall learn for ourselves  at length all was arranged and we stood up to face each other the four of us being armed in the same way for as did idernes and the hawkeyed lord bes and i wore shirts of mail and helms those that we had brought with us from the east for weapons we had short and heavy swords small shields and knives at our girdles  look your last upon the sun thieves mocked idernes for when you see it again it shall be with blind eyes from the points of spears fastened to the gateway pillars of the great kings palace  liars you have lived and liars you shall die shouted bes but i said nothing  now the agreement was that when the word had been given idernes and i and the noble and bes should fight together but if they killed one of us or we killed one of them the two who survived might fall together on the remaining man remembering this as he told me afterwards at the signal bes leapt forward like a flash with working face and foam upon his lips and before ever i could come to idernes how i know not had received the blow of the eastern lord upon his shield and without striking back had gripped him in his long arms and wrapped him round with his bowed legs in an instant they were on the ground bes uppermost and i heard the sound of blow upon blow struck with knife or sword i knew not which upon the easterns mail followed by a shout of victory from the egyptians which told me that bes had slain him  now idernes and i were smiting at each other he was a taller and a bigger man than myself but older and one who had lived too well therefore i thought it wise to keep him at a distance and tire him which i did by retreating and catching his swordcuts on my shield only smiting back now and again  he runs he runs shouted the easterns o idernes beware the dwarf  stand away bes i called this is my game and he obeyed as often he had done when we were hunting together  now a shrewd blow from idernes cut through my helm and staggered me and another before i could recover myself shore the shield from my hand whereat the easterns shouted more loudly than before then fear of defeat entered into me and made me mad for this satrap was a great fighter with a shout of egypt i went at him like a wounded lion and soon it was his turn to stagger back but alas i struck too hard for my sword snapped upon his mail  the knife screamed bes the knife  i hurled the sword hilt in the satraps face and drew the dagger from my belt then i ran in beneath his guard and stabbed and stabbed and stabbed he gripped me and we went down side by side rolling over each other the gods know how it ended for things were growing dim to me when some thrust of mine found a rent in his mail made when the sword broke and he became weak his spirit weakened also for he gasped  spare my life egyptian and my treasure is yours i swear it by the fire  not for all the treasure in the world slanderer i panted back and drove the dagger home to the hilt thrice until he died then i staggered to my feet and when the armies saw that it was i who rose while idernes lay still a roar of triumph went up from the egyptians answered by a roar of rage from the easterns  with a cry of well done master bes leapt upon the dead man and hewed his head from him as already he had served the hawkeyed noble then gripping one head in each hand he held them up for the easterns to see  men of the great king i said bear us witness that we have fought fairly man to man when we need not have done so  the ten of the satraps guard stood silent but my own shouted  back shabaka the easterns charge  i looked and saw them coming like waves of steel then supported by my men and preceded by bes who danced in front shaking the severed heads i ran back to my own ranks where one gave me wine to drink and threw water over my hurts which were but slight scarcely was it done when the battle closed in and soon in it i forgot the deaths of idernes and the eastern liar     chapter xiii amada returns to isis  we fought a very terrible fight that evening there by the banks of nile our position was good but we were outnumbered by four or five to one and the easterns and their mercenaries were mad at the death of the satrap by my hand time upon time they came on furiously charging up the slope like wild bulls for the most part we relied upon our archers to drive them back since our halftrained troops could scarcely hope to stand against the onset of veterans disciplined in war so taking cover behind the rocks we rained arrows on them shooting the horses in the chariots and when these were down pouring our shafts upon the footmen behind myself i took my great black bow and drew it thrice and each time i saw a noble fall for no mail could withstand the arrows which it sent and of that art i was a master none in egypt could shoot so far or so straight as i did save perhaps peroa himself i had no time to do more since always i must be moving up and down the line encouraging my men  three times we drove them back after which they grew cunning ceasing from a direct onslaught and keeping what remained of their chariots in reserve they sent one body of men to climb along the slope of the hill where the rocks gave them cover from our arrows and another to creep through the reeds and growing crops upon the bank of the river where we could not see to shoot them well although the slingers in the ships did them some damage  thus they attacked us on either flank and while we were thus engaged their centre made a charge then came the bitterest of the fighting for now the bows were useless and it was sword against sword and spear against spear once we broke and i thought that they were through but i led a charge against them and drove them back a little way still the issue was doubtful till i saw bes rush past me grinning and leaping and with him a small body of greeks whom we held in reserve and i think that the sight of the terrible dwarf whom they thought a devil frightened the easterns more than did the greeks  at any rate shouting out something about an evil spirit whom the egyptians worshipped by which i suppose they meant that god after whom bes was named they retreated leaving many dead but taking their wounded with them for they were unbroken  at the foot of the slope they reformed and took counsel then sat down out of bowshot as though to rest now i guessed their plan it was to wait till night closed in which would be soon for the sun was sinking and then when we could not see to shoot either rush through us by the weight of numbers or march back to where the cliffs were lower and climb them thus passing us on the higher open land  now we also took counsel though little came of it since we did not know what to do we were too few to attack so great an army nor if we climbed the cliffs could we hope to withstand them in the desert sands or to hold our own against them if they charged in the dark if this happened it seemed that all we could do would be to fight as long as we could after which the survivors of us must take refuge on our boats so it came to this that we should lose the battle and the greater part of the easterns would win back to sais unless indeed the main army under peroa came to our aid  whilst we talked i caused the wounded to be carried to the ships before it grew too dark to move them bes went with them presently he returned running swiftly  master he said the evening wind is blowing strong and stirs the sand but from a masthead through it i caught sight of peroas banners the army comes round the bend of the river not four furlongs away now charge and those easterns will be caught between the hammer and the stone for while they are meeting us they will not look behind  so i went down the lines of our little force telling them the good news and showing them my plan they listened and understood we formed up those who were left of us not more than a thousand men perhaps and advanced the easterns laughed when they saw us coming down the slope for they thought that we were mad and that they would kill us every one believing as they did that peroa had no other army when we were within bowshot we began to shoot though sparingly for but few arrows were left galled by our archery they marshalled their ranks to charge us again with a shout we leapt forward to meet them for now from the higher ground i saw the chariots of peroa rushing to our rescue  we met we fought surely there had been no such fighting since the days of thotmes and rameses the great still they drove us back till unseen and unsuspected the chariots and the footmen of peroa broke on them from behind broke on them like a desert storm they gave they fled this way and that some to the banks of the nile some to the hills by the light of the setting sun we finished it and ere the darkness closed in the great kings army was destroyed save for the fugitives whom we hunted down next day  yes in that battle perished ten thousand of the easterns and their mercenaries and upon its field at dawn we crowned peroa pharaoh of egypt and he named me the chief general of his army there too fell over a thousand of my men and among them those six hunters whom i had won in the wager with the great king and brought with me from the east throughout the fray they served me as a bodyguard fighting furiously who knew that they could hope for no mercy from their own people one by one they were slain the last two of them in the charge at sunset well they were brave and faithful to me so peace be on their spirits better to die thus than in the den of lions    in triumph we returned to memphis i bringing in the rearguard and the spoils before pharaoh and i parted a messenger brought me more good news sure tidings had come that the king of kings had been driven by revolt in his dominions to embark upon a mighty war with syria greece and cyprus and other halfconquered countries in which doubtless by agreement the fires of insurrection had suddenly burned up also already peroas messengers had departed to tell them of what was passing on the nile  if this be true said peroa when he had heard all the great king will have no new army to spare for egypt  it is so pharaoh i answered yet i think he will conquer in this great war and that within two years you must be prepared to meet him face to face  two years are long shabaka and in them by your help much may be done  but as it chanced he was destined to be robbed of that help and this by the work of woman the destroyer  it happened thus amidst great rejoicings pharaoh reached memphis and in the vast temple of amen laid down our spoils in the presence of the god thousands of right hands hewn from the fallen thousands of swords and other weapons and tens of chariots together with much treasure of which a portion was given to the god the high priests blessed us in the name of amen and of the other gods the people blessed us and threw flowers in our path all the land rejoiced because once more it was free  there too that day in the temple with ancient form and ceremonial peroa was crowned pharaoh of egypt sceptres and jewels that had been hid for generations were brought out by those who knew the secret of their hidingplaces the crowns that had been worn by old pharaohs were set upon his head yes the double crown of the upper and the lower land thus in a memphis mad with joy at the casting off of the foreign yoke he was anointed the first of a new dynasty and with him his queen  i too received honours for the story of the slaying of idernes at my hands and of how i held the pass had gone abroad so that next to pharaoh i was looked upon as the greatest man in egypt nor was bes forgotten since many of the common people thought that he was a spirit in the form of a dwarf whom the gods had sent to aid us with his strength and cunning indeed at the close of the ceremony voices cried out in the multitude of watchers demanding that i who was to marry the royal lady of egypt should be named next in succession to the throne  the pharaoh heard and glanced first at his son and then at me doubtfully whereon covered with confusion i slipped away  the portico of the temple was deserted since all even the guards had crowded into the vast court to watch the coronation only in the shadow seated against the pedestal of one of the two colossal statues in front of the outer pylon gate and looking very small beneath its greatness was a man wrapped in a dark cloak whom noting vaguely i took to be a beggar as i passed him he plucked at my robe and i stopped to search for something to give to him but could find naught  i have nothing father i said laughing except the gold hilt of my sword  do not part with that son answered a deep voice for i think you will need it before all is over  then while i stared at him he threw back his hood and i saw that beneath was the ancient withered face and the long white beard of my greatuncle the holy tanofir the hermit and magician  great things happen yonder shabaka so great that i have come from my sepulchre to see or rather being blind to listen who thrice in my life days have known the like before and he pointed to the glittering throng in the court within yes he went on i have seen pharaohs crowned and pharaohs dieone of them at the hand of a conqueror what will happen to this pharaoh think you shabaka  you should be better able to answer that question than i who am no prophet my uncle  how my nephew seeing that your dwarf has borne away my magic cup i do not grudge her to him for he is a brave dwarf and clever who may yet prove a good prop to you as he has done before and to egypt also but she has gone and the new vessel is not yet shaped to my liking so how can i answer  out of the store of wisdom gathered in your breast  so my nephew well my store of wisdom tells me that feasts are sometimes followed by want and rejoicings by sorrow and victories by defeat and splendid sins by repentance and slow climbing back to good again also that you will soon take a long journey where is the royal lady amada i did not hear her step among those who passed in to the crowning but even my hearing has grown somewhat weak of late except in the silence of the night shabaka  i do not know my uncle who have only been in memphis one hour but what do you mean doubtless she prepares herself for the feast where i shall meet her  doubtless tell me what passes at the temple of isis as i crept past the pylon feeling my way with my beggars staff i thoughtbut how can you know who have only been in memphis an hour yet surely i heard voices just now calling out that you shabaka should be named as the next successor to the throne of egypt was it so  yes holy tanofir that is why i have left who was vexed and am sworn to seek no such honour which indeed i do not desire  just so nephew yet gifts have a way of coming to those who do not desire them and the last vision that i saw before my cup left me or rather that she saw was of you wearing the double crown she said that you looked very well in it shabaka but now begone for hark here comes the procession with the newanointed pharaoh whose royal robe you won for him yonder in the pass when you smote down idernes and held his legions oh it was well done and my new cup though faulty was good enough to show me all i felt proud of you shabaka but begone begone a gift for the poor old beggar a gift my lords for the poor blind beggar who has had none since the last pharaoh was crowned in egypt and finds it hard to live on memories    at our house i found my mother just returned from the coronation but bes i did not find and guessed that he had slipped away to meet his newmade wife karema my mother embraced me and blessed me making much of me and my deeds in the battle also she doctored such small hurts as i had i put the matter by as shortly as i could and asked her if she had seen aught of amada she answered that she had neither seen nor heard of her which i was sure she thought strange as she began to talk quickly of other things i said to her what i had said to the holy tanofir that doubtless she was making ready for the feast since i could not find her at the crowning  or saying goodbye to the goddess answered my mother nodding since there are some who find it even harder to fall from heaven to earth than to climb from earth to heaven and after all you are but a man my son  then she slipped away to attire herself leaving me wondering because my mother was shrewd and never spoke at random  there was the holy tanofir too with his talk about the temple of isis and he also did not speak at random oh now i felt as i had done when the shadow of the palmtree fell on me yonder in the palace garden  the mood passed for my blood still tingled with the glory of that great fight and my heart shut its doors to sadness knowing as i did that i was the most praised man in memphis that day indeed had i not i should have learned it when with my mother i entered the great banquetinghall of the palace somewhat late for she was long in making ready  the first thing i saw there was bes gorgeously arrayed in eastern silks that he had plundered from the satraps tent standing on a table so that all might see and hear him and holding aloft in one hand the grisly head of idernes and in the other that of the hawkeyed noble whom he had slain while in his thick guttural voice he told the tale of that great fray catching sight of me he called aloud  see here comes the man here comes the hero to whom egypt owes its liberty and pharaoh his crown  thereon all the company and the soldiers and servants who were gathered about the door began to shout and acclaim me till i wished that i could vanish away as the holy tanofir was said to be able to do since this was impossible i rushed at bes who leapt from the table like a monkey and still waving the heads and talking slipped from the hall i know not how followed by the loud laughter of the guests  then heralds announced the coming of pharaoh and all grew silent he and his company entered with pomp and we his subjects prostrated ourselves in the ancient fashion  rise my guests he cried rise my people above all do you rise shabaka my beloved cousin to whom egypt and i owe so much  so we rose and i took my seat in a place of honour having my mother at my side and looked about me for amada but in vain there was the carven chair upon which she should have been among those of the princesses but it was empty at first i thought that she was late but when time went by and she did not appear i asked if she were ill a question that none seemed able to answer  the feast went on with all the ancient ceremonies that attended the crowning of a pharaoh of egypt since there were old men who remembered these also the scribes and priests had them written in their books  i took no heed of them and will not set them down at length pharaoh pledged his subjects and his subjects pledged pharaoh then the doors were opened and through them came a company of whiterobed shaven priests bearing on a bier the body of a dead man wrapped in his mummycloths at first some laughed for this rite had not been performed in egypt since she passed into the hands of the great kings of the east and therefore was strange to them then they grew silent since after all it was solemn to see those deathbearing priests flitting in and out between the great columns now seen and now lost in the shadows and to listen to their funeral chants  in the hush my mother whispered to me that this body was that of the last pharaoh of egypt brought from his tomb but whether this were so i cannot say for certain at length they brought the mummy which was crowned with a snakeheaded circlet of the royal uræus and still draped with withered funeral wreaths and stood it on its feet opposite to peroa just behind and between my mother and me in such a fashion that it cut off the light from us  the faint and heavy smell of the embalmers spices struck upon my nostrils a dead flower from the chaplets fell upon my head and glancing over my shoulder i saw the painted or enamelled eyes in the gilded mask staring at me the thing filled me with fear i knew not of what not of death surely for that i had faced a score of times of late and thought nothing of it indeed i am not sure that it was fear i felt but rather a deep sense of the vanity of all things it seemed to come home to meshabaka or allan quatermain for in my dream the inspiration or whatever it might be struck through the spirit that animated both of usas it had never done before that everything is nothing that victory and love and even life itself have no meaning that naught really exists save the soul of man and god of whom perchance that soul is a part sent forth for a while to do his work through good and ill the thought lifted me up and yet crushed me since for a moment all that makes a man passed away and i felt myself standing in utter loneliness naked before the glory of god watched only by the flaming stars that light his throne yes and at that moment suddenly i learned that all the gods are but one god having many shapes and called by many names  then i heard the priests saying  pharaoh the osiris greets pharaoh the living on the earth and sends to him this messageas i am so shalt thou be and where i am there thou shalt dwell through all the ages of eternity  then pharaoh the living rose and bowed to pharaoh the dead and pharaoh the dead was taken away back to his eternal house and i wondered whether his ka or his spirit or whatever is the part of him that lives on were watching us and remembering the feasts whereof he had partaken in his pomp in this pillared hall as his forefathers had done before him for hundreds or thousands of years  not until the mummy had gone and the last sound of the chanting of the priests had died did the hearts of the feasters grow light again but soon they forgot as men alive always forget death and those whom time has devoured for the wine was good and strong and the eyes of the women were bright and victory had crowned our spears and for a while egypt was once more free  so it went on till pharaoh rose and departed the great gold earrings in his ears jingling as he walked and the trumpets sounding before and after him i too rose to go with my mother when a messenger came and bade me wait upon pharaoh and with me the dwarf bes so we went leaving an officer to conduct my mother to our home as i passed her she caught me by the sleeve and whispered in my ear  my son whatever chances to you be brave and remember that the world holds more than women  yes i answered it holds death and god or they hold it though what put the words into my mind i do not know since i did not understand and had no time to ask her meaning  the messenger led us to the door of peroas private chamber the same in which i had seen him on my return from the east here he bade me enter and bes to wait without i went in and found two men and a woman in the chamber all standing very silent the men were pharaoh who still wore his glorious robe and double crown and the high priest of isis clothed in white the other was the lady amada also clothed in the snowy robes of isis  at the sight of her thus arrayed my heart stopped and i stood silent because i could not speak she too stood silent and i saw that beneath her thin veil her beautiful face was set and pale as that of an alabaster statue indeed she might have been not a lovely living woman but the goddess isis herself whose symbols she bore about her  shabaka said pharaoh at length the royal lady of egypt amada priestess of isis has somewhat to say to you  let the royal lady of egypt speak on to her servant and affianced husband i answered  count shabaka general of the armies she began in a cold clear voice like to that of one who repeats a lesson learn that you are no more my affianced husband and that i who am gathered again to isis the divine am no more your affianced wife  i do not understand will it please you to be more plain i said faintly  i will be more plain count shabaka more plain than you have been with me since we speak together for the last time it is well that i should be plain hear me when first you returned from the east in yonder hall you told us of certain things that happened to you there then the dwarf your servant took up the tale he said that he gave my name to the great king i was wroth as well i might be but even when i prayed that he should be scourged you did not deny that it was he who gave my name to the king although pharaoh yonder said that if you had spoken the name it would have been another matter  i had no time i answered for just then the messengers came from idernes and afterwards when i sought you you were gone  had you then no time she asked coldly beneath the palms in the garden of the palace when we were affianced oh there was time in plenty but it did not please you to tell me that you had bought safety and great gifts at the price of the honour of the lady of egypt whose love you stole  you do not understand i exclaimed wildly  forgive me shabaka but i understand very well indeed since from your own words i learned at the feast given to idernes that the name of amada slipped your lips by chance and thus came to the ears of the great king  the tale that idernes and his captain told was false lady and for it bes and i took their lives with our own hands  it had perhaps been better shabaka if you had kept them living that they might confess that it was false but doubtless you thought them safer dead since dead men cannot speak and for this reason challenged them to single combat  i gasped and could not answer for my mind seemed to leave me and she went on in a gentler voice  i do not wish to speak angrily to you my cousin shabaka especially when you have just wrought such great deeds for egypt moreover by the law i serve i may speak angrily to no man know then that on learning the truth since i could love none but you according to the flesh and therefore can never give myself in marriage to another i sought refuge in the arms of the goddess whom for your sake i had deserted she was pleased to receive me forgetting my treason on this very day for the second time i took the oaths which may no more be broken and that i may dwell where i shall never see you more pharaoh here has been pleased at my request to name me high priestess and prophetess of isis and to appoint me as a dwellingplace her temple at amada where i was born far away in upper egypt now all is said and done so farewell  all is not said and done i broke out in fury pharaoh i ask your leave to tell the full story of this business of the naming of the lady amada to the king of kings and that in the presence of the dwarf bes even a slave is allowed to set out his tale before judgment is passed upon him  peroa glanced at amada who made no sign then said  it is granted general shabaka  so bes was called into the chamber and having looked about him curiously seated himself upon the ground  bes i said you have heard nothing of what has passed here i was mistaken for as he told me afterwards he had heard everything through the door which was not quite closed it is needful bes that you should repeat truly all that happened at the court of the king of kings before and after i was brought from the boat  bes obeyed telling the tale very well so well that all listened earnestly without error moreover when he had finished i also told my story and how shaken by all i had gone through and already weak from the torment of the boat the name of amada was surprised from me who never dreamed that the king would at once make demand of her and who would have perished a thousand times rather than such a thing should happen i added what i had learned afterwards from our escort that this name was already well known to the great king who meant to make use of it as a cause of quarrel with egypt further that he had let me escape from a death by horrible torments because of some dream that he had dreamed while he rested before the banquet in which a god appeared and told him that it was an evil thing to slay a man because that man had bested him at a hunting match and one of which heaven would keep an account still because of the law of his land he must find a public pretext for loosing one whom he had once condemned and therefore chose this matter of the lady amada whom he pretended to send me to bring to him  when i had finished as amada still remained silent pharaoh asked of bes how it came about that he told one story on the night of our return and another on this night  because o pharaoh answered bes rolling his eyes for the first time in my life i have been just a little too clever and shot my arrow just a little too far hearken pharaoh and royal lady and high priest i knew that my master loves the lady amada and knew also that she is quick of tongue and temper one who readily takes offence even if thereby she breaks her own heart and so brings her life to ruin and with it perchance her country therefore knowing women whom i have studied in my own land i saw in this matter just such a cause of offence as she would lay hold of and counselled my master to keep silent as to the story of the naming of her before the king some evil spirit made him listen to this bad counsel so far at least that when i lied as to what had chanced for which lie the lady amada prayed that i might be scourged till my bones broke through the skin he did not at once tell all the truth nor did he do so afterwards because he feared that if he did i should in fact be scourged for my master and i love each other neither of us wishes to see the other scourged though such is my lot tonight and he glanced at amada i have said  then at last amada spoke  had i known all this story from the first perhaps i should not have done what i have done today and perhaps i should have forgiven and forgotten for in truth even if the dwarf still lies i believe your word o shabaka and understand how all came about but now it is too late to change say o priest of the mother is it not too late  it is too late said the priest solemnly seeing that if such vows as yours are broken for the second time o prophetess the curse of the goddess will pursue you and him for whom they were broken yes through this life and all other lives that perchance may be given to you upon the earth or elsewhere  pharaoh i cried in despair i made a bond with you it is recorded in writing and sealed i have kept my part of the bond my treasure you have spent your enemies i have slain your army i have commanded not so ill will you not keep yours and bid the priests release this lady from her vow and give her to me to whom she was promised or must i believe that you refuse not because of goddesses and vows but because yonder is the royal lady of egypt the true heiress to the throne who might perchance bear children which as prophetess of isis she can never do yes because of this and because of certain cries that came to your ears in the hour of your crowning before amenra and all the gods  peroa flushed as he heard me and answered  you speak roughly cousin and were you any other man i might be tempted to answer roughly but i know that you suffer and therefore i forgive nay you must believe no such things rather must you remember that in this bond of which you speak it was set down that i only promised you the lady amada with her own consent and this she has withdrawn  then pharaoh hearken tomorrow i leave egypt for another land giving you back your generalship and sheathing the sword that i had hoped to wield in its defence and yours when the last great day of trial by battle comes as come it will i tell you that i go to return no more unless the lady amada yonder shall summon me back to fight for her and you promising herself to me in guerdon  that can never be said amada  then i became aware of another presence in the room though how and when it appeared i do not know but i suppose that it had crept in while we were lost in talk at least between me and pharaoh crouched upon the ground was the figure of a man wrapped in a beggars cloak it threw back the hood and there appeared the ashen face and snowy beard of the holy tanofir  you know me pharaoh he said in his deep solemn voice i am tanofir the kings son tanofir the hermit tanofir the seer i have heard all that passes it matters not how and i come to you with a message i who read mens hearts of vows and goddesses and women i say nothing but this i say to you that if you break the spirit of your bond and suffer yonder shabaka to go hence with a bitter heart trouble shall come on you all the great kings armies did not die yonder by the banks of nile and mayhap one day he will journey to bury the bones of those who fell and with them yours o pharaoh i do not think that you will listen to me tonight and i am sure that yonder lady full of the newfanned flame of the jealous goddess will not listen still let her take counsel and remember my words in the hour of desperate danger let her send to shabaka and demand his help promising in return what he has asked and remembering that if isis loves her that goddess was born upon the nile and loves egypt more  too late too late too late wailed amada  then she burst into tears and turning fled away with the high priest pharaoh went also leaving me and bes alone i looked for the holy tanofir to speak with him but he too was gone  it is time to sleep master said bes for all this talk is more wearisome than any battle why what is this that has your name upon it and he picked a silkwrapped package from the floor and opened it  within were the priceless rosehued pearls     chapter xiv shabaka fights the crocodile  where to i said to bes when we were outside the palace for i was so broken with grief that i scarcely knew what i did  to the house of the lady tiu i think master since there you must make preparations for your start on the morrow also bid her farewell oh he went on in a kind of rapture which afterwards i knew was feigned though at the time i did not think about it oh how happy should you be who now are free from all this womancoil with life new and fresh before you reflect master on the hunting we will have yonder in ethiopia no more cares no more plannings for the welfare of egypt no more persuading of the doubtful to take up arms no more desperate battleventures with your countrys honour on your swordpoint and if you must see womenwell there are plenty in ethiopia who come and go lightly as an evening breeze laden with the odour of flowers and never trouble in the morning  at any rate you are not free from such coils bes i said and in the moonlight i saw his great face fall in  no master i am tying them about my throat see such is the way of the world or of the gods that rule the world i know not which for years i have been happy and free i have enjoyed adventures and visited strange countries and have gathered learning till i think i am the wisest man upon the nile at the side of one whom i loved and holding nothing at risk except my own life which mattered no more than that of a gnat dancing in the sun now all is changed i have a wife whom i love also more than i can tell you and he sighed but who still must be looked after and obeyedyes obeyed further soon i shall have a people and a crown to wear and councillors and affairs of state and an ancient religion to support and the grasshopper itself knows what besides the burden has rolled from your back to mine master making my heart which was so light heavy and oh i wish it had stopped where it was  even then i laughed sad as i was for truth lived in the philosophy of bes  master he went on in a changed voice i have been a fool and my folly has worked you ill forgive me since i acted for the best only until the end no one ever knows what is the best now here is the house and i go to meet my wife and to make certain arrangements by dawn perhaps you will be ready to start to ethiopia  do you really desire that i should accompany you there bes  certainly master that is unless you should desire that i accompany you somewhere else instead by sea southward for instance if so i do not know that i would refuse since ethiopia will not run away and there is much of the world that i should still like to visit only then there is karema to be thought about who expects or when she learns all soon will expect to be a queen he added doubtfully  no bes i am too tired to make new plans so let us go to ethiopia and not disappoint karema who after holding a cup so long naturally would like to try a sceptre  i think that is wisest master at any rate the holy tanofir thinks it wisest and he is the voice of fate oh why do we trouble who after all every one of us are nothing but pieces upon the board of fate  then he turned and left me and i entered the house where i found my mother sitting still in her festal robes like one who waits she looked at my face then asked what troubled me i sat down on a stool at her feet and told her everything  much as i thought she said when i had finished these overlearned women are strange fish to catch and hold and too much soul is like too much sail upon a boat when the desert wind begins to blow across the nile well do not let us blame her or bes or peroa who is already anxious for his dynasty and would rather that amada were a priestess than your wife or even the goddess isis who no doubt is anxious for her votaries let us rather blame the power that is behind the veil or to it bow our heads seeing that we know nothing of the end for which it works so egypt shuts her doors on you my son and whither away not to the east again i trust for there you would soon grow shorter by a head  i go to ethiopia my mother where it seems that bes is a great man and can shelter me  so we go to ethiopia do we well it is a long journey for an old woman but i weary of memphis where i have lived for so many years and doubtless the sands of the south make good burial grounds  we i exclaimed we  surely my son since in losing a wife you have again found a mother and until i die we part no more  when i heard this my eyes filled with tears my conscience smote me also because of late and indeed for years past i had thought so much of amada and so little of my mother and now it was amada who had cast me out unjustly without waiting to learn the truth because at the worst i who worshipped her had saved myself from death in slow torment by speaking her name while my mother forgetting all took me to her bosom again as she had done when i was a babe i knew not what to say but remembering the pearls i drew them out and placed them round my mothers neck  she looked at the wonderful things and smiled then said  such gems as these become white locks and withered breasts but ill yet my son i will keep them for you till you find a wife if not amada then another  if not amada i shall never find a wife i said bitterly whereat she smiled  then she left me to make ready before she slept a while    work as we would noon had passed two hours on the following day before we were prepared to start for there was much to do thus the house must be placed in charge of friends and the means of travel collected also a messenger came from pharaoh praying me for his and egypts sake to think again before i left them and an answer sent that go i must whither the holy tanofir would know if at any time pharaoh desired to learn in reply to this came another messenger who brought me parting gifts from pharaoh a chain of honour a title of higher nobility a commission as his envoy to whatever land i wandered and so forth which i must acknowledge lastly as we were leaving the house to seek the boat which bes had made ready on the nile there came yet another messenger at the sight of whom my heart leapt for he was priest of isis  he bowed and handed me a roll i opened it with a trembling hand and read    from the prophetess of isis whose house is at amada aforetime   royal lady of egypt to the count shabaka   i learn o my cousin that you depart from egypt and knowing the   reason my heart is sore believe me my cousin i love you well   better than any who lives upon the earth nor will that love ever   change since the goddess who holds my future in her hands knows   of what we are made and is not jealous of the past therefore she   will not be wroth at the earthly love of one who is gathered to   her heavenly arms her blessing and mine be on you and if we see   each other no more face to face in the world may we meet again in   the halls of osiris farewell beloved shabaka oh why did you   suffer that black master of lies the dwarf bes to persuade you   to hide the truth from me   so the writing ended and below it were two stains still wet which i knew were caused by tears moreover wrapped in a piece of silk and fastened to the scroll was a little gold ring graven with the royal uræus that amada had always worn from childhood only on the previous night i had noted it on the first finger of her right hand  i took my stylus and my waxen tablets and wrote on one of them    had you been a man amada and not a woman i think you would have   judged me differently but learned priestess and prophetess as you   are a woman you remain perchance a time may come when once more   you will turn to me in the hour of your need if so and i am   living i will come yea if i am dead i think that i still shall   come since nothing can really part us meanwhile by day and by   night i wear your ring and whenever i look on it i think of amada   the woman whose lips have pressed my own and forget amada the   priestess who for her souls sake has been pleased to break the   heart of the man who loved her and whom she misjudged so sorely in   her pride and anger   this tablet i wrapped up and sealed using clay and her own ring to make the seal and gave it for delivery to the priest  at length we drew near to the river and here gathered on the open land i found the most of those who had fought with me in the battle against the easterns and with them a great concourse of others from the city these collected round me some of them wounded and hobbling upon crutches praying me not to go as did the others who foresaw sorrow to egypt from my loss but i broke away from them almost in tears and with my mother hid myself beneath the canopy of the boat here bes was waiting also his beautiful wife who although she seemed sad at leaving egypt smiled a greeting to us while the steersmen and rowers of the boat tall ethiopians every one of them rose and gave me a generals salute then as the wind served we hoisted the sail and glided away up nile till presently the temples and palmgroves of memphis were lost to sight    of that long long journey there is no need to tell up the nile we travelled slowly dragging the boat past the cataracts till egypt was far behind us in the end many days after we had passed the mouth of another river that was blue in colour which flowed from the northern mountain lands down into the nile we came to a place where the rapids were so long and steep that we must leave the boat and travel overland drawing near to it at sunset i saw a multitude of people gathered on the sand and beyond them a camp in which were set many beautiful pavilions that seemed to be broidered with silk and gold as were the banners that floated above them whereon appeared the effigy of a grasshopper also done in gold with silver legs  it seems that my messengers travelled in safety said bes to me for know that yonder are some of my subjects who have come here to meet us now master i must no longer call you master since i fear i am once more a king and you must no longer call me bes but karoon moreover forgive me but when you come into my presence you must bow which i shall like less than you do but it is the custom of the ethiopians oh i would that you were the king and that i were your friend for henceforth goodbye to ease and jollity  i laughed but bes did not laugh at all only turned to his wife who already ruled him as though he were indeed a slave and said lady karema make yourself as beautiful as you can and forget that you have ever been a cup or anything useful since henceforth you must be a queen that is if you please my people  and what happens if i do not please them husband asked karema opening her fine eyes  i do not quite know wife perhaps they may refuse to accept me at which i shall not weep or perhaps they may refuse to accept you at which of course i should weep very much for you see you are so very white and heretofore all the queens of the ethiopians have been black  and if they refuse to accept me because i am white or rather brown instead of black like oiled marble what then o husband  thenoh then i cannot say o wife perhaps they will send you back to your own country or perhaps they will separate us and place you in a temple where you will live alone in all honour i remember that once they did that to a white woman making a goddess of her until she died of weariness or perhapswell i do not know  then karema grew angry  now i wish i had remained a cup she said and the servant of the holy tanofir who at least taught me many secret things instead of coming to dwell among black barbarians in the company of a dwarf who even if he be a king it seems has no power to protect the wife whom he has chosen  why will women always grow wroth before there is need asked bes humbly surely it would be time to rate me when any of these things had happened  if any of them do happen husband i shall say much worse things than that she replied but the talk went no further for at this moment our boat grounded and singing a wild song many of those who waited rushed into the water to drag it to the bank  then bes stood up on the prow waving his bow and there arose a mighty shout of karoon karoon it is he it is he returned after many years  twice they shouted thus and then every one of them threw themselves face downwards in the sand  yes my people cried bes it is i karoon who having been miraculously preserved from many dangers in far lands by the help of the grasshopper in heaven and as my messengers will have told you of my beloved friend lord shabaka the egyptian who has deigned to come to dwell with us for a while have at length returned to ethiopia that i may shed my wisdom on you like the sun and pour it on your heads like melted honey moreover mindful of our laws which aforetime i defied and therefore left you i have searched the whole world through till i found the most beautiful woman that it contained and made her my wife she too has deigned to come to this far country to be your queen advance fair karema and show yourself to these my ethiopians  so karema stepped forward and stood on the prow of the boat by the side of bes and a strange couple they looked the ethiopians who had risen considered her gravely then one of them said  karoon called her beautiful but in truth she is almost white and very ugly  at least she is a woman said another for her shape is female  yes and he has married her remarked a third and even a king may choose his own wife sometimes for in such matters who can judge anothers taste  cease said bes in a lordly way if you do not think her beautiful tonight you will tomorrow and now let us land and rest  so we landed and while i did so i took note of these ethiopians they were great men black as charcoal with thick lips white teeth and flat noses their eyes were large and the whites of them somewhat yellow their hair curled like wool their beards were short and on their faces they wore a continual smile of dress most of them had little but their elders or leaders wore lion and leopard skins and some were clad in a kind of silken tunic belted about the middle all were armed for war with long bows short swords and small shields round in shape and made from the hide of the hippopotamus or of the unicorn gold was plentiful amongst them since even the humblest wore bracelets of that metal while about the necks of the chieftains it was wound in great torques also sometimes on their ankles they wore sandals on their feet and some of them had ostrich feathers stuck in their hair a few also had grasshoppers fashioned of gold bound on the top of their heads and these i took to be the priests there were no women in their number  as the sun was sinking we were led at once to a very beautiful tent made of woven flax and ornamented as i have described where we found food made ready for us in plenty milk in bowls and the flesh of sheep and oxen boiled and roasted bes however was taken to a place apart which made karema even more angry than she was before  scarcely had we finished eating when a herald rushed into the tent crying prostrate yourselves yea be prostrated the grasshopper comes karoon comes  here i must say that i found that the title of karoon meant great grasshopper but karema who did not know this asked indignantly why she should prostrate herself to a grasshopper indeed she refused to do so even when bes entered the pavilion wonderfully attired in a gorgeouscoloured robe of which the train was held by two huge men so absurd did he look that my mother and i must bow very deeply to hide our laughter while karema said  it would be better husband if you found children to carry your robe instead of two giants moreover if it is meant to copy the colours of a grasshopper tis badly done since grasshoppers are green and you are gold and scarlet also they do not wear feathers set awry upon their heads  bes rolled his eyes as though in agony then turning bade his attendants be gone they obeyed though doubtfully as though they did not like to leave him alone with us whereon he let down the flap of the pavilion threw off his gorgeous coverings and said  you must learn to understand wife that our customs are different from those of egypt there i was happy as a slave and you were held to be beautiful as the cup of the holy tanofir also learned here i am wretched as a king and you are held to be ugly also ignorant as a stranger oh do not answer i pray you but learn that all goes well for the time you are accepted as my wife subject to the decision of a council of matrons aged relatives of my family who will decide when we reach the city of the grasshopper whether or not you shall be acknowledged as the queen of the ethiopians no no i pray you say nothing since i must go away at once as according to the law of the ethiopians the time has come for the grasshopper to sleep alone karema as you are not yet acknowledged as my wife you also can sleep with the lady tiu and for shabaka a tent is provided rest sweetly wife hark they fetch me  now if i had my way said karema i would rest in that boat going back to egypt what say you lord shabaka  but i made no answer who followed bes out of the tent leaving her to talk the matter over with my mother here i found a crowd of his people waiting to convey him to sleep and watching saw them place him in another tent round which they ranged themselves playing upon musical instruments after this someone came and led me to my own place where was a good bed in which i lay down to sleep this however i could not do for a long while because of my own laughter and the noise of the drums and horns that were soothing bes to his rest for now i understood why he had preferred to be a slave in egypt rather than a king in ethiopia  in the morning i rose before the dawn and went out to the riverbank to bathe while i was making ready to wash myself who should appear but bes followed but at a distance by a number of his people  never have i spent such a night master he said at least not since you took me prisoner years ago since by law i may not stop those horns and musical instruments now however also according to the law of the ethiopians i am my own lord until the sun rises so i have come here to gather some of those blue lilies which she loves as a present for karema because i fear that she is angry and must be appeased  certainly she is very angry i said or at least was so when i left her last night oh bes why did you let your people tell her that she was ugly  how can i help it master have you not always heard that the ethiopians are chiefly famous for one thing namely that they speak nothing but the truth to them she being different seems to be ugly therefore when they say that she is ugly they speak the truth  if so it is a truth that she does not like bes as i have no doubt she will tell you by and by do they think me ugly also  yes they do master but they think also that you look like a man who can draw a bow and use a sword and that goes far with the ethiopians of your mother they say nothing because she is old and they venerate the aged whom the grasshopper is waiting to carry away  now i began to laugh again and went with bes to gather the lilies these grew at the end of a mass of reeds woven together by the pressure of the current and floating on the water bes lay down upon his stomach while his people watched from a distance on the bank amazed into silence and stretched out his long arms to reach the blue lotus flowers suddenly the reeds gave way beneath him just as he had grasped two of the flowers and was dragging at them so that he fell into the river  next instant i saw a swirl in the brown water and perceived a huge crocodile it rushed at bes openmouthed being a good swimmer he twisted his body in order to avoid it but i heard the great teeth close with a snap on the short leathern garment which he wore about his middle  the devil has me farewell he cried and vanished beneath the water  now as i have said i was almost stripped for bathing but had not yet taken off my short sword which was girded round me by a belt in an instant i drew it and amidst the yells of horror of the ethiopians who had seen all from the bank i plunged into the river there are few able to swim as i could and i had the art of diving with my eyes open and remaining long beneath the surface without drawing breath for this i had practised from a child  immediately i saw the great reptile sinking to the mud and dragging bes with him to drown him there but here the river was very deep and with a few swift strokes i was able to get under the crocodile then with all my strength i stabbed upwards driving the sword far into the soft part of the throat feeling the pain of the sharp iron the beast let go of bes and turned on me how it happened i do not know but presently i found myself upon its back and was striking at its eyes one thrust at least went home for the blinded brute rose to the surface bearing me with him and oh the sweetness of the air as i breathed again  thus we appeared i riding the crocodile like a horse and stabbing furiously while close by was bes rolling his yellow eyes but helpless for he had no weapon still the devil was not dead although blood streamed from him only mad with pain and rage nor could the shouting ethiopians help me since they had only bows and dared not shoot lest their shafts should pierce me the crocodile began to sink again snapping furiously at my legs then i bethought me of a trick i had seen practised by natives on the nile  waiting till its huge jaws were open i thrust my arm between them grasping the short sword in such fashion that the hilt rested on its tongue and the point against the roof of its mouth it tried to close its jaws and lo the good iron was fixed between them holding them wide open then i withdrew my hand and floated upwards with nothing worse than a cut upon the wrist from one of its sharp fangs i appeared upon the surface and after me the crocodile spouting blood and wallowing in its death agonies i remembered no more till i found myself lying on the bank surrounded by a multitude with bes standing over me also in the shallow water was the crocodile dead my sword still fixed between its jaws  are you harmed master cried bes in a voice of agony  very little i think i answered sitting up with the blood pouring from my arm  bes thrust aside karema who had come lightly clothed from her tent saying  all is well wife i will bring you the lilies presently  then he flung his arms about me kissed my hands and my brow and turning to the crowd shouted  last night you were disputing as to whether this egyptian lord should be allowed to dwell with me in the land of ethiopia which of you disputes it now  no one they answered with a roar he is not a man but a god no man could have done such a deed  so it seems answered bes quietly at least none of you even tried to do it yet he is not a god but only that kind of man who is called a hero also he is my brother and while i reign in ethiopia either he shall reign at my side or i go away with him  it shall be so karoon they shouted with one voice and after this i was carried back to the tent  in front of it my mother waited and kissed me proudly before them all whereat they shouted again    so ended this adventure of the crocodile except that presently bes went back and recovered the two lilies for karema this time from a boat which caused the ethiopians to call out that he must love her very much though not as much as he did me  that afternoon borne in litters we set out for the city of the grasshopper which we reached on the fourth day as we drew near the place regiments of men to the number of twelve thousand or more came out to meet us so that at last we arrived escorted by an army who sang their songs of triumph and played upon their musical instruments until my head ached with the noise  this city was a great place whereof the houses were built of mud and thatched with reeds it stood upon a wide plain and in its centre rose a natural rocky hill upon the crest of which fashioned of blocks of gleaming marble and roofed with a metal that shone as gold was the temple of the grasshopper a columned building very like to those of egypt round it also were other public buildings among them the palace of the karoon the whole being surrounded by triple marble walls as a protection from attack by foes never had i seen anything so beautiful as that hill with its edifices of shining white roofed with gold or copper and gleaming in the sun  descending from my litter i walked to those of my mother and karema for bes in his majesty might not be approached and said as much to them  yes son answered my mother it is worth while to have travelled so far to see such a sight i shall have a fine sepulchre son  i have seen it all before broke in karema  when i asked  i do not know i suppose it must have been when i was the cup of the holy tanofir at least it is familiar to me already i weary of it for who can care for a land or a city where they think white people hideous and scarcely allow a wife to go near her husband save between midnight and dawn when they cease from their horrible music  it will be your part to change these customs karema  yes she exclaimed certainly that will be my part after which i went back to my litter     chapter xv the summons  now at the gates of the city of the grasshopper we were royally received the priests came out to meet us pushing a colossal image of their god before them on a kind of flat chariot and i remember wondering what would be the value of that huge golden locust if it were melted down also the council came very ancient men all of them since the ethiopians for the most part lived more than a hundred years perhaps that is why they were so glad to welcome bes since they were too old to care about retaining power in their own hands as they had done during his long absence for save bes there was no other man living of the true royal blood who could take the throne  then there were thousands of women broadfaced and smiling whose black skins shone with scented oils for they wore little except a girdle about their waists and many ornaments of gold thus their earrings were sometimes a palm in breadth and many of them had great gold rings through their noses such as in egypt are put in those of bulls my mother laughed at them but karema said that she thought them hideous and hateful  they were a strange people these ethiopians like children most of them being merry and kind and never thinking of one thing for more than a minute thus one would see them weep and laugh almost in the same breath but among them was an upper class who had great learning and much ancient knowledge these men made their laws wherein there was always sense under what seemed to be folly designed the temples managed the mines of gold and other metals and followed the arts they were the real masters of the land the rest were but slaves content to live in plenty for in that fertile soil want never came near them and to do as they were bid  thus they passed from the cradle to the grave amidst song and flowers carrying out their light allotted tasks and for the rest living as they would and loving those they would especially their children of whom they had many by nature and tradition the men were warriors and hunters being skilled in the use of the bow and always at war when they could find anyone to fight indeed when we came among them their trouble was that they had no enemies left and at once they implored bes to lead them out to battle since they were weary of herding kine and tilling fields  all of these things i found out by degrees also that they were a great people who could send out an army of seventy thousand men and yet leave enough behind them to defend their land of the world beyond their borders the most of them knew little but the learned men of whom i have spoken a great deal since they travelled to egypt and elsewhere to study the customs of other countries for the rest their only god was the grasshopper and like that insect they skipped and chirruped through life and when the winter of death came sprang away to another of which they knew nothing leaving their young behind them to bask in the sun of unborn summers such were the ethiopians  now of all the ceremonies of the reception of bes and his recrowning as karoon i knew little for the reason that the tooth of the crocodile poisoned my blood and made me very ill so that i remained for a moon or more lying in a fine room in the palace where gold seemed to be as plentiful as earthen pots are in egypt and all the vessels were of crystal had it not been for the skill of the ethiopian leeches and above all for the nursing of my mother i think that i must have died she it was who withstood them when they wished to cut off my arm and wisely for it recovered and was as strong as it had ever been in the end i grew well again and from the platform in front of the temple was presented to the people by bes as his saviour and the next greatest to him in the kingdom nor shall i ever forget the shoutings with which i was received  karema also was presented as his wife having passed the ordeal of the matrons but only i think because it was found that she was in the way to give an heir to the throne for to them her beauty was ugliness nor could they understand how it came about that their king who contrary to the general customs of the land was only allowed one wife lest the children should quarrel could have chosen a lady who was not black so they received her in silence with many whisperings which made karema very angry  when in due course however the child came and proved to be a son black as the best of them and of perfect shape they relented towards her and after the birth of a second grew to love her but she never forgave and loved them not at all nor was she overfond of these children of hers because they were so black which she said showed how poisonous was the blood of the ethiopians and indeed this is so for often i have noticed that if an ethiopian weds with one of another colour their offspring is black down to the third or fourth generation therefore karema longed for egypt notwithstanding the splendour in which she dwelt  so greatly did she long that she had recourse to the magic lore which she had learned from the holy tanofir and would sit for hours gazing into water in a crystal bowl or sometimes into a ball of crystal without the water trying to see visions therein that had to do with what passed in egypt moreover in time much of her gift returned to her and she did see many things which she repeated to me for she would tell no one else of them not even her husband  thus she saw amada kneeling in a shrine before the statue of isis and weeping a picture that made me sad also she saw the holy tanofir brooding in the darkness of the cave of the bulls and read in his mind that he was thinking of us though what he thought she could not read again she saw eastern messengers delivering letters to pharaoh and knew from his face that he was disturbed and that egypt was threatened with calamities and so forth  soon the news of her powers of divination spread abroad so that all the ethiopians grew to fear her as a seeress and thenceforth whatever they may have thought none of them dared to say that she was ugly further her gift was real since if she told me of a certain thing such as that messengers were approaching in due course they would arrive and make clear much that she had not been able to understand in her visions  now from the time that i grew strong again and as soon as bes was firmly seated on his throne he and i set to work to train and drill the army of the ethiopians which hitherto had been little more than a mob of men carrying bows and swords we divided it into phalanxes after the greek fashion and armed these bodies with long lances swords and large shields in the place of the small ones they had carried before also we trained the archers teaching them to advance in open order and shoot from cover and lastly chose the best soldiers to be captains and generals so it came about that at the end of the two years that i spent in ethiopia there was a force of sixty thousand men or more whom i should not have been afraid to match against any troops in the world since they were of great strength and courage and as i have said by nature lovers of war also their bows being longer and more powerful they could shoot arrows farther than the easterns or the egyptians  the ethiopian lords wondered why their king and i did these things since they saw no enemy against which so great an army could be led to battle on that matter bes and i kept our own counsel telling them only that it was good for the men to be trained to war since hearing of their wealth one day the king of kings might attempt to invade their country so month by month i laboured at this task leading armies into distant regions to accustom them to travelling far afield carrying with them what was necessary for their sustenance  so it went on until a sad thing happened since on returning from one of these forays in which i had punished a tribe that had murdered some ethiopian hunters and we had taken many thousands of their cattle i found my mother dying she had been smitten by a fever which was common at that season of the year and being old and weak had no strength to throw it off  as medicine did not help her the priests of the grasshopper prayed day and night in their temple for her recovery yes there they prayed to a golden locust standing on an altar in a sanctuary that was surrounded by crystal coffins wherein rested the flesh of former kings of the land to me the sight was pitiful but bes asked me what was the difference between praying to a locust and praying to images with the heads of beasts or to a dwarf shaped as he was like we did in egypt and i could not answer him  the truth is brother he said for so he called me now that all peoples in the world do not offer petitions to what they see and have been taught to revere but to something beyond of which to them it is a sign but why the ethiopians should have chosen a grasshopper as a symbol of god who is everywhere is more than i can tell still they have done so for thousands of years  when i came to my mothers bedside she was wandering and i saw that she could not live long in a little while however her mind cleared so that she knew me and tears of joy ran down her pale cheeks because i had returned before she died she reminded me that she had always said that she would find a grave in ethiopia and asked to be buried and not kept above ground in crystal as was the custom there then she said that she had been dreaming of my father and of me also that she did not think that i need fret myself overmuch about amada since she was sure that before long i should kiss her on the lips  i asked if she meant that i should marry her and that we should be happy and fortunate she replied that she supposed that i should marry her but of the rest would say nothing indeed her face grew troubled as though some thought hurt her and leaving the matter of amada she bade karema bring me the rosehued pearls blessed me prayed for our reunion in the halls of osiris and straightway died  so i caused her to be embalmed after the egyptian fashion and enclosed in a coffin of crystal with a scarab on her heart that karema had discovered somewhere in the city for always she was searching for things that reminded her of egypt whereof many were to be found brought from time to time by travellers or strangers then with such ceremony as we could without the services of the priests of osiris karema and i buried her in a tomb that bes had caused to be made near to the steps of the temple of the grasshopper while bes and his nobles watched from a distance  and so farewell to my beloved mother the lady tiu    after she was gone i grew very sad and lonely while she lived i had a home but now i was an exile a stranger in a strange land with no one of my own people to talk to except karema with whom as there were gossips even in ethiopia i thought it well not to talk too much there was bes it was true but now he was a great king and the time of kings is not their own moreover bes was bes and an ethiopian and i was i and an egyptian and therefore notwithstanding our love and brotherhood we could never be like men of the same blood and country  i grew weary of ethiopia with its useless gold and damp eternal green and heat and longed for the sand and the keen desert air bes noted it and offered me wives but i shrank from these black women however buxom and kindly and wished for no offspring of their race whom afterwards i could never leave to egypt i had sworn not to return unless one voice called me and it remained silent what then was i to do being no longer content to discipline and command an army that i might not lead into battle  at length i made up my mind by nature i was a hunter as much as a soldier i would beg from bes a band of brave men whom i knew lovers of adventure who sought new things and with them strike down south following the path of the elephants to wherever the gods might lead us doubtless in the end it would be to death but what matter when there is nothing for which one cares to live  while i was brooding over these plans karema read my mind perhaps because it was her own perhaps by help of her strange arts which i do not know at least one day when i was sitting alone looking at the city beneath from one of the palace windowplaces she came to me looking very beautiful and very mystic in the white robes she always loved to wear and said  my lord shabaka you tire of this land of honey and sweetness and soft airs and flowers and gold and crystal and black people who grin and chatter and are not pleasant to be near is it not so  yes queen i answered  do not call me queen my lord shabaka for i weary of that name as we both do of the rest call me karema the arab or karema the cup which you will but by the name of thoth god of learning do not call me queen  karema then i said well how do you know that i tire of all this karema  how could you do otherwise who are not a barbarian and who have egypt in your heart and egypts fate and here she looked me straight in the eyes egypts lady besides i measure you by myself  you at least should be happy karema who are great and rich and beloved and the wife of a king who is one of the best of men and the mother of children  yes shabaka i should be but i am not for who can live on sweetmeats only especially when they like what is sour see now how strangely we are made when i was a girl the daughter of an arab chief well bred and well taught as it chanced i tired of the hard life of the desert and the narrow minds about me i who longed for wisdom and to know great men then i became the cup of the holy tanofir and wisdom was all about me strange wisdom from another world rough sharp wisdom from tanofir and the quiet wisdom of the dead among whom i dwelt i wearied of that also shabaka i was beautiful and knew it and i longed to shine in a court to be admired among men to be envied of women to rule my husband came my way he was clever with a great heart he was your friend and therefore i was sure that he must be loyal and true he was or might be a king as i knew though he thought that i did not i married him and the holy tanofir laughed but he did not say me nay and i became a queen and now i wish sometimes that i were dead or back holding the cup of the holy tanofir with the wisdom of the heavens flowing round me and the soft darkness of the tombs about me it seems that in this world we never can be content shabaka  no karema we only think that we should be if things were otherwise than they are but how can i help you karema  least of all by going away and leaving me alone she answered with the tears starting to her eyes  looking at her i began to think that the best thing i could do would be to go away and at once but as ever she read my thought shook her head and laughed  no no i have put on my yoke and will carry it to the end have i not two black children and a husband who is a hero a wit and a mountebank in one and a throne and more gold and crystal than i ever wish to see again even in a dream and shall i not cling to these good things if you went i should only be a little more unhappy than before that is all not for my sake do i ask you to stay but for your own  how for my own karema i have done all that i can do here i have built the army afresh from cookboys to generals bes needs me no longer who has you his children and his country and i die of weariness  you can stop to make use of that army you have built afresh shabaka  against whom there are none to fight  against the great king of the east listen my gift of vision has grown strong and clear of late only today i have seen a meeting between pharaoh the holy tanofir and the lady amada they were all disturbed i know not at what and the end of it was that amada wrote in a roll and gave the writing to messengers who i think even now are speeding southwardto you shabaka nay do not look doubtfully on me it is true  then you did well to tell me karema for within a moon of this day i should have been where perhaps no messengers would have found me now i will wait and let it be your part to prepare the mind of bes do you think that he would give me an army to lead to egypt if there were need  she nodded and answered  he would do so for three reasons the first is because he loves you the second because he too wearies of ethiopia and this rich fat life of peace and the third because i shall tell him that he must  then why trouble to speak of the other two i said laughing  so i stayed on in the city of the grasshopper and busied myself with the questions of how to transport and feed a great army that must hold the field for six months or a year also with the setting of hundreds of skilled men to the making of bows arrows swords and shields nor did bes say me no in these matters indeed he helped them forward by issuing the orders as his own wherein i saw the hand of karema  three months went by and i began to think that karemas power had been at fault or that her vision was one that came from her lips and not from her heart to keep me in ethiopia but again she read my mind and smiled  not so shabaka she said those messengers have come to trouble and are detained by a petty tribe beyond our borders over some matter of a woman ten days ago the frontier guards marched to set them free  so again i waited and at length the messengers came three of them egyptians and three men of ethiopia who dwelt in egypt to learn its wisdom reporting that as karema had said through the foolishness of a servant they had been held prisoner by an arab chief and thus delayed then they delivered the writings which they had kept safe one was from pharaoh to the karoon of ethiopia one from the holy tanofir to karema and one from the lady amada to myself  with a trembling hand i broke the silk and seals and read it ran thus    shabaka my cousin   you departed from egypt saying that never would you return unless   i amada the priestess called you and i told you that i should   never call you said moreover that if you came at my call you   would demand me in guerdon and i told you that never would i give   myself to you who was doubly sworn to isis yet now i call and now   i say that if you come and conquer and i yet live then if you   still will it i am yours thus stands the case the great king   advances upon egypt with an army countless as the sands nor can   egypt hope to battle against him unaided and alone he comes to   make of her a slave to kill her children to burn her temples to   sack her cities and to defile her gods with blasphemies moreover   he comes to seize me and to drag me away to shame in his house of   women   therefore for the sake of the gods for egypts sake and for my   own i pray you come and save us moreover i still love you   shabaka yes more a thousand times then ever i did though   whether you still love me i know not for that loves sake   therefore i am ready to break my vows to isis and to dare her   vengeance if she should desire to be avenged upon me who would   save her and her worship praying that it may fall on my head and   not on yours this will i do by the counsel of the holy tanofir   by command of pharaoh and with the consent of the high priests of   egypt   now i amada have written choose shabaka beloved of my heart   such was the letter that caused my head to swim and set my soul on fire still i said nothing but thrust it into my robe and waited presently bes who had been reading in his roll looked up and spoke saying  are you minded to see arrows fly and swords shine in war brother if so here is opportunity pharaoh writes to me above his own seal seeking an alliance between egypt and ethiopia he says that the king of kings invades him and that if he conquers egypt he has sworn to travel on and conquer ethiopia also since he learns that it is now ruled by a certain dwarf who once stole his white signet and by a certain egyptian who once killed his satrap idernes  what says the karoon i asked  bes rolled his eyes and turning to karema asked  what says the karoons wife  karema laid down the roll she had been studying and answered  she says that she has received a command from her master the holy tanofir to wait upon him forthwith for reasons that he will explain when she arrives or to brave his curse upon her her children her country and her husband and not only his but that of the spirits who serve him  the curse of the holy tanofir is not a thing to mock at said bes as i who revere him know as well as any man  no husband and therefore i leave for egypt as soon as may be it seems that my sister is dead this year past and the holy tanofir has no one to hold his cup  and what shall i do asked bes  that is for you to say husband but if you will you can stay here and guard our children giving the command of your army to the lord shabaka  now for we were alone bes twisted himself about rolling his eyes and laughing as he used to do before he became karoon of ethiopia  ohoho wife he said so you are to go to egypt leaving me to play the nurse to babes and my brother here is to command my armies leaving me to look after the old men and the women nay i think otherwise i think that i shall come also that is if my brother wishes it did he not save my life and is it not his and with it all i have oh have done once more we will stand side by side in the battle brother and afterwards let fate do as it will with us tell me now what is the tale of archers and of swordsmen with which we can march against the great king with whom like you i have a score to settle  seventy and five thousand i answered  good on the fifth day from now the army marches for egypt     chapter xvi tanofir finds his broken cup  march we did but on the fifteenth day not the fifth since there was much to make ready first the council of the ethiopians must be consulted and through them the people in the beginning there was trouble over the matter since many were against a distant war and this even after bes had urged that it was better to attack than wait to be attacked for they answered and justly that here in ethiopia distance and the desert were their shields since the king of kings however great his strength would be weary and famished before he set foot within their borders  in the end the knot was cut with a sword for when the army came to learn of the dispute from the generals down to the common soldiers every man clamoured to be led to war since as i have said these ethiopians were fighters all of them and near at hand there were none left with whom they could fight so when the council came to see that they must choose between war abroad and revolt at home they gave way bargaining only that the children of the karoon should not leave the land so that if aught befell him there would be some of the true blood left to succeed  also the grasshopper was consulted by the priests who found the omens favourable indeed i was told that this great golden locust sat up upon its hind legs upon the altar and waved its feelers in the air which only happened when wonderful fortune was about to bless the land the tale reminded me of the nodding of the statues of our own gods in egypt when a new pharaoh was presented to them and of that of isis when amada put up her prayer to the divine mother to tell the truth i suspected karema of having some hand in the business however so it happened  at length we set forth a mighty host bes commanding the swordsmen and i under him the archers of whom there were more than thirty thousand men and glad was i when all the farewells were said and we were free of the weeping crowds of women at first bes and karema were somewhat sad at parting from their children but in a little while they grew gay again since the one longed for battle and the other for the sands of egypt  now of our advance i need say little except that it was slow though none dared to bar the road of so mighty an array since we must go on foot we were not able to cover more than five leagues a day for even after we reached the river boats could not be found for so many though karema travelled in one with her ladies also cattle and corn must always be sent forward for food still we crept on to egypt without sickness accident or revolt  when we drew near to its frontiers messengers met us from pharaoh bearing letters in answer to those which we had sent with the tidings of our coming these contained little but ill news it seemed that the great king with a countless host had taken all the cities of the delta and after a long siege had captured memphis and put it to the sack and that the army of egypt fighting desperately by land and upon the nile was being driven southwards towards thebes pharaoh added that he proposed to make his last stand at the strong city of amada since he doubted whether the troops from lower egypt would not rather surrender to the easterns than retreat further up the nile he thanked and blessed us for our promised aid and prayed that it might come in time to save egypt from slavery and himself from death  also there was a letter for me from amada in which she said    oh come quickly come quickly beloved shabaka lest of me you   should find but bones for never will i fall living into the hands   of the great king we are sore pressed and although amada has been   made very strong it can stand but a little while against such a   countless multitude armed with all the engines of war   for karema too there were messages from the holy tanofir of the same meaning saying that unless we appeared within a moon of their receipt all was lost  we read and took counsel then we pressed forward by double marches sending swift runners forward to bid pharaoh and his army hold on to the last spear and arrow  on the twentyfifth day from the receipt of this news we came to the great frontier city which we found in tumult for its citizens were mad with fear here we rested one night and ate of the food that was gathered there in plenty then leaving a small rearguard of five thousand men who were tired out to hold the place we pressed onwards for amada was still four days march away on the morning of the fourth day we were told that it was falling or had fallen and when at length we came in sight of the place we saw that it was beleaguered by an innumerable host of easterns while on the nile was a great fleet of grecian and cyprian mercenaries moreover heralds from the king of kings reached us saying  surrender barbarians or before the second day dawns you shall sleep sound every one of you  to these we answered that we would take counsel on the matter and that perhaps on the morrow we would surrender since when we had marched from ethiopia we did not know how great was the kings strength having been deceived as to it by the letters of the pharaoh meanwhile that the king of kings would do well to let us alone since we were brave men and meant to die hard and it would be better for him to leave us to march back to ethiopia rather than lose an army in trying to kill us  with these words which were spoken by bes himself the messengers departed one of them however who seemed to be a great lord called in a loud voice to his companions saying it was hard that nobles should have to do the errands not of a man but of an ape who would look better hanging to a pole bes made no answer only rolled his yellow eyes and said when the lord was out of hearing  now by the grasshopper and all the gods of egypt i swear that in payment for this insult i will choke the nile with the army of the great king and hang that knave to a pole from the prow of the royal ship which last thing i hope he did    when the embassy had gone bes gave orders that the whole army should eat and lie down to sleep  i am sure said he that the great king will not attack us at once since he will hope that we shall flee away during the night having seen his strength  so the ethiopians filled themselves and then lay down to sleep which these people can do at any time even if not tired as they were but while they rested bes and i and karema with some of the generals consulted together long and earnestly for in truth we knew not what to do but a league away lay the town of amada beset by hundreds of thousands of the easterns so that none could come in or out and within its walls were the remains of pharaohs army not more than twenty thousand men all told if what we heard were true on the nile also was the great grecian and cyprian fleet two hundred vessels and more though as we could see by the light of the setting sun the most of these were made fast to the western bank where the egyptians could not come at them  for the rest our position was good being on high desert beyond the cultivated land which bordered the eastern bank but in front of us separating us from the southern army of the king stretched a swamp hard to cross so that we could not hope to make an attack by night as there was no moon lastly the main eastern strength to the number of two hundred thousand or more lay to the north beyond amada  all these things we considered talking low and earnestly there in the tent till it grew so dark that we could not see each others faces while behind us slumbered our army that now numbered some seventy thousand men  we are in a trap said bes at length if we await attack they will weigh us down with numbers if we flee they have camels and horses and will overtake us also ships of which we have none if we attack it must be without cover through swamp where we shall be bogged  meanwhile pharaoh is perishing within yonder walls of amada which the engines batter down by the grasshopper i know not what to do it seems that our journey is vain and that few of us will see ethiopia more also that egypt is sped  i made no answer for here my generalship failed me and i had nothing to say the captains too were silent only womanlike karema wept a little and i too went near to weeping who thought of amada penned in yonder temple like a lamb that awaits the butchers knife  suddenly coming from the door of the tent which i thought was closed i heard a deep voice say  i have ever noted that those of ethiopian blood are melancholy after sundown though of egyptians i had thought better things  now about this voice there was something familiar to me still i said nothing nor did the others for to speak the truth all of us were frightened and thought that we must dream for how could any thing that breathed approach this tent through a triple line of sentries so we sat still staring at the darkness till presently in that darkness appeared a glow of light such as comes from the fireflies of ethiopia it grew and grew while we gasped with fear till presently it took shape and the shape it took was that of the ancient withered face the sightless eyes and the white beard of the holy tanofir yes there not two feet from the ground seemed to float the head of the holy tanofir limned in faint flame which i suppose must have been reflected on to it from the light of some campfire without  o my beloved master cried karema and threw herself towards him  o my beloved cup answered tanofir glad am i to know you well and unshattered  then a torch was lit and lo there before us wrapped in his dark cloak sat the holy tanofir  whence come you my greatuncle i asked amazed  from less far than you do nephew he answered namely out of amada yonder oh ask me not how it is easy if you are a blind old beggar who knows the path and by the way if you have aught to eat i should be glad of a bite and a sup since in amada food has been scarce for this last month and tonight there is little left  karema sped from the tent and presently returned with bread and wine of which tanofir partook almost greedily  this is the first strong drink that i have tasted for many a year he said as he drained the goblet but better a broken vow than broken wits when one has much to plan and do at least i hope the gods will think so when i meet them presently therei am strong again now say what is your force  we told him  good and what is your plan  we shook our heads having none  bes he said sternly i think you grow dull since you became a kingor perhaps it is marriage that makes you so why in bygone years schemes would have come so fast that they would have choked each other between those thick lips of yours and shabaka tell me have you lost all your generalship whereof once you had plenty in the soft air of ethiopia or is it that even the shadow of marriage makes you dull well i must turn to the woman for that is always the lot of man your plan karema and quickly for there is no time to lose  now the face of karema grew fixed and her eyes dreamy as she spoke in a slow measured voice like one who knows not what she says  my plan is to destroy the armies of the great king and to relieve the city of amada  a very good plan said holy tanofir but the question is how  i think went on karema that about a league above this place there is a spot where at this season the nile can be forded by tall men without the wetting of their shoulders first then i would send five thousand swordsmen across that ford and let them creep down on the navy of the great king where the sailors revel in safety or sleep sound and fire the ships the wind blows strongly from the south and the flames will leap fast from one of them to the other most of their crews will be burned and the rest can be slain by our five thousand  good very good said the holy tanofir but not enough seeing that on the eastern bank is gathered the host of over two hundred thousand men now how will you deal with them karema  i seem to see a road yonder beyond the swamp it runs on the edge of the desert but behind the sandhills i would send the archers of whom there are more than thirty thousand under the command of shabaka along that road which leads them past amada on its farther side are low hills strewn with rocks here i would let the archers take cover and wait for the breaking of the dawn then beneath them they will see the most of the eastern host and with such bows as ours they can sweep the plain from the hills almost to the nile and having a hundred arrows to a man should slaughter the easterns by the ten thousand for when these turn to charge a shaft should pierce through two together  good again said tanofir but what of the army of the great king which lies upon this side of amada  i think that before the dawn believing us so few it will advance and with the first light begin to thread the swamp and therefore we must keep five thousand archers to gall it as it comes still it will win through though with loss and find us waiting for it here shoulder to shoulder rank upon rank with locked shields against which horse and foot shall break in vain for who shall drive a wedge through the ethiopian squares that shabaka has trained and that bes the karoon commands i say that they shall roll back like waves from a cliff yes again and again growing ever fewer till the clamour of battle and the shouts of fear and agony reach their ears from beyond amada where shabaka and the archers do their work and the sight of the burning ships strikes terror in them and they fly  good again said the holy tanofir but still many on both fronts will be left for this army of easterns is very vast and how will you deal with these o karema  on these i would have pharaoh with all his remaining strength pour from the northern and the southern gates of amada for so shall they be caught like wounded lions between two wild bulls and torn and trampled and utterly destroyed only i know not how to tell pharaoh what he must do and when  good again said the holy tanofir very good and as for the telling of pharaoh well i shall see him presently it is strange my chipped cup which i had almost thrown away as useless that although broken you still hold so much wisdom for know wonderful though it may seem that just such plans as you have spoken have grown up in my own mind only i wished to learn if you thought them wise  then he laughed a little and karema stretched her arms as one does who awakes from sleep rubbed her eyes and asked if he would not eat more food  in an instant tanofir was speaking again in a quick clear voice  bes or king he said doubtless you will do your wifes will therefore let the host be aroused and stand to its arms as it chances i have four men without who can be trusted two of these will guide the five thousand to the ford and across it also down upon the ships the other two will guide shabaka and the archers along the road which karema remembers so well perhaps she trod it as a child for my part i return to amada to make sure that pharaoh does his share and at the right time for mark unless all this is carried through tonight amada will fall tomorrow a certain priestess will die and you bes and your soldiers will never look on ethiopia again is it agreed  i nodded who did not wish to waste time in words and bes rolled his eyes and answered  when one can think of nothing it is best to follow the counsel of those who can think of something also to hunt rather than to be hunted especially is this so if that something comes from the holy tanofir or his broken cup generals you have heard rouse the host and bid them stand to their arms company by company  the generals leapt away into the darkness like arrows from a bow and presently we heard the noise of gathering men  where are these guides of yours holy tanofir asked bes  tanofir beckoned over his shoulder and out of the gloom one by one four men stole into the tent they were strange quiet men but i can say no more of them since their faces were veiled nor as it chances did i ever see any of them after the battle in which i suppose that they were killed or perhaps they appeared afterwell never mind  you have heard said tanofir whereupon all four of them bowed their mysterious veiled heads  now my brother whispered bes into my ear tell me i pray you how did four men who were not in the tent hear what was said in this tent and how did they come through the guards who have orders to kill anyone who does not know the countersign especially men whose faces are wrapped in napkins  i do not know i answered whereon bes groaned only karema smiled a little as though to herself  then having heard obey said the holy tanofir whereon the four veiled ones bowed again  will you not give them their orders o most venerable inquired bes doubtfully  i think it is needless said tanofir in a dry voice why try to teach those who know  will you not offer them something to eat since they also must be hungry i asked of karema  fool be silent she replied looking on me with contempt do thefriendsof tanofir need to eat  i should have thought so after being beleaguered for a month in a starving town if the master wants to eat why should not his men i murmured  then a thought struck me and i was silent  a general returned and reported that the orders had been executed and that all the army was afoot  good said bes then start forthwith with five thousand men and burn those ships according to the plan laid down by the queen karema which you heard her speak but now and he named certain regiments that he should take with him those of the generals own command adding save some of the ships if you can and afterwards cross the nile in them with your men and join yourself either to my force or to that of the lord shabaka according to what you see may the grasshopper give you victory and wisdom  the general saluted and asked  who guides us to and across the ford of the great river  two of the veiled men stepped forward whereon the general muttered into my ear  i like not the look of them i pray the grasshopper they do not guide us across the river of death  have no fear general said the holy tanofir from the other end of the tent if you and your men play their parts as well as the guides will play theirs the ships are already burned together with their companies only take fire with you  so that general departed with the two guides looking somewhat frightened and soon was marching up nile at the head of five thousand swordsmen  now bes looked at me and said  it seems that you had better be gone also my brother with the archers perchance the holy tanofir will show you whither  no no answered tanofir my guides will show him look not so doubtful shabaka did i fail you when you were in the grip of the king of kings in the east and only your own life and that of bes were at stake  i do not know i answered  you do not know but i know as i think do bes and karema since the one received the messages which the other sent well if i did not fail you then shall i fail you now when egypt is at stake follow these guides i give you and here he took hold of the quiver of arrows that lay beside me on the ground and as certainly as though he could see it with his blind eyes touched one of them on the shaft of which were two black and a white feather remember my words after you have loosed this arrow from your great black bow and noted where it strikes  then i turned to bes and asked  where do we meet again  i cannot say brother he answered in amada if that may be if not at the table of osiris or in the fields of the grasshopper or in the blackness which swallows all gods and men together  does karema come with me or bide with you i asked again  she does neither interrupted tanofir she accompanies me to amada where i have need of her and she will be more safe oh fear nothing for every hermit however poor still carries his staff and his cup even if it be cracked  then i shook bes by the hand and went my way wondering if i were awake or dreaming and the last thing i saw in that tent was the beautiful face of karema smiling at me this i took to be a good omen since i knew that it was the heart of the holy tanofir which smiled and that her eyes were but its mirror  already my thirty thousand archers were marshalling and having made sure that there was ample store of arrows and that all their gourds were filled with water i set myself at their head while in front of me walked the two veiled guides i looked upon them doubtfully since it seemed dangerous to trust an army to unknown men who for aught i knew might lead us into the midst of our foes then i remembered that they were vouched for by the holy tanofir my own greatuncle whom i trusted above any man on earth and took heart again  how had he come into our tent i wondered and how blind as he was would he get back into amada with karema if he took her well who could account for the goings or the comings of the holy tanofir who was more of a spirit than a man perhaps it was not really he whom we had seen but what we egyptians called his ka or double which can pass to and fro at will only do kas eat of this matter i knew only that offerings of food and drink are made to them in tombs so leaving the holy tanofir to guard himself i turned my mind to our own business which was to surprise the army of the great king  skirting the swamp we came to rough and higher ground and though i could see little in that darkness i knew that we were walking up a hill presently we crossed its crest and descending for three bowshots or so i felt that my feet were on a road now the guides turned to the left and after them in a long line came my army of thirty thousand archers in utter silence we went since we had no beasts with us and our sandalled feet made little noise moreover orders had been passed down the line that the man who made a sound should die  for two hours or more we marched thus then bore to the left again and climbed a slope by which time i judged we must be well past the town of amada here suddenly the guides halted and we after them at whispered words of command one of them took me by the cloak led me forward a little way to the crest of the ridge and pointed with his whitesleeved arm i looked and there beneath me well within bowshot were thousands of the watchfires of the kings army flaring some of them in the strong wind for a full league those fires burned and we were opposite to the midmost of them  see now general shabaka said the guide speaking for the first time in a curious hissing whisper such as might come from a man who had no lips beneath you sleeps the eastern host which being so great has not thought it needful to guard this ridge now marshal your archers in a fourfold line in such fashion that at the first break of dawn they can take cover behind the rocks and shoot every man of them without piercing his fellow do you bide here with the centre where your standard can be seen by all to north and south i and my companion will lead your vanguard farther on to where the ridge draws nearer to the nile so that with their arrows they can hold back and slay any who strive to escape down stream the rest is in your hands for we are guides not generals summon your captains and issue your commands  so we went back again and i called the officers together and told them what they were to do then despatched them to their regiments  presently the vanguard of ten thousand men drew away and vanished and with them the whiterobed guides on whom i never looked again then i marshalled my centre as well as i could in the gloom and bade them lie down to rest and sleep if they were able also within thirty minutes of the sunrise to eat and drink a little of the food they carried to see that every bow was ready and that the arrows were loosened in every quiver this done with a few whom i trusted to serve me as messengers and guard i crept up to the brow of the hill or slope and there we laid us down and watched     chapter xvii the battleand after  two hours went by and i knew by the stars that the dawn could not be far away my eyes were fixed upon the nile and on the lights that hung to the prows of the great kings ships where were those who had been sent to fire them i wondered for of them i saw nothing well their journey would be long as they must wade the river perhaps they had not yet arrived or perhaps they had miscarried at least the fleet seemed very quiet none were alarmed there and no sentry challenged  at length it grew near to dawn and behind me i heard the gentle stir of the ethiopians arising and eating as they had been bidden whereon i too ate and drank a little though never had i less wished for food the east brightened and far up the nile of a sudden there appeared what at first i took to be a meteor or a lantern waving in the wind that now was blowing its strongest as it does at this season of the year just at the time of dawn yet that lantern seemed to travel fast and lo now i saw that it was fire running up the rigging of a ship  it leapt from rope to rope and from sail to sail till they blazed fiercely and in other ships also nearer to us flame appeared that grew to a great red sheet our men had not failed the navy of the king of kings was burning oh how it burned fanned by the breath of that strong wind from vessel to vessel leapt the fire like a thing alive for all of them were drawn up on the bank with prows fastened in such fashion that they could not readily be made loose some broke away indeed but they were aflame and only served to spread the fire more quickly before the rim of the sun appeared for a league or more there was nothing but blazing ships from which rose a hideous crying and still more and more took fire lower down the line  i had no time to watch for now i must be up and doing the sky grew grey there was light enough to see though faintly i cast my eyes about me and perceived that no place in the world could have been better for archery in front the hill was steep for a hundred paces or more and scattered over with thousands of large stones behind which bowmen might take shelter then came a gentle slope of loose sand up which attackers would find it hard to climb then the long flat plain whereon the easterns were camped and beyond it scarce two furlongs away the banks of nile  indeed the place was illchosen for so great an army nor could it have held them all had not the camping ground been a full league in length and even so they were crowded out of the mist their tents appeared thousands of them farther than my eye could reach and almost opposite to me near to the banks of the river was a great pavilion of silk and gold that i guessed must shelter the majesty of the king of kings indeed this was certain since now i saw that over it floated his royal banner which i knew so well i who had stolen the little white signet of signets from which it was taken truly the holy tanofir or his cup karema or his messengers or the spirits with whom he dwelt i know not which had a generals eye and knew how to plan an ambuscade  so thought i to myself as i ran back to my army to meet the gathered captains and set all things in order it was soon done for they were ready as were the fierce ethiopians fresh from their rest and food and stringing their bows every one of them or loosening the arrows in their quivers as i came they lifted their hands in salute for speak they dared not and i sent a whisper down their ranks that this day they must fight and conquer or fall for the glory of ethiopia and their king then i gave my orders and before the sun rose and revealed them they crept forward in a fourfold line and took shelter behind the stones lying there invisible on their bellies until the moment came  the red rim of ra appeared glorious in the east and i from behind the rocks that i had chosen sat down and watched oh truly tanofir or the gods of egypt were ordering things aright for us the huge camp was awake now and aware of what was happening on the nile they could not see well because of the tall reeds upon the rivers rim and therefore without order or discipline by the thousand and the ten thousand for their numbers were countless some with arms and some without they ran to the slope of sand beneath our station and began to climb it to have a better view of the burning ships  the sun leapt up swiftly as it does in egypt his glowing edge appeared over the crest of the hill though the hollows beneath were still filled with shadow the moment was at hand i waited till i had counted ten glancing to the right and left of me to see that all were ready and to suffer the crowd to thicken on the slope but not to reach the lowest rocks whither they were climbing then i gave the double signal that had been agreed  behind me the banner of the golden grasshopper was raised upon a tall pole and broke upon the breeze that was the first signal whereat every man rose to his knees and set shaft on string next i lifted my bow the black bow the ancient bow that few save i could bend and drew it to my ear  far away out of arrowreach as most would have said floated the great kings standard over his pavilion at this i aimed making allowance for the wind and shot the shaft leapt forward seen in the sunlight lost in the shadow seen in the sunlight again and lastly seen once more pinning that golden standard against its pole  at the sight of the omen a roar went up that rolled to right and left of us a roar from thirty thousand throats now it was lost in a sound like to the hissing of thunder rain in ethiopia the sound of thirty thousand arrows rushing through the wind oh they were well aimed those arrows for i had not taught the ethiopians archery in vain  how many went down before them the gods of egypt know alone i do not all i know is that the long slope of sand which had been crowded with standing men was now thick with fallen men many of whom lay as though they were asleep for what mail could resist the ironpointed shafts driven by the strong bows of the ethiopians  and this was but a beginning for flight after flight those arrows sped till the air grew dark with them soon there were no more to shoot at on the slope for these were down and the order went to lift the bows and draw upon the camp and especially upon the parks of baggage beasts presently these were down also or rushing maddened to and fro  at last the eastern generals saw and understood orders were shouted and in a mad confusion the scores of thousands who were unharmed rushed back towards the banks of nile where our shafts could not reach them here they formed up in their companies and took counsel it was soon ended for all the vast mass of them preceded by a cloud of archers began to advance upon the hill  now i passed a command to the ethiopians of whom so far not one had fallen to lie low and wait on came the glittering multitude of easterns gay with purple and gold their mail and swords shining in the risen sun on they came by squadron and by company more than the eye could number they reached the sand slope thick with their own dead and wounded and paused a little because they could see no man since the black bodies of the ethiopians were hid behind the black stones and the black bows did not catch the light  then from a gorgeous group that i guessed hid the person of the great king surrounded by his regiment of guards ten thousand of them who were called immortals messengers sprang forth screaming the order to charge the host began to climb the slippery sand slope but still i held my hand till their endless lines were within fifty paces of us and their arrows rattled harmlessly against our stones then i caused the banner of the grasshopper that had been lowered to be lifted thrice and at the third lifting once more thirty thousand arrows rushed forth to kill  they went down they went down in lines and heaps riddled through and through but still others came on for they fought under the eye of the great king and to fly meant death with shame and torture we could not kill them all they were too many we could not kill the half of them now their foremost were within ten paces of us and since we must stand up to shoot our men began to fall also pierced with arrows i caused the blast of retreat to be sounded on the ivory horn and step by step we drew back to the crest of the ridge shooting as we went on the crest we reformed rapidly in a double line standing as close as we could together and my example was followed all down the ranks to right and left then i bethought me of a plan that i had taught these archers again and again in ethiopia  with the flag i signalled a command to stop shooting and also passed the word down the line so that presently no more arrows flew the easterns hesitated wondering whether this were a trap or if we lacked shafts and meanwhile i sent messengers with certain orders to the vanguard who sped away at speed behind the hill running as they never ran before presently i heard a voice below cry out  the great king commands that the barbarians be destroyed let the barbarians be destroyed  now with a roar they came on like a flood i waited till they were within twenty paces of us and shouted shoot and fall  the first line shot and oh fearful was its work for not a shaft missed those crowded hosts and many pinned two together my archers shot and fell down setting new arrows to the string as they fell whereon the second line also shot over them then up we sprang and loosed again and again fell down whereon the second line once more poured in its deadly hail  now the easterns stayed their advance for their front ranks lay prone and those behind must climb over them if they could yes standing there in glittering groups they rocked and hesitated although their officers struck them with swords and lances to drive them forward once more our front rank rose and loosed and once more we dropped and let the shafts of the second speed over us it was too much flesh and blood could not bear more of those arrows thousands upon thousands were down and the rest began to flee in confusion  then at my command the ivory horns sounded the charge every man slung his bow upon his back and drew his short sword  on to them i cried and leapt forward  like a black torrent we rushed down the hill leaping over the dead and wounded the retreat became a rout since before these ebon greateyed warriors the soft easterns did not care to stand they fled screaming  these are devils these are devils  we were among them now hacking and stabbing with the short swords upon their heads and backs there was no need to aim the blow they were so many like a huddled mob of cattle they turned and fled down nile but my orders had reached the vanguard and these hidden in the growing crops on the narrow neck of swampy land between the hills and the nile met them with arrows as they came also raked them from the steep cliff side their chariot wheels sank into the mud till the horses were slain their footmen were piled in heaps about them till soon there was a mighty wall of dead and dying and our centre and rearguard came up behind oh we slew and slew till before the sun was an hour high over half the army of the great king was no more then we reformed having suffered but little loss and drank of the water of the nile  all is not done i cried  for the immortals still remained behind us gathered in massed ranks about their king also there were many thousands of others between these and the walls of amada and to the south of the city yet a second army that with which bes had been left to deal with what success i knew not  ethiopians i shouted cease crying victory since the battle is about to begin strike and at once before the easterns find their heart again  so we advanced upon the immortals all of us for now the vanguard had joined our strength  in long lines we advanced over that bloodsoaked plain and as we came the great king loosed his remaining chariots against us it availed him nothing since the horses could not face our arrows whereof thanks be to the gods i had prepared so ample a store carried in bundles by lads scarce a chariot reached our lines and those that did were destroyed leaving us unbroken  the chariots were done with and their drivers dead but there still frowned the squares of the immortals we shot at them till nearly all our shafts were spent and galled to madness they charged we did not wait for the points of those long spears but ran in beneath them striking with our short swords and oh grim and desperate was that battle since the easterns were clad in mail and the ethiopians had but short jerkins of bulls hide  fight as we would we were driven back the fray turned against us and we fell by hundreds i bethought me of flight to the hills since now we were outnumbered and very weary but behold when all seemed lost a great shouting rose from amada and through her opened gates poured forth all that remained of the army of pharaoh perhaps eighteen or twenty thousand men i saw and my heart rose again  stand firm i cried stand firm and lo we stood  the egyptians were on them now and in their midst i saw pharaohs banner by degrees the battle swayed towards the banks of nile we to the north the egyptians to the south and the easterns between us they were trying to turn our flank yes and would have done it had there not suddenly appeared upon the nile a fleet of ships at first i thought that we were lost for these ships were from greece and cyprus till i saw the banner of the grasshopper wave from a prow and knew that they were manned by our five thousand who had gone out to burn the fleet and had saved these vessels they beached and from their crowded holds poured the five thousand or those that were left of them and ranging themselves upon the bank raised their warshout and attacked the ends of the easterns lines  now we charged for the last time and the egyptians charged from the south haha the ranks of the immortals were broken at length we were among them i saw pharaoh his uræus circlet on his helm he was wounded and sore beset a tall immortal rushed at him with a spear and drove it home  pharaoh fell  i leapt over him and killed that eastern with a blow upon the neck but my sword shattered on his armour the tide of battle rolled up and swept us apart and i saw pharaoh being carried away look yonder was the great king himself standing in a golden chariot the great king in all his glory whom last i had seen far away in the east he knew me and shot at me with a bow the bow he thought my own shouting die dog of an egyptian  his arrow pierced my helm but missed my head i strove to come at him but could not  the real rout began the immortals were broken like an earthen jar they retreated in groups fighting desperately and of these the thickest was around the great king he whom i hated was about to escape me he still had horses he would fly down nile gain his reserves and so away back to the east where he would gather new and yet larger armies since men in millions were at his command then he would return and destroy egypt when perchance there were no ethiopians to help her and perhaps after all drag amada to his house of women see they were breaking through and already i was far away with a wound in my breast a hurt leg and a shattered sword  what could i do my arrows were spent and the bearers had none left to give me no there was one still in the quiver i drew it out on its shaft were two black feathers and one white who had spoken of that arrow i remembered tanofir i was to think of certain things that he had said when i noted what it pierced i unslung my bow strung it and set that arrow on the string  by now the great king was far away out of reach for most archers his chariot forging ahead amidst the remnant of his guards and the nobles who attended on his sacred person travelled over a little rise where doubtless once there had been a village long since rotted down to its parent clay the sunlight glinted on his shining armour and silken robe whereof the back was toward me  i aimed i drew i loosed swift and far the shaft sped forward by osiris it struck him full between the shoulders and lo the king of kings the monarch of the world lurched forward fell on to the rail of his chariot and rolled to the ground next instant there arose a roar of the king is dead the great king is dead fly fly fly  so they fled and after them thundered the pursuers slaying and slaying till they could lift their arms no more oh yes some escaped though the men of thebes and country folk murdered many of them and but a few ever won back to the east to tell the tale of the blotting out of the mighty army of the king of kings and of the doom dealt to him by the great black bow of shabaka the egyptian  i stood there gasping when suddenly i heard a voice at my side it said  you seem to have done very well brother even better than we did yonder on the other side of the town though some might think that fray a thing whereof to make a song also that last shot of yours was worthy of a good archer for i marked it i marked it a great lord was laid low thereby let us go and see who it was  i threw my arm round the bull neck of bes and leaning on him advanced to where the king lay alone save for the fallen about him  this man is not yet sped said bes let us look upon his face and he turned him over and stretched him there upon the sand with the arrow standing two spans beyond his corselet  why said bes this is a certain high one with whom we had dealings in the east and he laughed thickly  then the great king opened his eyes and knew us and on his dying features came a look of hate  so you have conquered egyptian he said oh if only i had you again in the east whence in my folly i let you go  you would set me in your boat would you not whence by the wisdom of bes i escaped  more than that he gasped  i shall not serve you so i went on i shall leave you to die as a warrior should upon a fair fought field but learn tyrant and murderer that the shaft which overthrew you came from the black bow you coveted and thought you had received and that this hand loosed itnot at hazard  i guessed it he whispered  know too king that the lady amada whom you also coveted waits to be my wife that your mighty army is destroyed and that egypt is free by the hands of shabaka the egyptian and bes the dwarf  shabaka the egyptian he muttered whom i held and let go because of a dream and for policy so shabaka you will wed amada whom i desired because i could not take her and doubtless you will rule in egypt for pharaoh i think is as i am today o shabaka you are strong and a great warrior but there is something stronger than you in the worldthat which men call fate such success as yours offends the gods look on me shabaka look on the king of kings the ruler of the earth lying shamed in the dust before you and accursed shabaka do not call yourself happy until you see death as near as i do now  then he threw his arms wide and died    we called to soldiers to bear his body and having set the pursuit with that royal clay entered into amada in triumph it was not a very great town and the temple was its finest building and thither we wended in the outer court we found pharaoh lying at the point of death for from many wounds his life drained out with his flowing blood nor could the leeches help him  greeting shabaka he said you and the ethiopians have saved egypt my son is slain in the battle and i too am slain and who remains to rule her save you you and amada would that you had married her at once and never left my side but she was foolish and headstrong and iwas jealous of you shabaka forgive me and farewell  he spoke no more although he lived a little while  karema came from the inner court she greeted her husband then turned and said  lord shabaka one waits to welcome you  i rested myself upon her shoulder for i could not walk alone  what happened to the army of the karoon i asked as we went slowly  that happened lord which the holy tanofir foretold the easterns attacked across the swamp thinking to bear us down by numbers but the paths were too narrow and their columns were bogged in the mud still they struggled on against the arrows to its edge and there the ethiopians fell on them and being lighterfooted and without armour had the mastery of them who were encumbered by their very multitude oh i saw it all from the temple top bes did well and i am proud of him as i am proud of you  it is of the ethiopians that you should be proud karema since with one to five they have won a great battle  we came to the end of the second court where was a sanctuary  enter said karema and fell back  i did so and though the cedar door was left a little ajar at first could see nothing because of the gloom of the place by degrees my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness and i perceived an alabaster statue of the goddess isis of the size of life who held in her arms an ivory child also lifesize then i heard a sigh and looking down saw a woman clad in white kneeling at the feet of the statue lost in prayer suddenly she rose and turned and the ray of light from the door ajar fell upon her it was amada draped only in the transparent robe of a priestess and oh she was beautiful beyond imagining so beautiful that my heart stood still  she saw me in my battered mail and the blood flowed up to her breast and brow and in her eyes there came a light such as i had never known in them before the light that is lit only by the torch of womans love yes no longer were hers the eyes of a priestess they were the eyes of a woman who burns with mortal passion  amada i whispered amada found at last  shabaka she whispered back returned at last to me your home and she stretched out her arms toward me  but before i could take her into mine she uttered a little cry and shrank away  oh not here she said not here in the presence of this holy one who watches all that passes in heaven and earth  then perchance amada she has watched the freeing of egypt on yonder field today and knows for whose sake it was done  hearken shabaka i am your guerdon moreover as a woman i am yours there is naught i desire so much as to feel your kiss upon me for it and it alone i am ready to risk my spirits death and torment but for you i fear twice have i sworn myself to this goddess and she is very jealous of those who rob her of her votaries i fear that her curse will fall not only on me but on you also and not only for this life but for all lives that may be given to us for your own sake i pray you leave me i hear that pharaoh my uncle is dead or dying and doubtless they will offer you the throne take it shabaka for in it i ask no share take it and leave me to serve the goddess till my death  i too serve a goddess i answered hoarsely and she is named love and you are her priestess little i care for isis who serve the goddess love come kiss me here and now ere perchance i die kiss me who have waited long enough and so let us be wed  one moment she paused swaying in the wind of passion like a tall reed on the banks of nile and then ah then she sank upon my breast and pressed her lips against my own                                  and after  for a few moments i shabaka seemed to be lost in a kind of delirium and surrounded by a rosehued mist then i allan quatermain heard a sharp quick sound as of a clock striking and looked up it was a lock a beautiful old clock on a mantelpiece opposite to me and the hands showed that it had just struck the hour of ten  now i remembered that centuries ago as i was dropping asleep i did not know why i had seen that clock and those hands in the same position and known that it was striking the second stroke of ten oh what did it all mean had thousands of years gone by oronly eight seconds  there was a weight upon my shoulder i glanced round to see what it was and discovered the beautiful head of lady ragnall who was sweetly sleeping there lady ragnall and in that very strange dream which i had dreamed she was the priestess called amada look there was the mark of the new moon above her breast and not a second ago i had been in a shrine with amada dressed as lady ragnall was tonight in circumstances so intimate that it made me blush to think of them lady ragnall amadaamada lady ragnall a shrine a boudoir oh i must be going mad  i could not disturb her it would have beenwell unseemly so i shabaka or allan quatermain just sat still feeling curiously comfortable and tried to piece things together when suddenly amadai mean lady ragnall woke  i wonder she said without lifting her head from my shoulder what happened to the holy tanofir i think that i heard him outside the shine giving directions for the digging of pharaohs grave at that spot and saying that he must do so at once as his time was very short yes and i wished that he would go away oh my goodness she exclaimed and suddenly sprang up  i too rose and we stood facing each other  between us in front of the fire stood the tripod and the bowl of black stone at the bottom of which lay a pinch of white ashes the remains of the taduki we stared at it and at each other  oh where have we been shabai mean mr quatermain she gasped looking at me roundeyed  i dont know i answered confusedly to the east i suppose that isit was all a dream  a dream she said what nonsense tell me were you or were you not in a sanctuary just now with me before the statue of isis the same that fell on george two years ago and killed him and did you or did you not give me a necklace of wonderful rosy pearls which we put upon the neck of the statue as a peaceoffering because i had broken my vows to the goddessthose that you won from the great king  no i answered triumphantly i did nothing of the sort is it likely that i should have taken those priceless pearls into battle i gave them to karema to keep after my mother returned them to me on her deathbed i remember it distinctly  yes and karema handed them to me again as your lovetoken when she appeared in the city with the holy tanofir and what was more welcome at the momentsomething to eat for we were near starving you know well i threw them over your neck and my own in the shrine to be the symbol of our eternal union but afterwards we thought that it might be wise to offer them to the goddessto appease her you know oh how dared we plight our mortal troth there in her very shrine and presence and i her twicesworn servant it was insult heaped on sacrilege  at a guess because love is stronger than fear i replied but it seems that you dreamed a little longer than i did so perhaps you can tell me what happened afterwards i only got as far aswell i forget how far i got i added for at that moment full memory returned and i could not go on  she blushed to her eyes and grew disturbed  it is all mixed up in my mind too she exclaimed i can only remember something rather absurdand affectionate you know what strange things dreams are  i thought you said it wasnt a dream  really i dont know what it was butyour wound doesnt hurt you does it you were bleeding a good deal it stained me here and she touched her breast and looked down wonderingly at her sacred ancient robe as though she expected to see that it was red  as there is no stain now it must have been a dream but my word that was a battle i answered  yes i watched it from the pylon top and oh it was glorious do you remember the charge of the ethiopians against the immortals why of course you must as you led it and then the fall of pharaoh peroahe was george you know and the death of the great king killed by your black bow you were a wonderful shot even then you see and the burning of the ships how they blazed anda hundred other things  yes i said it came off the holy tanofir was a good strategistor his cup was i dont know which  and you were a good general and so for the matter of that was bes oh what agonies i went through while the fight hung doubtful my heart was on fire yes i seemed to burn for and she stopped  for whom i asked  for egypt of course and when reflected in the alabaster i saw you enter that shrine where you remember i was praying for your successand safety i nearly died of joy for you know i had been well attached to youto shabaka i meanall the timethats my part of the story which i daresay you did not see although i seemed so cold and wayward i could love yes in that life i knew how to love and shabaka looked oh a hero with his rent mail and the glory of triumph in his eyes he was very handsome too in his way but what nonsense i am talking  yes great nonsense still i wish we were sure how it ended it is a pity that you forget for i am crazed with curiosity i suppose there is no more taduki is there  not a scrap she answered firmly and if there were it would be fatal to take it twice on the same day we have learned all there is to learn perhaps it is as well though i should like to know what happened after ourour marriage  so we were married were we  i mean she went on ignoring my remark whether you ruled long in egypt for you or rather shabaka did rule also whether the easterns returned and drove us out or what you see the ivory child went away somehow for we found it again in kendah land only a few years ago  perhaps we retired to ethiopia i suggested and the worship of the child continued in some part of that country after the ethiopian kingdom passed away  perhaps only i dont think karema would ever have gone back to ethiopia unless she was obliged you remember how she hated the place no not even to see those black children of hers well as we can never tell it is no use speculating  i thought there was more taduki i remarked sadly i am sure i saw some in the coffer  not one bit she answered still more firmly than before and stretching out her hand she shut down the lid of the coffer before i could look into it it may be best so for as it stands the story had a happy ending and i dont want to learn oh i dont want to learn how the curse of isis fell on you and me  so you believe in that  yes i do she answered with passion and what is more i believe it is working still which perhaps is why we have all come down in the world you and i and george and hans yes and even old harût whom we knew in kendah land who i think was the holy tanofir for as surely as i live i know beyond possibility of doubt that whatever we may be called today you were the general shabaka and i was the priestess amada royal lady of egypt and between us and about us the curse of isis wavers like a sword that is why george was killed and that is whybut i feel very tired i think i had better go to bed   as i recall that i have explained i was obliged to leave ragnall castle early the next morning to keep a shooting engagement o heavens to keep a shooting engagement   but whatever amada i mean lady ragnall said there was plenty more taduki as i have good reason to know   allan quatermain
