85213664	a desert drama  being  the tragedy of the korosko  by  a conan doyle  with thirtytwo fullpage illustrations by s paget  philadelphia  j b lippincott company 1898   illustration frontispiece p78  illustration titlepage   to my friend james payn in token of my affection and esteem     preface  this book has been materially enlarged and altered since its appearance in serial form  a conan doyle  october 17 1897     a desert drama     chapter i  the public may possibly wonder why it is that they have never heard in the papers of the fate of the passengers of the korosko in these days of universal press agencies responsive to the slightest stimulus it may well seem incredible that an international incident of such importance should remain so long unchronicled suffice it that there were very valid reasons both of a personal and political nature for holding it back the facts were well known to a good number of people at the time and some version of them did actually appear in a provincial paper but was generally discredited they have now been thrown into narrative form the incidents having been collated from the sworn statements of colonel cochrane cochrane of the army and navy club and from the letters of miss adams of boston mass these have been supplemented by the evidence of captain archer of the egyptian camel corps as given before the secret government inquiry at cairo mr james stephens has refused to put his version of the matter into writing but as these proofs have been submitted to him and no correction or deletion has been made in them it may be supposed that he has not succeeded in detecting any grave misstatement of fact and that any objection which he may have to their publication depends rather upon private and personal scruples  the korosko a

florence   this was the party as it started from shellal with the intention of travelling up the two hundred miles of nubian nile which lie between the first and the second cataract  it is a singular country this nubia varying in breadth from a few miles to as many yards for the name is only applied to the narrow portion which is capable of cultivation it extends in a thin green palmfringed strip upon either side of the broad coffeecoloured river beyond it there stretches on the libyan bank a savage and illimitable desert extending to the whole breadth of africa on the other side an equally desolate wilderness is bounded only by the distant red sea between these two huge and barren expanses nubia writhes like a green sandworm along the course of the river here and there it disappears altogether and the nile runs between black and suncracked hills with the orange driftsand lying like glaciers in their valleys everywhere one sees traces of vanished races and submerged civilisations grotesque graves dot the hills or stand up against the skyline pyramidal graves tumulus graves rock graveseverywhere graves and occasionally as the boat rounds a rocky point one sees a deserted city up abovehouses walls battlements with the sun shining through the empty window squares sometimes you learn that it has been roman sometimes egyptian sometimes all record of its name or origin has been absolutely lost you ask yourself in amazement why any race should build in so uncouth a solitude and you find it difficult to accept the theory that this has only been of value as a guardhouse to the richer country down below and that these frequent cities have been so many fortresses to hold off the wild and predatory men of the south but whatever be their explanation be it a fierce neighbour or be it a climatic change there they stand these grim and silent cities and up on the hills you can see the graves of their people like the portholes of a manofwar it is through this weird dead country that the tourists smoke and gossip and flirt as they pass up to the egyptian frontier  the passengers of the korosko formed a merry party for most of them had travelled up together from cairo to assouan and even anglosaxon ice thaws rapidly upon the nile they were fortunate in being without the single disagreeable person who in these small boats is sufficient to mar the enjoyment of the whole party on a vessel which is little more than a large steam launch the bore the cynic or the grumbler holds the company at his mercy but the korosko was free from anything of the kind colonel cochrane cochrane was one of those officers whom the british government acting upon a large system of averages declares at a certain age to be incapable of further service and who demonstrate the worth of such a system by spending their declining years in exploring morocco or shooting lions in somaliland he was a dark straight aquiline man with a courteously deferential manner but a steady questioning eye very neat in his dress and precise in his habits a gentleman to the tips of his trim fingernails in his anglosaxon dislike to effusiveness he had cultivated a selfcontained manner which was apt at first acquaintance to be repellant and he seemed to those who really knew him to be at some pains to conceal the kind heart and human emotions which influenced his actions it was respect rather than affection which he inspired among his fellowtravellers for they felt like all who had ever met him that he was a man with whom acquaintance was unlikely to ripen into a friendship though a friendship when once attained would be an unchanging and inseparable part of himself he wore a grizzled military moustache but his hair was singularly black for a man of his years he made no allusion in his conversation to the numerous campaigns in which he had distinguished himself and the reason usually given for his reticence was that they dated back to such early victorian days that he had to sacrifice his military glory at the shrine of his perennial youth  mr cecil brownto take the names in the chance order in which they appear upon the passenger listwas a young diplomatist from a continental embassy a man slightly tainted with the oxford manner and erring upon the side of unnatural and inhuman refinement but full of interesting talk and cultured thought he had a sad handsome face a small waxtipped moustache a low voice and a listless manner which was relieved by a charming habit of suddenly lighting up into a rapid smile and gleam when anything caught his fancy an acquired cynicism was eternally crushing and overlying his natural youthful enthusiasms and he ignored what was obvious while expressing keen appreciation for what seemed to the average man to be either trivial or unhealthy he chose walter pater for his travelling author and sat all day reserved but affable under the awning with his novel and his sketchbook upon a campstool beside him his personal dignity prevented him from making advances to others but if they chose to address him they found him a courteous and amiable companion  the americans formed a group by themselves john h headingly was a new englander a graduate of harvard who was completing his education by a tour round the world he stood for the best type of young americanquick observant serious eager for knowledge and fairly free from prejudice with a fine ballast of unsectarian but earnest religious feeling which held him steady amid all the sudden gusts of youth he had less of the appearance and more of the reality of culture than the young oxford diplomatist for he had keener emotions though less exact knowledge miss adams and miss sadie adams were aunt and niece the former a little energetic hardfeatured bostonian oldmaid with a huge surplus of unused love behind her stern and swarthy features she had never been from home before and she was now busy upon the selfimposed task of bringing the east up to the standard of massachusetts she had hardly landed in egypt before she realised that the country needed putting to rights and since the conviction struck her she had been very fully occupied the saddlegalled donkeys the starved pariah dogs the flies round the eyes of the babies the naked children the importunate begging the ragged untidy womenthey were all challenges to her conscience and she plunged in bravely at her work of reformation as she could not speak a word of the language however and was unable to make any of the delinquents understand what it was that she wanted her passage up the nile left the immemorial east very much as she had found it but afforded a good deal of sympathetic amusement to her fellowtravellers no one enjoyed her efforts more than her niece sadie who shared with mrs belmont the distinction of being the most popular person upon the boat she was very youngfresh from smith collegeand she still possessed many both of the virtues and of the faults of a child she had the frankness the trusting confidence the innocent straightforwardness the high spirits and also the loquacity and the want of reverence but even her faults caused amusement and if she had preserved many of the characteristics of a clever child she was none the less a tall and handsome woman who looked older than her years on account of that low curve of the hair over the ears and that fulness of bodice and skirt which mr gibson has either initiated or imitated the whisk of those skirts and the frank incisive voice and pleasant catching laugh were familiar and welcome sounds on board of the korosko even the rigid colonel softened into geniality and the oxfordbred diplomatist forgot to be unnatural with miss sadie adams as a companion  the other passengers may be dismissed more briefly some were interesting some neutral and all amiable monsieur fardet was a goodnatured but argumentative frenchman who held the most decided views as to the deep machinations of great britain and the illegality of her position in egypt mr belmont was an irongrey sturdy irishman famous as an astonishingly good longrange rifleshot who had carried off nearly every prize which wimbledon or bisley had to offer with him was his wife a very charming and refined woman full of the pleasant playfulness of her country mrs shiesinger was a middleaged widow quiet and soothing with her thoughts all taken up by her sixyearold child as a mothers thoughts are likely to be in a boat which has an open rail for a bulwark the reverend john stuart was a nonconformist minister from birminghameither a presbyterian or a congregationalista man of immense stoutness slow and torpid in his ways but blessed with a considerable fond of homely humour which made him i am told a very favourite preacher and an effective speaker from advanced radical platforms  finally there was mr james stephens a manchester solicitor junior partner of hickson ward and stephens who was travelling to shake off the effects of an attack of influenza stephens was a man who in the course of thirty years had worked himself up from cleaning the firms windows to managing its business for most of that long time he had been absolutely immersed in dry technical work living with the one idea of satisfying old clients and attracting new ones until his mind and soul had become as formal and precise as the laws which he expounded a fine and sensitive nature was in danger of being as warped as a busy city mans is liable to become his work had become an engrained habit and being a bachelor he had hardly an interest in life to draw him away from it so that his soul was being gradually bricked up like the body of a mediæval nun but at last there came this kindly illness and nature hustled james stephens out of his groove and sent him into the broad world far away from roaring manchester and his shelves full of calfskin authorities at first he resented it deeply everything seemed trivial to him compared to his own petty routine but gradually his eyes were opened and he began dimly to see that it was his work which was trivial when compared to this wonderful varied inexplicable world of which he was so ignorant vaguely he realised that the interruption to his career might be more important than the career itself all sorts of new interests took possession of him and the middleaged lawyer developed an afterglow of that youth which had been wasted among his books his character was too formed to admit of his being anything but dry and precise in his ways and a trifle pedantic in his mode of speech but he read and thought and observed scoring his baedeker with underlinings and annotations as he had once done his prideauxs commentaries he had travelled up from cairo with the party and had contracted a friendship with miss adams and her niece the young american girl with her chatter her audacity and her constant flow of high spirits amused and interested him and she in turn felt a mixture of respect and of pity for his knowledge and his limitations so they became good friends and people smiled to see his clouded face and her sunny one bending over the same guidebook  the little korosko puffed and spluttered her way up the river kicking up the white water behind her and making more noise and fuss over her five knots an hour than an atlantic liner on a record voyage on deck under the thick awning sat her little family of passengers and every few hours she eased down and sidled up to the bank to allow them to visit one more of that innumerable succession of temples the remains however grow more modern as one ascends from cairo and travellers who have sated themselves at gizeh and sakara with the contemplation of the very oldest buildings which the hands of man have constructed become impatient of temples which are hardly older than the christian era ruins which would be gazed upon with wonder and veneration in any other country are hardly noticed in egypt the tourists viewed with languid interest the halfgreek art of the nubian basreliefs they climbed the hill of korosko to see the sun rise over the savage eastern desert they were moved to wonder by the great shrine of abousimbel where some old race has hollowed out a mountain as if it were a cheese and finally upon the evening of the fourth day of their travels they arrived at wady haifa the frontier garrison town some few hours after they were due on account of a small mishap in the engineroom the next morning was to be devoted to an expedition to the famous rock of abousir from which a great view may be obtained of the second cataract at eightthirty as the passengers sat on deck after dinner mansoor the dragoman half copt half syrian came forward according to the nightly custom to announce the programme for the morrow  ladies and gentlemen said he plunging boldly into the rapid but broken stream of his english tomorrow you will remember not to forget to rise when the gong strikes you for to compress the journey before twelve oclock having arrived at the place where the donkeys expect us we shall ride five miles over the desert passing a very fine temple of ammonra which dates itself from the eighteenth dynasty upon the way and so reach the celebrated pulpit rock of abousir the pulpit rock is supposed to have been called so because it is a rock like a pulpit when you have reached it you will know that you are on the very edge of civilisation and that very little more will take you into the country of the dervishes which will be obvious to you at the top having passed the summit you will perceive the full extremity of the second cataract embracing wild natural beauties of the most dreadful variety here all very famous people carve their namesand so you will carve your names also  illustration so you will carve your names also p26  mansoor waited expectantly for a titter and bowed to it when it arrived you will then return to wady haifa and there remain two hours to suspect sp the camel corps including the grooming of the beasts and the bazaar before returning so i wish you a very happy goodnight there was a gleam of his white teeth in the lamplight and then his long dark petticoats his short english covercoat and his red tarboosh vanished successively down the ladder the low buzz of conversation which had been suspended by his coming broke out anew  im relying on you mr stephens to tell me all about abousir said miss sadie adams i do like to know what i am looking at right there at the time and not six hours afterwards in my stateroom i havent got abousimbel and the wall pictures straight in my mind yet though i saw them yesterday  i never hope to keep up with it said her aunt when i am safe back in commonwealth avenue and theres no dragoman to hustle me around ill have time to read about it all and then i expect i shall begin to enthuse and want to come right back again but its just too good of you mr stephens to try and keep us informed  i thought that you might wish precise information and so i prepared a small digest of the matter said stephens handing a slip of paper to miss sadie she looked at it in the light of the deck lamp and broke into her low hearty laugh  re abousir she read now what do you mean by re mr stephens you put re rameses the second on the last paper you gave me  it is a habit i have acquired miss sadie said stephens it is the custom in the legal profession when they make a memo  make what mr stephens  a memo a memorandum you know we put re soandso to show what it is about  i suppose its a good short way said miss sadie but it feels queer somehow when applied to scenery or to dead egyptian kings re cheopsdoesnt that strike you as funny  no i cant say that it does said stephens  i wonder if it is true that the english have less humour than the americans or whether its just another kind of humour said the girl she had a quiet abstracted way of talking as if she were thinking aloud i used to imagine they had less and yet when you come to think of it dickens and thackeray and barrie and so many other of the humourists we admire most are britishers besides i never in all my days heard people laugh so hard as in that london theatre there was a man behind us and every time he laughed auntie looked round to see if a door had opened he made such a draught but you have some funny expressions mr stephens  what else strikes you as funny miss sadie  well when you sent me the temple ticket and the little map you began your letter enclosed please find and then at the bottom in brackets you had 2 enclo  that is the usual form in business  yes in business said sadie demurely and there was a silence  theres one thing i wish remarked miss adams in the hard metallic voice with which she disguised her softness of heart and that is that i could see the legislature of this country and lay a few colddrawn facts in front of them id make a platform of my own mr stephens and run a party on my ticket a bill for the compulsory use of eyewash would be one of my planks and another would be for the abolition of those yashmak veil things which turn a woman into a bale of cotton goods with a pair of eyes looking out of it  i never could think why they wore them said sadie until one day i saw one with her veil lifted then i knew  they make me tired those women cried miss adams wrathfully one might as well try to preach duty and decency and cleanliness to a line of bolsters why good land it was only yesterday at abousimbel mr stephens i was passing one of their housesif you can call a mudpie like that a houseand i saw two of the children at the door with the usual crust of flies round their eyes and great holes in their poor little blue gowns so i got off my donkey and i turned up my sleeves and i washed their faces well with my handkerchief and sewed up the rentsfor in this country i would as soon think of going ashore without my needlecase as without my white umbrella mr stephens then as i warmed on the job i got into the roomsuch a roomand i packed the folks out of it and i fairly did the chores as if i had been the hired help ive seen no more of that temple of abousimbel than if i had never left boston but my sakes i saw more dust and mess than you would think they could crowd into a house the size of a newport bathinghut from the time i pinned up my skirt until i came out with my face the colour of that smokestack wasnt more than an hour or maybe an hour and a half but i had that house as clean and fresh as a new pinewood box i had a new york herald with me and i lined their shelf with paper for them well mr stephens when i had done washing my hands outside i came past the door again and there were those two children sitting on the stoop with their eyes full of flies and all just the same as ever except that each had a little paper cap made out of the new york herald upon his head but say sadie its going on to ten oclock and tomorrow an early excursion  its just too beautiful this purple sky and the great silver stars said sadie look at the silent desert and the black shadows of the hills its grand but its terrible too and then when you think that we really are as that dragoman said just now on the very end of civilisation and with nothing but savagery and bloodshed down there where the southern cross is twinkling so prettily why its like standing on the beautiful edge of a live volcano  shucks sadie dont talk like that child said the older woman nervously its enough to scare any one to listen to you  well but dont you feel it yourself auntie look at that great desert stretching away and away until it is lost in the shadows hear the sad whisper of the wind across it its just the most solemn thing that ever i saw in my life  im glad weve found something that will make you solemn my dear said her aunt ive sometimes thought sakes alive whats that  from somewhere amongst the hill shadows upon the other side of the river there had risen a high shrill whimpering rising and swelling to end in a long weary wail  its only a jackal miss adams said stephens i heard one when we went out to see the sphinx by moonlight  but the american lady had risen and her face showed that her nerves had been ruffled  if i had my time over again i wouldnt have come past assouan said she i cant think what possessed me to bring you all the way up here sadie your mother will think that i am clean crazy and id never dare to look her in the eye if anything went wrong with us ive seen all i want to see of this river and all i ask now is to be back at cairo again  why auntie cried the girl it isnt like you to be fainthearted  well i dont know how it is sadie but i feel a bit unstrung and that beast caterwauling over yonder was just more than i could put up with theres one consolation we are scheduled to be on our way home tomorrow after weve seen this one rock or temple or whatever it is im full up of rocks and temples mr stephens i shouldnt mope if i never saw another come sadie goodnight  goodnight goodnight miss adams and the two ladies passed down to their cabins  monsieur fardet was chatting in a subdued voice with headingly the young harvard graduate bending forward confidentially between the whiffs of his cigarette  dervishes mister headingly said he speaking excellent english but separating his syllables as a frenchman will there are no dervishes they do not exist  why i thought the woods were full of them said the american  monsieur fardet glanced across to where the red core of colonel cochranes cigar was glowing through the darkness  you are an american and you do not like the english he whispered it is perfectly comprehended upon the continent that the americans are opposed to the english  well said headingly with his slow deliberate manner i wont say that we have not our tiffs and there are some of our peoplemostly of irish stockwho are always mad with england but the most of us have a kindly thought for the mother country you see they may be aggravating folk sometimes but after all they are our own folk and we cant wipe that off the slate  eh bien said the frenchman at least i can say to you what i could not without offence say to these others and i repeat that there are no dervishes they were an invention of lord cromer in the year 1885  you dont say cried headingly  it is well known in paris and has been exposed in la patrie and other of our so wellinformed papers  but this is colossal said headingly  do you mean to tell me monsieur fardet that the siege of khartoum and the death of gordon and the rest of it was just one great bluff  i will not deny that there was an emeute but it was local you understand and now long forgotten since then there has been profound peace in the soudan  but i have heard of raids monsieur fardet and ive read of battles too when the arabs tried to invade egypt it was only two days ago that we passed toski where the dragoman said there had been a fight is that all bluff also  pah my friend you do not know the english you look at them as you see them with their pipes and their contented faces and you say now these are good simple folk who will never hurt any one but all the time they are thinking and watching and planning here is egypt weak they cry allons and down they swoop like a gull upon a crust you have no right there says the world come out of it but england has already begun to tidy everything just like the good miss adams when she forces her way into the house of an arab come out says the world certainly says england just wait one little minute until i have made everything nice and proper so the world waits for a year or so and then it says once again come out just wait a little says england there is trouble at khartoum and when i have set that all right i shall be very glad to come out so they wait until it is all over and then again they say come out how can i come out says england when there are still raids and battles going on if we were to leave egypt would be run over but there are no raids says the world oh are there not says england and then within a week sure enough the papers are full of some new raid of dervishes we are not all blind mister headingly we understand very well how such things can be done a few bedouins a little backsheesh some blank cartridges and beholda raid  well well said the american im glad to know the rights of this business for it has often puzzled me but what does england get out of it  she gets the country monsieur  i see you mean for example that there is a favourable tariff for british goods  no monsieur it is the same for all  well then she gives the contracts to britishers  precisely monsieur  for example the railroad that they are building right through the country the one that runs alongside the river that would be a valuable contract for the british  monsieur fardet was an honest man if an imaginative one  it is a french company monsieur which holds the railway contract said he  the american was puzzled  they dont seem to get much for their trouble said he still of course there must be some indirect pull somewhere for example egypt no doubt has to pay and keep all those redcoats in cairo  egypt monsieur no they are paid by england  well i suppose they know their own business best but they seem to me to take a great deal of trouble and to get mighty little in exchange if they dont mind keeping order and guarding the frontier with a constant war against the dervishes on their hands i dont know why any one should object i suppose no one denies that the prosperity of the country has increased enormously since they came the revenue returns show that they tell me also that the poorer folks have justice which they never had before  what are they doing here at all cried the frenchman angrily let them go back to their island we cannot have them all over the world  well certainly to us americans who live all in our own land it does seem strange how you european nations are for ever slopping over into some other country which was not meant for you its easy for us to talk of course for we have still got room and to spare for all our people when we start pushing each other over the edge we shall have to start annexing also but at present just here in north africa there is italy in abyssinia and england in egypt and france in algiers  france cried monsieur fardet algiers belongs to france you laugh monsieur i have the honour to wish you a very goodnight he rose from his seat and walked off rigid with outraged patriotism to his cabin     chapter ii  the young american hesitated for a little debating in his mind whether he should not go down and post up the daily record of his impressions which he kept for his homestaying sister but the cigars of colonel cochrane and of cecil brown were still twinkling in the far corner of the deck and the student was acquisitive in the search of information he did not quite know how to lead up to the matter but the colonel very soon did it for him  come on headingly said he pushing a campstool in his direction this is the place for an antidote i see that fardet has been pouring politics into your ear  i can always recognise the confidential stoop of his shoulders when he discusses la haute politique said the dandy diplomatist but what a sacrilege upon a night like this what a nocturne in blue and silver might be suggested by that moon rising above the desert there is a movement in one of mendelssohns songs which seems to embody it alla sense of vastness of repetition the cry of the wind over an interminable expanse the subtler emotions which cannot be translated into words are still to be hinted at by chords and harmonies  it seems wilder and more savage than ever tonight remarked the american it gives me the same feeling of pitiless force that the atlantic does upon a cold dark winter day perhaps it is the knowledge that we are right there on the very edge of any kind of law and order how far do you suppose that we are from any dervishes colonel cochrane  well on the arabian side said the colonel we have the egyptian fortified camp of sarras about forty miles to the south of us beyond that are sixty miles of very wild country before you would come to the dervish post at akasheh on this other side however there is nothing between us and them  abousir is on this side is it not  yes that is why the excursion to the abousir rock has been forbidden for the last year but things are quieter now  what is to prevent them from coming down on that side  absolutely nothing said cecil brown in his listless voice  nothing except their fears the coming of course would be absolutely simple the difficulty would lie in the return they might find it hard to get back if their camels were spent and the haifa garrison with their beasts fresh got on their track they know it as well as we do and it has kept them from trying  it isnt safe to reckon upon a dervishs fears remarked brown we must always bear in mind that they are not amenable to the same motives as other people many of them are anxious to meet death and all of them are absolute uncompromising believers in destiny they exist as a reductio ad absurdum of all bigotrya proof of how surely it leads towards blank barbarism  you think these people are a real menace to egypt asked the american there seems from what i have heard to be some difference of opinion about it monsieur fardet for example does not seem to think that the danger is a very pressing one  i am not a rich man colonel cochrane answered after a little pause but i am prepared to lay all i am worth that within three years of the british officers being withdrawn the dervishes would be upon the mediterranean where would the civilisation of egypt be where would the hundreds of millions be which have been invested in this country where the monuments which all nations look upon as most precious memorials of the past  come now colonel cried headingly laughing surely you dont mean that they would shift the pyramids  you cannot foretell what they would do there is no iconoclast in the world like an extreme mohammedan last time they overran this country they burned the alexandrian library you know that all representations of the human features are against the letter of the koran a statue is always an irreligious object in their eyes what do these fellows care for the sentiment of europe the more they could offend it the more delighted they would be down would go the sphinx the colossi the statues of abousimbelas the saints went down in england before cromwells troopers  well now said headingly in his slow thoughtful fashion suppose i grant you that the dervishes could overrun egypt and suppose also that you english are holding them out what im never done asking is what reason have you for spending all these millions of dollars and the lives of so many of your men what do you get out of it more than france gets or germany or any other country that runs no risk and never lays out a cent  there are a good many englishmen who are asking themselves that question remarked cecil brown its my opinion that we have been the policemen of the world long enough we policed the seas for pirates and slavers now we police the land for dervishes and brigands and every sort of danger to civilisation there is never a mad priest or a witch doctor or a firebrand of any sort on this planet who does not report his appearance by sniping the nearest british officer one tires of it at last if a kurd breaks loose in asia minor the world wants to know why great britain does not keep him in order if there is a military mutiny in egypt or a jehad in the soudan it is still great britain who has to set it right and all to an accompaniment of curses such as the policeman gets when he seizes a ruffian among his pals we get hard knocks and no thanks and why should we do it let europe do its own dirty work  well said colonel cochrane crossing his legs and leaning forward with the decision of a man who has definite opinions i dont at all agree with you brown and i think that to advocate such a course is to take a very limited view of our national duties i think that behind national interests and diplomacy and all that there lies a great guiding forcea providence in factwhich is for ever getting the best out of each nation and using it for the good of the whole when a nation ceases to respond it is time that she went into hospital for a few centuries like spain or greecethe virtue has gone out of her a man or a nation is not here upon this earth merely to do what is pleasant and profitable it is often called upon to carry out what is unpleasant and unprofitable but if it is obviously right it is mere shirking not to undertake it  headingly nodded approvingly  each has its own mission germany is predominant in abstract thought france in literature art and grace but we and youfor the englishspeakers are all in the same boat however much the new york sun may scream over itwe and you have among our best men a higher conception of moral sense and public duty than is to be found in any other people now these are the two qualities which are needed for directing a weaker race you cant help them by abstract thought or by graceful art but only by that moral sense which will hold the scales of justice even and keep itself free from every taint of corruption that is how we rule india we came there by a kind of natural law like air rushing into a vacuum all over the world against our direct interests and our deliberate intentions we are drawn into the same thing and it will happen to you also the pressure of destiny will force you to administer the whole of america from mexico to the horn  headingly whistled  our jingoes would be pleased to hear you colonel cochrane said he theyd vote you into our senate and make you one of the committee on foreign relations  the world is small and it grows smaller every day its a single organic body and one spot of gangrene is enough to vitiate the whole theres no room upon it for dishonest defaulting tyrannical irresponsible governments as long as they exist they will always be centres of trouble and of danger but there are many races which appear to be so incapable of improvement that we can never hope to get a good government out of them what is to be done then the former device of providence in such a case was extermination by some more virile stock an attila or a tamerlane pruned off the weaker branch now we have a more merciful substitution of rulers or even of mere advice from a more advanced race that is the case with the central asian khanates and with the protected states of india if the work has to be done and if we are the best fitted for the work then i think that it would be a cowardice and a crime to shirk it  but who is to decide whether it is a fitting case for your interference objected the american a predatory country could grab every other land in the world upon such a pretext  eventsinexorable inevitable eventswill decide it take this egyptian business as an example in 1881 there was nothing in this world further from the minds of our people than any interference with egypt and yet 1882 left us in possession of the country there was never any choice in the chain of events a massacre in the streets of alexandria and the mounting of guns to drive out our fleetwhich was there you understand in fulfilment of solemn treaty obligationsled to the bombardment the bombardment led to a landing to save the city from destruction the landing caused an extension of operationsand here we are with the country upon our hands at the time of trouble we begged and implored the french or any one else to come and help us to set the thing to rights but they all deserted us when there was work to be done though they are ready enough to scold and to impede us now when we tried to get out of it up came this wild dervish movement and we had to sit tighter than ever we never wanted the task but now that it has come we must put it through in a workmanlike manner weve brought justice into the country and purity of administration and protection for the poor man it has made more advance in the last twelve years than since the moslem invasion in the seventh century except the pay of a couple of hundred men who spend their money in the country england has neither directly nor indirectly made a shilling out of it and i dont believe you will find in history a more successful and more disinterested bit of work  headingly puffed thoughtfully at his cigarette  there is a house near ours down on the back bay at boston which just ruins the whole prospect said he it has old chairs littered about the stoop and the shingles are loose and the garden runs wild but i dont know that the neighbours are exactly justified in rushing in and stamping around and running the thing on their own lines  not if it were on fire asked the colonel  headingly laughed and rose from his campstool  well it doesnt come within the provisions of the monroe doctrine colonel said he im beginning to think that modern egypt is every bit as interesting as ancient and that rameses the second wasnt the last live man in the country  the two englishmen rose and yawned  yes its a whimsical freak of fortune which has sent men from a little island in the atlantic to administer the land of the pharaohs we shall pass away and never leave a trace among the successive races who have held the country for it is an anglosaxon custom to write their deeds upon rocks i dare say that the remains of a cairo drainage system will be our most permanent record unless they prove a thousand years hence that it was the work of the hyksos kings remarked cecil brown but here is the shore party come back  down below they could hear the mellow irish accents of mrs belmont and the deep voice of her husband the irongrey rifleshot mr stuart the fat birmingham clergyman was thrashing out a question of piastres with a noisy donkeyboy and the others were joining in with chaff and advice then the hubbub died away the party from above came down the ladder there were goodnights the shutting of doors and the little steamer lay silent dark and motionless in the shadow of the high haifa bank and beyond this one point of civilisation and of comfort there lay the limitless savage unchangeable desert strawcoloured and dreamlike in the moonlight mottled over with the black shadows of the hills     chapter iii  stoppa backa cried the native pilot to the european engineer  the bluff bows of the sternwheeler had squelched into the soft brown mud and the current had swept the boat alongside the bank the long gangway was thrown across and the six tall soldiers of the soudanese escort filed along it their lightblue goldtrimmed zouave uniforms and their jaunty yellow and red forage caps showing up bravely in the clear morning light  illustration the soudanese escort filed along p54  above them on the top of the bank was ranged the line of donkeys and the air was full of the clamour of the boys in shrill strident voices each was crying out the virtues of his own beast and abusing that of his neighbour  colonel cochrane and mr belmont stood together in the bows each wearing the broad white puggareed hat of the tourist miss adams and her niece leaned against the rail beside them  sorry your wife isnt coming belmont said the colonel  i think she had a touch of the sun yesterday her head aches very badly  his voice was strong and thick like his figure  i should stay to keep her company mr belmont said the little american old maid but i learn that mrs shlesinger finds the ride too long for her and has some letters which she must mail today so mrs belmont will not be lonesome  youre very good miss adams we shall be back you know by two oclock  is that certain  it must be certain for we are taking no lunch with us and we shall be famished by then  yes i expect we shall be ready for a hock and seltzer at any rate said the colonel this desert dust gives a flavour to the worst wine  now ladies and gentlemen cried mansoor the dragoman moving forward with something of the priest in his flowing garments and smooth cleanshaven face we must start early that we may return before the meridial heat of the weather he ran his dark eyes over the little group of his tourists with a paternal expression you take your green glasses miss adams for glare very great out in the desert ah mr stuart i set aside very fine donkey for youprize donkey sir always put aside for the gentleman of most weight never mind to take your monument ticket today now ladies and gentlemen if you please  like a grotesque frieze the party moved one by one along the plank gangway and up the brown crumbling bank mr stephens led them a thin dry serious figure in an english straw hat his red baedeker gleamed under his arm and in one hand he held a little paper of notes as if it were a brief he took miss sadie by one arm and her aunt by the other as they toiled up the bank and the young girls laughter rang frank and clear in the morning air as baedeker came fluttering down at their feet mr belmont and colonel cochrane followed the brims of their sunhats touching as they discussed the relative advantages of the mauser the lebel and the leemetford behind them walked cecil brown listless cynical selfcontained the fat clergyman puffed slowly up the bank with many gasping witticisms at his own defects im one of those men who carry everything before them said he glancing ruefully at his rotundity and chuckling wheezily at his own little joke last of all came headingly slight and tall with the student stoop about his shoulders and fardet the goodnatured fussy argumentative parisian  you see we have an escort today he whispered to his companion  so i observed  pah cried the frenchman throwing out his arms in derision as well have an escort from paris to versailles this is all part of the play monsieur headingly it deceives no one but it is part of the play  pourquoi ces drôles de militaires dragoman hein  it was the dragomans rôle to be all things to all men so he looked cautiously round before he answered to make sure that the english were mounted and out of earshot  cest ridicule monsieur said he shrugging his fat shoulders mais que voulezvous cest lordre officiel egyptien  egyptien pah anglais anglaistoujours anglais cried the angry frenchman  the frieze now was more grotesque than ever but had changed suddenly to an equestrian one sharply outlined against the deepblue egyptian sky those who have never ridden before have to ride in egypt and when the donkeys break into a canter and the nile irregulars are at full charge such a scene of flying veils clutching hands huddled swaying figures and anxious faces is nowhere to be seen belmont his square figure balanced upon a small white donkey was waving his hat to his wife who had come out upon the saloondeck of the korosko cochrane sat very erect with a stiff military seat hands low head high and heels down while beside him rode the young oxford man looking about him with drooping eyelids as if he thought the desert hardly respectable and had his doubts about the universe behind them the whole party was strung along the bank in varying stages of jolting and discomfort a brownfaced noisy donkeyboy running after each donkey looking back they could see the little leadcoloured sternwheeler with the gleam of mrs belmonts handkerchief from the deck beyond ran the broad brown river winding down in long curves to where five miles off the square white blockhouses upon the black ragged hills marked the outskirts of wady haifa which had been their startingpoint that morning  isnt it just too lovely for anything cried sadie joyously ive got a donkey that runs on casters and the saddle is just elegant did you ever see anything so cunning as these beads and things round his neck you must make a memo re donkey mr stephens isnt that correct legal english  stephens looked at the pretty animated boyish face looking up at him from under the coquettish straw hat and he wished that he had the courage to tell her in her own language that she was just too sweet for anything but he feared above all things lest he should offend her and so put an end to their present pleasant intimacy so his compliment dwindled into a smile  you look very happy said he  well who could help feeling good with this dry clear air and the blue sky and the crisp yellow sand and a superb donkey to carry you ive just got everything in the world to make me happy  everything  well everything that i have any use for just now  i suppose you never know what it is to be sad  oh when i am miserable i am just too miserable for words ive sat and cried for days and days at smiths college and the other girls were just crazy to know what i was crying about and guessing what the reason was that i wouldnt tell when all the time the real true reason was that i didnt know myself you know how it comes like a great dark shadow over you and you dont know why or wherefore but youve just got to settle down to it and be miserable  but you never had any real cause  no mr stephens ive had such a good time all my life that i dont think when i look back that i ever had any real cause for sorrow  well miss sadie i hope with all my heart that you will be able to say the same when you are the same age as your aunt surely i hear her calling  i wish mr stephens you would strike my donkeyboy with your whip if he hits the donkey again cried miss adams jogging up on a high rawboned beast hi dragoman mansoor you tell this boy that i wont have the animals ill used and that he ought to be ashamed of himself yes you little rascal you ought hes grinning at me like an advertisement for a tooth paste do you think mr stephens that if i were to knit that black soldier a pair of woollen stockings he would be allowed to wear them the poor creature has bandages round his legs  those are his putties miss adams said colonel cochrane looking back at her we have found in india that they are the best support to the leg in marching they are very much better than any stocking  well you dont say they remind me mostly of a sick horse but its elegant to have the soldiers with us though monsieur fardet tells me theres nothing for us to be scared about  that is only my opinion miss adams said the frenchman hastily it may be that colonel cochrane thinks otherwise  it is monsieur fardets opinion against that of the officers who have the responsibility of caring for the safety of the frontier said the colonel coldly at least we will all agree that they have the effect of making the scene very much more picturesque  the desert upon their right lay in long curves of sand like the dunes which might have fringed some forgotten primeval sea topping them they could see the black craggy summits of the curious volcanic hills which rise upon the libyan side on the crest of the low sandhills they would catch a glimpse every now and then of a tall skyblue soldier walking swiftly his rifle at the trail for a moment the lank warlike figure would be sharply silhouetted against the sky then he would dip into a hollow and disappear while some hundred yards off another would show for an instant and vanish  wherever are they raised asked sadie watching the moving figures they look to me just about the same tint as the hotel boys in the states  i thought some question might arise about them said mr stephens who was never so happy as when he could anticipate some wish of the pretty american i made one or two references this morning in the ships library here it isrethats to say about black soldiers i have it on my notes that they are from the 10th soudanese battalion of the egyptian army they are recruited from the dinkas and the shillukstwo negroid tribes living to the south of the dervish country near the equator  how can the recruits come through the dervishes then asked headingly sharply  i dare say there is no such very great difficulty over that said monsieur fardet with a wink at the american  the older men are the remains of the old black battalions some of them served with gordon at khartoum and have his medal to show the others are many of them deserters from the mahdis army said the colonel  well so long as they are not wanted they look right elegant in those blue jackets miss adams observed but if there was any trouble i guess we would wish they were less ornamental and a bit whiter  i am not so sure of that miss adams said the colonel i have seen these fellows in the field and i assure you that i have the utmost confidence in their steadiness  well ill take your word without trying said miss adams with a decision which made every one smile  so far their road had lain along the side of the river which was swirling down upon their left hand deep and strong from the cataracts above here and there the rush of the current was broken by a black shining boulder over which the foam was spouting higher up they could see the white gleam of the rapids and the banks grew into rugged cliffs which were capped by a peculiar outstanding semicircular rock it did not require the dragomans aid to tell the party that this was the famous landmark to which they were bound a long level stretch lay before them and the donkeys took it at a canter at the farther side were scattered rocks black upon orange and in the midst of them rose some broken shafts of pillars and a length of engraved wall looking in its greyness and its solidity more like some work of nature than of man the fat sleek dragoman had dismounted and stood waiting in his petticoats and his covercoat for the stragglers to gather round him  illustration he pointed up with his donkeywhip p66  this temple ladies and gentlemen he cried with the air of an auctioneer who is about to sell it to the highest bidder very fine example from the eighteenth dynasty here is the cartouche of thotmes the third he pointed up with his donkeywhip at the rude but deep hieroglyphics upon the wall above him he live sixteen hundred years before christ and this is made to remember his victorious exhibition into mesopotamia here we have his history from the time that he was with his mother until he return with captives tied to his chariot in this you see him crowned with lower egypt and with upper egypt offering up sacrifice in honour of his victory to the god ammonra here he bring his captives before him and he cut off each his right hand in this corner you see little pileall right hands  my sakes i shouldnt have liked to be here in those days said miss adams  why theres nothing altered remarked cecil brown the east is still the east ive no doubt that within a hundred miles or perhaps a good deal less from where you stand  shut up whispered the colonel and the party shuffled on down the line of the wall with their faces up and their big hats thrown backwards the sun behind them struck the old grey masonry with a brassy glare and carried on to it the strange black shadows of the tourists mixing them up with the grim highnosed squareshouldered warriors and the grotesque rigid deities who lined it the broad shadow of the reverend john stuart of birmingham smudged out both the heathen king and the god whom he worshipped  whats this he was asking in his wheezy voice pointing up with a yellow assouan cane  that is a hippopotamus said the dragoman and the tourists all tittered for there was just a suspicion of mr stuart himself in the carving  but it isnt bigger than a little pig he protested you see that the king is putting his spear through it with ease  they make it small to show that it was a very small thing to the king said the dragoman so you see that all the kings prisoners do not exceed his kneewhich is not because he was so much taller but so much more powerful you see that he is bigger than his horse because he is a king and the other is only a horse the same way these small women whom you see here and there are just his trivial little wives  well now cried miss adams indignantly if they had sculped that kings soul it would have needed a lens to see it fancy his allowing his wives to be put in like that  if he did it now miss adams said the frenchman he would have more fighting than ever in mesopotamia but time brings revenge perhaps the day will soon come when we have the picture of the big strong wife and the trivial little husbandhein  cecil brown and headingly had dropped behind for the glib comments of the dragoman and the empty lighthearted chatter of the tourists jarred upon their sense of solemnity they stood in silence watching the grotesque procession with its sunhats and green veils as it passed in the vivid sunshine down the front of the old grey wall above them two crested hoopoes were fluttering and calling amid the ruins of the pylon  isnt it a sacrilege said the oxford man at last  well now im glad you feel that about it because its how it always strikes me headingly answered with feeling im not quite clear in my own mind how these things should be approachedif they are to be approached at allbut i am sure this is not the way on the whole i prefer the ruins that i have not seen to those which i have  the young diplomatist looked up with his peculiarly bright smile which faded away too soon into his languid blasé mask  ive got a map said the american and sometimes far away from anything in the very midst of the waterless trackless desert i see ruins marked upon itor remains of a temple perhaps for example the temple of jupiter ammon which was one of the most considerable shrines in the world was hundreds of miles from anywhere those are the ruins solitary unseen unchanging through the centuries which appeal to ones imagination but when i present a check at the door and go in as if it were barnums show all the subtle feeling of romance goes right out of it  absolutely said cecil brown looking over the desert with his dark intolerant eyes if one could come wandering here alonestumble upon it by chance as it wereand find ones self in absolute solitude in the dim light of the temple with these grotesque figures all around it would be perfectly overwhelming a man would be prostrated with wonder and awe but when belmont is puffing his bulldog pipe and stuart is wheezing and miss sadie adams is laughing  and that jay of a dragoman speaking his piece said headingly i want to stand and think all the time and i never seem to get the chance i was ripe for manslaughter when i stood before the great pyramid and couldnt get a quiet moment because they would boost me on to the top i took a kick at one man which would have sent him to the top in one jump if i had hit meat but fancy travelling all the way from america to see the pyramid and then finding nothing better to do than to kick an arab in front of it  the oxford man laughed in his gentle tired fashion  they are starting again said he and the two hastened forwards to take their places at the tail of the absurd procession  their route ran now among large scattered boulders and between stony shingly hills a narrow winding path curved in and out amongst the rocks behind them their view was cut off by similar hills black and fantastic like the slagheaps at the shaft of a mine a silence fell upon the little company and even sadies bright face reflected the harshness of nature the escort had closed in and marched beside them their boots scrunching among the loose black rubble colonel cochrane and belmont were still riding together in the van  illustration a silence fell upon the little company p72  do you know belmont said the colonel in a low voice you may think me a fool but i dont like this one little bit  belmont gave a short gruff laugh  it seemed all right in the saloon of the korosko but now that we are here we do seem rather up in the air said he still you know a party comes here every week and nothing has ever yet gone wrong  i dont mind taking my chances when i am on the warpath the colonel answered thats all straightforward and in the way of business but when you have women with you and a helpless crowd like this it becomes really dreadful of course the chances are a hundred to one that we have no trouble but if we should havewell it wont bear thinking about the wonderful thing is their complete unconsciousness that there is any danger whatever  well i like the english tailormade dresses well enough for walking mr stephens said miss sadie from behind them but for an afternoon dress i think the french have more style than the english your milliners have a more severe cut and they dont do the cunning little ribbons and bows and things in the same way  the colonel smiled at belmont  she is quite serene in her mind at any rate said he of course i wouldnt say what i drink to any one but you and i dare say it will all prove to be quite unfounded  well i could imagine parties of dervishes on the prowl said belmont but what i cannot imagine is that they should just happen to come to the pulpit rock on the very morning when we are due there  considering that our movements have been freely advertised and that every one knows a week beforehand what our programme is and where we are to be found it does not strike me as being such a wonderful coincidence  it is a very remote chance said belmont stoutly but he was glad in his heart that his wife was safe and snug on board the steamer  and now they were clear of the rocks again with a fine stretch of firm yellow sand extending to the very base of the conical hill which lay before them ayah ayah cried the boys and whack came their sticks upon the flanks of the donkeys which broke into a gallop and away they all streamed over the plain it was not until they had come to the end of the path which curves up the hill that the dragoman called a halt  now ladies and gentlemen we are arrived for the so famous pulpit rock of abousir from the summit you will presently enjoy a panorama of remarkable fertility but first you will observe that over the rocky side of the hill are everywhere cut the names of great men who have passed it in their travels and some of these names are older than the time of christ  got moses asked miss adams  auntie im surprised at you cried sadie  well my dear he was in egypt and he was a great man and he may have passed this way  mosess name very likely there and the same with herodotus said the dragoman gravely both have been long worn away but there on the brown rock you will see belzoni and up higher is gordon there is hardly a name famous in the soudan which you will not find if you like and now with your permission we shall take goodbye of our donkeys and walk up the path and you will see the river and the desert from the summit of the top  a minute or two of climbing brought them out upon the semicircular platform which crowns the rock below them on the far side was a perpendicular black cliff a hundred and fifty feet high with the swirling foamstreaked river roaring past its base the swish of the water and the low roar as it surged over the midstream boulders boomed through the hot stagnant air far up and far down they could see the course of the river a quarter of a mile in breadth and running very deep and strong with sleek black eddies and occasional spoutings of foam on the other side was a frightful wilderness of black scattered rocks which were the débris carried down by the river at high flood in no direction were there any signs of human beings or their dwellings  on the far side said the dragoman waving his donkeywhip towards the east is the military line which conducts wady haifa to sarras sarras lies to the south under that black hill those two blue mountains which you see very far away are in dongola more than a hundred miles from sarras the railway there is forty miles long and has been much annoyed by the dervishes who are very glad to turn the rails into spears the telegraph wires are also much appreciated thereby now if you will kindly turn round i will explain also what we see upon the other side  it was a view which when once seen must always haunt the mind such an expanse of savage and unrelieved desert might be part of some cold and burnedout planet rather than of this fertile and bountiful earth away and away it stretched to die into a soft violet haze in the extremest distance in the foreground the sand was of a bright golden yellow which was quite dazzling in the sunshine here and there in a scattered cordon stood the six trusty negro soldiers leaning motionless upon their rifles and each throwing a shadow which looked as solid as himself but beyond this golden plain lay a low line of those black slagheaps with yellow sandvalleys winding between them these in their turn were topped by higher and more fantastic hills and these by others peeping over each others shoulders until they blended with that distant violet haze none of these hills were of any heighta few hundred feet at the mostbut their savage sawtoothed crests and their steep scarps of sunbaked stone gave them a fierce character of their own  the libyan desert said the dragoman with a proud wave of his hand the greatest desert in the world suppose you travel right west from here and turn neither to the north nor to the south the first houses you would come to would be in america that make you homesick miss adams i believe  but the american old maid had her attention drawn away by the conduct of sadie who had caught her arm by one hand and was pointing over the desert with the other  well now if that isnt too picturesque for anything she cried with a flush of excitement upon her pretty face do look mr stephens thats just the one only thing we wanted to make it just perfectly grand see the men upon the camels coming out from between those hills  illustration long string of redturbaned riders frontispiece p78  they all looked at the long string of redturbaned riders who were winding out of the ravine and there fell such a hush that the buzzing of the flies sounded quite loud upon their ears colonel cochrane had lit a match and he stood with it in one hand and the unlit cigarette in the other until the flame licked round his fingers belmont whistled the dragoman stood staring with his mouth halfopen and a curious slaty tint in his full red lips the others looked from one to the other with an uneasy sense that there was something wrong it was the colonel who broke the silence  by george belmont i believe the hundredtoone chance has come off said he     chapter iv  whats the meaning of this mansoor cried belmont harshly who are these people and why are you standing staring as if you had lost your senses  the dragoman made an effort to compose himself and licked his dry lips before he answered  i do not know who they are said he in a quavering voice i did not expect to see any arabs in this part  who they are cried the frenchman you can see who they are they are armed men upon camels ababdeh bishareenbedouins in short such as are employed by the government upon the frontier  by jove he may be right cochrane said belmont looking inquiringly at the colonel why shouldnt it be as he says why shouldnt these fellows be friendlies  there are no friendlies upon this side of the river said the colonel abruptly i am perfectly certain about that there is no use in mincing matters we must prepare for the worst  but in spite of his words they stood stockstill in a huddled group staring out over the plain their nerves were numbed by the sudden shock and to all of them it was like a scene in a dream vague impersonal and unreal the men upon the camels had streamed out from a gorge which lay a mile or so distant on the side of the path along which they had travelled their retreat therefore was entirely cut off it appeared from the dust and the length of the line to be quite an army which was emerging from the hills for seventy men upon camels cover a considerable stretch of ground having reached the sandy plain they very deliberately formed to the front and then at the harsh call of a bugle they trotted forward in line the particoloured figures all swaying and the sand smoking in a rolling yellow cloud at the heels of their camels at the same moment the six black soldiers doubled in from the front with their martinis at the trail and snuggled down like welltrained skirmishers behind the rocks upon the haunch of the hill their breechblocks all snapped together as their corporal gave them the order to load  and now suddenly the first stupor of the excursionists passed away and was succeeded by a frantic and impotent energy they all ran about upon the plateau of rock in an aimless foolish flurry like frightened fowls in a yard they could not bring themselves to acknowledge that there was no possible escape for them again and again they rushed to the edge of the great cliff which rose from the river but the youngest and most daring of them could never have descended it the two women clung one on each side of the trembling mansoor with a feeling that he was officially responsible for their safety when he ran up and down in his desperation his skirts and theirs all fluttered together stephens the lawyer kept close to sadie adams muttering mechanically dont be alarmed miss sadie dont be at all alarmed though his own limbs were twitching with agitation monsieur fardet stamped about with a guttural rolling of rs glancing angrily at his companions as if they had in some way betrayed him while the fat clergyman stood with his umbrella up staring stolidly with big frightened eyes at the camelmen cecil brown curled his small prim moustache and looked white but contemptuous the colonel belmont and the young harvard graduate were the three most coolheaded and resourceful members of the party  better stick together said the colonel theres no escape for us so we may as well remain united  theyve halted said belmont they are reconnoitring us they know very well that there is no escape from them and they are taking their time i dont see what we can do  suppose we hide the women headingly suggested they cant know how many of us are here when they have taken us the women can come out of their hidingplace and make their way back to the boat  admirable cried colonel cochrane admirable this way please miss adams bring the ladies here mansoor there is not an instant to be lost  there was a part of the plateau which was invisible from the plain and here in feverish haste they built a little cairn many flaky slabs of stone were lying about and it did not take long to prop the largest of these against a rock so as to make a leanto and then to put two sidepieces to complete it the slabs were of the same colour as the rock so that to a casual glance the hidingplace was not very visible the two ladies were squeezed into this and they crouched together sadies arms thrown round her aunt when they had walled them up the men turned with lighter hearts to see what was going on as they did so there rang out the sharp peremptory crack of a rifleshot from the escort followed by another and another but these isolated shots were drowned in the long spattering roll of an irregular volley from the plain and the air was full of the phitphitphit of the bullets the tourists all huddled behind the rocks with the exception of the frenchman who still stamped angrily about striking his sunhat with his clenched hand belmont and cochrane crawled down to where the soudanese soldiers were firing slowly and steadily resting their rifles upon the boulders in front of them  the arabs had halted about five hundred yards away and it was evident from their leisurely movements that they were perfectly aware that there was no possible escape for the travellers they had paused to ascertain their number before closing in upon them most of them were firing from the backs of their camels but a few had dismounted and were kneeling here and therelittle shimmering white spots against the golden background their shots came sometimes singly in quick sharp throbs and sometimes in a rolling volley with a sound like a boys stick drawn across iron railings the hill buzzed like a beehive and the bullets made a sharp crackling sound as they struck against the rocks  illustration you do no good by exposing yourself p86  you do no good by exposing yourself said belmont drawing colonel cochrane behind a large jagged boulder which already furnished a shelter for three of the soudanese  a bullet is the best we have to hope for said cochrane grimly what an infernal fool i have been belmont not to protest more energetically against this ridiculous expedition i deserve whatever i get but it is hard on these poor souls who never knew the danger  i suppose theres no help for us  not the faintest  dont you think this firing might bring the troops up from haifa  theyll never hear it it is a good six miles from here to the steamer from that to haifa would be another five  well when we dont return the steamer will give the alarm  and where shall we be by that time  my poor norah my poor little norah muttered belmont in the depths of his grizzled moustache  what do you suppose that they will do with us cochrane he asked after a pause  they may cut our throats or they may take us as slaves to khartoum i dont know that there is much to choose theres one of us out of his troubles anyhow  the soldier next them had sat down abruptly and leaned forward over his knees his movement and attitude were so natural that it was hard to realise that he had been shot through the head he neither stirred nor groaned his comrades bent over him for a moment and then shrugging their shoulders they turned their dark faces to the arabs once more belmont picked up the dead mans martini and his ammunitionpouch  only three more rounds cochrane said he with the little brass cylinders upon the palm of his hand weve let them shoot too soon and too often we should have waited for the rush  youre a famous shot belmont cried the colonel ive heard of you as one of the cracks dont you think you could pick off their leader which is he  as far as i can make out it is that one on the white camel on their right front i mean the fellow who is peering at us from under his two hands  belmont thrust in his cartridge and altered the sights its a shocking bad light for judging distance said he this is where the low pointblank trajectory of the leemetford comes in useful well well try him at five hundred he fired but there was no change in the white camel or the peering rider  did you see any sand fly  no i saw nothing i fancy i took my sight a trifle too full try him again man and rifle and rock were equally steady but again the camel and chief remained unharmed the third shot must have been nearer for he moved a few paces to the right as if he were becoming restless  belmont threw the empty rifle down with an exclamation of disgust  its this confounded light he cried and his cheeks flushed with annoyance think of my wasting three cartridges in that fashion if i had him at bisley id shoot the turban off him but this vibrating glare means refraction whats the matter with the frenchman  monsieur fardet was stamping about the plateau with the gestures of a man who has been stung by a wasp scré nom scré nom he shouted showing his strong white teeth under his black waxed moustache he wrung his right hand violently and as he did so he sent a little spray of blood from his fingertips a bullet had chipped his wrist headingly ran out from the cover where he had been crouching with the intention of dragging the demented frenchman into a place of safety but he had not taken three paces before he was himself hit in the loins and fell with a dreadful crash among the stones he staggered to his feet and then fell again in the same place floundering up and down like a horse which has broken its back im done he whispered as the colonel ran to his aid and then he lay still with his chinawhite cheek against the black stones when but a year before he had wandered under the elms of cambridge surely the last fate upon this earth which he could have predicted for himself would be that he should be slain by the bullet of a fanatical mohammedan in the wilds of the libyan desert  meanwhile the fire of the escort had ceased for they had shot away their last cartridge a second man had been killed and a third who was the corporal in chargehad received a bullet in his thigh he sat upon a stone tying up his injury with a grave preoccupied look upon his wrinkled black face like an old woman piecing together a broken plate the three others fastened their bayonets with a determined metallic rasp and snap and the air of men who intended to sell their lives dearly  theyre coming cried belmont looking over the plain  let them come the colonel answered putting his hands into his trouserpockets suddenly he pulled one fist out and shook it furiously in the air oh the cads die confounded cads he shouted and his eyes were congested with rage  it was the fate of the poor donkeyboys which had carried the selfcontained soldier out of his usual calm during the firing they had remained huddled a pitiable group among the rocks at the base of the hill now upon the conviction that the charge of the dervishes must come first upon them they had sprung upon their animals with shrill inarticulate cries of fear and had galloped off across the plain a small flankingparty of eight or ten camelmen had worked round while the firing had been going on and these dashed in among the flying donkeyboys hacking and hewing with a coldblooded deliberate ferocity one little boy in a flapping galabeeah kept ahead of his pursuers for a time but the long stride of the camels ran him down and an arab thrust his spear into the middle of his stooping back the small whiteclad corpses looked like a flock of sheep trailing over the desert  but the people upon the rock had no time to think of the cruel fate of the donkeyboys even the colonel after that first indignant outburst had forgotten all about them the advancing camelmen had trotted to the bottom of the hill had dismounted and leaving their camels kneeling had rushed furiously onward fifty of them were clambering up the path and over the rocks together their red turbans appearing and vanishing again as they scrambled over the boulders without a shot or a pause they surged over the three black soldiers killing one and stamping the other two down under their hurrying feet so they burst on to the plateau at the top where an unexpected resistance checked them for an instant  the travellers nestling up against one another had awaited each after his own fashion the coming of the arabs the colonel with his hands back in his trouserpockets tried to whistle out of his dry lips belmont folded his arms and leaned against a rock with a sulky frown upon his lowering face so strangely do our minds act that his three successive misses and the tarnish to his reputation as a marksman was troubling him more than his impending fate cecil brown stood erect and plucked nervously at the upturned points of his little prim moustache monsieur fardet groaned over his wounded wrist mr stephens in sombre impotence shook his head slowly the living embodiment of prosaic law and order mr stuart stood his umbrella still over him with no expression upon his heavy face or in his staring brown eyes headingly lay with that chinawhite cheek resting motionless upon the stones his sunhat had fallen off and he looked quite boyish with his ruffled yellow hair and his unlined cleancut face the dragoman sat upon a stone and played nervously with his donkeywhip so the arabs found them when they reached the summit of the hill  and then just as the foremost rushed to lay hands upon them a most unexpected incident arrested them from the time of the first appearance of the dervishes the fat clergyman of birmingham had looked like a man in a cataleptic trance he had neither moved nor spoken but now he suddenly woke at a bound into strenuous and heroic energy it may have been the mania of fear or it may have been the blood of some berserk ancestor which stirred suddenly in his veins but he broke into a wild shout and catching up a stick he struck right and left among the arabs with a fury which was more savage than their own one who helped to draw up this narrative has left it upon record that of all the pictures which have been burned into his brain there is none so clear as that of this man his large face shining with perspiration and his great body dancing about with unwieldy agility as he struck at the shrinking snarling savages  illustration he struck at the snarling savages p 94  then a spearhead flashed from behind a rock with a quick vicious upward thrust the clergyman fell upon his hands and knees and the horde poured over him to seize their unresisting victims knives glimmered before their eyes rude hands clutched at their wrists and at their throats and then with brutal and unreasoning violence they were hauled and pushed down the steep winding path to where the camels were waiting below the frenchman waved his unwounded hand as he walked vive le khalifa vive le madhi he shouted until a blow from behind with the buttend of a remington beat him into silence  and now they were herded in at the base of the abousir rock this little group of modern types who had fallen into the rough clutch of the seventh centuryfor in all save the rifles in their hands there was nothing to distinguish these men from the desert warriors who first carried the crescent flag out of arabia the east does not change and the dervish raiders were not less brave less cruel or less fanatical than their forebears they stood in a circle leaning upon their guns and spears and looking with exultant eyes at the dishevelled group of captives they were clad in some approach to a uniform red turbans gathered around the neck as well as the head so that the fierce face looked out of a scarlet frame yellow untanned shoes and white tunics with square brown patches let into them all carried rifles and one had a small discoloured bugle slung over his shoulder half of them were negroesfine muscular men with the limbs of a jet hercules and the other half were baggara arabssmall brown and wiry with little vicious eyes and thin cruel lips the chief was also a baggara but he was a taller man than the others with a black beard which came down over his chest and a pair of hard cold eyes which gleamed like glass from under his thick black brows they were fixed now upon his captives and his features were grave with thought mr stuart had been brought down his hat gone his face still flushed with anger and his trousers sticking in one part to his leg the two surviving soudanese soldiers their black faces and blue coats blotched with crimson stood silently at attention upon one side of this forlorn group of castaways  the chief stood for some minutes stroking his black beard while his fierce eyes glanced from one pale face to another along the miserable line of his captives in a harsh imperious voice he said something which brought mansoor the dragoman to the front with bent back and outstretched supplicating palms to his employers there had always seemed to be something comic in that flapping skirt and short covercoat above it but now under the glare of the midday sun with those faces gathered round them it appeared rather to add a grotesque horror to the scene the dragoman salaamed like some ungainly automatic doll and then as the chief rasped out a curt word or two he fell suddenly upon his face rubbing his forehead into the sand and flapping upon it with his hands  illustration fell suddenly upon his face p97  whats that cochrane asked belmont why is he making an exhibition of himself  as far as i can understand it is all up with us the colonel answered  but this is absurd cried the frenchman excitedly why should these people wish any harm to me i have never injured them on the other hand i have always been their friend if i could but speak to them i would make them comprehend hola dragoman mansoor  the excited gestures of monsieur fardet drew the sinister eyes of the baggara chief upon him again he asked a curt question and mansoor kneeling in front of him answered it  tell him that i am a frenchman dragoman tell him that i am a friend of the khalifa tell him that my countrymen have never had any quarrel with him but that his enemies are also ours  the chief asks what religion you call your own said mansoor the khalifa he says has no necessity for any friendship from those who are infidels and unbelievers  tell him that in france we look upon all religions as good  the chief says that none but a blaspheming dog and the son of a dog would say that all religions are one as good as the other he says that if you are indeed the friend of the khalifa you will accept the koran and become a true believer upon the spot if you will do so he will promise on his side to send you alive to khartoum  and if not  you will fare in the same way as the others  then you may make my compliments to monsieur the chief and tell him that it is not the custom for frenchmen to change their religion under compulsion  the chief said a few words and then turned to consult with a short sturdy arab at his elbow  he says monsieur fardet said the dragoman that if you speak again he will make a trough out of you for the dogs to feed from say nothing to anger him sir for he is now talking what is to be done with us  who is he asked the colonel  it is ali wad ibrahim the same who raided last year and killed all of the nubian village  ive heard of him said the colonel  he has the name of being one of the boldest and the most fanatical of all the khalifas leaders thank god that the women are out of his clutches  the two arabs had been talking in that stern restrained fashion which comes so strangely from a southern race now they both turned to the dragoman who was still kneeling upon the sand they plied him with questions pointing first to one and then to another of their prisoners then they conferred together once more and finally said something to mansoor with a contemptuous wave of the hand to indicate that he might convey it to the others  thank heaven gentlemen i think that we are saved for the present time said mansoor wiping away the sand which had stuck to his perspiring forehead ali wad ibrahim says that though an unbeliever should have only the edge of the sword from one of the sons of the prophet yet it might be of more profit to the beitelmal at omdurman if it had the gold which your people will pay for you until it comes you can work as the slaves of the khalifa unless he should decide to put you to death you are to mount yourselves upon the spare camels and to ride with the party  the chief had waited for the end of the explanation now he gave a brief order and a negro stepped forward with a long dullcoloured sword in his hand the dragoman squealed like a rabbit who sees a ferret and threw himself frantically down upon the sand once more  what is it cochrane asked cecil brownfor the colonel had served in the east and was the only one of the travellers who had a smattering of arabic  as far as i can make out he says there is no use keeping the dragoman as no one would trouble to pay a ransom for him and he is too fat to make a good slave  poor devil cried brown here cochrane tell them to let him go we cant let him be butchered like this in front of us say that we will find the money amongst us i will be answerable for any reasonable sum  ill stand in as far as my means will allow cried belmont  we will sign a joint bond or indemnity said the lawyer if i had a paper and pencil i could throw it into shape in an instant and the chief could rely upon its being perfectly correct and valid  but the colonels arabic was insufficient and mansoor himself was too maddened by fear to understand the offer which was being made for him the negro looked a question at the chief and then his long black arm swung upwards and his sword hissed over his shoulder but the dragoman had screamed out something which arrested the blow and which brought the chief and the lieutenant to his side with a new interest upon their swarthy faces the others crowded in also and formed a dense circle around the grovelling pleading man  the colonel had not understood this sudden change nor had the others fathomed the reason of it but some instinct flashed it upon stephenss horrified perceptions  oh you villain he cried furiously  hold your tongue you miserable creature be silent better diea thousand times better die  but it was too late and already they could all see the base design by which the coward hoped to save his own life he was about to betray the women they saw the chief with a brave mans contempt upon his stern face make a sign of haughty assent and then mansoor spoke rapidly and earnestly pointing up the hill at a word from the baggara a dozen of the raiders rushed up the path and were lost to view upon the top then came a shrill cry a horrible strenuous scream of surprise and terror and an instant later the party streamed into sight again dragging the women in their midst sadie with her young active limbs kept up with them as they sprang down the slope encouraging her aunt all the while over her shoulder the older lady struggling amid the rushing white figures looked with her thin limbs and open mouth like a chicken being dragged from a coop  illustration the party streamed into sight again p103  the chiefs dark eyes glanced indifferently at miss adams but gazed with a smouldering fire at the younger woman then he gave an abrupt order and the prisoners were hurried in a miserable hopeless drove to the cluster of kneeling camels their pockets had already been ransacked and the contents thrown into one of the camelfood bags the neck of which was tied up by ali wad ibrahims own hands  i say cochrane whispered belmont looking with smouldering eyes at the wretched mansoor ive got a little hip revolver which they have not discovered shall i shoot that cursed dragoman for giving away the women  the colonel shook his head  you had better keep it said he with a sombre face the women may find some other use for it before all is over     chapter v  the camels some brown and some white were kneeling in a long line their champing jaws moving rhythmically from side to side and their gracefully poised heads turning to right and left in a mincing selfconscious fashion most of them were beautiful creatures true arabian trotters with the slim limbs and finely turned necks which mark the breed but amongst them were a few of the slower heavier beasts with ungroomed skins disfigured by the black scars of old firings these were loaded with the doora and the waterskins of the raiders but a few minutes sufficed to redistribute their loads and to make place for the prisoners none of these had been bound with the exception of mr stuartfor the arabs understanding that he was a clergyman and accustomed to associate religion with violence had looked upon his fierce outburst as quite natural and regarded him now as the most dangerous and enterprising of their captives his hands were therefore tied together with a plaited camelhalter but the others including the dragoman and the two wounded blacks were allowed to mount without any precaution against their escape save that which was afforded by the slowness of their beasts then with a shouting of men and a roaring of camels the creatures were jolted on to their legs and the long straggling procession set off with its back to the homely river and its face to the shimmering violet haze which hung round the huge sweep of beautiful terrible desert striped tigerfashion with black rock and with golden sand  none of the white prisoners with the exception of colonel cochrane had ever been upon a camel before it seemed an alarming distance to the ground when they looked down and the curious swaying motion with the insecurity of the saddle made them sick and frightened but their bodily discomfort was forgotten in the turmoil of bitter thoughts within what a chasm gaped between their old life and their new and yet how short was the time and space which divided them less than an hour ago they had stood upon the summit of that rock and had laughed and chattered or grumbled at the heat and flies becoming peevish at small discomforts headingly had been hypercritical over the tints of nature they could not forget his own tint as he lay with his cheek upon the black stone sadie had chattered about tailormade dresses and parisian chiffons now she was clinging halfcrazy to the pommel of a wooden saddle with suicide rising as a red star of hope in her mind humanity reason argumentall were gone and there remained the brutal humiliation of force and all the time down there by the second rocky point their steamer was waiting for themtheir saloon with the white napery and the glittering glasses the latest novel and the london papers the least imaginative of them could see it so clearly the white awning mrs shlesinger with her yellow sunhat mrs belmont lying back in the canvas chair there it lay almost in sight of them that little floating chip broken off from home and every silent ungainly step of the camels was carrying them more hopelessly away from it that very morning how beneficent providence had appeared how pleasant was lifea little commonplace perhaps but so soothing and restful and now  the red headgear patched jibbehs and yellow boots had already shown to the colonel that these men were no wandering party of robbers but a troop from the regular army of the khalifa now as they struck across the desert they showed that they possessed the rude discipline which their work demanded a mile ahead and far out on either flank rode their scouts dipping and rising among the yellow sandhills ali wad ibrahim headed the caravan and his short sturdy lieutenant brought up the rear the main party straggled over a couple of hundred yards and in the middle was the little dejected clump of prisoners no attempt was made to keep them apart and mr stephens soon contrived that his camel should be between those of the two ladies  dont be downhearted miss adams said he this is a most indefensible outrage but there can be no question that steps will be taken in the proper quarter to set the matter right i am convinced that we shall be subjected to nothing worse than a temporary inconvenience if it had not been for that villain mansoor you need not have appeared at all  it was shocking to see the change in the little bostonian lady for she had shrunk to an old woman in an hour her swarthy cheeks had fallen in and her eyes shone wildly from sunken darkened sockets her frightened glances were continually turned upon sadie there is surely some wrecker angel which can only gather her best treasures in moments of disaster for here were all these worldlings going to their doom and already frivolity and selfishness had passed away from them and each was thinking and grieving only for the other sadie thought of her aunt her aunt thought of sadie the men thought of the women belmont thought of his wifeand then he thought of something else also and he kicked his camels shoulder with his heel until he found himself upon the near side of miss adams  ive got something for you here he whispered we may be separated soon so it is as well to make our arrangements  separated wailed miss adams  dont speak loud for that infernal mansoor may give us away again i hope it wont be so but it might we must be prepared for the worst for example they might determine to get rid of us men and to keep you  miss adams shuddered  what am i to do for gods sake tell me what i am to do mr belmont i am an old woman i have had my day i could stand it if it was only myself but sadiei am clean crazed when i think of her theres her mother waiting at home and i she clasped her thin hands together in the agony of her thoughts  put your hand out under your dustcloak said belmont sidling his camel up against hers dont miss your grip of it there now hide it in your dress and youll always have a key to unlock any door  illustration dont miss your grip of it p111  miss adams felt what it was which he had slipped into her hand and she looked at him for a moment in bewilderment then she pursed up her lips and shook her stern brown face in disapproval but she pushed the little pistol into its hidingplace all the same and she rode with her thoughts in a whirl could this indeed be she eliza adams of boston whose narrow happy life had oscillated between the comfortable house in commonwealth avenue and the tremont presbyterian church here she was hunched upon a camel with her hand upon the butt of a pistol and her mind weighing the justifications of murder oh life sly sleek treacherous life how are we ever to trust you show us your worst and we can face it but it is when you are sweetest and smoothest that we have most to fear from you  at the worst miss sadie it will only be a question of ransom said stephens arguing against his own convictions besides we are still close to egypt far away from the dervish country there is sure to be an energetic pursuit you must try not to lose your courage and to hope for the best  no i am not scared mr stephens said sadie turning towards him a blanched face which belied her words were all in gods hands and surely he wont be cruel to us it is easy to talk about trusting him when things are going well but now is the real test if hes up there behind that blue heaven  he is said a voice behind them and they found that the birmingham clergyman had joined the party his tied hands clutched on to his makloofa saddle and his fat body swayed dangerously from side to side with every stride of the camel his wounded leg was oozing with blood and clotted with flies and the burning desert sun beat down upon his bare head for he had lost both hat and umbrella in the scuffle a rising fever flecked his large white cheeks with a touch of colour and brought a light into his brown oxeyes he had always seemed a somewhat gross and vulgar person to his fellowtravellers now this bitter healing draught of sorrow had transformed him he was purified spiritualised exalted he had become so calmly strong that he made the others feel stronger as they looked upon him he spoke of life and of death of the present and their hopes of the future and the black cloud of their misery began to show a golden rift or two cecil brown shrugged his shoulders for he could not change in an hour the convictions of his life but the others even fardet the frenchman were touched and strengthened they all took off their hats when he prayed then the colonel made a turban out of his red silk cummerbund and insisted that mr stuart should wear it with his homely dress and gorgeous headgear he looked like a man who has dressed up to amuse the children  and now the dull ceaseless insufferable torment of thirst was added to the aching weariness which came from the motion of the camels the sun glared down upon them and then up again from the yellow sand and the great plain shimmered and glowed until they felt as if they were riding over a cooling sheet of molten metal their lips were parched and dried and their tongues like tags of leather they lisped curiously in their speech for it was only the vowel sounds which would come without an effort miss adamss chin had dropped upon her chest and her great hat concealed her face  auntie will faint if she does not get water said sadie oh mr stephens is there nothing we could do  the dervishes riding near were all baggara with the exception of one negroan uncouth fellow with a face pitted with smallpox his expression seemed goodnatured when compared with that of his arab comrades and stephens ventured to touch his elbow and to point to his waterskin and then to the exhausted lady the negro shook his head brusquely but at the same time he glanced significantly towards the arabs as if to say that if it were not for them he might act differently then he laid his black forefinger upon the breast of his jibbeh  tippy tilly said he  whats that asked colonel cochrane  tippy tilly repeated the negro sinking his voice as if he wished only the prisoners to hear him  the colonel shook his head  my arabic wont bear much strain i dont know what he is saying said he  tippy tilly hicks pasha the negro repeated  i believe the fellow is friendly to us but i cant quite make him out said cochrane to belmont do you think that he means that his name is tippy tilly and that he killed hicks pasha  the negro showed his great white teeth at hearing his own words coming back to him aiwa said he tippy tillybimbashi mormerbourn  by jove i got it cried belmont  hes trying to speak english tippy tilly is as near as he can get to egyptian artillery he has served in the egyptian artillery under bimbashi mortimer he was taken prisoner when hicks pasha was destroyed and had to turn dervish to save his skin hows that  the colonel said a few words of arabic and received a reply but two of the arabs closed up and the negro quickened his pace and left them  you are quite right said the colonel the fellow is friendly to us and would rather fight for the khedive than for the khalifa i dont know that he can do us any good but ive been in worse holes than this and come out right side up after all we are not out of reach of pursuit and wont be for another fortyeight hours  belmont calculated the matter out in his slow deliberate fashion  it was about twelve that we were on the rock said he they would become alarmed aboard the steamer if we did not appear at two  yes the colonel interrupted that was to be our lunch hour i remember saying that when i came back i would haveoh lord its best not to think about it  the reis was a sleepy old crock belmont continued but i have absolute confidence in the promptness and decision of my wife she would insist upon an immediate alarm being given suppose they started back at twothirty they should be at haifa by three since the journey is down stream how long did they say that it took to turn out the camel corps  give them an hour  and another hour to get them across the river they would be at the abousir rock and pick up the tracks by six oclock after that it is a clear race we are only four hours ahead and some of these beasts are very spent we may be saved yet cochrane  some of us may i dont expect to see the padre alive tomorrow nor miss adams either they are not made for this sort of thing either of them then again we must not forget that these people have a trick of murdering their prisoners when they think that there is a chance of a rescue see here belmont in case you get back and i dont theres a matter of a mortgage that i want you to set right for me they rode on with their shoulders inclined to each other deep in the details of business  the friendly negro who had talked of himself as tippy tilly had managed to slip a piece of cloth soaked in water into the hand of mr stephens and miss adams had moistened her lips with it even the few drops had given her renewed strength and now that the first crushing shock was over her wiry elastic yankee nature began to reassert itself  these people dont look as if they would harm us mr stephens said she i guess they have a working religion of their own such as it is and that whats wrong to us is wrong to them  stephens shook his head in silence he had seen the death of the donkeyboys and she had not  maybe we are sent to guide them into a better path said the old lady maybe we are specially singled out for a good work among them  if it were not for her niece her energetic and enterprising temperament was capable of glorying in the chance of evangelising khartoum and turning omdurman into a little welldrained broadavenued replica of a new england town  do you know what i am thinking of all the time said sadie you remember that temple that we sawwhen was it why it was this morning  they gave an exclamation of surprise all three of them yes it had been this morning and it seemed away and away in some dim past experience of their lives so vast was the change so new and so overpowering the thoughts which had come between them they rode in silence full of this strange expansion of time until at last stephens reminded sadie that she had left her remark unfinished  oh yes it was the wall picture on that temple that i was thinking of do you remember the poor string of prisoners who are being dragged along to the feet of the great kinghow dejected they looked among the warriors who led them who couldwho could have thought that within three hours the same fate should be our own and mr headingly she turned her face away and began to cry  dont take on sadie said her aunt remember what the minister said just now that we are all right there in the hollow of gods hand where do you think we are going mr stephens  the red edge of his baedeker still projected from the lawyers pocket for it had not been worth their captors while to take it he glanced down at it  if they will only leave me this i will look up a few references when we halt i have a general idea of the country for i drew a small map of it the other day the river runs from south to north so we must be travelling almost due west i suppose they feared pursuit if they kept too near the nile bank there is a caravan route i remember which runs parallel to the river about seventy miles inland if we continue in this direction for a day we ought to come to it there is a line of wells through which it passes it comes out at assiout if i remember right upon the egyptian side on the other side it leads away into the dervish countryso perhaps  his words were interrupted by a high eager voice which broke suddenly into a torrent of jostling words words without meaning pouring strenuously out in angry assertions and foolish repetitions the pink had deepened to scarlet upon mr stuarts cheeks his eyes were vacant but brilliant and he gabbled gabbled gabbled as he rode kindly mother nature she will not let her children be mishandled too far this is too much she says this wounded leg these crusted lips this anxious weary mind come away for a time until your body becomes more habitable and so she coaxes the mind away into the nirvana of delirium while the little cellworkers tinker and toil within to get things better for its homecoming when you see the veil of cruelty which nature wears try and peer through it and you will sometimes catch a glimpse of a very homely kindly face behind  the arab guards looked askance at this sudden outbreak of the clergyman for it verged upon lunacy and lunacy is to them a fearsome and supernatural thing one of them rode forward and spoke with the emir when he returned he said something to his comrades one of whom closed in upon each side of the ministers camel so as to prevent him from falling the friendly negro sidled his beast up to the colonel and whispered to him  we are going to halt presently belmont said cochrane  thank god they may give us some water we cant go on like this  i told tippy tilly that if he could help us we would turn him into a bimbashi when we got him back into egypt i think hes willing enough if he only had the power by jove belmont do look back at the river  their route which had lain through sandstrewn khors with jagged black edgesplaces up which one would hardly think it possible that a camel could climbopened out now on to a hard rolling plain covered thickly with rounded pebbles dipping and rising to the violet hills upon the horizon so regular were the long brown pebblestrewn curves that they looked like the dark rollers of some monstrous groundswell here and there a little straggling sagegreen tuft of camelgrass sprouted up between the stones brown plains and violet hillsnothing else in front of them behind lay the black jagged rocks through which they had passed with orange slopes of sand and then far away a thin line of green to mark the course of the river how cool and beautiful that green looked in the stark abominable wilderness on one side they could see the high rockthe accursed rock which had tempted them to their ruin on the other the river curved and the sun gleamed upon the water oh that liquid gleam and the insurgent animal cravings the brutal primitive longings which for the instant took the soul out of all of them they had lost families countries liberty everything but it was only of water water water that they could think mr stuart in his delirium began roaring for oranges and it was insufferable for them to have to listen to him only the rough sturdy irishman rose superior to that bodily craving that gleam of river must be somewhere near haifa and his wife might be upon the very water at which he looked he pulled his hat over his eyes and rode in gloomy silence biting at his strong irongrey moustache  illustration looking for some landmark p124  slowly the sun sank towards the west and their shadows began to trail along the path where their hearts would go it was cooler and a desert breeze had sprung up whispering over the rolling stonestrewed plain the emir at their head had called his lieutenant to his side and the pair had peered about their eyes shaded by their hands looking for some landmark then with a satisfied grunt the chiefs camel had seemed to break short off at its knees and then at its hocks going down in three curious brokenjointed jerks until its stomach was stretched upon the ground as each succeeding camel reached the spot it lay down also until they were all stretched in one long line the riders sprang off and laid out the chopped tibbin upon cloths in front of them for no wellbred camel will eat from the ground in their gentle eyes their quiet leisurely way of eating and their condescending mincing manner there was something both feminine and genteel as though a party of prim old maids had foregathered in the heart of the libyan desert  there was no interference with the prisoners either male or female for how could they escape in the centre of that huge plain the emir came towards them once and stood combing out his blueblack beard with his fingers and looking thoughtfully at them out of his dark sinister eyes miss adams saw with a shudder that it was always upon sadie that his gaze was fixed then seeing their distress he gave an order and a negro brought a waterskin from which he gave each of them about half a tumblerful it was hot and muddy and tasted of leather but oh how delightful it was to their parched palates the emir said a few abrupt words to the dragoman and left  ladies and gentlemen mansoor began with something of his old consequential manner but a glare from the colonels eyes struck the words from his lips and he broke away into a long whimpering excuse for his conduct  how could i do anything otherwise he wailed with the very knife at my throat  you will have the very rope round your throat if we all see egypt again growled cochrane savagely in the meantime  thats all right colonel said belmont but for our own sakes we ought to know what the chief has said  for my part ill have nothing to do with the blackguard  i think that that is going too far we are bound to hear what he has to say  cochrane shrugged his shoulders privations had made him irritable and he had to bite his lip to keep down a bitter answer he walked slowly away with his straightlegged military stride  what did he say then asked belmont looking at the dragoman with an eye which was as stern as the colonels  he seems to be in a somewhat better manner than before he said that if he had more water you should have it but that he is himself short in supply he said that tomorrow we shall come to the wells of selimah and everybody shall have plentyand the camels too  did he say how long we stopped here  very little rest he said and then forwards oh mr belmont  hold your tongue snapped the irishman and began once more to count times and distances if it all worked out as he expected if his wife had insisted upon the indolent reis giving an instant alarm at haifa then the pursuers should be already upon their track the camel corps or the egyptian horse would travel by moonlight better and faster than in the daytime he knew that it was the custom at haifa to keep at least a squadron of them all ready to start at any instant he had dined at the mess and the officers had told him how quickly they could take the field they had shown him the watertanks and the food beside each beast and he had admired the completeness of the arrangements with little thought as to what it might mean to him in the future it would be at least an hour before they would all get started again from their present haltingplace that would be a clear hour gained perhaps by next morning  and then suddenly his thoughts were terribly interrupted the colonel raving like a madman appeared upon the crest of the nearest slope with an arab hanging on to each of his wrists his face was purple with rage and excitement and he tugged and bent and writhed in his furious efforts to get free you cursed murderers he shrieked and then seeing the others in front of him belmont he cried theyve killed cecil brown  what had happened was this in his conflict with his own illhumour cochrane had strolled over this nearest crest and had found a group of camels in the hollow beyond with a little knot of angry loudvoiced men beside them brown was the centre of the group pale heavyeyed with his upturned spiky moustache and listless manner they had searched his pockets before but now they were determined to tear off all his clothes in the hope of finding something which he had secreted a hideous negro with silver bangles in his ears grinned and jabbered in the young diplomatists impassive face there seemed to the colonel to be something heroic and almost inhuman in that white calm and those abstracted eyes his coat was already open and the negros great black paw flew up to his neck and tore his shirt down to the waist and at the sound of that rrrip and at the abhorrent touch of those coarse fingers this man about town this finished product of the nineteenth century dropped his lifetraditions and became a savage facing a savage  his face flushed his lips curled back he chattered his teeth like an ape and his eyes those indolent eyes which had always twinkled so placidlywere gorged and frantic he threw himself upon the negro and struck him again and again feebly but viciously in his broad black face he hit like a girl round arm with an open palm the man winced away for an instant appalled by this sudden blaze of passion then with an impatient snarling cry he slid a knife from his long loose sleeve and struck upwards under the whirling arm brown sat down at the blow and began to coughto cough as a man coughs who has choked at dinner furiously ceaselessly spasm after spasm then the angry red cheeks turned to a mottled pallor there were liquid sounds in his throat and clapping his hand to his mouth he rolled over on to his side  illustration he rolled over on to his side p130  the negro with a brutal grunt of contempt slid his knife up his sleeve once more while the colonel frantic with impotent anger was seized by the bystanders and dragged raving with fury back to his forlorn party his hands were lashed with a camelhalter and he lay at last in bitter silence beside the delirious nonconformist  so headingly was gone and cecil brown was gone and their haggard eyes were turned from one pale face to another to know which they should lose next of that frieze of lighthearted riders who had stood out so clearly against the blue morning sky when viewed from the deckchairs of the korosko two gone out of ten and a third out of his mind the pleasure trip was drawing to its climax  fardet the frenchman was sitting alone with his chin resting upon his hands and his elbows upon his knees staring miserably out over the desert when belmont saw him start suddenly and prick up his head like a dog who hears a strange step then with clenched fingers he bent his face forward and stared fixedly towards the black eastern hills through which they had passed belmont followed his gaze and yesyesthere was something moving there he saw the twinkle of metal and the sudden gleam and flutter of some white garment  a dervish vedette upon the flank turned his camel twice round as a danger signal and discharged his rifle in the air the echo of the crack had hardly died away before they were all in their saddles arabs and negroes another instant and the camels were on their feet and moving slowly towards the point of alarm several armed men surrounded the prisoners slipping cartridges into their remingtons as a hint to them to remain still  by heaven they are men on camels cried cochrane his troubles all forgotten as he strained his eyes to catch sight of these newcomers i do believe that it is our own people in the confusion he had tugged his hands free from the halter which bound them  theyve been smarter than i gave them credit for said belmont his eyes shining from under his thick brows they are here a long two hours before we could have reasonably expected them hurrah monsieur fardet ça va bien nest ce pas  hurrah hurrah merveilleusement bien vivent les anglais vivent les anglais yelled the excited frenchman as the head of a column of camelry began to wind out from among the rocks  see here belmont cried the colonel these fellows will want to shoot us if they see it is all up i know their ways and we must be ready for it will you be ready to jump on the fellow with the blind eye and ill take the big nigger if i can get my arms around him stephens you must do what you can you fardet comprenez vous il est nécessaire to plug these johnnies before they can hurt us you dragoman tell those two soudanese soldiers that they must be readybut but his words died into a murmur and he swallowed once or twice these are arabs said he and it sounded like another voice  of all the bitter day it was the very bitterest moment happy mr stuart lay upon the pebbles with his back against the ribs of his camel and chuckled consumedly at some joke which those busy little cellworkers had come across in their repairs  his fat face was wreathed and creased with merriment but the others how sick how heartsick were they all the women cried the men turned away in that silence which is beyond tears monsieur fardet fell upon his face and shook with dry sobbings  the arabs were firing their rifles as a welcome to their friends and the others as they trotted their camels across the open returned the salutes and waved their rifles and lances in the air they were a smaller band than the first onenot more than thirtybut dressed in the same red headgear and patched jibbehs one of them carried a small white banner with a scarlet text scrawled across it but there was something there which drew the eyes and the thoughts of the tourists away from everything else the same fear gripped at each of their hearts and the same impulse kept each of them silent they stared at a swaying white figure half seen amidst the ranks of the desert warriors  whats that they have in the middle of them cried stephens at last look miss adams surely it is a woman  there was something there upon a camel but it was difficult to catch a glimpse of it and then suddenly as the two bodies met the riders opened out and they saw it plainly its a white woman the steamer has been taken belmont gave a cry that sounded high above everything  illustration norah darling keep your heart up p135  norah darling he shouted keep your heart up im here and it is all well     chapter vi  so the korosko had been taken and the chances of rescue upon which they had reckonedall those elaborate calculations of hours and distanceswere as unsubstantial as the mirage which shimmered upon the horizon there would be no alarm at haifa until it was found that the steamer did not return in the evening even now when the nile was only a thin green band upon the farthest horizon the pursuit had probably not begun in a hundred miles or even less they would be in the dervish country how small then was the chance that the egyptian forces could overtake them they all sank into a silent sulky despair with the exception of belmont who was held back by the guards as he strove to go to his wifes assistance  the two bodies of camelmen had united and the arabs in their grave dignified fashion were exchanging salutations and experiences while the negroes grinned chattered and shouted with the careless goodhumour which even the koran has not been able to alter the leader of the newcomers was a greybeard a worn ascetic highnosed old man abrupt and fierce in his manner and soldierly in his bearing the dragoman groaned when he saw him and flapped his hands miserably with the air of a man who sees trouble accumulating upon trouble  it is the emir abderrahman said he i fear now that we shall never come to khartoum alive  the name meant nothing to the others but colonel cochrane had heard of him as a monster of cruelty and fanaticism a redhot moslem of the old fighting preaching dispensation who never hesitated to carry the fierce doctrines of the koran to their final conclusions he and the emir wad ibrahim conferred gravely together their camels side by side and their red turbans inclined inwards so that the black beard mingled with the white one then they both turned and stared long and fixedly at the poor headhanging huddle of prisoners the younger man pointed and explained while his senior listened with a sternly impassive face  whos that nicelooking old gentleman in the white beard asked miss adams who had been the first to rally from the bitter disappointment  that is their leader now cochrane answered  you dont say that he takes command over that other one  yes lady said the dragoman he is now the head of all  well thats good for us he puts me in mind of elder mathews who was at the presbyterian church in minister scotts time anyhow i had rather be in his power than in the hands of that blackhaired one with the flint eyes sadie dear you feel better now its cooler dont you  yes auntie dont you fret about me how are you yourself  well im stronger in faith than i was  they havent hurt you norah have they  i set you a poor example sadie for i was clean crazed at first at the suddenness of it all and at thinking of what your mother who trusted you to me would think about it my land therell be some headlines in the boston herald over this i guess somebody will have to suffer for it  poor mr stuart cried sadie as the monotonous droning voice of the delirious man came again to their ears come auntie and see if we cannot do something to relieve him  im uneasy about mrs shlesinger and the child said colonel cochrane i can see your wife belmont but i can see no one else  they are bringing her over cried he thank god we shall hear all about it they havent hurt you norah have they he ran forward to grasp and kiss the hand which his wife held down to him as he helped her from the camel  illustration they havent hurt you norah have they p139  the kind grey eyes and calm sweet face of the irishwoman brought comfort and hope to the whole party she was a devout roman catholic and it is a creed which forms an excellent prop in hours of danger to her to the anglican colonel to the nonconformist minister to the presbyterian american even to the two pagan black riflemen religion in its various forms was fulfilling the same beneficent officewhispering always that the worst which the world can do is a small thing and that however harsh the ways of providence may seem it is on the whole the wisest and best thing for us that we should go cheerfully whither the great hand guides us they had not a dogma in common these fellows in misfortune but they held the intimate deeplying spirit the calm essential fatalism which is the worldold framework of religion with fresh crops of dogmas growing like ephemeral lichens upon its granite surface  you poor things she said i can see that you have had a much worse time than i have no really john dear i am quite wellnot even very thirsty for our party filled their waterskins at the nile and they let me have as much as i wanted but i dont see mr headingly and mr brown and poor mr stuartwhat a state he has been reduced to  headingly and brown are out of their troubles her husband answered you dont know how often i have thanked god today norah that you were not with us and here you are after all  where should i be but by my husbands side i had much much rather be here than safe at haifa  has any news gone to the town asked the colonel  one boat escaped mrs shlesinger and her child and maid were in it i was downstairs in my cabin when the arabs rushed on to the vessel those on deck had time to escape for the boat was alongside i dont know whether any of them were hit the arabs fired at them for some time  did they cried belmont exultantly his responsive irish nature catching the sunshine in an instant then be jove well do them yet for the garrison must have heard the firing what dye think cochrane they must be full cry upon our scent this four hours any minute we might see the white puggaree of a british officer coming over that rise  but disappointment had left the colonel cold and sceptical  they need not come at all unless they come strong said he these fellows are picked men with good leaders and on their own ground they will take a lot of beating suddenly he paused and looked at the arabs by george said he thats a sight worth seeing  illustration hour of arab prayer p142  the great red sun was down with half its disc slipped behind the violet bank upon the horizon it was the hour of arab prayer an older and more learned civilisation would have turned to that magnificent thing upon the skyline and adored that but these wild children of the desert were nobler in essentials than the polished persian to them the ideal was higher than the material and it was with their backs to the sun and their faces to the central shrine of their religion that they prayed and how they prayed these fanatical moslems wrapt absorbed with yearning eyes and shining faces rising stooping grovelling with their foreheads upon their praying carpets who could doubt as he watched their strenuous heartwhole devotion that here was a great living power in the world reactionary but tremendous countless millions all thinking as one from cape juby to the confines of china let a common wave pass over them let a great soldier or organiser arise among them to use the grand material at his hand and who shall say that this may not be the besom with which providence may sweep the rotten decadent impossible halfhearted south of europe as it did a thousand years ago until it makes room for a sounder stock  and now as they rose to their feet the bugle rang out and the prisoners understood that having travelled all day they were fated to travel all night also belmont groaned for he had reckoned upon the pursuers catching them up before they left this camp but the others had already got into the way of accepting the inevitable a flat arab loaf had been given to each of themwhat effort of the chef of the postboat had ever tasted like that dry brown breadand then luxury of luxuries they had a second ration of a glass of water for the freshfilled bags of the newcomers had provided an ample supply if the body would but follow the lead of the soul as readily as the soul does that of the body what a heaven the earth might be now with their base material wants satisfied for the instant their spirits began to sing within them and they mounted their camels with some sense of the romance of their position mr stuart remained babbling upon the ground and the arabs made no effort to lift him into his saddle his large white upturned face glimmered through the gathering darkness  hi dragoman tell them that they are forgetting mr stuart cried the colonel  no use sir said mansoor they say that he is too fat and that they will not take him any farther he will die they say and why should they trouble about him  not take him cried cochrane why the man will perish of hunger and thirst wheres the emir hi he shouted as the blackbearded arab passed with a tone like that in which he used to summon a dilatory donkeyboy the chief did not deign to answer him but said something to one of the guards who dashed the butt of his remington into the colonels ribs  illustration the old soldier fell forward gasping p145  the old soldier fell forward gasping and was carried on half senseless clutching at the pommel of his saddle the women began to cry and the men with muttered curses and clenched hands writhed in that hell of impotent passion where brutal injustice and illusage have to go without check or even remonstrance belmont gripped at his hippocket for his little revolver and then remembered that he had already given it to miss adams if his hot hand had clutched it it would have meant the death of the emir and the massacre of the party  and now as they rode onwards they saw one of the most singular of the phenomena of the egyptian desert in front of them though the ill treatment of their companion had left them in no humour for appreciating its beauty when the sun had sunk the horizon had remained of a slatyviolet hue but now this began to lighten and to brighten until a curious false dawn developed and it seemed as if a vacillating sun was coming back along the path which it had just abandoned a rosy pink hung over the west with beautifully delicate seagreen tints along the upper edge of it slowly these faded into slate again and the night had come it was but twentyfour hours since they had sat in their canvas chairs discussing politics by starlight on the saloon deck of the korosko only twelve since they had breakfasted there and had started spruce and fresh upon their last pleasure trip what a world of fresh impressions had come upon them since then how rudely they had been jostled out of their takeitforgranted complacency the same shimmering silver stars as they had looked upon last night the same thin crescent of moonbut they what a chasm lay between that old pampered life and this  the long line of camels moved as noiselessly as ghosts across the desert before and behind were the silent swaying white figures of the arabs not a sound anywhere not the very faintest sound until far away behind them they heard a human voice singing in a strong droning unmusical fashion it had the strangest effect this faraway voice in that huge inarticulate wilderness and then there came a wellknown rhythm into that distant chant and they could almost hear the words we nightly pitch our moving tent a days march nearer home  was mr stuart in his right mind again or was it some coincidence of his delirium that he should have chosen this for his song with moist eyes his friends looked back through the darkness for well they knew that home was very near to this wanderer gradually the voice died away into a hum and was absorbed once more into the masterful silence of the desert  my dear old chap i hope youre not hurt said belmont laying his hand upon cochranes knee  the colonel had straightened himself though he still gasped a little in his breathing  i am all right again now would you kindly show me which was the man who struck me  it was the fellow in front therewith his camel beside fardets  the young fellow with the moustachei cant see him very well in this light but i think i could pick him out again thank you belmont  but i thought some of your ribs were gone  no it only knocked the wind out of me  you must be made of iron it was a frightful blow how could you rally from it so quickly  the colonel cleared his throat and hummed and stammered  the fact is my dear belmontim sure you would not let it go furtherabove all not to the ladies but i am rather older than i used to be and rather than lose the military carriage which has always been dear to me i  stays be jove cried the astonished irishman  well some slight artificial support said the colonel stiffly and switched the conversation off to the chances of the morrow  it still comes back in their dreams to those who are left that long nights march in the desert it was like a dream itself the silence of it as they were borne forward upon those soft shuffling sponge feet and the flitting flickering figures which oscillated upon every side of them the whole universe seemed to be hung as a monstrous timedial in front of them a star would glimmer like a lantern on the very level of their path they looked again and it was a handsbreadth up and another was shining beneath it hour after hour the broad stream flowed sedately across the deep blue background worlds and systems drifting majestically overhead and pouring over the dark horizon in their vastness and their beauty there was a vague consolation to the prisoners for their own fate and their own individuality seemed trivial and unimportant amid the play of such tremendous forces slowly the grand procession swept across the heaven first climbing then hanging long with little apparent motion and then sinking grandly downwards until away in the east the first cold grey glimmer appeared and their own haggard faces shocked each others sight  the day had tortured them with its heat and now the night had brought the even more intolerable discomfort of cold the arabs swathed themselves in their gowns and wrapped up their heads the prisoners beat their hands together and shivered miserably miss adams felt it most for she was very thin with the impaired circulation of age stephens slipped off his norfolk jacket and threw it over her shoulders he rode beside sadie and whistled and chatted to make her believe that her aunt was really relieving him by carrying his jacket for him but the attempt was too boisterous not to be obvious and yet it was so far true that he probably felt the cold less than any of the party for the old old fire was burning in his heart and a curious joy was inextricably mixed with all his misfortunes so that he would have found it hard to say if this adventure had been the greatest evil or the greatest blessing of his lifetime aboard the boat sadies youth her beauty her intelligence and humour all made him realise that she could at the best only be expected to charitably endure him but now he felt that he was really of some use to her that every hour she was learning to turn to him as one turns to ones natural protector and above all he had begun to find himselfto understand that there really was a strong reliable man behind all the tricks of custom which had built up an artificial nature which had imposed even upon himself a little glow of selfrespect began to warm his blood he had missed his youth when he was young and now in his middle age it was coming up like some beautiful belated flower  i do believe that you are all the time enjoying it mr stephens said sadie with some bitterness  i would not go so far as to say that he answered but i am quite certain that i would not leave you here  illustration certain that i would not leave you here p152  it was the nearest approach to tenderness which he had ever put into a speech and the girl looked at him in surprise  i think ive been a very wicked girl all my life she said after a pause because i have had a good time myself i never thought of those who were unhappy this has struck me serious if ever i get back i shall be a better womana more earnest womanin the future  and i a better man i suppose it is just for that that trouble comes to us look how it has brought out the virtues of all our friends take poor mr stuart for example should we ever have known what a noble constant man he was and see belmont and his wife in front of us there going fearlessly forward hand in hand thinking only of each other and cochrane who always seemed on board the boat to be a rather standoffish narrow sort of man look at his courage and his unselfish indignation when any one is ill used fardet too is as brave as a lion i think misfortune has done us all good  sadie sighed  yes if it would end right here one might say so but if it goes on and on for a few weeks or months of misery and then ends in death i dont know where we reap the benefit of those improvements of character which it brings suppose you escape what will you do  the lawyer hesitated but his professional instincts were still strong  i will consider whether an action lies and against whom it should be with the organisers of the expedition for taking us to the abousir rockor else with the egyptian government for not protecting their frontiers it will be a nice legal question and what will you do sadie  it was the first time that he had ever dropped the formal miss but the girl was too much in earnest to notice it  i will be more tender to others she said i will try to make some one else happy in memory of the miseries which i have endured  you have done nothing all your life but made others happy you cannot help doing it said he the darkness made it more easy for him to break through the reserve which was habitual with him you need this rough schooling far less than any of us how could your character be changed for the better  you show how little you know me i have been very selfish and thoughtless  at least you had no need for all these strong emotions you were sufficiently alive without them now it has been different with me  why did you need emotions mr stephens  because anything is better than stagnation pain is better than stagnation i have only just begun to live hitherto i have been a machine upon the earths surface i was a oneideaed man and a oneideaed man is only one remove from a dead man that is what i have only just begun to realise for all these years i have never been stirred never felt a real throb of human emotion pass through me i had no time for it i had observed it in others and i had vaguely wondered whether there was some want in me which prevented my sharing the experience of my fellowmortals but now these last few days have taught me how keenly i can livethat i can have warm hopes and deadly fearsthat i can hate and that i canwell that i can have every strong feeling which the soul can experience i have come to life i may be on the brink of the grave but at least i can say now that i have lived  and why did you lead this soulkilling life in england  i was ambitiousi wanted to get on and then there were my mother and my sisters to be thought of thank heaven here is the morning coming your aunt and you will soon cease to feel the cold  and you without your coat  oh i have a very good circulation i can manage very well in my shirtsleeves  and now the long cold weary night was over and the deep blueblack sky had lightened to a wonderful mauveviolet with the larger stars still glinting brightly out of it behind them the grey line had crept higher and higher deepening into a delicate rosepink with the fanlike rays of the invisible sun shooting and quivering across it then suddenly they felt its warm touch upon their backs and there were hard black shadows upon the sand in front of them the dervishes loosened their cloaks and proceeded to talk cheerily among themselves the prisoners also began to thaw and eagerly ate the doora which was served out for their breakfasts a short halt had been called and a cup of water handed to each  can i speak to you colonel cochrane asked the dragoman  no you cant snapped the colonel  but it is very importantall our safety may come from it  the colonel frowned and pulled at his moustache  well what is it he asked at last  you must trust to me for it is as much to me as to you to get back to egypt my wife and home and children are on one part and a slave for life upon the other you have no cause to doubt it  well go on  you know the black man who spoke with youthe one who had been with hicks  yes what of him  he has been speaking with me during the night i have had a long talk with him he said that he could not very well understand you nor you him and so he came to me  what did he say  he said that there were eight egyptian soldiers among the arabssix black and two fellaheen he said that he wished to have your promise that they should all have very good reward if they helped you to escape  of course they shall  they asked for one hundred egyptian pounds each  they shall have it  i told him that i would ask you but that i was sure that you would agree to it  what do they purpose to do  they could promise nothing but what they thought best was that they should ride their camels not very far from you so that if any chance should come they would be ready to take advantage  well you can go to him and promise two hundred pounds each if they will help us you do not think we could buy over some arabs  mansoor shook his head too much danger to try said he suppose you try and fail then that will be the end to all of us i will go tell what you have said he strolled off to where the old negro gunner was grooming his camel and waiting for his reply  the emirs had intended to halt for a halfhour at the most but the baggagecamels which bore the prisoners were so worn out with the long rapid march that it was clearly impossible that they should move for some time they had laid their long necks upon the ground which is the last symptom of fatigue the two chiefs shook their heads when they inspected them and the terrible old man looked with his hardlined rock features at the captives then he said something to mansoor whose face turned a shade more sallow as he listened  the emir abderrahman says that if you do not become moslem it is not worth while delaying the whole caravan in order to carry you upon the baggagecamels if it were not for you he says that we could travel twice as fast he wishes to know therefore once for ever if you will accept the koran then in the same tone as if he were still translating he continued you had far better consent for if you do not he will most certainly put you all to death  the unhappy prisoners looked at each other in despair the two emirs stood gravely watching them  for my part said cochrane i had as soon die now as be a slave in khartoum  what do you say norah asked belmont  if we die together john i dont think i shall be afraid  it is absurd that i should die for that in which i have never had belief said fardet and yet it is not possible for the honour of a frenchman that he should be converted in this fashion he drew himself up with his wounded wrist stuck into the front of his jacket je suis chrétien jy reste he cried a gallant falsehood in each sentence  what do you say mr stephens asked mansoor in a beseeching voice if one of you would change it might place them in a good humour i implore you that you do what they ask  no i cant said the lawyer quietly  well then you miss sadie you miss adams it is only just to say it once and you will be saved  oh auntie do you think we might whimpered the frightened girl would it be so very wrong if we said it  the old lady threw her arms round her  no no my own dear little sadie she whispered youll be strong you would just hate yourself for ever after keep your grip of me dear and pray if you find your strength is leaving you dont forget that your old aunt eliza has you all the time by the hand  for an instant they were heroic this line of dishevelled bedraggled pleasureseekers they were all looking death in the face and the closer they looked the less they feared him they were conscious rather of a feeling of curiosity together with the nervous tingling with which one approaches a dentists chair the dragoman made a motion of his hands and shoulders as one who has tried and failed the emir abderrahman said something to a negro who hurried away  what does he want a scissors for asked the colonel  he is going to hurt the women said mansoor with the same gesture of impotence  a cold chill fell upon them all they stared about them in helpless horror death in the abstract was one thing but these insufferable details were another each had been braced to endure any evil in his own person but their hearts were still soft for each other the women said nothing but the men were all buzzing together  theres the pistol miss adams said belmont  give it here we wont be tortured we wont stand it  offer them money mansoor offer them anything cried stephens look here ill turn mohammedan if theyll promise to leave the women alone after all it isnt bindingits under compulsion but i cant see the women hurt  no wait a bit stephens said the colonel we mustnt lose our heads i think i see a way out see here dragoman you tell that greybearded old devil that we know nothing about his cursed tinpot religion put it smooth when you translate it tell him that he cannot expect us to adopt it until we know what particular brand of rot it is that he wants us to believe tell him that if he will instruct us we are perfectly willing to listen to his teaching and you can add that any creed which turns out such beauties as him and that other bounder with the black beard must claim the attention of every one  with bows and suppliant sweepings of his hands the dragoman explained that the christians were already full of doubt and that it needed but a little more light of knowledge to guide them on to the path of allah the two emirs stroked their beards and gazed suspiciously at them then abderrahman spoke in his crisp stern fashion to the dragoman and the two strode away together an instant later the bugle rang out as a signal to mount  what he says is this mansoor explained as he rode in the middle of the prisoners we shall reach the wells by midday and there will be a rest his own moolah a very good and learned man will come to give you an hour of teaching at the end of that time you will choose one way or the other when you have chosen it will be decided whether you are to go to khartoum or to be put to death that is his last word  they wont take ransom  wad ibrahim would but the emir abderrahman is a terrible man i advise you to give in to him  what have you done yourself you are a christian too  mansoor blushed as deeply as his complexion would allow  i was yesterday morning perhaps i will be tomorrow morning i serve the lord as long as what he ask seem reasonable but this is very otherwise  he rode onwards amongst the guards with a freedom which showed that his change of faith had put him upon a very different footing to the other prisoners  so they were to have a reprieve of a few hours though they rode in that dark shadow of death which was closing in upon them  what is there in life that we should cling to it so it is not the pleasures for those whose hours are one long pain shrink away screaming when they see merciful death holding his soothing arms out for them it is not the associations for we will change all of them before we walk of our own free wills down that broad road which every son and daughter of man must tread is it the fear of losing the i that dear intimate i which we think we know so well although it is eternally doing things which surprise us is it that which makes the deliberate suicide cling madly to the bridgepier as the river sweeps him by or is it that nature is so afraid that all her weary workmen may suddenly throw down their tools and strike that she has invented this fashion of keeping them constant to their present work but there it is and all these tired harassed humiliated folk rejoiced in the few more hours of suffering which were left to them     chapter vii  there was nothing to show them as they journeyed onwards that they were not on the very spot that they had passed at sunset upon the evening before the region of fantastic black hills and orange sand which bordered the river had long been left behind and everywhere now was the same brown rolling gravelly plain the groundswell with the shining rounded pebbles upon its surface and the occasional little sprouts of sagegreen camelgrass behind and before it extended to where far away in front of them it sloped upwards towards a line of violet hills the sun was not high enough yet to cause the tropical shimmer and the wide landscape brown with its violet edging stood out with a hard clearness in that dry pure air the long caravan straggled along at the slow swing of the baggagecamels far out on the flanks rode the vedettes halting at every rise and peering backwards with their hands shading their eyes in the distance their spears and rifles seemed to stick out of them straight and thin like needles in knitting  how far do you suppose we are from the nile asked cochrane he rode with his chin on his shoulder and his eyes straining wistfully to the eastern skyline  a good fifty miles belmont answered  not so much as that said the colonel we could not have been moving more than fourteen or fifteen hours and a camel seldom goes more than two and a half miles an hour unless he is trotting that would give about forty miles but still it is i fear rather far for a rescue i dont know that we are much the better for this postponement what have we to hope for we may just as well take our gruel  never say die cried the cheery irishman theres plenty of time between this and midday hamilton and hedley of the camel corps are good boys and theyll be after us like a streak theyll have no baggagecamels to hold them back you can lay your life on that little did i think when i dined with them at mess that last night and they were telling me all their precautions against a raid that i should depend upon them for our lives  well well play the game out but im not very hopeful said cochrane of course we must keep the best face we can before the women i see that tippy tilly is as good as his word for those five niggers and the two brown johnnies must be the men he speaks of they all ride together and keep well up but i cant see how they are going to help us  ive got my pistol back whispered belmont and his square chin and strong mouth set like granite if they try any games on the women i mean to shoot them all three with my own hand and then well die with our minds easy  good man said cochrane and they rode on in silence none of them spoke much a curious dreamy irresponsible feeling crept over them it was as if they had all taken some narcotic drugthe merciful anodyne which nature uses when a great crisis has fretted the nerves too far they thought of their friends and of their past lives in the comprehensive way in which one views that which is completed a subtle sweetness mingled with the sadness of their fate they were filled with the quiet serenity of despair  its devilish pretty said the colonel looking about him i always had an idea that i should like to die in a real good yellow london fog you couldnt change for the worse  i should have liked to have died in my sleep said sadie how beautiful to wake up and find yourself in the other world there was a piece that hetty smith used to say at the college say not goodnight but in some brighter world wish me goodmorning  the puritan aunt shook her head at the idea its a terrible thing to go unprepared into the presence of your maker said she  its the loneliness of death that is terrible said mrs belmont if we and those whom we loved all passed over simultaneously we should think no more of it than of changing our house  if the worst comes to the worst we wont be lonely said her husband well all go together and we shall find brown and headingly and stuart waiting on the other side  the frenchman shrugged his shoulders he had no belief in survival after death but he envied the two catholics the quiet way in which they took things for granted he chuckled to think of what his friends in the café cubat would say if they learned that he had laid down his life for the christian faith sometimes it amused and sometimes it maddened him and he rode onwards with alternate gusts of laughter and of fury nursing his wounded wrist all the time like a mother with a sick baby  across the brown of the hard pebbly desert there had been visible for some time a single long thin yellow streak extending north and south as far as they could see it was a band of sand not more than a few hundred yards across and rising at the highest to eight or ten feet but the prisoners were astonished to observe that the arabs pointed at this with an air of the utmost concern and they halted when they came to the edge of it like men upon the brink of an unfordable river it was very light dusty sand and every wandering breath of wind sent it dancing into the air like a whirl of midges the emir abderrahman tried to force his camel into it but the creature after a step or two stood still and shivered with terror  illustration the creature stood still p171  the two chiefs talked for a little and then the whole caravan trailed off with their heads for the north and the streak of sand upon their left  what is it asked belmont who found the dragoman riding at his elbow why are we going out of our course  drift sand mansoor answered every sometimes the wind bring it all in one long place like that tomorrow if a wind comes perhaps there will not be one grain left but all will be carried up into the air again an arab will sometimes have to go fifty or a hundred miles to go round a drift suppose he tries to cross his camel breaks its legs and he himself is sucked in and swallowed  how long will this be  no one can say  well cochrane its all in our favour the longer the chase the better chance for the fresh camels and for the hundredth time he looked back at the long hard skyline behind them there was the great empty duncoloured desert but where the glint of steel or the twinkle of white helmet for which he yearned  and soon they cleared the obstacle in their front it spindled away into nothing as a streak of dust would which has been blown across an empty room it was curious to see that when it was so narrow that one could almost jump it the arabs would still go for many hundreds of yards rather than risk the crossing then with good hard country before them once more the tired beasts were whipped up and they ambled on with a doublejointed jogtrot which set the prisoners nodding and bowing in grotesque and ludicrous misery it was fun at first and they smiled at each other but soon the fun had become tragedy as the terrible camelache seized them by spine and waist with its deep dull throb which rises gradually to a splitting agony  i cant stand it sadie cried miss adams suddenly ive done my best im going to fall  no no auntie youll break your limbs if you do hold up just a little and maybe theyll stop  lean back and hold your saddle behind said the colonel there youll find that will ease the strain he took the puggaree from his hat and tying the ends together he slung it over her front pommel put your foot in the loop said he it will steady you like a stirrup  the relief was instant so stephens did the same for sadie but presently one of the weary doora camels came down with a crash its limbs starred out as if it had split asunder and the caravan had to come down to its old sober gait  is this another belt of drift sand asked the colonel presently  no its white said belmont here mansoor what is that in front of us  but the dragoman shook his head  i dont know what it is sir i never saw the same thing before  right across the desert from north to south there was drawn a white line as straight and clear as if it had been slashed with chalk across a brown table it was very thin but it extended without a break from horizon to horizon tippy tilly said something to the dragoman  its the great caravan route said mansoor  illustration the great caravan route p 174  what makes it white then  the bones  it seemed incredible and yet it was true for as they drew nearer they saw that it was indeed a beaten track across the desert hollowed out by long usage and so covered with bones that they gave the impression of a continuous white ribbon long snouty heads were scattered everywhere and the lines of ribs were so continuous that it looked in places like the framework of a monstrous serpent the endless road gleamed in the sun as if it were paved with ivory for thousands of years this had been the highway over the desert and during all that time no animal of all those countless caravans had died there without being preserved by the dry antiseptic air no wonder then that it was hardly possible to walk down it now without treading upon their skeletons  this must be the route i spoke of said stephens i remember marking it upon the map i made for you miss adams baedeker says that it has been disused on account of the cessation of all trade which followed the rise of the dervishes but that it used to be the main road by which the skins and gums of darfur found their way down to lower egypt  they looked at it with a listless curiosity for there was enough to engross them at present in their own fates the caravan struck to the south along the old desert track and this golgotha of a road seemed to be a fitting avenue for that which awaited them at the end of it weary camels and weary riders dragged on together towards their miserable goal  and now as the critical moment approached which was to decide their fate colonel cochrane weighed down by his fears lest something terrible should befall the women put his pride aside to the extent of asking the advice of the renegade dragoman the fellow was a villain and a coward but at least he was an oriental and he understood the arab point of view his change of religion had brought him into closer contact with the dervishes and he had overheard their intimate talk cochranes stiff aristocratic nature fought hard before he could bring himself to ask advice from such a man and when he at last did so it was in the gruffest and most unconciliatory voice  you know the rascals and you have the same way of looking at things said he our object is to keep things going for another twentyfour hours after that it does not much matter what befalls us for we shall be out of the reach of rescue but how can we stave them off for another day  you know my advice the dragoman answered i have already answered it to you if you will all become as i have you will certainly be carried to khartoum alive if you do not you will never leave our next campingplace alive  the colonels wellcurved nose took a higher tilt and an angry flush reddened his thin cheeks he rode in silence for a little for his indian service had left him with a curriedprawn temper which had had an extra touch of cayenne added to it by his recent experiences it was some minutes before he could trust himself to reply  well set that aside said he at last  some things are possible and some are not this is not  you need only pretend  thats enough said the colonel abruptly  mansoor shrugged his shoulders  what is the use of asking me if you become angry when i answer if you do not wish to do what i say then try your own attempt at least you cannot say that i have not done all i could to save you  im not angry the colonel answered after a pause in a more conciliatory voice but this is climbing down rather farther than we care to go now what i thought is this you might if you chose give this priest or moolah who is coming to us a hint that we really are softening a bit upon the point i dont think considering the hole that we are in that there can be very much objection to that then when he comes we might play up and take an interest and ask for more instruction and in that way hold the matter over for a day or two dont you think that would be the best game  you will do as you like said mansoor i have told you once for ever what i think if you wish that i speak to the moolah i will do so it is the fat little man with the grey beard upon the brown camel in front there i may tell you that he has a name among them for converting the infidel and he has a great pride in it so that he would certainly prefer that you were not injured if he thought that he might bring you into islam  tell him that our minds are open then said the colonel i dont suppose the padre would have gone so far but now that he is dead i think we may stretch a point you go to him mansoor and if you work it well we will agree to forget what is past by the way has tippy tilly said anything  no sir he has kept his men together but he does not understand yet how he can help you  neither do i well you go to the moolah and ill tell the others what we have agreed  the prisoners all acquiesced in the colonels plan with the exception of the old new england lady who absolutely refused even to show any interest in the mohammedan creed i guess i am too old to bow the knee to baal she said the most that she would concede was that she would not openly interfere with anything which her companions might say or do  and who is to argue with the priest asked fardet as they all rode together talking the matter over it is very important that it should be done in a natural way for if he thought that we were only trying to gain time he would refuse to have any more to say to us  i think cochrane should do it as the proposal is his said belmont  pardon me cried the frenchman i will not say a word against our friend the colonel but it is not possible that a man should be fitted for everything it will all come to nothing if he attempts it the priest will see through the colonel  will he said the colonel with dignity  yes my friend he will for like most of your countrymen you are very wanting in sympathy for the ideas of other people and it is the great fault which i find with you as a nation  oh drop the politics cried belmont impatiently  i do not talk politics what i say is very practical how can colonel cochrane pretend to this priest that he is really interested in his religion when in effect there is no religion in the world to him outside some little church in which he has been born and bred i will say this for the colonel that i do not believe he is at all a hypocrite and i am sure that he could not act well enough to deceive such a man as this priest  the colonel sat with a very stiff back and the blank face of a man who is not quite sure whether he is being complimented or insulted  you can do the talking yourself if you like said he at last i should be very glad to be relieved of it  i think that i am best fitted for it since i am equally interested in all creeds when i ask for information it is because in verity i desire it and not because i am playing a part  i certainly think that it would be much better if monsieur fardet would undertake it said mrs belmont with decision and so the matter was arranged  the sun was now high and it shone with dazzling brightness upon the bleached bones which lay upon the road again the torture of thirst fell upon the little group of survivors and again as they rode with withered tongues and crusted lips a vision of the saloon of the korosko danced like a mirage before their eyes and they saw the white napery the winecards by the places the long necks of the bottles the siphons upon the sideboard sadie who had borne up so well became suddenly hysterical and her shrieks of senseless laughter jarred horribly upon their nerves her aunt on one side of her and mr stephens on the other did all they could to soothe her and at last the weary overstrung girl relapsed into something between a sleep and a faint hanging limp over her pommel and only kept from falling by the friends who clustered round her the baggagecamels were as weary as their riders and again and again they had to jerk at their noseropes to prevent them from lying down from horizon to horizon stretched that one hugh arch of speckless blue and up its monstrous concavity crept the inexorable sun like some splendid but barbarous deity who claimed a tribute of human suffering as his immemorial right  their course still lay along the old trade route but their progress was very slow and more than once the two emirs rode back together and shook their heads as they looked at the weary baggagecamels on which the prisoners were perched the greatest laggard of all was one which was ridden by a wounded soudanese soldier it was limping badly with a strained tendon and it was only by constant prodding that it could be kept with the others the emir wad ibraham raised his remington as the creature hobbled past and sent a bullet through its brain the wounded man flew forwards out of the high saddle and fell heavily upon the hard track his companions in misfortune looking back saw him stagger to his feet with a dazed face at the same instant a baggara slipped down from his camel with a sword in his hand  illustration sword in his hand p184  dont look dont look cried belmont to the ladies and they all rode on with their faces to the south they heard no sound but the baggara passed them a few minutes afterwards he was cleaning his sword upon the hairy neck of his camel and he glanced at them with a quick malicious gleam of his teeth as he trotted by but those who are at the lowest pitch of human misery are at least secured against the future that vicious threatening smile which might once have thrilled them left them now unmovedor stirred them at most to vague resentment  there were many things to interest them in this old trade route had they been in a condition to take notice of them here and there along its course were the crumbling remains of ancient buildings so old that no date could be assigned to them but designed in some faroff civilisation to give the travellers shade from the sun or protection from the everlawless children of the desert the mud bricks with which these refuges were constructed showed that the material had been carried over from the distant nile once upon the top of a little knoll they saw the shattered plinth of a pillar of red assouan granite with the widewinged symbol of the egyptian god across it and the cartouche of the second rameses beneath after three thousand years one cannot get away from the ineffaceable footprints of the warriorking it is surely the most wonderful survival of history that one should still be able to gaze upon him highnosed and masterful as he lies with his powerful arms crossed upon his chest majestic even in decay in the gizeh museum to the captives the cartouche was a message of hope as a sign that they were not outside the sphere of egypt theyve left their card here once and they may again said belmont and they all tried to smile  and now they came upon one of the most satisfying sights on which the human eye can ever rest here and there in the depressions at either side of the road there had been a thin scurf of green which meant that water was not very far from the surface and then quite suddenly the track dipped down into a bowlshaped hollow with a most dainty group of palmtrees and a lovely greensward at the bottom of it the sun gleaming upon that brilliant patch of clear restful colour with the dark glow of the bare desert around it made it shine like the purest emerald in a setting of burnished copper and then it was not its beauty only but its promise for the future water shade all that weary travellers could ask for even sadie was revived by the cheery sight and the spent camels snorted and stepped out more briskly stretching their long necks and sniffing the air as they went after the unhomely harshness of the desert it seemed to all of them that they had never seen anything more beautiful than this they looked below at the greensward with the dark starlike shadows of the palmcrowns and then they looked up at those deep green leaves against the rich blue of the sky and they forgot their impending death in the beauty of that nature to whose bosom they were about to return  the wells in the centre of the grove consisted of seven large and two small saucerlike cavities filled with peatcoloured water enough to form a plentiful supply for any caravan camels and men drank it greedily though it was tainted by the allpervading natron the camels were picketed the arabs threw their sleepingmats down in the shade and the prisoners after receiving a ration of dates and of doora were told that they might do what they would during the heat of the day and that the moolah would come to them before sunset the ladies were given the thicker shade of an acacia tree and the men lay down under the palms the great green leaves swished slowly above them they heard the low hum of the arab talk and the dull champing of the camels and then in an instant by that most mysterious and least understood of miracles one was in a green irish valley and another saw the long straight line of commonwealth avenue and a third was dining at a little round table opposite to the bust of nelson in the army and navy club and for him the swishing of the palm branches had been transformed into the longdrawn hum of pall mall so the spirits went their several ways wandering back along strange untraced tracks of the memory while the weary grimy bodies lay senseless under the palmtrees in the oasis of the libyan desert  illustration grimy bodies lay senseless under the palmtrees p188     chapter viii  colonel cochrane was awakened from his slumber by some one pulling at his shoulder as his eyes opened they fell upon the black anxious face of tippy tilly the old egyptian gunner his crooked finger was laid upon his thick livercoloured lips and his dark eyes glanced from left to right with ceaseless vigilance  lie quiet do not move he whispered in arabic i will lie here beside you and they cannot tell me from the others you can understand what i am saying  yes if you will talk slowly  very good i have no great trust in this black man mansoor i had rather talk direct with the miralai  what have you to say  i have waited long until they should all be asleep and now in another hour we shall be called to evening prayer first of all here is a pistol that you may not say that you are without arms  it was a clumsy oldfashioned thing but the colonel saw the glint of a percussioncap upon the nipple and knew that it was loaded he slipped it into the inner pocket of his norfolk jacket  thank you said he speak slowly so that i may understand you  there are eight of us who wish to go to egypt there are also four men in your party one of us mehemet ali has fastened twelve camels together which are the fastest of all save only those which are ridden by the emirs there are guards upon watch but they are scattered in all directions the twelve camels are close beside us herethose twelve behind the acaciatree if we can only get mounted and started i do not think that many can overtake us and we shall have our rifles for them the guards are not strong enough to stop so many of us the waterskins are all filled and we may see the nile again by tomorrow night  the colonel could not follow it all that is excellent said he but what are we to do about the three ladies  the black soldier shrugged his shoulders  mefeesh said he one of them is old and in any case there are plenty more women if we get back to egypt these will not come to any hurt but they will be placed in the harem of the khalija  what you say is nonsense said the colonel sternly we shall take our women with us or we shall not go at all  i think it is rather you who talk the thing without sense the black man answered angrily how can you ask my companions and me to do that which must end in failure for years we have waited for such a chance as this and now that it has come you wish us to throw it away owing to this foolishness about the women  he understood enough to set a little spring of hope bubbling in his heart the last terrible day had left its mark in his livid face and his hair which was turning rapidly to grey he might have been the father of the spruce wellpreserved soldier who had paced with straight back and military stride up and down the saloon deck of the korosko  what have we promised you if we come back to egypt asked cochrane  two hundred egyptian pounds and promotion in the armyall upon the word of an englishman  very good then you shall have three hundred each if you can make some new plan by which you can take the women with you  tippy tilly scratched his woolly head in his perplexity  we might indeed upon some excuse bring three more of the faster camels round to this place indeed there are three very good camels among those which are near the cookingfire but how are we to get the women upon themand if we had them upon them we know very well that they would fall off when they began to gallop i fear that you men will fall off for it is no easy matter to remain upon a galloping camel but as to the women it is impossible no we shall leave the women and if you will not leave the women then we shall leave all of you and start by ourselves  very good go said the colonel abruptly and settled down as if to sleep once more he knew that with orientals it is the silent man who is most likely to have his way  the negro turned and crept away for some little distance where he was met by one of his fellaheen comrades mehemet ali who had charge of the camels the two argued for some little timefor those three hundred golden pieces were not to be lightly resigned then the negro crept back to colonel cochrane  mehemet ali has agreed said he he has gone to put the noserope upon three more of the camels but it is foolishness and we are all going to our death now come with me and we shall awaken the women and tell them  the colonel shook his companions and whispered to them what was in the wind belmont and fardet were ready for any risk stephens to whom the prospect of a passive death presented little terror was seized with a convulsion of fear when he thought of any active exertion to avoid it and shivered in all his long thin limbs then he pulled out his baedeker and began to write his will upon the flyleaf but his hand twitched so that he was hardly legible by some strange gymnastic of the legal mind a death even by violence if accepted quietly had a place in the established order of things while a death which overtook one galloping frantically over a desert was wholly irregular and discomposing it was not dissolution which he feared but the humiliation and agony of a fruitless struggle against it  colonel cochrane and tippy tilly had crept together under the shadow of the great acacia tree to the spot where the women were lying sadie and her aunt lay with their arms round each other the girls head pillowed upon the old womans bosom mrs belmont was awake and entered into the scheme in an instant  but you must leave me said miss adams earnestly what does it matter at my age anyhow  no no aunt eliza i wont move without you dont you think it cried the girl youve got to come straight away or else we both stay right here where we are  come come maam there is no time for arguing said the colonel roughly our lives all depend upon your making an effort and we cannot possibly leave you behind  but i will fall off  ill tie you on with my puggaree i wish i had the cummerbund which i lent poor stuart now tippy i think we might make a break for it  but the black soldier had been staring with a disconsolate face out over the desert and he turned upon his heel with an oath  there said he sullenly you see what comes of all your foolish talking you have ruined our chances as well as your own  half a dozen mounted camelmen had appeared suddenly over the lip of the bowlshaped hollow standing out hard and clear against the evening sky where the copper basin met its great blue lid they were travelling fast and waved their rifles as they came an instant later the bugle sounded an alarm and the camp was up with a buzz like an overturned beehive the colonel ran back to his companions and the black soldier to his camel stephens looked relieved and belmont sulky while monsieur fardet raved with his one uninjured hand in the air  sacred name of a dog he cried is there no end to it then are we never to come out of the hands of these accursed dervishes  oh they really are dervishes are they said the colonel in an acid voice you seem to be altering your opinions i thought they were an invention of the british government  the poor fellows tempers were getting frayed and thin the colonels sneer was like a match to a magazine and in an instant the frenchman was dancing in front of him with a broken torrent of angry words his hand was clutching at cochranes throat before belmont and stephens could pull him off  if it were not for your grey hairs he said  damn your impudence cried the colonel  if we have to die let us die like gentlemen and not like so many cornerboys said belmont with dignity  i only said i was glad to see that monsieur fardet had learned something from his adventures the colonel sneered  shut up cochrane what do you want to aggravate him for cried the irishman  upon my word belmont you forget yourself i do not permit people to address me in this fashion  you should look after your own manners then  gentlemen gentlemen here are the ladies cried stephens and the angry overstrained men relapsed into a gloomy silence pacing up and down and jerking viciously at their moustaches it is a very catching thing illtemper for even stephens began to be angry at their anger and to scowl at them as they passed him here they were at a crisis in their fate with the shadow of death above them and yet their minds were all absorbed in some personal grievance so slight that they could hardly put it into words misfortune brings the human spirit to a rare height but the pendulum still swings  but soon their attention was drawn away to more important matters a council of war was being held beside the wells and the two emirs stern and composed were listening to a voluble report from the leader of the patrol the prisoners noticed that though the fierce old man stood like a graven image the younger emir passed his hand over his beard once or twice with a nervous gesture the thin brown fingers twitching among the long black hair  i believe the gippies are after us said belmont not very far off either to judge by the fuss they are making  it looks like it something has scared them  now hes giving orders what can it be here mansoor what is the matter  the dragoman came running up with the light of hope shining upon his brown face  i think they have seen something to frighten them i believe that the soldiers are behind us they have given the order to fill the waterskins and be ready for a start when the darkness comes but i am ordered to gather you together for the moolah is coming to convert you all i have already told him that you are all very much inclined to think the same with him  how far mansoor may have gone with his assurances may never be known but the mussulman preacher came walking towards them at this moment with a paternal and contented smile upon his face as one who has a pleasant and easy task before him he was a oneeyed man with a fringe of grizzled beard and a face which was fat but which looked as if it had once been fatter for it was marked with many folds and creases he had a green turban upon his head which marked him as a mecca pilgrim in one hand he carried a small brown carpet and in the other a parchment copy of the koran laying his carpet upon the ground he motioned mansoor to his side and then gave a circular sweep of his arm to signify that the prisoners should gather round him and a downward wave which meant that they should be seated so they grouped themselves round him sitting on the short green sward under the palmtree these seven forlorn representatives of an alien creed and in the midst of them sat the fat little preacher his one eye dancing from face to face as he expounded the principles of his newer cruder and more earnest faith they listened attentively and nodded their heads as mansoor translated the exhortation and with each sign of their acquiescence the moolah became more amiable in his manner and more affectionate in his speech  for why should you die my sweet lambs when all that is asked of you is that you should set aside that which will carry you to everlasting gehenna and accept the law of allah as written by his prophet which will assuredly bring you unimaginable joys as is promised in the book of the camel for what says the chosen oneand he broke away into one of those dogmatic texts which pass in every creed as an argument besides is it not clear that god is with us since from the beginning when we had but sticks against the rifles of the turks victory has always been with us have we not taken el obeid and taken khartoum and destroyed hicks and slain gordon and prevailed against every one who has come against us how then can it be said that the blessing of allah does not rest upon us  the colonel had been looking about him during the long exhortation of the moolah and he had observed that the dervishes were cleaning their guns counting their cartridges and making all the preparations of men who expected that they might soon be called upon to fight the two emirs were conferring together with grave faces and the leader of the patrol pointed as he spoke to them in the direction of egypt it was evident that there was at least a chance of a rescue if they could only keep things going for a few more hours the camels were not recovered yet from their long march and the pursuers if they were indeed close behind were almost certain to overtake them  for gods sake fardet try and keep him in play said he i believe we have a chance if we can only keep the ball rolling for another hour or so  but a frenchmans wounded dignity is not so easily appeased monsieur fardet sat moodily with his back against the palmtree and his black brows drawn down he said nothing but he still pulled at his thick strong moustache  come on fardet we depend upon you said belmont  let colonel cochrane do it the frenchman answered snappishly he takes too much upon himself this colonel cochrane  there there said belmont soothingly as if he were speaking to a fractious child i am quite sure that the colonel will express his regret at what has happened and will acknowledge that he was in the wrong  ill do nothing of the sort snapped the colonel  besides that is merely a personal quarrel belmont continued hastily it is for the good of the whole party that we wish you to speak with the moolah because we all feel that you are the best man for the job  but the frenchman only shrugged his shoulders and relapsed into a deeper gloom  the moolah looked from one to the other and the kindly expression began to fade away from his large baggy face his mouth drew down at the corners and became hard and severe  have these infidels been playing with us then said he to the dragoman why is it that they talk among themselves and have nothing to say to me  he is getting impatient about it said cochrane perhaps i had better do what i can belmont since this damned fellow has left us in the lurch  but the ready wit of a woman saved the situation  i am sure monsieur fardet said mrs belmont that you who are a frenchman and therefore a man of gallantry and honour would not permit your own wounded feelings to interfere with the fulfilment of your promise and your duty towards three helpless ladies  fardet was on his feet in an instant with his hand over his heart  you understand my nature madame he cried i am incapable of abandoning a lady i will do all that i can in this matter now mansoor you may tell the holy man that i am ready to discuss through you the high matters of his faith with him  and he did it with an ingenuity which amazed his companions he took the tone of a man who is strongly attracted and yet has one single remaining shred of doubt to hold him back yet as that one shred was torn away by the moolah there was always some other stubborn little point which prevented his absolute acceptance of the faith of islam and his questions were all so mixed up with personal compliments to the priest and selfcongratulations that they should have come under the teachings of so wise a man and so profound a theologian that the hanging pouches under the moolahs eyes quivered with his satisfaction and he was led happily and hopefully onwards from explanation to explanation while the blue overhead turned into violet and the green leaves into black until the great serene stars shone out once more between the crowns of the palmtrees  as to the learning of which you speak my lamb said the moolah in answer to some argument of fardets i have myself studied at the university of el azhar at cairo and i know that to which you allude but the learning of the faithful is not as the learning of the unbeliever and it is not fitting that we pry too deeply into the ways of allah some stars have tails o my sweet lamb and some have not but what does it profit us to know which are which for god made them all and they are very safe in his hands therefore my friend be not puffed up by the foolish learning of the west and understand that there is only one wisdom which consists in following the will of allah as his chosen prophet has laid it down for us in this book and now my lambs i see that you are ready to come into islam and it is time for that bugle tells that we are about to march and it was the order of the excellent emir abderrahman that your choice should be taken one way or the other before ever we left the wells  yet my father there are other points upon which i would gladly have instruction said the frenchman for indeed it is a pleasure to hear your clear words after the cloudy accounts which we have had from other teachers  but the moolah had risen and a gleam of suspicion twinkled in his single eye  this further instruction may well come afterwards said he since we shall travel together as far as khartoum and it will be a joy to me to see you grow in wisdom and in virtue as we go he walked over to the fire and stooping down with the pompous slowness of a stout man he returned with two halfcharred sticks which he laid crosswise upon the ground the dervishes came clustering over to see the new converts admitted into the fold they stood round in the dim light tall and fantastic with the high necks and supercilious heads of the camels swaying above them  now said the moolah and his voice had lost its conciliatory and persuasive tone there is no more time for you here upon the ground i have made out of two sticks the foolish and superstitious symbol of your former creed you will trample upon it as a sign that you renounce it and you will kiss the koran as a sign that you accept it and what more you need in the way of instruction shall be given to you as you go  they stood up the four men and the three women to meet the crisis of their fate none of them except perhaps miss adams and mrs belmont had any deep religious convictions all of them were children of this world and some of them disagreed with everything which that symbol upon the earth represented but there was the european pride the pride of the white race which swelled within them and held them to the faith of their countrymen it was a sinful human unchristian motive and yet it was about to make them public martyrs to the christian creed in the hush and tension of their nerves low sounds grew suddenly loud upon their ears those swishing palmleaves above them were like a swiftflowing river and far away they could hear the dull soft thudding of a galloping camel  theres something coming whispered cochrane try and stave them off for five minutes longer fardet  the frenchman stepped out with a courteous wave of his uninjured arm and the air of a man who is prepared to accommodate himself to anything  you will tell this holy man that i am quite ready to accept his teaching and so i am sure are all my friends said he to the dragoman but there is one thing which i should wish him to do in order to set at rest any possible doubts which may remain in our hearts every true religion can be told by the miracles which those who profess it can bring about even i who am but a humble christian can by virtue of my religion do some of these but you since your religion is superior can no doubt do far more and so i beg you to give us a sign that we may be able to say that we know that the religion of islam is the more powerful  behind all his dignity and reserve the arab has a good fund of curiosity the hush among the listening arabs showed how the words of the frenchman as translated by mansoor appealed to them  such things are in the hands of allah said the priest it is not for us to disturb his laws but if you have yourself such powers as you claim let us be witnesses to them  illustration took a large shining date out of the moolahs beard p210  the frenchman stepped forward and raising his hand he took a large shining date out of the moolahs beard this he swallowed and immediately produced once more from his left elbow he had often given his little conjuring entertainment on board the boat and his fellowpassengers had had some goodnatured laughter at his expense for he was not quite skilful enough to deceive the critical european intelligence but now it looked as if this piece of obvious palming might be the point upon which all their fates would hang a deep hum of surprise rose from the ring of arabs and deepened as the frenchman drew another date from the nostril of a camel and tossed it into the air from which apparently it never descended that gaping sleeve was obvious enough to his companions but the dim light was all in favour of the performer so delighted and interested was the audience that they paid little heed to a mounted camelman who trotted swiftly between the palm trunks all might have been well had not fardet carried away by his own success tried to repeat his trick once more with the result that the date fell out of his palm and the deception stood revealed in vain he tried to pass on at once to another of his little stock the moolah said something and an arab struck fardet across the shoulders with the thick shaft of his spear  we have had enough childs play said the angry priest are we men or babes that you should try to impose upon us in this manner here is the cross and the koranwhich shall it be  fardet looked helplessly round at his companions  i can do no more you asked for five minutes you have had them said he to colonel cochrane  and perhaps it is enough the soldier answered here are the emirs  the camelman whose approach they had heard from afar had made for the two arab chiefs and had delivered a brief report to them stabbing with his forefinger in the direction from which he had come there was a rapid exchange of words between the emirs and then they strode forward together to the group around the prisoners bigots and barbarians they were none the less two most majestic men as they advanced through the twilight of the palm grove the fierce old greybeard raised his hand and spoke swiftly in short abrupt sentences and his savage followers yelped to him like hounds to a huntsman the fire that smouldered in his arrogant eyes shone back at him from a hundred others here were to be read the strength and danger of the mahdi movement here in these convulsed faces in that fringe of waving arms in these frantic redhot souls who asked nothing better than a bloody death if their own hands might be bloody when they met it  have the prisoners embraced the true faith asked the emir abderrahman looking at them with his cruel eyes  the moolah had his reputation to preserve and it was not for him to confess to a failure  they were about to embrace it when  let it rest for a little time o moolah he gave an order and the arabs all sprang for their camels the emir wad ibrahim filed off at once with nearly half the party the others were mounted and ready with their rifles unslung  whats happened asked belmont  things are looking up cried the colonel by george i think we are going to come through all right the gippy camel corps are hot on our trail  how do you know  what else could have scared them  o colonel do you really think we shall be saved sobbed sadie the dull routine of misery through which they had passed had deadened all their nerves until they seemed incapable of any acute sensation but now this sudden return of hope brought agony with it like the recovery of a frostbitten limb even the strong selfcontained belmont was filled with doubts and apprehensions he had been hopeful when there was no sign of relief and now the approach of it set him trembling  surely they wouldnt come very weak he cried be jove if the commandant let them come weak he should be courtmartialled  sure were in gods hands anyway said his wife in her soothing irish voice kneel down with me john dear if its the last time and pray that earth or heaven we may not be divided  dont do that dont cried the colonel anxiously for he saw that the eye of the moolah was upon them but it was too late for the two roman catholics had dropped upon their knees and crossed themselves a spasm of fury passed over the face of the mussulman priest at this public testimony to the failure of his missionary efforts he turned and said something to the emir  illustration stand up cried mansoor p214  stand up cried mansoor for your lifes sake stand up he is asking for leave to put you to death  let him do what he likes said the obstinate irishman we will rise when our prayers are finished and not before  the emir stood listening to the moolah with his baleful gaze upon the two kneeling figures then he gave one or two rapid orders and four camels were brought forward the baggagecamels which they had hitherto ridden were standing unsaddled where they had been tethered  dont be a fool belmont cried the colonel everything depends upon our humouring them do get up mrs belmont you are only putting their backs up  the frenchman shrugged his shoulders as he looked at them mon dieu he cried were there ever such impracticable people voilà he added with a shriek as the two american ladies fell upon their knees beside mrs belmont it is like the camelsone down all down was ever anything so absurd  but mr stephens had knelt down beside sadie and buried his haggard face in his long thin hands only the colonel and monsieur fardet remained standing cochrane looked at the frenchman with an interrogative eye  after all said he it is stupid to pray all your life and not to pray now when we have nothing to hope for except through the goodness of providence he dropped upon his knees with a rigid military back but his grizzled unshaven chin upon his chest the frenchman looked at his kneeling companions and then his eyes travelled onwards to the angry faces of the emir and moolah  sapristi he growled do they suppose that a frenchman is afraid of them and so with an ostentatious sign of the cross he took his place upon his knees beside the others foul bedraggled and wretched the seven figures knelt and waited humbly for their fate under the black shadow of the palmtree  the emir turned to the moolah with a mocking smile and pointed at the results of his ministrations then he gave an order and in an instant the four men were seized  a couple of deft turns with a camelhalter secured each of their wrists fardet screamed out for the rope had bitten into his open wound the others took it with the dignity of despair  you have ruined everything i believe you have ruined me also cried mansoor wringing his hands the women are to get upon these three camels  never cried belmont we wont be separated he plunged madly but he was weak from privation and two strong men held him by each elbow  illustration dont fret john cried his wife p217  dont fret john cried his wife as they hurried her towards the camel no harm shall come to me dont struggle or theyll hurt you dear  the four men writhed as they saw the women dragged away from them all their agonies had been nothing to this sadie and her aunt appeared to be half senseless from fear only mrs belmont kept a brave face when they were seated the camels rose and were led under the tree behind where the four men were standing  ive a pistol in me pocket said belmont looking up at his wife i would give me soul to be able to pass it to you  keep it john and it may be useful yet i have no fears ever since we prayed i have felt as if our guardian angels had their wings round us she was like a guardian angel herself as she turned to the shrinking sadie and coaxed some little hope back into her despairing heart  the short thick arab who had been in command of wad ibrahims rearguard had joined the emir and the moolah the three consulted together with occasional oblique glances towards the prisoners then the emir spoke to mansoor  the chief wishes to know which of you four is the richest man said the dragoman his fingers were twitching with nervousness and plucking incessantly at the front of his covercoat  why does he wish to know asked the colonel  i do not know  but it is evident cried monsieur fardet  he wishes to know which is the best worth keeping for his ransom  i think we should see this thing through together said the colonel its really for you to decide stephens for i have no doubt that you are the richest of us  i dont know that i am the lawyer answered but in any case i have no wish to be placed upon a different footing to the others  the emir spoke again in his harsh rasping voice  he says mansoor translated that the baggagecamels are spent and that there is only one beast left which can keep up it is ready now for one of you and you have to decide among yourselves which is to have it if one is richer than the others he will have the preference  tell him that we are all equally rich  in that case he says that you are to choose at once which is to have the camel  and the others  the dragoman shrugged his shoulders  well said the colonel if only one of us is to escape i think you fellows will agree with me that it ought to be belmont since he is the married man  yes yes let it be monsieur belmont cried fardet  i think so also said stephens  but the irishman would not hear of it  no no share and share alike he cried all sink or all swim and the devil take the flincher  they wrangled among themselves until they became quite heated in this struggle of unselfishness some one had said that the colonel should go because he was the oldest and the colonel was a very angry man  one would think i was an octogenarian he cried these remarks are quite uncalled for  well then said belmont let us all refuse to go  but this is not very wise cried the frenchman see my friends here are the ladies being carried off alone surely it would be far better that one of us should be with them to advise them  they looked at one another in perplexity what fardet said was obviously true but how could one of them desert his comrades the emir himself suggested the solution  the chief says said mansoor that if you cannot settle who is to go you had better leave it to allah and draw lots  i dont think we can do better said the colonel and his three companions nodded their assent  it was the moolah who approached them with four splinters of palmbark protruding from between his fingers  he says that he who draws the longest has the camel says mansoor  we must agree to abide absolutely by this said cochrane and again his companions nodded  the dervishes had formed a semicircle in front of them with a fringe of the oscillating heads of the camels before them was a cooking fire which threw its red light over the group the emir was standing with his back to it and his fierce face towards the prisoners behind the four men was a line of guards and behind them again the three women who looked down from their camels upon this tragedy with a malicious smile the fat oneeyed moolah advanced with his fist closed and the four little brown spicules protruding from between his fingers  it was to belmont that he held them first the irishman gave an involuntary groan and his wife gasped behind him for the splinter came away in his hand then it was the frenchmans turn and his was half an inch longer than belmonts then came colonel cochrane whose piece was longer than the two others put together stephens was no bigger than belmonts the colonel was the winner of this terrible lottery  illustration the colonel was the winner of this terrible lottery p222  youre welcome to my place belmont said he ive neither wife nor child and hardly a friend in the world go with your wife and ill stay  no indeed an agreement is an agreement its all fair play and the prize to the luckiest  the emir says that you are to mount at once said mansoor and an arab dragged the colonel by his wristrope to the waiting camel  he will stay with the rearguard said the emir to his lieutenant you can keep the women with you also  and this dragoman dog  put him with the others  and they  put them all to death     chapter ix  as none of the three could understand arabic the order of the emir would have been unintelligible to them had it not been for the conduct of mansoor the unfortunate dragoman after all his treachery and all his subservience and apostasy found his worst fears realised when the dervish leader gave his curt command with a shriek of fear the poor wretch threw himself forward upon his face and clutched at the arabs jibbeh clawing with his brown fingers at the edge of the cotton skirt the emir tugged to free himself and then finding that he was still held by that convulsive grip he turned and kicked at mansoor with the vicious impatience with which one drives off a pestering cur the dragomans high red tarboosh flew up into the air and he lay groaning upon his face where the stunning blow of the arabs horny foot had left him  all was bustle and movement in the camp for the old emir had mounted his camel and some of his party were already beginning to follow their companions the squat lieutenant the moolah and about a dozen dervishes surrounded the prisoners they had not mounted their camels for they were told off to be the ministers of death the three men understood as they looked upon their faces that the sand was running very low in the glass of their lives their hands were still bound but their guards had ceased to hold them they turned round all three and said goodbye to the women upon the camels  all up now norah said belmont its hard luck when there was a chance of a rescue but weve done our best  for the first time his wife had broken down she was sobbing convulsively with her face between her hands  dont cry little woman weve had a good time together give my love to all my friends at bray remember me to amy mccarthy and to the blessingtons youll find there is enough and to spare but i would take rogerss advice about the investments mind that  o john i wont live without you sorrow for her sorrow broke the strong man down and he buried his face in the hairy side of her camel the two of them sobbed helplessly together  stephens meanwhile had pushed his way to sadies beast she saw his worn earnest face looking up at her through the dim light  dont be afraid for your aunt and for yourself said he i am sure that you will escape colonel cochrane will look after you the egyptians cannot be far behind i do hope you will have a good drink before you leave the wells i wish i could give your aunt my jacket for it will be cold tonight im afraid i cant get it off she should keep some of the bread and eat it in the early morning  he spoke quite quietly like a man who is arranging the details of a picnic a sudden glow of admiration for this quietly consistent man warmed her impulsive heart  how unselfish you are she cried i never saw any one like you talk about saints there you stand in the very presence of death and you think only of us  i want to say a last word to you sadie if you dont mind i should die so much happier i have often wanted to speak to you but i thought that perhaps you would laugh for you never took anything very seriously did you that was quite natural of course with your high spirits but still it was very serious to me but now i am really a dead man so it does not matter very much what i say  oh dont mr stephens cried the girl  i wont if it is very painful to you as i said it would make me die happier but i dont want to be selfish about it if i thought it would darken your life afterwards or be a sad recollection to you i would not say another word  what did you wish to say  it was only to tell you how i loved you i always loved you from the first i was a different man when i was with you but of course it was absurd i knew that well enough i never said anything and i tried not to make myself ridiculous but i just want you to know about it now that it cant matter one way or the other youll understand that i really do love you when i tell you that if it were not that i knew you were frightened and unhappy these last two days in which we have been always together would have been infinitely the happiest of my life  the girl sat pale and silent looking down with wondering eyes at his upturned face she did not know what to do or say in the solemn presence of this love which burned so brightly under the shadow of death to her childs heart it seemed incomprehensibleand yet she understood that it was sweet and beautiful also  i wont say any more said he i can see that it only bothers you but i wanted you to know and now you do know so it is all right thank you for listening so patiently and gently goodbye little sadie i cant put my hand up will you put yours down  illustration goodbye little sadie p229  she did so and stephens kissed it then he turned and took his place once more between belmont and fardet in his whole life of struggle and success he had never felt such a glow of quiet contentment as suffused him at that instant when the grip of death was closing upon him there is no arguing about love it is the innermost fact of life the one which obscures and changes all the others the only one which is absolutely satisfying and complete pain is pleasure and want is comfort and death is sweetness when once that golden mist is round it so it was that stephens could have sung with joy as he faced his murderers he really had not time to think about them the important allengrossing delightful thing was that she could not look upon him as a casual acquaintance any more through all her life she would think of himshe would know  colonel cochranes camel was at one side and the old soldier whose wrists had been freed had been looking down upon the scene and wondering in his tenacious way whether all hope must really be abandoned it was evident that the arabs who were grouped round the victims were to remain behind with them while the others who were mounted would guard the three women and himself he could not understand why the throats of his companions had not been already cut unless it were that with an eastern refinement of cruelty this rearguard would wait until the egyptians were close to them so that the warm bodies of their victims might be an insult to the pursuers no doubt that was the right explanation the colonel had heard of such a trick before  but in that case there would not be more than twelve arabs with the prisoners were there any of the friendly ones among them if tippy tilly and six of his men were there and if belmont could get his arms free and his hand upon his revolver they might come through yet the colonel craned his neck and groaned in his disappointment he could see the faces of the guards in the firelight they were all baggara arabs men who were beyond either pity or bribery tippy tilly and the others must have gone on with the advance for the first time the stiff old soldier abandoned hope  goodbye you fellows god bless you he cried as a negro pulled at his camels nosering and made him follow the others the women came after him in a misery too deep for words their departure was a relief to the three men who were left  i am glad they are gone said stephens from his heart  yes yes it is better cried fardet how long are we to wait  not very long now said belmont grimly as the arabs closed in around them  the colonel and the three women gave one backward glance when they came to the edge of the oasis between the straight stems of the palms they saw the gleam of the fire and above the group of arabs they caught a last glimpse of the three white hats an instant later the camels began to trot and when they looked back once more the palm grove was only a black clump with the vague twinkle of a light somewhere in the heart of it as with yearning eyes they gazed at that throbbing red point in the darkness they passed over the edge of the depression and in an instant the huge silent moonlit desert was round them without a sign of the oasis which they had left on every side the velvet blueblack sky with its blazing stars sloped downwards to the vast duncoloured plain the two were blurred into one at their point of junction  the women had sat in the silence of despair and the colonel had been silent alsofor what could he saybut suddenly all four started in their saddles and sadie gave a sharp cry of dismay in the hush of the night there had come from behind them the petulant crack of a rifle then another then several together with a brisk rattattat and then after an interval one more  it may be the rescuers it may be the egyptians cried mrs belmont with a sudden flicker of hope colonel cochrane dont you think it may be the egyptians  yes yes sadie whimpered it must be the egyptians  the colonel had listened expectantly but all was silent again then he took his hat off with a solemn gesture  there is no use deceiving ourselves mrs belmont said he we may as well face the truth our friends are gone from us but they have met their end like brave men  but why should they fire their guns they had they had spears she shuddered as she said it  that is true said the colonel i would not for the world take away any real grounds of hope which you may have but on the other hand there is no use in preparing bitter disappointments for ourselves if we had been listening to an attack we should have heard some reply besides an egyptian attack would have been an attack in force no doubt it is as you say a little strange that they should have wasted their cartridgesby jove look at that  he was pointing over the eastern desert two figures were moving across its expanse swiftly and stealthily furtive dark shadows against the lighter ground they saw them dimly dipping and rising over the rolling desert now lost now reappearing in the uncertain light they were flying away from the arabs and then suddenly they halted upon the summit of a sandhill and the prisoners could see them outlined plainly against the sky they were camelmen but they sat their camels astride as a horseman sits his horse  gippy camel corps cried the colonel  two men said miss adams in a voice of despair  only a vedette maam throwing feelers out all over the desert this is one of them main body ten miles off as likely as not there they go giving the alarm good old camel corps  the selfcontained methodical soldier had suddenly turned almost inarticulate with his excitement there was a red flash upon the top of the sandhill and then another followed by the crack of the rifles then with a whisk the two figures were gone as swiftly and silently as two trout in a stream  the arabs had halted for an instant as if uncertain whether they should delay their journey to pursue them or not there was nothing left to pursue now for amid the undulations of the sanddrift the vedettes might have gone in any direction the emir galloped back along the line with exhortations and orders then the camels began to trot and the hopes of the prisoners were dulled by the agonies of the terrible jolt mile after mile and mile after mile they sped onwards over that vast expanse the women clinging as best they might to the pommels the colonel almost as spent as they but still keenly on the lookout for any sign of the pursuers  i think i think cried mrs belmont that something is moving in front of us  the colonel raised himself upon his saddle and screened his eyes from the moonshine  by jove youre right there maam there are men over yonder  they could all see them now a straggling line of riders far ahead of them in the desert  they are going in the same direction as we cried mrs belmont whose eyes were very much better than the colonels  cochrane muttered an oath into his moustache  look at the tracks there said he of course its our own vanguard who left the palm grove before us the chief keeps us at this infernal pace in order to close up with them  as they drew closer they could see plainly that it was indeed the other body of arabs and presently the emir wad ibrahim came trotting back to take counsel with the emir abderrahman they pointed in the direction in which the vedettes had appeared and shook their heads like men who have many and grave misgivings then the raiders joined into one long straggling line and the whole body moved steadily on towards the southern cross which was twinkling just over the skyline in front of them hour after hour the dreadful trot continued while the fainting ladies clung on convulsively and cochrane worn out but indomitable encouraged them to hold out and peered backwards over the desert for the first glad signs of their pursuers the blood throbbed in his temples and he cried that he heard the roll of drums coming out of the darkness in his feverish delirium he saw clouds of pursuers at their very heels and during the long night he was for ever crying glad tidings which ended in disappointment and heartache the rise of the sun showed the desert stretching away around them with nothing moving upon its monstrous face except themselves with dull eyes and heavy hearts they stared round at that huge and empty expanse their hopes thinned away like the light morning mist upon the horizon  it was shocking to the ladies to look at their companion and to think of the spruce hale old soldier who had been their fellowpassenger from cairo as in the case of miss adams old age seemed to have pounced upon him in one spring his hair which had grizzled hour by hour during his privations was now of a silvery white white stubble too had obscured the firm clean line of his chin and throat the veins of his fare were injected and his features were shot with heavy wrinkles he rode with his back arched and his chin sunk upon his breast for the old timerotted body was worn out but in his bright alert eyes there was always a trace of the gallant tenant who lived in the shattered house delirious spent and dying he preserved his chivalrous protecting air as he turned to the ladies shot little scraps of advice and encouragement at them and peered back continually for the help which never came  an hour after sunrise the raiders called a halt and food and water were served out to all then at a more moderate pace they pursued their southern journey their long straggling line trailing out over a quarter of a mile of desert from their more careless bearing and the way in which they chatted as they rode it was clear that they thought that they had shaken off their pursuers their direction now was east as well as south and it was evidently their intention after this long detour to strike the nile again at some point far above the egyptian outposts already the character of the scenery was changing and they were losing the long levels of the pebbly desert and coming once more upon those fantastic sunburned black rocks and that rich orange sand through which they had already passed on every side of them rose the scaly conical hills with their loose slaglike débris and jaggededged khors with sinuous streams of sand running like watercourses down their centre the camels followed each other twisting in and out among the boulders and scrambling with their adhesive spongy feet over places which would have been impossible for horses among the broken rocks those behind could sometimes only see the long undulating darting necks of the creatures in front as if it were some nightmare procession of serpents indeed it had much the effect of a dream upon the prisoners for there was no sound save the soft dull padding and shuffling of the feet the strange wild frieze moved slowly and silently onwards amid a setting of black stone and yellow sand with the one arch of vivid blue spanning the rugged edges of the ravine  miss adams who had been frozen into silence during the long cold night began to thaw now in the cheery warmth of the rising sun she looked about her and rubbed her thin hands together  why sadie she remarked i thought i heard you in the night dear and now i see that you have been crying  i have been thinking auntie well we must try and think of others dearie and not of ourselves its not of myself auntie never fret about me sadie no auntie i was not thinking of you was it of any one in particular of mr stephens auntie how gentle he was and how brave to think of him fixing up every little thing for us and trying to pull his jacket over his poor ropedup hands with those murderers waiting all round his hes my saint and hero from now ever after  well hes out of his troubles anyhow said miss adams with that bluntness which the years bring with them  then i wish i was also  i dont see how that would help him  well i think he might feel less lonesome said sadie and drooped her saucy little chin upon her breast  the four had been riding in silence for some little time when the colonel clapped his hand to his brow with a gesture of dismay  good god he cried i am going off my head  again and again they had perceived it during the night but he had seemed quite rational since daybreak they were shocked therefore at this sudden outbreak and tried to calm him with soothing words  mad as a hatter he shouted whatever do you think i saw  dont trouble about it whatever it was said mrs belmont laying her hand soothingly upon his as the camels closed together it is no wonder that you are overdone you have thought and worked for all of us so long we shall halt presently and a few hours sleep will quite restore you  but the colonel looked up again and again he cried out in his agitation and surprise  i never saw anything plainer in my life he groaned it is on the point of rock on our right frontpoor old stuart with my red cummerbund round his head just the same as we left him  the ladies had followed the direction of the colonels frightened gaze and in an instant they were all as amazed as he  illustration on this pinnacle stood a motionless figure p242  there was a black bulging ridge like a bastion upon the right side of the terrible khor up which the camels were winding at one point it rose into a small pinnacle on this pinnacle stood a solitary motionless figure clad entirely in black save for a brilliant dash of scarlet upon his head there could not surely be two such short sturdy figures or such large colourless faces in the libyan desert his shoulders were stooping forward and he seemed to be staring intently down into the ravine his pose and outline were like a caricature of the great napoleon  can it possibly be he  it must be it is cried the ladies you see he is looking towards us and waving his hand  good heavens theyll shoot him get down you fool or youll be shot roared the colonel but his dry throat would only emit a discordant croaking  several of the dervishes had seen the singular apparition upon the hill and had unslung their remingtons but a long arm suddenly shot up behind the figure of the birmingham clergyman a brown hand seized upon his skirts and he disappeared with a snap higher up the pass just below the spot where mr stuart had been standing appeared the tall figure of the emir abderrahman he had sprung upon a boulder and was shouting and waving his arms but the shouts were drowned in a long rippling roar of musketry from each side of the khor the bastionlike cliff was fringed with gunbarrels with red tarbooshes drooping over the triggers from the other lip also came the long spurts of flame and the angry clatter of the rifles the raiders were caught in an ambuscade the emir fell but was up again and waving there was a splotch of blood upon his long white beard he kept pointing and gesticulating but his scattered followers could not understand what he wanted some of them came tearing down the pass and some from behind were pushing to the front a few dismounted and tried to climb up sword in hand to that deadly line of muzzles but one by one they were hit and came rolling from rock to rock to the bottom of the ravine the shooting was not very good one negro made his way unharmed up the whole side only to have his brains dashed out with the buttend of a martini at the top the emir had fallen off his rock and lay in a crumpled heap like a brown and white patchwork quilt at the bottom of it and then when half of them were down it became evident even to those exalted fanatical souls that there was no chance for them and that they must get out of these fatal rocks and into the desert again they galloped down the pass and it is a frightful thing to see a camel galloping over broken ground the beasts own terror his ungainly bounds the sprawl of his four legs all in the air together his hideous cries and the yells of his rider who is bucked high from his saddle with every spring make a picture which is not to be forgotten the women screamed as this mad torrent of frenzied creatures came pouring past them but the colonel edged his camel and theirs farther and farther in among the rocks and away from the retreating arabs the air was full of whistling bullets and they could hear them smacking loudly against the stones all round them  keep quiet and theyll pass us whispered the colonel who was all himself again now that the hour for action had arrived i wish to heaven i could see tippy tilly or any of his friends now is the time for them to help us he watched the mad stream of fugitives as they flew past upon their shambling squattering loosejointed beasts but the black face of the egyptian gunner was not among them  and now it really did seem as if the whole body of them in their haste to get clear of the ravine had not a thought to spend upon the prisoners the rush was past and only stragglers were running the gauntlet of the fierce fire which poured upon them from above the last of all a young baggara with a black moustache and pointed beard looked up as he passed and shook his sword in impotent passion at the egyptian riflemen at the same instant a bullet struck his camel and the creature collapsed all neck and legs upon the ground the young arab sprang off its back and seizing its nosering he beat it savagely with the flat of his sword to make it stand up but the dim glazing eye told its own tale and in desert warfare the death of the beast is the death of the rider the baggara glared round like a lion at bay his dark eyes flashing murderously from under his red turban a crimson spot and then another sprang out upon his dark skin but he never winced at the bullet wounds his fierce gaze had fallen upon the prisoners and with an exultant shout he was dashing towards them his broadbladed sword gleaming above his head miss adams was the nearest to him but at the sight of the rushing figure and the maniac face she threw herself off the camel upon the far side the arab bounded on to a rock and aimed a thrust at mrs belmont but before the point could reach her the colonel leaned forward with his pistol and blew the mans head in yet with a concentrated rage which was superior even to the agony of death the fellow lay kicking and striking bounding about among the loose stones like a fish upon the shingle  illustration the colonel leaned forward with his pistol p247  dont be frightened ladies cried the colonel he is quite dead i assure you i am so sorry to have done this in your presence but the fellow was dangerous i had a little score of my own to settle with him for he was the man who tried to break my ribs with his remington i hope you are not hurt miss adams one instant and i will come down to you  but the old boston lady was by no means hurt for the rocks had been so high that she had a very short distance to fall from her saddle sadie mrs belmont and colonel cochrane had all descended by slipping on to the boulders and climbing down from them but they found miss adams on her feet and waving the remains of her green veil in triumph  hurrah sadie hurrah my own darling sadie she was shrieking we are saved my girl we are saved after all  by george so we are cried the colonel and they all shouted in an ecstasy together  but sadie had learned to think more about others during those terrible days of schooling her arms were round mrs belmont and her cheek against hers  you dear sweet angel she cried how can we have the heart to be glad when youwhen you  but i dont believe it is so cried the brave irishwoman no ill never believe it until i see johns body lying before me and when i see that i dont want to live to see anything more  the last dervish had clattered down the khor and now above them on either cliff they could see the egyptianstall thin squareshouldered figures looking when outlined against the blue sky wonderfully like the warriors in the ancient basreliefs their camels were in the background and they were hurrying to join them at the same time others began to ride down from the farther end of the ravine their dark faces flushed and their eyes shining with the excitement of victory and pursuit a very small englishman with a strawcoloured moustache and a weary manner was riding at the head of them he halted his camel beside the fugitives and saluted the ladies he wore brown boots and brown belts with steel buckles which looked trim and workmanlike against his kharki uniform  had em that timehad em proper said he very glad to have been of any assistance im shaw hope youre none the worse for it all what i mean its rather rough work for ladies  youre from haifa i suppose asked the colonel  no were from the other show were the sarras crowd you know we met in the desert and we headed em off and the other johnnies headed them behind weve got em on toast i tell you get up on that rock and youll see things happen its going to be a knockout in one round this time  we left some of our people at the wells we are very uneasy about them said the colonel i suppose you have not heard anything of them  the young officer looked serious and shook his head bad job that said he theyre a poisonous crowd when you put em in a corner what i mean we never expected to see you alive and were very glad to pull any of you out of the fire the most we hoped was that we might revenge you  any other englishman with you archer is with the flanking party hell have to come past for i dont think there is any other way down weve got one of your chaps up therea funny old bird with a red topknot see you later i hope good day ladies he touched his helmet tapped his camel and trotted on after his men  we cant do better than stay where we are until they are all past said the colonel for it was evident now that the men from above would have to come round in a broken single file they went past black men and brown soudanese and fellaheen but all of the best for the camel corps is the corps delite of the egyptian army each had a brown bandolier over his chest and his rifle held across his thigh a large man with a drooping black moustache and a pair of binoculars in his hand was riding at the side of them  hulloa archer croaked the colonel  the officer looked at him with the vacant unresponsive eye of a complete stranger  im cochrane you know we travelled up together  excuse me sir but you have the advantage of me said the officer i knew a colonel cochrane but you are not the man he was three inches taller than you with black hair and  thats all right cried the colonel testily you try a few days with the dervishes and see if your friends will recognise you  good god cochrane is it really you i could not have believed it great scott what you must have been through ive heard before of fellows going grey in a night but by jove  quite so said the colonel flushing allow me to hint to you archer that if you could get some food and drink for these ladies instead of discussing my personal appearance it would be much more practical  thats all right said captain archer  your friend stuart knows that you are here and he is bringing some stuff round for you poor fare ladies but the best we have youre an old soldier cochrane get up on the rocks presently and youll see a lovely sight no time to stop for we shall be in action again in five minutes anything i can do before i go  you havent got such a thing as a cigar asked the colonel wistfully  illustration you havent got such a thing as a cigar p253  archer drew a thick satisfying partaga from his case and handed it down with halfadozen wax vestas then he cantered after his men and the old soldier leaned back against the rock and drew in the fragrant smoke it was then that his jangled nerves knew the full virtue of tobacco the gentle anodyne which stays the failing strength and soothes the worrying brain he watched the dim blue reek swirling up from him and he felt the pleasant aromatic bite upon his palate while a restful languor crept over his weary and harassed body the three ladies sat together upon a flat rock  good land what a sight you are sadie cried miss adams suddenly and it was the first reappearance of her old self what would your mother say if she saw you why sakes alive your hair is full of straw and your frock clean crazy  i guess we all want some setting to right said sadie in a voice which was much more subdued than that of the sadie of old mrs belmont you look just too perfectly sweet anyhow but if youll allow me ill fix your dress for you  but mrs belmonts eyes were far away and she shook her head sadly as she gently put the girls hands aside  i do not care how i look i cannot think of it said she could you if you had left the man you love behind you as i have mine  im beginbeginning to think i have sobbed poor sadie and buried her hot face in mrs belmonts motherly bosom     chapter x  the camel corps had all passed onwards down the khor in pursuit of the retreating dervishes and for a few minutes the escaped prisoners had been left alone but now there came a cheery voice calling upon them and a red turban bobbed about among the rocks with the large white face of the nonconformist minister smiling from beneath it he had a thick lance with which to support his injured leg and this murderous crutch combined with his peaceful appearance to give him a most incongruous aspectas of a sheep which has suddenly developed claws behind him were two negroes with a basket and a waterskin  illustration not a word not a word p255  not a word not a word he cried as he stumped up to them i know exactly how you feel ive been there myself bring the water ali only half a cup miss adams you shall have some more presently now your turn mrs belmont dear me dear me you poor souls how my heart does bleed for you theres bread and meat in the basket but you must be very moderate at first he chuckled with joy and slapped his fat hands together as he watched them  but the others he asked his face turning grave again  the colonel shook his head we left them behind at the wells i fear that it is all over with them  tut tut cried the clergyman in a boisterous voice which could not cover the despondency of his expression you thought no doubt that it was all over with me but here i am in spite of it never lose heart mrs belmont your husbands position could not possibly be as hopeless as mine was  when i saw you standing on that rock up yonder i put it down to delirium said the colonel if the ladies had not seen you i should never have ventured to believe it  i am afraid that i behaved very badly captain archer says that i nearly spoiled all their plans and that i deserved to be tried by a drumhead courttrial and shot the fact is that when i heard the arabs beneath me i forgot myself in my anxiety to know if any of you were left  i wonder that you were not shot without any drumhead courtmartial said the colonel but how in the world did you get here  the haifa people were close upon our track at the time when i was abandoned and they picked me up in the desert i must have been delirious i suppose for they tell me that they heard my voice singing hymns a long way off and it was that under the providence of god which brought them to me they had a camel ambulance and i was quite myself again by next day i came with the sarras people after we met them because they have the doctor with them my wound is nothing and he says that a man of my habit will be the better for the loss of blood and now my friendshis big brown eyes lost their twinkle and became very solemn and reverentwe have all been upon the very confines of death and our dear companions may be so at this instant the same power which saved us may save them and let us pray together that it may be so always remembering that if in spite of our prayers it should not be so then that also must be accepted as the best and wisest thing  so they knelt together among the black rocks and prayed as some of them had never prayed before it was very well to discuss prayer and treat it lightly and philosophically upon the deck of the korosko it was easy to feel strong and selfconfident in the comfortable deckchair with the slippered arab handing round the coffee and liqueurs but they had been swept out of that placid stream of existence and dashed against the horrible jagged facts of life battered and shaken they must have something to cling to a blind inexorable destiny was too horrible a belief a chastening power acting intelligently and for a purposea living working power tearing them out of their grooves breaking down their small sectarian ways forcing them into the better paththat was what they had learned to realise during these days of horror great hands had closed suddenly upon them and had moulded them into new shapes and fitted them for new uses could such a power be deflected by any human supplication it was that or nothingthe last court of appeal left open to injured humanity and so they all prayed as lover loves or a poet writes from the very inside of their souls and they rose with that singular illogical feeling of inward peace and satisfaction which prayer only can give  hush said cochrane listen the sound of a volley came crackling up the narrow khor and then another and another the colonel was fidgeting about like an old horse which hears the bugle of the hunt and the yapping of the pack where can we see what is going on come this way this way if you please there is a path up to the top if the ladies will come after me they will be spared the sight of anything painful  the clergyman led them along the side to avoid the bodies which were littered thickly down the bottom of the khor it was hard walking over the shingly slaggy stones but they made their way to the summit at last beneath them lay the vast expanse of the rolling desert and in the foreground such a scene as none of them are ever likely to forget in that perfectly dry and clear light with the unvarying brown tint of the hard desert as a background every detail stood out as clearly as if these were toy figures arranged upon a table within hands touch of them  the dervishesor what was left of themwere riding slowly some little distance out in a confused crowd their patchwork jibbehs and red turbans swaying with the motion of their camels they did not present the appearance of men who were defeated for their movements were very deliberate but they looked about them and changed their formation as if they were uncertain what their tactics ought to be it was no wonder that they were puzzled for upon their spent camels their situation was as hopeless as could be conceived the sarras men had all emerged from the khor and had dismounted the beasts being held in groups of four while the riflemen knelt in a long line with a woolly curling fringe of smoke sending volley after volley at the arabs who shot back in a desultory fashion from the backs of their camels but it was not upon the sullen group of dervishes nor yet upon the long line of kneeling riflemen that the eyes of the spectators were fixed far out upon the desert three squadrons of the haifa camel corps were coming up in a dense close column which wheeled beautifully into a widespread semicircle as it approached the arabs were caught between two fires  illustration arabs were caught between two fires p261  by jove cried the colonel see that  the camels of the dervishes had all knelt down simultaneously and the men had sprung from their backs in front of them was a tall stately figure who could only be the emir wad ibrahim they saw him kneel for an instant in prayer then he rose and taking something from his saddle he placed it very deliberately upon the sand and stood upon it  good man cried the colonel he is standing upon his sheepskin  what do you mean by that asked stuart  every arab has a sheepskin upon his saddle when he recognises that his position is perfectly hopeless and yet is determined to fight to the death he takes his sheepskin off and stands upon it until he dies see they are all upon their sheepskins they will neither give nor take quarter now  the drama beneath them was rapidly approaching its climax the haifa corps was well up and a ring of smoke and flame surrounded the clump of kneeling dervishes who answered it as best they could many of them were already down but the rest loaded and fired with the unflinching courage which has always made them worthy antagonists a dozen kharkidressed figures upon the sand showed that it was no bloodless victory for the egyptians but now there was a stirring buglecall from the sarras men and another answered it from the haifa corps their camels were down also and the men had formed up into a single long curved line one last volley and they were charging inwards with the wild inspiriting yell which the blacks had brought with them from their central african wilds for a minute there was a mad vortex of rushing figures riflebutts rising and falling spearheads gleaming and darting among the rolling dust cloud then the bugle rang out once more the egyptians fell back and formed up with the quick precision of highly disciplined troops and there in the centre each upon his sheepskin lay the gallant barbarian and his raiders the nineteenth century had been revenged upon the seventh  the three women had stared horrorstricken and yet fascinated at the stirring scene before them now sadie and her aunt were sobbing together the colonel had turned to them with some cheering words when his eyes fell upon the face of mrs belmont it was as white and set as if it were carved from ivory and her large grey eyes were fixed as if she were in a trance  good heavens mrs belmont what is the matter he cried  for answer she pointed out over the desert far away miles on the other side of the scene of the fight a small body of men were riding towards them  by jove yes theres some one there who can it be  they were all straining their eyes but the distance was so great that they could only be sure that they were camelmen and about a dozen in number  its those devils who were left behind in the palm grove said cochrane theres no one else it can be one consolation they cant get away again theyve walked right into the lions mouth  but mrs belmont was still gazing with the same fixed intensity and the same ivory face now with a wild shriek of joy she threw her two hands into the air its they she screamed they are saved its they colonel its they o miss adams miss adams it is they she capered about on the top of the hill with wild eyes like an excited child  her companions would not believe her for they could see nothing but there are moments when our mortal senses are more acute than those who have never put their whole heart and soul into them can ever realise mrs belmont had already run down the rocky path on the way to her camel before they could distinguish that which had long before carried its glad message to her in the van of the approaching party three white dots shimmered in the sun and they could only come from the three european hats the riders were travelling swiftly and by the time their comrades had started to meet them they could plainly see that it was indeed belmont fardet and stephens with the dragoman mansoor and the wounded soudanese rifleman as they came together they saw that their escort consisted of tippy tilly and the other old egyptian soldiers belmont rushed onwards to meet his wife but fardet stopped to grasp the colonels hand  vive la france vivent les anglais he was yelling tout va bien nest ce pas colonel ah canaille vivent les croix et les chrétiens he was incoherent in his delight  the colonel too was as enthusiastic as his anglosaxon standard would permit he could not gesticulate but he laughed in the nervous crackling way which was his topnote of emotion  my dear boy i am deuced glad to see you all again i gave you up for lost never was as pleased at anything in my life how did you get away  it was all your doing  mine  yes my friend and i have been quarrelling with youungrateful wretch that i am  but how did i save you  it was you who arranged with this excellent tippy tilly and the others that they should have so much if they brought us alive into egypt again they slipped away in the darkness and hid themselves in the grove then when we were left they crept up with their rifles and shot the men who were about to murder us that cursed moolah i am sorry they shot him for i believe that i could have persuaded him to be a christian and now with your permission i will hurry on and embrace miss adams for belmont has his wife and stephens has miss sadie so i think it is very evident that the sympathy of miss adams is reserved for me  a fortnight had passed away and the special boat which had been placed at the disposal of the rescued tourists was already far north of assiout next morning they would find themselves at baliani where one takes the express for cairo it was therefore their last evening together mrs shlesinger and her child who had escaped unhurt had already been sent down from the frontier miss adams had been very ill after her privations and this was the first time that she had been allowed to come upon deck after dinner she sat now in a loungechair thinner sterner and kindlier than ever while sadie stood beside her and tucked the rugs around her shoulders mr stephens was carrying over the coffee and placing it on the wickertable beside them on the other side of the deck belmont and his wife were seated together in silent sympathy and contentment monsieur fardet was leaning against the rail and arguing about the remissness of the british government in not taking a more complete control of the egyptian frontier while the colonel stood very erect in front of him with the red end of a cigarstump protruding from under his moustache  but what was the matter with the colonel who would have recognised him who had only seen the broken old man in the libyan desert there might be some little grizzling about the moustache but the hair was back once more at the fine glossy black which had been so much admired upon the voyage up with a stony face and an unsympathetic manner he had received upon his return to haifa all the commiserations about the dreadful way in which his privations had blanched him and then diving into his cabin he had reappeared within an hour exactly as he had been before that fatal moment when he had been cut off from the manifold resources of civilisation and he looked in such a sternly questioning manner at every one who stared at him that no one had the moral courage to make any remark about this modern miracle it was observed from that time forward that if the colonel had only to ride a hundred yards into the desert he always began his preparations by putting a small black bottle with a pink label into the sidepocket of his coat but those who knew him best at times when a man may be best known said that the old soldier had a young mans heart and a young mans spiritso that if he wished to keep a young mans colour also it was not very unreasonable after all it was very soothing and restful up there on the saloon deck with no sound but the gentle lipping of the water as it rippled against the sides of the steamer the red afterglow was in the western sky and it mottled the broad smooth river with crimson dimly they could discern the tall figures of herons standing upon the sandbanks and farther off the line of riverside datepalms glided past them in a majestic procession once more the silver stars were twinkling out the same clear placid inexorable stars to which their weary eyes had been so often upturned during the long nights of their desert martyrdom  where do you put up in cairo miss adams asked mrs belmont at last  shepheards i think  and you mr stephens  oh shepheards decidedly  we are staying at the continental i hope we shall not lose sight of you  i dont want ever to lose sight of you mrs belmont cried sadie oh you must come to the states and well give you just a lovely time  mrs belmont laughed in her pleasant mellow fashion  we have our duty to do in ireland and we have been too long away from it already my husband has his business and i have my home and they are both going to rack and ruin besides she added slyly it is just possible that if we did come to the states we might not find you there  we must all meet again said belmont if only to talk our adventures over once more it will be easier in a year or two we are still too near them  and yet how far away and dreamlike it all seems remarked his wife providence is very good in softening disagreeable remembrances in our minds all this feels to me as if it had happened in some previous existence  fardet held up his wrist with a cotton bandage still round it  the body does not forget as quickly as the mind this does not look very dreamlike or far away mrs belmont  how hard it is that some should be spared and some not if only mr brown and mr headingly were with us then i should not have one care in the world cried sadie why should they have been taken and we left  mr stuart had limped on to the deck with an open book in his hand a thick stick supporting his injured leg  why is the ripe fruit picked and the unripe left said he in answer to the young girls exclamation we know nothing of the spiritual state of these poor dear young fellows but the great master gardener plucks his fruit according to his own knowledge i brought you up a passage to read to you  there was a lantern upon the table and he sat down beside it the yellow light shone upon his heavy cheek and the red edges of his book the strong steady voice rose above the wash of the water  let them give thanks whom the lord hath redeemed and delivered from the hand of the enemy and gathered them out of the lands from the east and from the west from the north and from the south they went astray in the wilderness out of the way and found no city to dwell in hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them so they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he delivered them from their distress he led them forth by the right way that they might go to the city where they dwelt oh that men would therefore praise the lord for his goodness and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men  illustration he delivered them from their distress p273  it sounds as if it were composed for us and yet it was written two thousand years ago said the clergyman as he closed the book in every age man has been forced to acknowledge the guiding hand which leads him for my part i dont believe that inspiration stopped two thousand years ago when tennyson wrote with such fervour and conviction       oh yet we trust that somehow good      will be the final goal of ill  he was repeating the message which had been given to him just as micah or ezekiel when the world was younger repeated some cruder and more elementary lesson  that is all very well mr stuart said the frenchman you ask me to praise god for taking me out of danger and pain but what i want to know is why since he has arranged all things he ever put me into that pain and danger i have in my opinion more occasion to blame than to praise you would not thank me for pulling you out of that river if it was also i who pushed you in the most which you can claim for your providence is that it has healed the wound which its own hand inflicted  i dont deny the difficulty said the clergyman slowly no one who is not selfdeceived can deny the difficulty look how boldly tennyson faced it in that same poem the grandest and deepest and most obviously inspired in our language remember the effect which it had upon him       i falter where i firmly trod      and falling with my weight of cares      upon the great worlds altar stairs      which slope through darkness up to god       i stretch lame hands of faith and grope      and gather dust and chaff and call      to what i feel is lord of all      and faintly trust the larger hope  it is the central mystery of mysteriesthe problem of sin and suffering the one huge difficulty which the reasoner has to solve in order to vindicate the dealings of god with man but take our own case as an example i for one am very clear what i have got out of our experience i say it with all humility but i have a clearer view of my duties than ever i had before it has taught me to be less remiss in saying what i think to be true less indolent in doing what i feel to be rightful  and i cried sadie it has taught me more than all my life put together i have learned so much and unlearned so much i am a different girl  i never understood my own nature before said stephens i can hardly say that i had a nature to understand i lived for what was unimportant and i neglected what was vital  oh a good shakeup does nobody any harm the colonel remarked too much of the featherbedandfourmealsaday life is not good for man or woman  it is my firm belief said mrs belmont gravely that there was not one of us who did not rise to a greater height during those days in the desert than ever before or since when our sins come to be weighed much may be forgiven us for the sake of those unselfish days  they all sat in thoughtful silence for a little while the scarlet streaks turned to carmine and the grey shadows deepened and the wildfowl flew past in dark straggling vs over the dull metallic surface of the great smoothflowing nile a cold wind had sprung up from the eastward and some of the party rose to leave the deck stephens leaned forward to sadie  do you remember what you promised when you were in the desert he whispered  what was that  you said that if you escaped you would try in future to make some one else happy  then i must do so  you have said he and their hands met under the shadow of the table   the end
