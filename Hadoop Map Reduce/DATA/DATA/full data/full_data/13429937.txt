13429937	sir dominick ferrand  by henry james     there are several objections to it but ill take it if youll alter it mr lockets rather curt note had said and there was no waste of words in the postscript in which he had added  if youll come in and see me ill show you what i mean  this communication had reached jersey villas by the first post and peter baron had scarcely swallowed his leathery muffin before he got into motion to obey the editorial behest  he knew that such precipitation looked eager and he had no desire to look eagerit was not in his interest but how could he maintain a godlike calm principled though he was in favour of it the first time one of the great magazines had accepted even with a cruel reservation a specimen of his ardent young genius  it was not till like a child with a seashell at his ear he began to be aware of the great roar of the underground that in his thirdclass carriage the cruelty of the reservation penetrated with the taste of acrid smoke to his inner sense  it was really degrading to be eager in the face of having to alter  peter baron tried to figure to himself at that moment that he was not flying to betray the extremity of his need but hurrying to fight for some of those passages of superior boldness which were exactly what the conductor of the promiscuous review would be sure to be down upon he made believeas if to the greasy fellowpassenger oppositethat he felt indignant but he saw that to the small round eye of this still more downtrodden brother he represented selfish success  he would have liked to linger in the conception that he had been approached by the promiscuous but whatever might be thought in the office of that periodical of some of his flights of fancy there was no want of vividness in his occasional suspicion that he passed there for a familiar bore  the only thing that was clearly flattering was the fact that the promiscuous rarely published fiction  he should therefore be associated with a deviation from a solemn habit and that would more than make up to him for a phrase in one of mr lockets inexorable earlier notes a phrase which still rankled about his showing no symptom of the faculty really creative  you dont seem able to keep a character together this pitiless monitor had somewhere else remarked  peter baron as he sat in his corner while the train stopped considered in the befogged gaslight the bookstall standard of literature and asked himself whose character had fallen to pieces now  tormenting indeed had always seemed to him such a fate as to have the creative head without the creative hand  it should be mentioned however that before he started on his mission to mr locket his attention had been briefly engaged by an incident occurring at jersey villas  on leaving the house he lived at no  3 the door of which stood open to a small front garden he encountered the lady who a week before had taken possession of the rooms on the ground floor the parlours of mrs bundys terminology  he had heard her and from his window two or three times had even seen her pass in and out and this observation had created in his mind a vague prejudice in her favour  such a prejudice it was true had been subjected to a violent test it had been fairly apparent that she had a light step but it was still less to be overlooked that she had a cottage piano  she had furthermore a little boy and a very sweet voice of which peter baron had caught the accent not from her singing for she only played but from her gay admonitions to her child whom she occasionally allowed to amuse himselfunder restrictions very publicly enforcedin the tiny black patch which as a forecourt to each house was held in the humble row to be a feature  jersey villas stood in pairs semidetached and mrs ryvessuch was the name under which the new lodger presented herselfhad been admitted to the house as confessedly musical  mrs bundy the earnest proprietress of no 3 who considered her parlours they were a dozen feet square even more attractive if possible than the second floor with which baron had had to content himselfmrs bundy who reserved the drawingroom for a casual dressmaking business had threshed out the subject of the new lodger in advance with our young man reminding him that her affection for his own person was a proof that other things being equal she positively preferred tenants who were clever  this was the case with mrs ryves she had satisfied mrs bundy that she was not a simple strummer  mrs bundy admitted to peter baron that for herself she had a weakness for a pretty tune and peter could honestly reply that his ear was equally sensitive  everything would depend on the touch of their inmate  mrs ryvess piano would blight his existence if her hand should prove heavy or her selections vulgar but if she played agreeable things and played them in an agreeable way she would render him rather a service while he smoked the pipe of form  mrs bundy who wanted to let her rooms guaranteed on the part of the stranger a firstclass talent and mrs ryves who evidently knew thoroughly what she was about had not falsified this somewhat rash prediction  she never played in the morning which was barons workingtime and he found himself listening with pleasure at other hours to her discreet and melancholy strains  he really knew little about music and the only criticism he would have made of mrs ryvess conception of it was that she seemed devoted to the dismal  it was not however that these strains were not pleasant to him they floated up on the contrary as a sort of conscious response to some of his broodings and doubts harmony therefore would have reigned supreme had it not been for the singularly bad taste of no 4  mrs ryvess piano was on the free side of the house and was regarded by mrs bundy as open to no objection but that of their own gentleman who was so reasonable  as much however could not be said of the gentleman of no 4 who had not even mr barons excuse of being litteryhe kept a bullterrier and had five hatsthe street could count them and whom if you had listened to mrs bundy you would have supposed to be divided from the obnoxious instrument by walls and corridors obstacles and intervals of massive structure and fabulous extent  this gentleman had taken up an attitude which had now passed into the phase of correspondence and compromise but it was the opinion of the immediate neighbourhood that he had not a leg to stand upon and on whatever subject the sentiment of jersey villas might have been vague it was not so on the rights and the wrongs of landladies  mrs ryvess little boy was in the garden as peter baron issued from the house and his mother appeared to have come out for a moment bareheaded to see that he was doing no harm  she was discussing with him the responsibility that he might incur by passing a piece of string round one of the iron palings and pretending he was in command of a geegee but it happened that at the sight of the other lodger the child was seized with a finer perception of the drivable  he rushed at baron with a flourish of the bridle shouting ou geegee in a manner productive of some refined embarrassment to his mother baron met his advance by mounting him on a shoulder and feigning to prance an instant so that by the time this performance was overit took but a few secondsthe young man felt introduced to mrs ryves her smile struck him as charming and such an impression shortens many steps  she said oh thank youyou mustnt let him worry you and then as having put down the child and raised his hat he was turning away she added  its very good of you not to complain of my piano  i particularly enjoy ityou play beautifully said peter baron  i have to play you seeits all i can do  but the people next door dont like it though my room you know is not against their wall  therefore i thank you for letting me tell them that you in the house dont find me a nuisance  she looked gentle and bright as she spoke and as the young mans eyes rested on her the tolerance for which she expressed herself indebted seemed to him the least indulgence she might count upon but he only laughed and said oh no youre not a nuisance and felt more and more introduced  the little boy who was handsome hereupon clamoured for another ride and she took him up herself to moderate his transports  she stood a moment with the child in her arms and he put his fingers exuberantly into her hair so that while she smiled at baron she slowly permittingly shook her head to get rid of them  if they really make a fuss im afraid i shall have to go she went on  oh dont go baron broke out with a sudden expressiveness which made his voice as it fell upon his ear strike him as the voice of another  she gave a vague exclamation and nodding slightly but not unsociably passed back into the house  she had made an impression which remained till the other party to the conversation reached the railwaystation when it was superseded by the thought of his prospective discussion with mr locket  this was a proof of the intensity of that interest  the aftertaste of the later conference was also intense for peter baron who quitted his editor with his manuscript under his arm  he had had the question out with mr locket and he was in a flutter which ought to have been a sense of triumph and which indeed at first he succeeded in regarding in this light  mr locket had had to admit that there was an idea in his story and that was a tribute which baron was in a position to make the most of  but there was also a scene which scandalised the editorial conscience and which the young man had promised to rewrite  the idea that mr locket had been so good as to disengage depended for clearness mainly on this scene so it was easy to see his objection was perverse  this inference was probably a part of the joy in which peter baron walked as he carried home a contribution it pleased him to classify as accepted  he walked to work off his excitement and to think in what manner he should reconstruct  he went some distance without settling that point and then as it began to worry him he looked vaguely into shopwindows for solutions and hints  mr locket lived in the depths of chelsea in a little panelled amiable house and baron took his way homeward along the kings road  there was a new amusement for him a fresher bustle in a london walk in the morning these were hours that he habitually spent at his table in the awkward attitude engendered by the poor piece of furniture one of the rickety features of mrs bundys second floor which had to serve as his altar of literary sacrifice  if by exception he went out when the day was young he noticed that life seemed younger with it there were livelier industries to profit by and shopgirls often rosy to look at a different air was in the streets and a chaff of traffic for the observer of manners to catch  above all it was the time when poor baron made his purchases which were wholly of the wandering mind his extravagances for some mysterious reason were all matutinal and he had a foreknowledge that if ever he should ruin himself it would be well before noon  he felt lavish this morning on the strength of what the promiscuous would do for him he had lost sight for the moment of what he should have to do for the promiscuous before the old bookshops and printshops the crowded panes of the curiositymongers and the desirable exhibitions of mahogany done up he used by an innocent process to commit luxurious follies he refurnished mrs bundy with a freedom that cost her nothing and lost himself in pictures of a transfigured second floor  on this particular occasion the kings road proved almost unprecedentedly expensive and indeed this occasion differed from most others in containing the germ of real danger  for once in a way he had a bad consciencehe felt himself tempted to pick his own pocket  he never saw a commodious writingtable with elbowroom and drawers and a fair expanse of leather stamped neatly at the edge with gilt without being freshly reminded of mrs bundys dilapidations there were several such tables in the kings roadthey seemed indeed particularly numerous today  peter baron glanced at them all through the fronts of the shops but there was one that detained him in supreme contemplation  there was a fine assurance about it which seemed a guarantee of masterpieces but when at last he went in and just to help himself on his way asked the impossible price the sum mentioned by the voluble vendor mocked at him even more than he had feared  it was far too expensive as he hinted and he was on the point of completing his comedy by a pensive retreat when the shopman bespoke his attention for another article of the same general character which he described as remarkably cheap for what it was it was an old piece from a sale in the country and it had been in stock some time but it had got pushed out of sight in one of the upper roomsthey contained such a wilderness of treasuresand happened to have but just come to light  peter suffered himself to be conducted into an interminable dusky rear where he presently found himself bending over one of those square substantial desks of old mahogany raised with the aid of front legs on a sort of retreating pedestal which is fitted with small drawers contracted conveniences known immemorially to the knowing as davenports  this specimen had visibly seen service but it had an oldtime solidity and to peter baron it unexpectedly appealed  he would have said in advance that such an article was exactly what he didnt want but as the shopman pushed up a chair for him and he sat down with his elbows on the gentle slope of the large firm lid he felt that such a basis for literature would be half the battle he raised the lid and looked lovingly into the deep interior he sat ominously silent while his companion dropped the striking words now thats an article i personally covet  then when the man mentioned the ridiculous price they were literally giving it away he reflected on the economy of having a literary altar on which one could really kindle a fire  a davenport was a compromise but what was all life but a compromise  he could beat down the dealer and at mrs bundys he had to write on an insincere cardtable  after he had sat for a minute with his nose in the friendly desk he had a queer impression that it might tell him a secret or twoone of the secrets of form one of the sacrificial mysteriesthough no doubt its career had been literary only in the sense of its helping some old lady to write invitations to dull dinners  there was a strange faint odour in the receptacle as if fragrant hallowed things had once been put away there  when he took his head out of it he said to the shopman  i dont mind meeting you halfway  he had been told by knowing people that that was the right thing  he felt rather vulgar but the davenport arrived that evening at jersey villas    chapter ii    i daresay it will be all right he seems quiet now said the poor lady of the parlours a few days later in reference to their litigious neighbour and the precarious piano  the two lodgers had grown regularly acquainted and the piano had had much to do with it just as this instrument served with the gentleman at no 4 as a theme for discussion so between peter baron and the lady of the parlours it had become a basis of peculiar agreement a topic at any rate of conversation frequently renewed  mrs ryves was so prepossessing that peter was sure that even if they had not had the piano he would have found something else to thresh out with her fortunately however they did have it and he at least made the most of it knowing more now about his new friend who when widowed and fatigued she held her beautiful child in her arms looked dimly like a modern madonna  mrs bundy as a letter of furnished lodgings was characterised in general by a familiar domestic severity in respect to picturesque young women but she had the highest confidence in mrs ryves  she was luminous about her being a lady and a lady who could bring mrs bundy back to a gratified recognition of one of those manifestations of mind for which she had an independent esteem she was professional but jersey villas could be proud of a profession that didnt happen to be the wrong onethey had seen something of that  mrs ryves had a hundred a year baron wondered how mrs bundy knew this he thought it unlikely mrs ryves had told her and for the rest she depended on her lovely music  baron judged that her music even though lovely was a frail dependence it would hardly help to fill a concertroom and he asked himself at first whether she played countrydances at childrens parties or gave lessons to young ladies who studied above their station  very soon indeed he was sufficiently enlightened it all went fast for the little boy had been almost as great a help as the piano sidney haunted the doorstep of no  3 he was eminently sociable and had established independent relations with peter a frequent feature of which was an adventurous visit upstairs to picture books criticised for not being all geegees and walking sticks happily more conformable  the young mans window too looked out on their acquaintance through a starched muslin curtain it kept his neighbour before him made him almost more aware of her comings and goings than he felt he had a right to be  he was capable of a shyness of curiosity about her and of dumb little delicacies of consideration she did give a few lessons they were essentially local and he ended by knowing more or less what she went out for and what she came in from  she had almost no visitors only a decent old lady or two and every day poor dingy miss teagle who was also ancient and who came humbly enough to governess the infant of the parlours  peter barons window had always to his sense looked out on a good deal of life and one of the things it had most shown him was that there is nobody so bereft of joy as not to be able to command for twopence the services of somebody less joyous  mrs ryves was a struggler baron scarcely liked to think of it but she occupied a pinnacle for miss teagle who had lived onand from a noble nurseryinto a period of diplomas and humiliation  mrs ryves sometimes went out like baron himself with manuscripts under her arm and still more like baron she almost always came back with them  her vain approaches were to the musicsellers she tried to composeto produce songs that would make a hit  a successful song was an income she confided to peter one of the first times he took sidney blase and drowsy back to his mother  it was not on one of these occasions but once when he had come in on no better pretext than that of simply wanting to she had after all virtually invited him that she mentioned how only one song in a thousand was successful and that the terrible difficulty was in getting the right words  this rightness was just a vulgar fluke there were lots of words really clever that were of no use at all peter said laughing that he supposed any words he should try to produce would be sure to be too clever yet only three weeks after his first encounter with mrs ryves he sat at his delightful davenport well aware that he had duties more pressing trying to string together rhymes idiotic enough to make his neighbours fortune  he was satisfied of the fineness of her musical giftit had the touching note  the touching note was in her person as well  the davenport was delightful after six months of its tottering predecessor and such a reenforcement to the young mans style was not impaired by his sense of something lawless in the way it had been gained  he had made the purchase in anticipation of the money he expected from mr locket but mr lockets liberality was to depend on the ingenuity of his contributor who now found himself confronted with the consequence of a frivolous optimism  the fruit of his labour presented as he stared at it with his elbows on his desk an aspect uncompromising and incorruptible  it seemed to look up at him reproachfully and to say with its essential finish  how could you promise anything so base how could you pass your word to mutilate and dishonour me  the alterations demanded by mr locket were impossible the concessions to the platitude of his conception of the public mind were degrading  the public mindas if the public had a mind or any principle of perception more discoverable than the stare of huddled sheep  peter baron felt that it concerned him to determine if he were only not clever enough or if he were simply not abject enough to rewrite his story  he might in truth have had less pride if he had had more skill and more discretion if he had had more practice  humility in the profession of letters was half of practice and resignation was half of success  poor peter actually flushed with pain as he recognised that this was not success the production of gelid prose which his editor could do nothing with on the one side and he himself could do nothing with on the other  the truth about his luckless tale was now the more bitter from his having managed for some days to taste it as sweet  as he sat there baffled and sombre biting his pen and wondering what was meant by the rewards of literature he generally ended by tossing away the composition deflowered by mr locket and trying his hand at the sort of twaddle that mrs ryves might be able to set to music  success in these experiments wouldnt be a reward of literature but it might very well become a labour of love  the experiments would be pleasant enough for him if they were pleasant for his inscrutable neighbour  that was the way he thought of her now for he had learned enough about her little by little to guess how much there was still to learn  to spend his mornings over cheap rhymes for her was certainly to shirk the immediate question but there were hours when he judged this question to be altogether too arduous reflecting that he might quite as well perish by the sword as by famine  besides he did meet it obliquely when he considered that he shouldnt be an utter failure if he were to produce some songs to which mrs ryvess accompaniments would give a circulation he had not ventured to show her anything yet but one morning at a moment when her little boy was in his room it seemed to him that by an inspiration he had arrived at the happy middle course it was an art by itself between sound and sense  if the sense was not confused it was because the sound was so familiar  he had said to the child to whom he had sacrificed barleysugar it had no attraction for his own lips yet in these days there was always some of it about he had confided to the small sidney that if he would wait a little he should be intrusted with something nice to take down to his parent  sidney had absorbing occupation and while peter copied off the song in a pretty hand roamed gurgling and sticky about the room  in this manner he lurched like a little toper into the rear of the davenport which stood a few steps out from the recess of the window and as he was fond of beating time to his intensest joys began to bang on the surface of it with a paper knife which at that spot had chanced to fall upon the floor  at the moment sidney committed this violence his kind friend had happened to raise the lid of the desk and with his head beneath it was rummaging among a mass of papers for a proper envelope  i say i say my boy he exclaimed solicitous for the ancient glaze of his most cherished possession  sidney paused an instant then while peter still hunted for the envelope he administered another and this time a distinctly disobedient rap  peter heard it from within and was struck with its oddity of soundso much so that leaving the child for a moment under a demoralising impression of impunity he waited with quick curiosity for a repetition of the stroke  it came of course immediately and then the young man who had at the same instant found his envelope and ejaculated hallo this thing has a false back jumped up and secured his visitor whom with his left arm he held in durance on his knee while with his free hand he addressed the missive to mrs ryves  as sidney was fond of errands he was easily got rid of and after he had gone baron stood a moment at the window chinking pennies and keys in pockets and wondering if the charming composer would think his song as good or in other words as bad as he thought it  his eyes as he turned away fell on the wooden back of the davenport where to his regret the traces of sidneys assault were visible in three or four ugly scratches  confound the little brute he exclaimed feeling as if an altar had been desecrated  he was reminded however of the observation this outrage had led him to make and for further assurance he knocked on the wood with his knuckle  it sounded from that position commonplace enough but his suspicion was strongly confirmed when again standing beside the desk he put his head beneath the lifted lid and gave ear while with an extended arm he tapped sharply in the same place  the back was distinctly hollow there was a space between the inner and the outer pieces he could measure it so wide that he was a fool not to have noticed it before  the depth of the receptacle from front to rear was so great that it could sacrifice a certain quantity of room without detection the sacrifice could of course only be for a purpose and the purpose could only be the creation of a secret compartment  peter baron was still boy enough to be thrilled by the idea of such a feature the more so as every indication of it had been cleverly concealed  the people at the shop had never noticed it else they would have called his attention to it as an enhancement of value  his legendary lore instructed him that where there was a hidingplace there was always a hidden spring and he pried and pressed and fumbled in an eager search for the sensitive spot  the article was really a wonder of neat construction everything fitted with a closeness that completely saved appearances  it took baron some minutes to pursue his inquiry during which he reflected that the people of the shop were not such fools after all they had admitted moreover that they had accidentally neglected this relic of gentilityit had been overlooked in the multiplicity of their treasures  he now recalled that the man had wanted to polish it up before sending it home and that satisfied for his own part with its honourable appearance and averse in general to shiny furniture he had in his impatience declined to wait for such an operation so that the object had left the place for jersey villas carrying presumably its secret with it two or three hours after his visit  this secret it seemed indeed capable of keeping there was an absurdity in being baffled but peter couldnt find the spring  he thumped and sounded he listened and measured again he inspected every joint and crevice with the effect of becoming surer still of the existence of a chamber and of making up his mind that his davenport was a rarity  not only was there a compartment between the two backs but there was distinctly something in the compartment perhaps it was a lost manuscripta nice safe oldfashioned story that mr locket wouldnt object to  peter returned to the charge for it had occurred to him that he had perhaps not sufficiently visited the small drawers of which in two vertical rows there were six in number of different sizes inserted sideways into that portion of the structure which formed part of the support of the desk  he took them out again and examined more minutely the condition of their sockets with the happy result of discovering at last in the place into which the third on the lefthand row was fitted a small sliding panel  behind the panel was a spring like a flat button which yielded with a click when he pressed it and which instantly produced a loosening of one of the pieces of the shelf forming the highest part of the davenportpieces adjusted to each other with the most deceptive closeness  this particular piece proved to be in its turn a sliding panel which when pushed revealed the existence of a smaller receptacle a narrow oblong box in the false back  its capacity was limited but if it couldnt hold many things it might hold precious ones  baron in presence of the ingenuity with which it had been dissimulated immediately felt that but for the odd chance of little sidney ryvess having hammered on the outside at the moment he himself happened to have his head in the desk he might have remained for years without suspicion of it  this apparently would have been a loss for he had been right in guessing that the chamber was not empty  it contained objects which whether precious or not had at any rate been worth somebodys hiding  these objects were a collection of small fiat parcels of the shape of packets of letters wrapped in white paper and neatly sealed  the seals mechanically figured bore the impress neither of arms nor of initials the paper looked oldit had turned faintly sallow the packets might have been there for ages  baron counted themthere were nine in all of different sizes he turned them over and over felt them curiously and snuffed in their vague musty smell which affected him with the melancholy of some smothered human accent  the little bundles were neither named nor numberedthere was not a word of writing on any of the covers but they plainly contained old letters sorted and matched according to dates or to authorship  they told some old dead storythey were the ashes of fires burned out  as peter baron held his discoveries successively in his hands he became conscious of a queer emotion which was not altogether elation and yet was still less pure pain  he had made a find but it somehow added to his responsibility he was in the presence of something interesting but in a manner he couldnt have defined this circumstance suddenly constituted a danger  it was the perception of the danger for instance which caused to remain in abeyance any impulse he might have felt to break one of the seals  he looked at them all narrowly but he was careful not to loosen them and he wondered uncomfortably whether the contents of the secret compartment would be held in equity to be the property of the people in the kings road  he had given money for the davenport but had he given money for these buried papers  he paid by a growing consciousness that a nameless chill had stolen into the air the penalty which he had many a time paid before of being made of sensitive stuff  it was as if an occasion had insidiously arisen for a sacrificea sacrifice for the sake of a fine superstition something like honour or kindness or justice something indeed perhaps even finer stilla difficult deciphering of duty an impossible tantalising wisdom standing there before his ambiguous treasure and losing himself for the moment in the sense of a dawning complication he was startled by a light quick tap at the door of his sittingroom  instinctively before answering he listened an instanthe was in the attitude of a miser surprised while counting his hoard  then he answered one moment please and slipped the little heap of packets into the biggest of the drawers of the davenport which happened to be open the aperture of the false back was still gaping and he had not time to work back the spring  he hastily laid a big book over the place and then went and opened his door  it offered him a sight none the less agreeable for being unexpected the graceful and agitated figure of mrs ryves  her agitation was so visible that he thought at first that something dreadful had happened to her childthat she had rushed up to ask for help to beg him to go for the doctor  then he perceived that it was probably connected with the desperate verses he had transmitted to her a quarter of an hour before for she had his open manuscript in one hand and was nervously pulling it about with the other  she looked frightened and pretty and if in invading the privacy of a fellowlodger she had been guilty of a departure from rigid custom she was at least conscious of the enormity of the step and incapable of treating it with levity  the levity was for peter baron who endeavoured however to clothe his familiarity with respect pushing forward the seat of honour and repeating that he rejoiced in such a visit  the visitor came in leaving the door ajar and after a minute during which to help her he charged her with the purpose of telling him that he ought to be ashamed to send her down such rubbish she recovered herself sufficiently to stammer out that his song was exactly what she had been looking for and that after reading it she had been seized with an extraordinary irresistible impulsethat of thanking him for it in person and without delay  it was the impulse of a kind nature he said and i cant tell you what pleasure you give me  she declined to sit down and evidently wished to appear to have come but for a few seconds  she looked confusedly at the place in which she found herself and when her eyes met his own they struck him as anxious and appealing  she was evidently not thinking of his song though she said three or four times over that it was beautiful well i only wanted you to know and now i must go she added but on his hearthrug she lingered with such an odd helplessness that he felt almost sorry for her  perhaps i can improve it if you find it doesnt go said baron im so delighted to do anything for you i can  there may be a word or two that might be changed she answered rather absently  i shall have to think it over to live with it a little  but i like it and thats all i wanted to say  charming of you  im not a bit busy said baron  again she looked at him with a troubled intensity then suddenly she demanded  is there anything the matter with you  the matter with me  i mean like being ill or worried  i wondered if there might be i had a sudden fancy and that i think is really why i came up  there isnt indeed im all right  but your sudden fancies are inspirations  its absurd  you must excuse me  goodby said mrs ryves  what are the words you want changed baron asked  i dont want anyif youre all right  goodby his visitor repeated fixing her eyes an instant on an object on his desk that had caught them  his own glanced in the same direction and he saw that in his hurry to shuffle away the packets found in the davenport he had overlooked one of them which lay with its seals exposed  for an instant he felt found out as if he had been concerned in something to be ashamed of and it was only his quick second thought that told him how little the incident of which the packet was a sequel was an affair of mrs ryvess  her conscious eyes came back to his as if they were sounding them and suddenly this instinct of keeping his discovery to himself was succeeded by a really startled inference that with the rarest alertness she had guessed something and that her guess it seemed almost supernatural had been her real motive  some secret sympathy had made her vibratehad touched her with the knowledge that he had brought something to light  after an instant he saw that she also divined the very reflection he was then making and this gave him a lively desire a grateful happy desire to appear to have nothing to conceal  for herself it determined her still more to put an end to her momentary visit  but before she had passed to the door he exclaimed  all right  how can a fellow be anything else who has just had such a find  she paused at this still looking earnest and asking  what have you found  some ancient family papers in a secret compartment of my writing table  and he took up the packet he had left out holding it before her eyes  a lot of other things like that  what are they murmured mrs ryves  i havent the least idea  theyre sealed  you havent broken the seals she had come further back  i havent had time it only happened ten minutes ago  i knew it said mrs ryves more gaily now  what did you know  that you were in some predicament  youre extraordinary  i never heard of anything so miraculous down two flights of stairs  are you in a quandary the visitor asked  yes about giving them back  peter baron stood smiling at her and rapping his packet on the palm of his hand  what do you advise  she herself smiled now with her eyes on the sealed parcel  back to whom  the man of whom i bought the table  ah then theyre not from your family  no indeed the piece of furniture in which they were hidden is not an ancestral possession  i bought it at second handyou see its oldthe other day in the kings road  obviously the man who sold it to me sold me more than he meant he had no idea from his own point of view it was stupid of him that there was a hidden chamber or that mysterious documents were buried there  ought i to go and tell him  its rather a nice question  are the papers of value mrs ryves inquired  i havent the least idea  but i can ascertain by breaking a seal  dont said mrs ryves with much expression  she looked grave again  its rather tantalisingits a bit of a problem baron went on turning his packet over  mrs ryves hesitated  will you show me what you have in your hand  he gave her the packet and she looked at it and held it for an instant to her nose  it has a queer charming old fragrance he said  charming  its horrid  she handed him back the packet saying again more emphatically dont  dont break a seal  dont give back the papers  is it honest to keep them  certainly  theyre yours as much as the peoples of the shop  they were in the hidden chamber when the table came to the shop and the people had every opportunity to find them out  they didnt therefore let them take the consequences  peter baron reflected diverted by her intensity  she was pale with eyes almost ardent  the table had been in the place for years  that proves the things havent been missed  let me show you how they were concealed he rejoined and he exhibited the ingenious recess and the working of the curious spring she was greatly interested she grew excited and became familiar she appealed to him again not to do anything so foolish as to give up the papers the rest of which in their little blank impenetrable covers he placed in a row before her  they might be tracedtheir history their ownership he argued to which she replied that this was exactly why he ought to be quiet  he declared that women had not the smallest sense of honour and she retorted that at any rate they have other perceptions more delicate than those of men  he admitted that the papers might be rubbish and she conceded that nothing was more probable yet when he offered to settle the point offhand she caught him by the wrist acknowledging that absurd as it was she was nervous  finally she put the whole thing on the ground of his just doing her a favour  she asked him to retain the papers to be silent about them simply because it would please her  that would be reason enough  barons acquaintance his agreeable relations with her advanced many steps in the treatment of this question an element of friendly candour made its way into their discussion of it  i cant make out why it matters to you one way or the other nor why you should think it worth talking about the young man reasoned  neither can i  its just a whim  certainly if it will give you any pleasure ill say nothing at the shop  thats charming of you and im very grateful  i see now that this was why the spirit moved me to come upto save them mrs ryves went on  she added moving away that now she had saved them she must really go  to save them for what if i maynt break the seals baron asked  i dont knowfor a generous sacrifice  why should it be generous  whats at stake peter demanded leaning against the doorpost as she stood on the landing  i dont know what but i feel as if something or other were in peril  burn them up she exclaimed with shining eyes  ah you ask too muchim so curious about them  well i wont ask more than i ought and im much obliged to you for your promise to be quiet  i trust to your discretion  goodby  you ought to reward my discretion said baron coming out to the landing  she had partly descended the staircase and she stopped leaning against the baluster and smiling up at him  surely youve had your reward in the honour of my visit  thats delightful as far as it goes  but what will you do for me if i burn the papers  mrs ryves considered a moment  burn them first and youll see  on this she went rapidly downstairs and baron to whom the answer appeared inadequate and the proposition indeed in that form grossly unfair returned to his room  the vivacity of her interest in a question in which she had discoverably nothing at stake mystified amused and in addition irresistibly charmed him  she was delicate imaginative inflammable quick to feel quick to act  he didnt complain of it it was the way he liked women to be but he was not impelled for the hour to commit the sealed packets to the flames  he dropped them again into their secret well and after that he went out  he felt restless and excited another day was lost for work the dreadful job to be performed for mr locket was still further off    chapter iii    ten days after mrs ryvess visit he paid by appointment another call on the editor of the promiscuous  he found him in the little wainscoted chelsea house which had to peters sense the smoky brownness of an old pipebowl surrounded with all the emblems of his officea litter of papers a hedge of encyclopaedias a photographic gallery of popular contributorsand he promised at first to consume very few of the moments for which so many claims competed  it was mr locket himself however who presently made the interview spacious gave it air after discovering that poor baron had come to tell him something more interesting than that he couldnt after all patch up his tale  peter had begun with this had intimated respectfully that it was a case in which both practice and principle rebelled and then perceiving how little mr locket was affected by his audacity had felt weak and slightly silly left with his heroism on his hands he had armed himself for a struggle but the promiscuous didnt even protest and there would have been nothing for him but to go away with the prospect of never coming again had he not chanced to say abruptly irrelevantly as he got up from his chair  do you happen to be at all interested in sir dominick ferrand  mr locket who had also got up looked over his glasses  the late sir dominick  the only one you know the familys extinct  mr locket shot his young friend another sharp glance a silent retort to the glibness of this information  very extinct indeed im afraid the subject today would scarcely be regarded as attractive  are you very sure baron asked  mr locket leaned forward a little with his fingertips on his table in the attitude of giving permission to retire  i might consider the question in a special connection  he was silent a minute in a way that relegated poor peter to the general but meeting the young mans eyes again he asked  are youathinking of proposing an article upon him  not exactly proposing itbecause i dont yet quite see my way but the idea rather appeals to me  mr locket emitted the safe assertion that this eminent statesman had been a striking figure in his day then he added  have you been studying him  ive been dipping into him  im afraid hes scarcely a question of the hour said mr locket shuffling papers together  i think i could make him one peter baron declared  mr locket stared again he was unable to repress an unattenuated you  i have some new material said the young man colouring a little that often freshens up an old story  it buries it sometimes  its often only another tombstone  that depends upon what it is  however peter added the documents i speak of would be a crushing monument  mr locket hesitating shot another glance under his glasses  do you allude toarevelations  very curious ones  mr locket still on his feet had kept his body at the bowing angle it was therefore easy for him after an instant to bend a little further and to sink into his chair with a movement of his hand toward the seat baron had occupied  baron resumed possession of this convenience and the conversation took a fresh start on a basis which such an extension of privilege could render but little less humiliating to our young man  he had matured no plan of confiding his secret to mr locket and he had really come out to make him conscientiously that other announcement as to which it appeared that so much artistic agitation had been wasted  he had indeed during the past daysdays of painful indecisionappealed in imagination to the editor of the promiscuous as he had appealed to other sources of comfort but his scruples turned their face upon him from quarters high as well as low and if on the one hand he had by no means made up his mind not to mention his strange knowledge he had still more left to the determination of the moment the question of how he should introduce the subject  he was in fact too nervous to decide he only felt that he needed for his peace of mind to communicate his discovery  he wanted an opinion the impression of somebody else and even in this intensely professional presence five minutes after he had begun to tell his queer story he felt relieved of half his burden  his story was very queer he could take the measure of that himself as he spoke but wouldnt this very circumstance qualify it for the promiscuous  of course the letters may be forgeries said mr locket at last  ive no doubt thats what many people will say  have they been seen by any expert  no indeed theyve been seen by nobody  have you got any of them with you  no i felt nervous about bringing them out  thats a pity  i should have liked the testimony of my eyes  you may have it if youll come to my rooms  if you dont care to do that without a further guarantee ill copy you out some passages  select a few of the worst mr locket laughed  over barons distressing information he had become quite human and genial  but he added in a moment more dryly  you know they ought to be seen by an expert  thats exactly what i dread said peter  theyll be worth nothing to me if theyre not  peter communed with his innermost spirit  how much will they be worth to me if they are  mr locket turned in his studychair  i should require to look at them before answering that question  ive been to the british museumthere are many of his letters there  ive obtained permission to see them and ive compared everything carefully  i repudiate the possibility of forgery  no sign of genuineness is wanting there are details down to the very postmarks that no forger could have invented  besides whose interest could it conceivably have been  a labor of unspeakable difficulty and all for what advantage  there are so many letters tootwentyseven in all  lord what an ass mr locket exclaimed  it will be one of the strangest postmortem revelations of which history preserves the record  mr locket grave now worried with a paperknife the crevice of a drawer  its very odd  but to be worth anything such documents should be subjected to a searching criticismi mean of the historical kind  certainly that would be the task of the writer introducing them to the public  again mr locket considered then with a smile he looked up  you had better give up original composition and take to buying old furniture  do you mean because it will pay better  for you i should think original composition couldnt pay worse the creative facultys so rare  i do feel tempted to turn my attention to real heroes peter replied  im bound to declare that sir dominick ferrand was never one of mine  flashy crafty secondratethats how ive always read him it was never a secret moreover that his private life had its weak spots  he was a mere flash in the pan  he speaks to the people of this country said baron  he did but his voicethe voice i mean of his prestigeis scarcely audible now  theyre still proud of some of the things he did at the foreign officethe famous exchange with spain in the mediterranean which took europe so by surprise and by which she felt injured especially when it became apparent how much we had the best of the bargain then the sudden unexpected show of force by which he imposed on the united states our interpretation of that tiresome treatyi could never make out what it was about  these were both matters that no one really cared a straw about but he made every one feel as if they cared the nation rose to the way he played his trumpsit was uncommon  he was one of the few men weve had in our period who took europe or took america by surprise made them jump a bit and the country liked his doing itit was a pleasant change  the rest of the world considered that they knew in any case exactly what we would do which was usually nothing at all  say what you like hes still a high name partly also no doubt on account of other things his early success and early death his political cheek and wit his very appearancehe certainly was handsomeand the possibilities of future personal supremacy which it was the fashion at the time which its the fashion still to say had passed away with him  he had been twice at the foreign office that alone was remarkable for a man dying at fortyfour  what therefore will the country think when it learns he was venal  peter baron himself was not angry with sir dominick ferrand who had simply become to him he had been reading up feverishly for a week a very curious subject of psychological study but he could easily put himself in the place of that portion of the public whose memory was long enough for their patriotism to receive a shock  it was some time fortunately since the conduct of public affairs had wanted for men of disinterested ability but the extraordinary documents concealed of all places in the worldit was as fantastic as a nightmare in a bargain picked up at secondhand by an obscure scribbler would be a calculable blow to the retrospective mind baron saw vividly that if these relics should be made public the scandal the horror the chatter would be immense  immense would be also the contribution to truth the rectification of history  he had felt for several days and it was exactly what had made him so nervous as if he held in his hand the key to public attention  there are too many things to explain mr locket went on and the singular provenance of your papers would count almost overwhelmingly against them even if the other objections were met  there would be a perfect and probably a very complicated pedigree to trace  how did they get into your davenport as you call it and how long had they been there  what hands secreted them what hands had so incredibly clung to them and preserved them  who are the persons mentioned in them who are the correspondents the parties to the nefarious transactions  you say the transactions appear to be of two distinct kindssome of them connected with public business and others involving obscure personal relations  they all have this in common said peter baron that they constitute evidence of uneasiness in some instances of painful alarm on the writers part in relation to exposurethe exposure in the one case as i gather of the fact that he had availed himself of official opportunities to promote enterprises public works and that sort of thing in which he had a pecuniary stake  the dread of the light in the other connection is evidently different and these letters are the earliest in date  they are addressed to a woman from whom he had evidently received money  mr locket wiped his glasses  what woman  i havent the least idea  there are lots of questions i cant answer of course lots of identities i cant establish lots of gaps i cant fill  but as to two points im clear and they are the essential ones  in the first place the papers in my possession are genuine in the second place theyre compromising  with this peter baron rose again rather vexed with himself for having been led on to advertise his treasure it was his interlocutors perfectly natural scepticism that produced this effect for he felt that he was putting himself in a false position he detected in mr lockets studied detachment the fermentation of impulses from which unsuccessful as he was he himself prayed to be delivered  mr locket remained seated he watched baron go across the room for his hat and umbrella  of course the question would come up of whose property today such documents would legally he  there are heirs descendants executors to consider  in some degree perhaps hut ive gone into that a little  sir dominick ferrand had no children and he left no brothers and no sisters  his wife survived him but she died ten years ago  he can have had no heirs and no executors to speak of for he left no property  thats to his honour and against your theory said mr locket  i have no theory  he left a largeish mass of debt peter baron added  at this mr locket got up while his visitor pursued  so far as i can ascertain though of course my inquiries have had to be very rapid and superficial there is no one now living directly or indirectly related to the personage in question who would be likely to suffer from any steps in the direction of publicity  it happens to be a rare instance of a life that had as it were no loose ends at least there are none perceptible at present  i see i see said mr locket  but i dont think i should care much for your article  what article  the one you seem to wish to write embodying this new matter  oh i dont wish to write it peter exclaimed  and then he bade his host goodby  goodby said mr locket  mind you i dont say that i think theres nothing in it  you would think there was something in it if you were to see my documents  i should like to see the secret compartment  the caustic editor rejoined  copy me out some extracts  to what end if theres no question of their being of use to you  i dont say thati might like the letters themselves  themselves  not as the basis of a paper but just to publishfor a sensation  theyd sell your number baron laughed  i daresay i should like to look at them mr locket conceded after a moment  when should i find you at home  dont come said the young man  i make you no offer  i might make you one the editor hinted  dont trouble yourself i shall probably destroy them  with this peter baron took his departure waiting however just afterwards in the street near the house as if he had been looking out for a stray hansom to which he would not have signalled had it appeared  he thought mr locket might hurry after him but mr locket seemed to have other things to do and peter baron returned on foot to jersey villas    chapter iv    on the evening that succeeded this apparently pointless encounter he had an interview more conclusive with mrs bundy for whose shrewd and philosophic view of life he had several times expressed even to the good woman herself a considerable relish  the situation at jersey villas mrs ryves had suddenly flown off to dover was such as to create in him a desire for moral support and there was a kind of domestic determination in mrs bundy which seemed in general to advertise it  he had asked for her on coming in but had been told she was absent for the hour upon which he had addressed himself mechanically to the task of doing up his dishonoured manuscriptthe ingenious fiction about which mr locket had been so stupidfor further adventures and not improbable defeats  he passed a restless ineffective afternoon asking himself if his genius were a horrid delusion looking out of his window for something that didnt happen something that seemed now to be the advent of a persuasive mr locket and now the return from an absence more disappointing even than mrs bundys of his interesting neighbour of the parlours  he was so nervous and so depressed that he was unable even to fix his mind on the composition of the note with which on its next peregrination it was necessary that his manuscript should be accompanied  he was too nervous to eat and he forgot even to dine he forgot to light his candles he let his fire go out and it was in the melancholy chill of the late dusk that mrs bundy arriving at last with his lamp found him extended moodily upon his sofa  she had been informed that he wished to speak to her and as she placed on the malodorous luminary an oily shade of green pasteboard she expressed the friendly hope that there was nothing wrong with his ealth  the young man rose from his couch pulling himself together sufficiently to reply that his health was well enough but that his spirits were down in his hoots  he had a strong disposition to draw his landlady on the subject of mrs ryves as well as a vivid conviction that she constituted a theme as to which mrs bundy would require little pressure to tell him even more than she knew  at the same time he hated to appear to pry into the secrets of his absent friend to discuss her with their bustling hostess resembled too much for his taste a gossip with a tattling servant about an unconscious employer  he left out of account however mrs bundys knowledge of the human heart for it was this fine principle that broke down the barriers after he had reflected reassuringly that it was not meddling with mrs ryvess affairs to try and find out if she struck such an observer as happy  crudely abruptly even a little blushingly he put the direct question to mrs bundy and this led tolerably straight to another question which on his spirit sat equally heavy they were indeed but different phases of the same and which the good woman answered with expression when she ejaculated  think it a liberty for you to run down for a few hours  if she do my dear sir just send her to me to talk to  as regards happiness indeed she warned baron against imposing too high a standard on a young thing who had been through so much and before he knew it he found himself without the responsibility of choice in submissive receipt of mrs bundys version of this experience  it was an interesting picture though it had its infirmities one of them congenital and consisting of the fact that it had sprung essentially from the virginal brain of miss teagle  amplified edited embellished by the richer genius of mrs bundy who had incorporated with it and now liberally introduced copious interleavings of miss teagles own romance it gave peter baron much food for meditation at the same time that it only half relieved his curiosity about the causes of the charming womans underlying strangeness  he sounded this note experimentally in mrs bundys ear but it was easy to see that it didnt reverberate in her fancy  she had no idea of the picture it would have been natural for him to desire that mrs ryves should present to him and she was therefore unable to estimate the points in respect to which his actual impression was irritating  she had indeed no adequate conception of the intellectual requirements of a young man in love she couldnt tell him why their faultless friend was so isolated so unrelated so nervously shrinkingly proud  on the other hand she could tell him he knew it already that she had passed many years of her life in the acquisition of accomplishments at a seat of learning no less remote than boulogne and that miss teagle had been intimately acquainted with the late mr everard ryves who was a most rising young man in the city not making any year less than his clear twelve hundred  now that he isnt there to make them his mourning widow cant live as she had then can she mrs bundy asked  baron was not prepared to say that she could but he thought of another way she might live as he sat the next day in the train which rattled him down to dover  the place as he approached it seemed bright and breezy to him his roamings had been neither far enough nor frequent enough to make the cockneyfied coast insipid mrs bundy had of course given him the address he needed and on emerging from the station he was on the point of asking what direction he should take  his attention however at this moment was drawn away by the bustle of the departing boat  he had been long enough shut up in london to be conscious of refreshment in the mere act of turning his face to paris  he wandered off to the pier in company with happier tourists and leaning on a rail watched enviously the preparation the agitation of foreign travel  it was for some minutes a foretaste of adventure but ah when was he to have the very draught  he turned away as he dropped this interrogative sigh and in doing so perceived that in another part of the pier two ladies and a little boy were gathered with something of the same wistfulness  the little boy indeed happened to look round for a moment upon which with the keenness of the predatory age he recognised in our young man a source of pleasures from which he lately had been weaned  he bounded forward with irrepressible cries of geegee and peter lifted him aloft for an embrace  on putting him down the pilgrim from jersey villas stood confronted with a sensibly severe miss teagle who had followed her little charge whats the matter with the old woman he asked himself as he offered her a hand which she treated as the merest detail  whatever it was it was and very properly on the part of a loyal suivante the same complaint as that of her employer to whom from a distance for mrs ryves had not advanced an inch he flourished his hat as she stood looking at him with a face that he imagined rather white  mrs ryvess response to this salutation was to shift her position in such a manner as to appear again absorbed in the calais boat  peter baron however kept hold of the child whom miss teagle artfully endeavoured to wrest from hima policy in which he was aided by sidneys own rough but instinctive loyalty and he was thankful for the happy effect of being dragged by his jubilant friend in the very direction in which he had tended for so many hours  mrs ryves turned once more as he came near and then from the sweet strained smile with which she asked him if he were on his way to france he saw that if she had been angry at his having followed her she had quickly got over it  no im not crossing but it came over me that you might be and thats why i hurried downto catch you before you were off  oh we cant gomores the pity but why if we could mrs ryves inquired should you wish to prevent it  because ive something to ask you first something that may take some time  he saw now that her embarrassment had really not been resentful it had been nervous tremulous as the emotion of an unexpected pleasure might have been  thats really why i determined last night without asking your leave first to pay you this little visitthat and the intense desire for another bout of horseplay with sidney  oh ive come to see you peter baron went on and i wont make any secret of the fact that i expect you to resign yourself gracefully to the trial and give me all your time  the days lovely and im ready to declare that the place is as good as the day  let me drink deep of these things drain the cup like a man who hasnt been out of london for months and months  let me walk with you and talk with you and lunch with youi go back this afternoon  give me all your hours in short so that they may live in my memory as one of the sweetest occasions of life  the emission of steam from the french packet made such an uproar that baron could breathe his passion into the young womans ear without scandalising the spectators and the charm which little by little it scattered over his fleeting visit proved indeed to be the collective influence of the conditions he had put into words  what is it you wish to ask me mrs ryves demanded as they stood there together to which he replied that he would tell her all about it if she would send miss teagle off with sidney  miss teagle who was always anticipating her cue had already begun ostentatiously to gaze at the distant shores of france and was easily enough induced to take an earlier start home and rise to the responsibility of stopping on her way to contend with the butcher  she had however to retire without sidney who clung to his recovered prey so that the rest of the episode was seasoned to barons sense by the importunate twitch of the childs little plump cool hand  the friends wandered together with a conjugal air and sidney not between them hanging wistfully first over the lengthened picture of the calais boat till they could look after it as it moved rumbling away in a spell of silence which seemed to confessespecially when a moment later their eyes metthat it produced the same fond fancy in each  the presence of the boy moreover was no hindrance to their talking in a manner that they made believe was very frank  peter baron presently told his companion what it was he had taken a journey to ask and he had time afterwards to get over his discomfiture at her appearance of having fancied it might be something greater  she seemed disappointed but she was forgiving on learning from him that he had only wished to know if she judged ferociously his not having complied with her request to respect certain seals  how ferociously do you suspect me of having judged it she inquired  why to the extent of leaving the house the next moment  they were still lingering on the great granite pier when he touched on this matter and she sat down at the end while the breeze warmed by the sunshine ruffled the purple sea  she coloured a little and looked troubled and after an instant she repeated interrogatively the next moment  as soon as i told you what i had done  i was scrupulous about this you will remember i went straight downstairs to confess to you  you turned away from me saying nothing i couldnt imagineas i vow i cant imagine nowwhy such a matter should appear so closely to touch you  i went out on some business and when i returned you had quitted the house  it had all the look of my having offended you of your wishing to get away from me  you didnt even give me time to tell you how it was that in spite of your advice i determined to see for myself what my discovery represented  you must do me justice and hear what determined me  mrs ryves got up from her scat and asked him as a particular favour not to allude again to his discovery  it was no concern of hers at all and she had no warrant for prying into his secrets  she was very sorry to have been for a moment so absurd as to appear to do so and she humbly begged his pardon for her meddling  saying this she walked on with a charming colour in her cheek while he laughed out though he was really bewildered at the endless capriciousness of women  fortunately the incident didnt spoil the hour in which there were other sources of satisfaction and they took their course to her lodgings with such pleasant little pauses and excursions by the way as permitted her to show him the objects of interest at dover  she let him stop at a winemerchants and buy a bottle for luncheon of which in its order they partook together with a pudding invented by miss teagle which as they hypocritically swallowed it made them look at each other in an intimacy of indulgence  they came out again and while sidney grubbed in the gravel of the shore sat selfishly on the parade to the disappointment of miss teagle who had fixed her hopes on a fly and a ladylike visit to the castle  baron had his eye on his watchhe had to think of his train and the dismal return and many other melancholy things but the sea in the afternoon light was a more appealing picture the wind had gone down the channel was crowded the sails of the ships were white in the purple distance  the young man had asked his companion he had asked her before when she was to come back to jersey villas and she had said that she should probably stay at dover another week  it was dreadfully expensive but it was doing the child all the good in the world and if miss teagle could go up for some things she should probably be able to manage an extension earlier in the day she had said that she perhaps wouldnt return to jersey villas at all or only return to wind up her connection with mrs bundy  at another moment she had spoken of an early date an immediate reoccupation of the wonderful parlours  baron saw that she had no plan no real reasons that she was vague and in secret worried and nervous waiting for something that didnt depend on herself  a silence of several minutes had fallen upon them while they watched the shining sails to which mrs ryves put an end by exclaiming abruptly but without completing her sentence  oh if you had come to tell me you had destroyed them  those terrible papers  i like the way you talk about destroying you dont even know what they are  i dont want to know they put me into a state  what sort of a state  i dont know they haunt me  they haunted me that was why early one morning suddenly i couldnt keep my hands off them  i had told you i wouldnt touch them  i had deferred to your whim your superstition what is it but at last they got the better of me  i had lain awake all night threshing about itching with curiosity  it made me ill my own nerves as i may say were irritated my capacity to work was gone it had come over me in the small hours in the shape of an obsession a fixed idea that there was nothing in the ridiculous relics and that my exaggerated scruples were making a fool of me  it was ten to one they were rubbish they were vain they were empty that they had been even a practical joke on the part of some weakminded gentleman of leisure the former possessor of the confounded davenport  the longer i hovered about them with such precautions the longer i was taken in and the sooner i exposed their insignificance the sooner i should get back to my usual occupations  this conviction made my hand so uncontrollable that that morning before breakfast i broke one of the seals  it took me but a few minutes to perceive that the contents were not rubbish the little bundle contained old letters very curious old letters  i knowi know private and confidential so you broke the other seals  mrs ryves looked at him with the strange apprehension he had seen in her eyes when she appeared at his door the moment after his discovery  you know of course because i told you an hour later though you would let me tell you very little  baron as he met this queer gaze smiled hard at her to prevent her guessing that he smarted with the fine reproach conveyed in the tone of her last words but she appeared able to guess everything for she reminded him that she had not had to wait that morning till he came downstairs to know what had happened above but had shown him at the moment how she had been conscious of it an hour before had passed on her side the same tormented night as he and had had to exert extraordinary selfcommand not to rush up to his rooms while the study of the open packets was going on  youre so sensitively organised and youve such mysterious powers that you re uncanny baron declared  i feel what takes place at a distance thats all  one would think somebody you liked was in danger  i told you that that was what was present to me the day i came up to see you  oh but you dont like me so much as that baron argued laughing  she hesitated  no i dont know that i do  it must be for someone elsethe other person concerned  the other day however you wouldnt let me tell you that persons name  mrs ryves at this rose quickly  i dont want to know it its none of my business  no fortunately i dont think it is baron rejoined walking with her along the parade  she had sidney by the hand now and the young man was on the other side of her  they moved toward the stationshe had offered to go part of the way  but with your miraculous gift its a wonder you havent divined  i only divine what i want said mrs ryves  thats very convenient exclaimed peter to whom sidney had presently come round again  only being thus in the dark its difficult to see your motive for wishing the papers destroyed  mrs ryves meditated looking fixedly at the ground  i thought you might do it to oblige me  does it strike you that such an expectation formed in such conditions is reasonable  mrs ryves stopped short and this time she turned on him the clouded clearness of her eyes  what do you mean to do with them  it was peter barons turn to meditate which he did on the empty asphalt of the parade the season at dover was not yet where their shadows were long in the afternoon light  he was under such a charm as he had never known and he wanted immensely to be able to reply  ill do anything you like if youll love me  these words however would have represented a responsibility and have constituted what was vulgarly termed an offer  an offer of what he quickly asked himself here as he had already asked himself after making in spirit other awkward dashes in the same directionof what but his poverty his obscurity his attempts that had come to nothing his abilities for which there was nothing to show  mrs ryves was not exactly a success but she was a greater success than peter baron poor as he was he hated the sordid he knew she didnt love it and he felt small for talking of marriage  therefore he didnt put the question in the words it would have pleased him most to hear himself utter but he compromised with an angry young pang and said to her what will you do for me if i put an end to them  she shook her head sadlyit was always her prettiest movement  i can promise nothingoh no i cant promise  we must part now she added  youll miss your train  he looked at his watch taking the hand she held out to him  she drew it away quickly and nothing then was left him before hurrying to the station but to catch up sidney and squeeze him till he uttered a little shriek  on the way back to town the situation struck him as grotesque    chapter v    it tormented him so the next morning that after threshing it out a little further he felt he had something of a grievance  mrs ryvess intervention had made him acutely uncomfortable for she had taken the attitude of exerting pressure without it appeared recognising on his part an equal right  she had imposed herself as an influence yet she held herself aloof as a participant there were things she looked to him to do for her yet she could tell him of no good that would come to him from the doing  she should either have had less to say or have been willing to say more and he asked himself why he should be the sport of her moods and her mysteries  he perceived her knack of punctual interference to be striking but it was just this apparent infallibility that he resented  why didnt she set up at once as a professional clairvoyant and eke out her little income more successfully  in purely private life such a gift was disconcerting her divinations her evasions disturbed at any rate his own tranquillity  what disturbed it still further was that he received early in the day a visit from mr locket who leaving him under no illusion as to the grounds of such an honour remarked as soon as he had got into the room or rather while he still panted on the second flight and the smudged little slavey held open barons door that he had taken up his young friends invitation to look at sir dominick ferrands letters for himself  peter drew them forth with a promptitude intended to show that he recognised the commercial character of the call and without attenuating the inconsequence of this departure from the last determination he had expressed to mr locket  he showed his visitor the davenport and the hidden recess and he smoked a cigarette humming softly with a sense of unwonted advantage and triumph while the cautious editor sat silent and handled the papers for all his caution mr locket was unable to keep a warmer light out of his judicial eye as he said to baron at last with sociable brevitya tone that took many things for granted  ill take them home with methey require much attention  the young man looked at him a moment  do you think theyre genuine  he didnt mean to be mocking he meant not to be but the words sounded so to his own ear and he could see that they produced that effect on mr locket  i cant in the least determine  i shall have to go into them at my leisure and thats why i ask you to lend them to me  he had shuffled the papers together with a movement charged while he spoke with the air of being preliminary to that of thrusting them into a little black bag which he had brought with him and which resting on the shelf of the davenport struck peter who viewed it askance as an object darkly editorial  it made our young man somehow suddenly apprehensive the advantage of which he had just been conscious was about to be transferred by a quiet process of legerdemain to a person who already had advantages enough  baron in short felt a deep pang of anxiety he couldnt have said why  mr locket took decidedly too many things for granted and the explorer of sir dominick ferrands irregularities remembered afresh how clear he had been after all about his indisposition to traffic in them  he asked his visitor to what end he wished to remove the letters since on the one hand there was no question now of the article in the promiscuous which was to reveal their existence and on the other he himself as their owner had a thousand insurmountable scruples about putting them into circulation  mr locket looked over his spectacles as over the battlements of a fortress  im not thinking of the endim thinking of the beginning  a few glances have assured me that such documents ought to be submitted to some competent eye  oh you mustnt show them to anyone baron exclaimed  you may think me presumptuous but the eye that i venture to allude to in those terms  is the eye now fixed so terribly on me peter laughingly interrupted  oh it would be interesting i confess to know how they strike a man of your acuteness  it had occurred to him that by such a concession he might endear himself to a literary umpire hitherto implacable  there would be no question of his publishing sir dominick ferrand but he might in due acknowledgment of services rendered form the habit of publishing peter baron  how long would it be your idea to retain them he inquired in a manner which he immediately became aware was what incited mr locket to begin stuffing the papers into his bag  with this perception he came quickly closer and laying his hand on the gaping receptacle lightly drew its two lips together  in this way the two men stood for a few seconds touching almost in the attitude of combat looking hard into each others eyes  the tension was quickly relieved however by the surprised flush which mantled on mr lockets brow  he fell back a few steps with an injured dignity that might have been a protest against physical violence  really my dear young sir your attitude is tantamount to an accusation of intended bad faith  do you think i want to steal the confounded things  in reply to such a challenge peter could only hastily declare that he was guilty of no discourteous suspicion he only wanted a limit named a pledge of every precaution against accident  mr locket admitted the justice of the demand assured him he would restore the property within three days and completed with peters assistance his little arrangements for removing it discreetly  when he was ready his treacherous reticule distended with its treasures he gave a lingering look at the inscrutable davenport  its how they ever got into that thing that puzzles ones brain  there was some concatenation of circumstances that would doubtless seem natural enough if it were explained but that one would have to remount the stream of time to ascertain  to one course i have definitely made up my mind  not to make any statement or any inquiry at the shop  i simply accept the mystery said peter rather grandly  that would be thought a cheap escape if you were to put it into a story mr locket smiled  yes i shouldnt offer the story to you  i shall be impatient till i see my papers again the young man called out as his visitor hurried downstairs  that evening by the last delivery he received under the dover postmark a letter that was not from miss teagle  it was a slightly confused but altogether friendly note written that morning after breakfast the ostensible purpose of which was to thank him for the amiability of his visit to express regret at any appearance the writer might have had of meddling with what didnt concern her and to let him know that the evening before after he had left her she had in a moment of inspiration got hold of the tail of a really musical ideaa perfect accompaniment for the song he had so kindly given her  she had scrawled as a specimen a few bars at the end of her note mystic mocking musical signs which had no sense for her correspondent  the whole letter testified to a restless but rather pointless desire to remain in communication with him  in answering her however which he did that night before going to bed it was on this bright possibility of their collaboration its advantages for the future of each of them that baron principally expatiated  he spoke of this future with an eloquence of which he would have defended the sincerity and drew of it a picture extravagantly rich the next morning as he was about to settle himself to tasks for some time terribly neglected with a sense that after all it was rather a relief not to be sitting so close to sir dominick ferrand who had become dreadfully distracting at the very moment at which he habitually addressed his preliminary invocation to the muse he was agitated by the arrival of a telegram which proved to be an urgent request from mr locket that he would immediately come down and see him  this represented for poor baron whose funds were very low another morning sacrificed but somehow it didnt even occur to him that he might impose his own time upon the editor of the promiscuous the keeper of the keys of renown  he had some of the plasticity of the raw contributor  he gave the muse another holiday feeling she was really ashamed to take it and in course of time found himself in mr lockets own chair at mr lockets own tableso much nobler an expanse than the slippery slope of the davenportconsidering with quick intensity in the white flash of certain words just brought out by his host the quantity of happiness of emancipation that might reside in a hundred pounds  yes that was what it meant  mr locket in the twentyfour hours had discovered so much in sir dominicks literary remains that his visitor found him primed with an offer  a hundred pounds would be paid him that day that minute and no questions would be either asked or answered  i take all the risks i take all the risks the editor of the promiscuous repeated  the letters were out on the table mr locket was on the hearthrug like an orator on a platform and peter under the influence of his sudden ultimatum had dropped rather weakly into the seat which happened to be nearest and which as he became conscious it moved on a pivot he whirled round so as to enable himself to look at his tempter with an eye intended to be cold  what surprised him most was to find mr locket taking exactly the line about the expediency of publication which he would have expected mr locket not to take  hush it all up a barren scandal an offence that cant be remedied is the thing in the world that least justifies an airing some such line as that was the line he would have thought natural to a man whose life was spent in weighing questions of propriety and who had only the other day objected in the light of this virtue to a work of the most disinterested art but the author of that incorruptible masterpiece had put his finger on the place in saying to his interlocutor on the occasion of his last visit that if given to the world in the pages of the promiscuous sir dominicks aberrations would sell the edition  it was not necessary for mr locket to reiterate to his young friend his phrase about their making a sensation  if he wished to purchase the rights as theatrical people said it was not to protect a celebrated name or to lock them up in a cupboard  that formula of barons covered all the ground and one edition was a low estimate of the probable performance of the magazine  peter left the letters behind him and on withdrawing from the editorial presence took a long walk on the embankment  his impressions were at war with each otherhe was flurried by possibilities of which he yet denied the existence  he had consented to trust mr locket with the papers a day or two longer till he should have thought out the terms on which he mightin the event of certain occurrencesbe induced to dispose of them  a hundred pounds were not this gentlemans last word nor perhaps was mere unreasoning intractability peters own  he sighed as he took no note of the pictures made by bargessighed because it all might mean money  he needed money bitterly he owed it in disquieting quarters  mr locket had put it before him that he had a high responsibilitythat he might vindicate the disfigured truth contribute a chapter to the history of england  you havent a right to suppress such momentous facts the hungry little editor had declared thinking how the series he would spread it into three numbers would be the talk of the town  if peter had money he might treat himself to ardour to bliss  mr locket had said no doubt justly enough that there were ever so many questions one would have to meet should one venture to play so daring a game  these questions embarrassments dangersthe danger for instance of the croppingup of some lurking litigious relativehe would take over unreservedly and bear the brunt of dealing with  it was to be remembered that the papers were discredited vitiated by their childish pedigree such a preposterous origin suggesting as he had hinted before the feeble ingenuity of a thirdrate novelist was a thing he should have to place himself at the positive disadvantage of being silent about  he would rather give no account of the matter at all than expose himself to the ridicule that such a story would infallibly excite  couldnt one see them in advance the clever taunting things the daily and weekly papers would say  peter baron had his guileless side but he felt as he worried with a stick that betrayed him the granite parapets of the thames that he was not such a fool as not to know how mr locket would work the mystery of his marvellous find  nothing could help it on better with the public than the impenetrability of the secret attached to it  if mr locket should only be able to kick up dust enough over the circumstances that had guided his hand his fortune would literally be made  peter thought a hundred pounds a low bid yet he wondered how the promiscuous could bring itself to offer such a sumso large it loomed in the light of literary remuneration as hitherto revealed to our young man  the explanation of this anomaly was of course that the editor shrewdly saw a dozen ways of getting his money back  there would be in the sensation at a later stage the making of a book in large typethe book of the hour and the profits of this scandalous volume or if one preferred the name this reconstruction before an impartial posterity of a great historical humbug the sum down in other words that any lively publisher would give for it figured vividly in mr lockets calculations  it was therefore altogether an opportunity of dealing at first hand with the lively publisher that peter was invited to forego  peter gave a masterful laugh rejoicing in his heart that on the spot in the repaire he had lately quitted he had not been tempted by a figure that would have approximately represented the value of his property it was a good job he mentally added as he turned his face homeward that there was so little likelihood of his having to struggle with that particular pressure    chapter vi    when half an hour later he approached jersey villas he noticed that the housedoor was open then as he reached the gate saw it make a frame for an unexpected presence  mrs ryves in her bonnet and jacket looked out from it as if she were expecting somethingas if she had been passing to and fro to watch  yet when he had expressed to her that it was a delightful welcome she replied that she had only thought there might possibly be a cab in sight  he offered to go and look for one upon which it appeared that after all she was not as yet at least in need  he went back with her into her sittingroom where she let him know that within a couple of days she had seen clearer what was best she had determined to quit jersey villas and had come up to take away her things which she had just been packing and getting together  i wrote you last night a charming letter in answer to yours baron said  you didnt mention in yours that you were coming up  it wasnt your answer that brought me  it hadnt arrived when i came away  youll see when you get back that my letter is charming  i daresay  baron had observed that the room was not as she had intimated in confusionmrs ryvess preparations for departure were not striking  she saw him look round and standing in front of the fireless grate with her hands behind her she suddenly asked  where have you come from now  from an interview with a literary friend  what are you concocting between you  nothing at all  weve fallen outwe dont agree  is he a publisher  hes an editor  well im glad you dont agree  i dont know what he wants but whatever it is dont do it  he must do what i want said baron  and whats that  oh ill tell you when he has done it  baron begged her to let him hear the musical idea she had mentioned in her letter on which she took off her hat and jacket and seating herself at her piano gave him with a sentiment of which the very first notes thrilled him the accompaniment of his song  she phrased the words with her sketchy sweetness and he sat there as if he had been held in a velvet vise throbbing with the emotion irrecoverable ever after in its freshness of the young artist in the presence for the first time of productionthe proofs of his book the hanging of his picture the rehearsal of his play  when she had finished he asked again for the same delight and then for more music and for more it did him such a world of good kept him quiet and safe smoothed out the creases of his spirit  she dropped her own experiments and gave him immortal things and he lounged there pacified and charmed feeling the mean little room grow large and vague and happy possibilities come back abruptly at the piano she called out to him  those papers of yoursthe letters you foundare not in the house  no theyre not in the house  i was sure of it  no matterits all right she added  she herself was pacifiedtrouble was a false note  later he was on the point of asking her how she knew the objects she had mentioned were not in the house but he let it pass  the subject was a profitless riddlea puzzle that grew grotesquely bigger like some monstrosity seen in the darkness as one opened ones eyes to it  he closed his eyeshe wanted another vision  besides she had shown him that she had extraordinary sensesher explanation would have been stranger than the fact  moreover they had other things to talk about in particular the question of her putting off her return to dover till the morrow and dispensing meanwhile with the valuable protection of sidney  this was indeed but another face of the question of her dining with him somewhere that evening where else should she dine accompanying him for instance just for an hour of bohemia in their deadly respectable lives to a jolly little place in soho mrs ryves declined to have her life abused but in fact at the proper moment at the jolly little place to which she did accompany himit dealt in macaroni and chiantithe pair put their elbows on the crumpled cloth and face to face with their little emptied coffeecups pushed away and the young mans cigarette lighted by her command became increasingly confidential  they went afterwards to the theatre in cheap places and came home in busses and under umbrellas  on the way back peter baron turned something over in his mind as he had never turned anything before it was the question of whether at the end she would let him come into her sittingroom for five minutes  he felt on this point a passion of suspense and impatience and yet for what would it be but to tell her how poor he was  this was literally the moment to say it so supremely depleted had the hour of bohemia left him  even bohemia was too expensive and yet in the course of the day his whole temper on the subject of certain fitnesses had changed  at jersey villas it was near midnight and mrs ryves scratching a light for her glimmering taper had said oh yes come in for a minute if you like in her precarious parlour which was indeed after the brilliances of the evening a return to ugliness and truth she let him stand while he explained that he had certainly everything in the way of fame and fortune still to gain but that youth and love and faith and energyto say nothing of her supreme dearnesswere all on his side  why if ones beginnings were rough should one add to the hardness of the conditions by giving up the dream which if she would only hear him out would make just the blessed difference  whether mrs ryves heard him out or not is a circumstance as to which this chronicle happens to be silent but after he had got possession of both her hands and breathed into her face for a moment all the intensity of his tendernessin the relief and joy of utterance he felt it carry him like a rising floodshe checked him with better reasons with a cold sweet afterthought in which he felt there was something deep her procrastinating headshake was prettier than ever yet it had never meant so many fears and painsimpossibilities and memories independences and pieties and a sort of uncomplaining ache for the ruin of a friendship that had been happy  she had liked himif she hadnt she wouldnt have let him think sobut she protested that she had not in the odious vulgar sense encouraged him  moreover she couldnt talk of such things in that place at that hour and she begged him not to make her regret her goodnature in staying over there were peculiarities in her position considerations insurmountable  she got rid of him with kind and confused words and afterwards in the dull humiliated night he felt that he had been put in his place  women in her situation women who after having really loved and lost usually lived on into the new dawns in which old ghosts steal away  but there was something in his whimsical neighbour that struck him as terribly invulnerable    chapter vii    ive had time to look a little further into what were prepared to do and i find the case is one in which i should consider the advisability of going to an extreme length said mr locket  jersey villas the next morning had had the privilege of again receiving the editor of the promiscuous and he sat once more at the davenport where the bone of contention in the shape of a large loose heap of papers that showed how much they had been handled was placed well in view  we shall see our way to offering you three hundred but we shouldnt i must positively assure you see it a single step further  peter baron in his dressinggown and slippers with his hands in his pockets crept softly about the room repeating below his breath and with inflections that for his own sake he endeavoured to make humorous  three hundredthree hundred  his state of mind was far from hilarious for he felt poor and sore and disappointed but he wanted to prove to himself that he was gallantwas made in general and in particular of undiscourageable stuff  the first thing he had been aware of on stepping into his front room was that a fourwheeled cab with mrs ryvess luggage upon it stood at the door of no 3 permitting himself behind his curtain a pardonable peep he saw the mistress of his thoughts come out of the house attended by mrs bundy and take her place in the modest vehicle  after this his eyes rested for a long time on the sprigged cotton back of the landlady who kept bobbing at the window of the cab an endlessly moralising old head  mrs ryves had really taken flighthe had made jersey villas impossible for herbut mrs bundy with a magnanimity unprecedented in the profession seemed to express a belief in the purity of her motives  baron felt that his own separation had been for the present at least effected every instinct of delicacy prompted him to stand back  mr locket talked a long time and peter baron listened and waited he reflected that his willingness to listen would probably excite hopes in his visitorhopes which he himself was ready to contemplate without a scruple  he felt no pity for mr locket and had no consideration for his suspense or for his possible illusions he only felt sick and forsaken and in want of comfort and of money  yet it was a kind of outrage to his dignity to have the knife held to his throat and he was irritated above all by the ground on which mr locket put the questionthe ground of a service rendered to historical truth  it might behe wasnt clear it might bethe question was deep too deep probably for his wisdom at any rate he had to control himself not to interrupt angrily such dry interested palaver the false voice of commerce and of cant  he stared tragically out of the window and saw the stupid rain begin to fall the day was duller even than his own soul and jersey villas looked so sordidly hideous that it was no wonder mrs ryves couldnt endure them  hideous as they were he should have to tell mrs bundy in the course of the day that he was obliged to seek humbler quarters suddenly he interrupted mr locket he observed to him  i take it that if i should make you this concession the hospitality of the promiscuous would be by that very fact unrestrictedly secured to me  mr locket stared  hospitalitysecured  he thumbed the proposition as if it were a hard peach  i mean that of course you wouldntin courtsey in gratitudekeep on declining my things  i should give them my best attentionas ive always done in the past  peter baron hesitated  it was a case in which there would have seemed to be some chance for the ideally shrewd aspirant in such an advantage as he possessed but after a moment the blood rushed into his face with the shame of the idea of pleading for his productions in the name of anything but their merit  it was as if he had stupidly uttered evil of them  nevertheless be added the interrogation  would you for instance publish my little story  the one i read and objected to some features of the other day  do you meanawith the alteration mr locket continued  oh no i mean utterly without it  the pages you want altered contain as i explained to you very lucidly i think the very raison detre of the work and it would therefore it seems to me be an imbecility of the first magnitude to cancel them  peter had really renounced all hope that his critic would understand what he meant but under favour of circumstances he couldnt forbear to taste the luxury which probably never again would come within his reach of being really plain for one wild moment with an editor  mr locket gave a constrained smile  think of the scandal mr baron  but isnt this other scandal just what youre going in for  it will be a great public service  you mean it will be a big scandal whereas my poor story would be a very small one and that its only out of a big one that moneys to be made  mr locket got uphe too had his dignity to vindicate  such a sum as i offer you ought really to be an offset against all claims  very goodi dont mean to make any since you dont really care for what i write  i take note of your offer peter pursued and i engage to give you tonight in a few words left by my own hand at your house my absolutely definite and final reply  mr lockets movements as he hovered near the relics of the eminent statesman were those of some feathered parent fluttering over a threatened nest  if he had brought his huddled brood back with him this morning it was because he had felt sure enough of closing the bargain to be able to be graceful  he kept a glittering eye on the papers and remarked that he was afraid that before leaving them he must elicit some assurance that in the meanwhile peter would not place them in any other hands  peter at this gave a laugh of harsher cadence than he intended asking justly enough on what privilege his visitor rested such a demand and why he himself was disqualified from offering his wares to the highest bidder  surely you wouldnt hawk such things about cried mr locket but before baron had time to retort cynically he added  ill publish your little story  oh thank you  ill publish anything youll send me mr locket continued as he went out  peter had before this virtually given his word that for the letters he would treat only with the promiscuous  the young man passed during a portion of the rest of the day the strangest hours of his life  yet he thought of them afterwards not as a phase of temptation though they had been full of the emotion that accompanies an intense vision of alternatives  the struggle was already over it seemed to him that poor as he was he was not poor enough to take mr lockets money  he looked at the opposed courses with the selfpossession of a man who has chosen but this self possession was in itself the most exquisite of excitements  it was really a high revulsion and a sort of noble pity  he seemed indeed to have his finger upon the pulse of history and to be in the secret of the gods  he had them all in his hand the tablets and the scales and the torch  he couldnt keep a character together but he might easily pull one to pieces  that would be creative work of a kind he could reconstruct the character less pleasingly could show an unknown side of it  mr locket had had a good deal to say about responsibility and responsibility in truth sat there with him all the morning while he revolved in his narrow cage and watching the crude spring rain on the windows thought of the dismalness to which at dover mrs ryves was going back  this influence took in fact the form put on the physiognomy of poor sir dominick ferrand he was at present as perceptible in it as coldly and strangely personal as if he had been a haunting ghost and had risen beside his own old hearthstone  our friend was accustomed to his company and indeed had spent so many hours in it of late following him up at the museum and comparing his different portraits engravings and lithographs in which there seemed to be conscious pleading eyes for the betrayer that their queer intimacy had grown as close as an embrace  sir dominick was very dumb but he was terrible in his dependence and peter would not have encouraged him by so much curiosity nor reassured him by so much deference had it not been for the young mans complete acceptance of the impossibility of getting out of a tight place by exposing an individual  it didnt matter that the individual was dead it didnt matter that he was dishonest  peter felt him sufficiently alive to suffer he perceived the rectification of history so conscientiously desired by mr locket to be somehow for himself not an imperative task  it had come over him too definitely that in a case where ones success was to hinge upon an act of extradition it would minister most to an easy conscience to let the success go  no noeven should he be starving he couldnt make money out of sir dominicks disgrace  he was almost surprised at the violence of the horror with which as he shuffled mournfully about the idea of any such profit inspired him  what was sir dominick to him after all  he wished he had never come across him  in one of his brooding pauses at the windowthe window out of which never again apparently should he see mrs ryves glide across the little garden with the step for which he had liked her from the firsthe became aware that the rain was about to intermit and the sun to make some grudging amends  this was a sign that he might go out he had a vague perception that there were things to be done  he had work to look for and a cheaper lodging and a new idea every idea he had ever cherished had left him in addition to which the promised little word was to be dropped at mr lockets door  he looked at his watch and was surprised at the hour for he had nothing but a heartache to show for so much time  he would have to dress quickly but as he passed to his bedroom his eye was caught by the little pyramid of letters which mr locket had constructed on his davenport  they startled him and staring at them he stopped for an instant halfamused halfannoyed at their being still in existence he had so completely destroyed them in spirit that he had taken the act for granted and he was now reminded of the orderly stages of which an intention must consist to be sincere  baron went at the papers with all his sincerity and at his empty grate where there lately had been no fire and he had only to remove a horrible ornament of tissuepaper dear to mrs bundy he burned the collection with infinite method  it made him feel happier to watch the worst pages turn to illegible ashesif happiness be the right word to apply to his sense in the process of something so crisp and crackling that it suggested the deathrustle of banknotes  when ten minutes later he came back into his sittingroom he seemed to himself oddly unexpectedly in the presence of a bigger view  it was as if some interfering mass had been so displaced that he could see more sky and more country  yet the opposite houses were naturally still there and if the grimy little place looked lighter it was doubtless only because the rain had indeed stopped and the sun was pouring in  peter went to the window to open it to the altered air and in doing so beheld at the garden gate the humble growler in which a few hours before he had seen mrs ryves take her departure  it was unmistakablehe remembered the knockkneed white horse but this made the fact that his friends luggage no longer surmounted it only the more mystifying  perhaps the cabman had already removed the luggagehe was now on his box smoking the short pipe that derived relish from inaction paid for  as peter turned into the room again his ears caught a knock at his own door a knock explained as soon as he had responded by the hard breathing of mrs bundy  please sir its to say sheve come back  what has she come back for barons question sounded ungracious but his heartache had given another throb and he felt a dread of another wound  it was like a practical joke  i think its for you sir said mrs bundy  shell see you for a moment if youll be so good in the old place  peter followed his hostess downstairs and mrs bundy ushered him with her company flourish into the apartment she had fondly designated  i went away this morning and ive only returned for an instant said mrs ryves as soon as mrs bundy had closed the door  he saw that she was different now something had happened that had made her indulgent  have you been all the way to dover and back  no but ive been to victoria  ive left my luggage thereive been driving about  i hope youve enjoyed it  very much  ive been to see mr morrish  mr morrish  the musical publisher  i showed him our song  i played it for him and hes delighted with it  he declares its just the thing  he has given me fifty pounds  i think he believes in us mrs ryves went on while baron stared at the wondertoo sweet to be safe it seemed to him as yetof her standing there again before him and speaking of what they had in common  fifty pounds fifty pounds she exclaimed fluttering at him her happy cheque  she had come back the first thing to tell him and of course his share of the money would be the half  she was rosy jubilant natural she chattered like a happy woman  she said they must do more ever so much more mr morrish had practically promised he would take anything that was as good as that  she had kept her cab because she was going to dover she couldnt leave the others alone  it was a vehicle infirm and inert but baron after a little appreciated its pace for she had consented to his getting in with her and driving this time in earnest to victoria  she had only come to tell him the good news she repeated this assurance more than once  they talked of it so profoundly that it drove everything else for the time out of his headhis duty to mr locket the remarkable sacrifice he had just achieved and even the odd coincidence matching with the oddity of all the others of her having reverted to the house again as if with one of her famous divinations at the very moment the trumpery papers the origin really of their intimacy had ceased to exist but she on her side also had evidently forgotten the trumpery papers  she never mentioned them again and peter baron never boasted of what he had done with them  he was silent for a while from curiosity to see if her fine nerves had really given her a hint and then later when it came to be a question of his permanent attitude he was silent prodigiously religiously tremulously silent in consequence of an extraordinary conversation that he had with her  this conversation took place at dover when he went down to give her the money for which at mr morrishs bank he had exchanged the cheque she had left with him  that cheque or rather certain things it represented had made somehow all the difference in their relations  the difference was huge and baron could think of nothing but this confirmed vision of their being able to work fruitfully together that would account for so rapid a change  she didnt talk of impossibilities nowshe didnt seem to want to stop him off only when the day following his arrival at dover with the fifty pounds he had after all to agree to share them with herhe couldnt expect her to take a present of money from him he returned to the question over which they had had their little scene the night they dined togetheron this occasion he had brought a portmanteau and he was staying she mentioned that there was something very particular she had it on her conscience to tell him before letting him commit himself  there dawned in her face as she approached the subject a light of warning that frightened him it was charged with something so strange that for an instant he held his breath  this flash of ugly possibilities passed however and it was with the gesture of taking still tenderer possession of her checked indeed by the grave important way she held up a finger that he answered  tell me everythingtell me  you must know what i amwho i am you must know especially what im not  theres a name for it a hideous cruel name  its not my fault  others have known ive had to speak of itit has made a great difference in my life  surely you must have guessed she went on with the thinnest quaver of irony letting him now take her hand which felt as cold as her hard duty  dont you see ive no belongings no relations no friends nothing at all in all the world of my own  i was only a poor girl  a poor girl baron was mystified touched distressed piecing dimly together what she meant but feeling in a great surge of pity that it was only something more to love her for  my mothermy poor mother said mrs ryves  she paused with this and through gathering tears her eyes met his as if to plead with him to understand  he understood and drew her closer but she kept herself free still to continue  she was a poor girlshe was only a governess she was alone she thought he loved her  he didi think it was the only happiness she ever knew but she died of it  oh im so glad you tell meits so grand of you baron murmured thenyour father  he hesitated as if with his hands on old wounds  he had his own troubles but he was kind to her  it was all misery and follyhe was married  he wasnt happythere were good reasons i believe for that  i know it from letters i know it from a person whos dead  everyone is dead nowits too far off  thats the only good thing  he was very kind to me i remember him though i didnt know then as a little girl who he was  he put me with some very good peoplehe did what he could for me  i think later his wife knewa lady who came to see me once after his death  i was a very little girl but i remember many things  what he could he did something that helped me afterwards something that helps me now  i think of him with a strange pityi see him said mrs ryves with the faint past in her eyes  you mustnt say anything against him she added gently and gravely  nevernever for he has only made it more of a rapture to care for you  you must wait you must think we must wait together she went on you cant tell and you must give me time  now that you know its all right but you had to know  doesnt it make us better friends asked mrs ryves with a tired smile which had the effect of putting the whole story further and further away  the next moment however she added quickly as if with the sense that it couldnt be far enough  you dont know you cant judge you must let it settle think of it think of it oh you will and leave it so  i must have time myself oh i must  yes you must believe me  she turned away from him and he remained looking at her a moment ah how i shall work for you he exclaimed  you must work for yourself ill help you  her eyes had met his eyes again and she added hesitating thinking  you had better know perhaps who he was  baron shook his head smiling confidently  i dont care a straw  i doa little  he was a great man  there must indeed have been some good in him  he was a high celebrity  youve often heard of him  baron wondered an instant  ive no doubt youre a princess he said with a laugh  she made him nervous  im not ashamed of him  he was sir dominick ferrand  baron saw in her face in a few seconds that she had seen something in his  he knew that he stared then turned pale it had the effect of a powerful shock  he was cold for an instant as he had just found her with the sense of danger the confused horror of having dealt a blow  but the blood rushed back to its courses with his still quicker consciousness of safety and he could make out as he recovered his balance that his emotion struck her simply as a violent surprise  he gave a muffled murmur  ah its you my beloved which lost itself as he drew her close and held her long in the intensity of his embrace and the wonder of his escape  it took more than a minute for him to say over to himself often enough with his hidden face  ah she must never never know  she never knew she only learned when she asked him casually that he had in fact destroyed the old documents she had had such a comic caprice about  the sensibility the curiosity they had had the queer
