97836451	to judith of randolph massachusetts     the sea fairies  by l frank baum  author of the emerald city of oz dorothy and the wizard in oz ozma of oz the road to oz the land of oz etc   illustrated by john r neill      the oceans are big and broad i believe twothirds of the earths surface is covered with water what people inhabit this water has always been a subject of curiosity to the inhabitants of the land strange creatures come from the seas at times and perhaps in the ocean depths are many more strange than mortal eye has ever gazed upon  this story is fanciful in it the sea people talk and act much as we do and the mermaids especially are not unlike the fairies with whom we have learned to be familiar yet they are real sea people for all that and with the exception of zog the magician they are all supposed to exist in the oceans depths  i am told that some very learned people deny that mermaids or seaserpents have ever inhabited the oceans but it would be very difficult for them to prove such an assertion unless they had lived under the water as trot and capn bill did in this story  i hope my readers who have so long followed dorothys adventures in the land of oz will be interested in trots equally strange experiences the ocean has always appealed to me as a veritable wonderland and this story has been suggested to me many times by my young correspondents in their letters indeed a good many children have implored me to write something about the mermaids and i have willingly granted the request  hollywood 1911  l frank baum     list of

trot looking earnestly up into the old sailors face  they were seated on a bench built around a giant acacia tree that grew just at the edge of the bluff below them rolled the blue waves of the great pacific a little way behind them was the house a neat frame cottage painted white and surrounded by huge eucalyptus and pepper trees still farther behind thata quarter of a mile distant but built upon a bend of the coastwas the village overlooking a pretty bay  capn bill and trot came often to this tree to sit and watch the ocean below them the sailor man had one meat leg and one hickory leg and he often said the wooden one was the best of the two once capn bill had commanded and owned the anemone a trading schooner that plied along the coast and in those days charlie griffiths who was trots father had been the captains mate but ever since capn bills accident when he lost his leg charlie griffiths had been the captain of the little schooner while his old master lived peacefully ashore with the griffiths family  this was about the time trot was born and the old sailor became very fond of the baby girl her real name was mayre but when she grew big enough to walk she took so many busy little steps every day that both her mother and capn bill nicknamed her trot and so she was thereafter mostly called  it was the old sailor who taught the child to love the sea to love it almost as much as he and her father did and these two who represented the beginning and the end of life became firm friends and constant companions  why hasnt anybody seen a mermaid and lived asked trot again  cause mermaids is fairies an aint meant to be seen by us mortal folk replied capn bill  but if anyone happens to see em what then capn  then he answered slowly wagging his head the mermaids give em a smile an a wink an they dive into the water an gets drownded  spose they knew how to swim capn bill  that dont make any diffrence trot the mermaids live deep down an the poor mortals never come up again  the little girl was thoughtful for a moment but why do folks dive in the water when the mermaids smile an wink she asked  mermaids he said gravely is the most beautiful creatures in the worldor the water either you know what theyre like trot theys got a lovely ladys form down to the waist an then the other half of ems a fish with green an purple an pink scales all down it  have they got arms capn bill  course trot arms like any other lady an pretty faces that smile an look mighty sweet an fetchin their hair is long an soft an silky an floats all around em in the water when they comes up atop the waves they wring the water outn their hair and sing songs that go right to your heart if anybody is unlucky enough to be round jes then the beauty o them mermaids an their sweet songs charm em like magic sos they plunge into the waves to get to the mermaids but the mermaids havent any hearts trot no moren a fish has so they laughs when the poor people drown an dont care a fig thats why i says an i says it true that nobody never sawr a mermaid an lived to tell the tale  nobody asked trot  nobody a tall  then how do you know capn bill asked the little girl looking up into his face with big round eyes  capn bill coughed then he tried to sneeze to gain time then he took out his red cotton handkerchief and wiped his bald head with it rubbing hard so as to make him think clearer look trot aint that a brig out there he inquired pointing to a sail far out in the sea  how does anybody know about mermaids if those who have seen them never lived to tell about them she asked again  know what about em trot  about their green and pink scales and pretty songs and wet hair  they dont know i guess but mermaids jes natcherly has to be like that or they wouldnt be mermaids  she thought this over somebody must have lived capn bill she declared positively other fairies have been seen by mortals why not mermaids  praps they have trot praps they have he answered musingly im tellin you as it was told to me but i never stopped to inquire into the matter so close before seems like folks wouldnt know so much about mermaids if they hadnt seen em an yet accordin to all accounts the victim is bound to get drownded  praps suggested trot softly someone found a fotygraph of one of em  that might o been trot that might o been answered capn bill  a nice man was capn bill and trot knew he always liked to explain everything so she could fully understand it the aged sailor was not a very tall man and some people might have called him chubby or even fat he wore a blue sailor shirt with white anchors worked on the corners of the broad square collar and his blue trousers were very wide at the bottom he always wore one trouser leg over his wooden limb and sometimes it would flutter in the wind like a flag because it was so wide and the wooden leg so slender his rough kersey coat was a peajacket and came down to his waistline in the big pockets of his jacket he kept a wonderful jackknife and his pipe and tobacco and many bits of string and matches and keys and lots of other things whenever capn bill thrust a chubby hand into one of his pockets trot watched him with breathless interest for she never knew what he was going to pull out  the old sailors face was brown as a berry he had a fringe of hair around the back of his head and a fringe of whisker around the edge of his face running from ear to ear and underneath his chin his eyes were light blue and kind in expression his nose was big and broad and his few teeth were not strong enough to crack nuts with  trot liked capn bill and had a great deal of confidence in his wisdom and a great admiration for his ability to make tops and whistles and toys with that marvelous jackknife of his in the village were many boys and girls of her own age but she never had as much fun playing with them as she had wandering by the sea accompanied by the old sailor and listening to his fascinating stories  she knew all about the flying dutchman and davy jones locker and captain kidd and how to harpoon a whale or dodge an iceberg or lasso a seal capn bill had been everywhere in the world almost on his many voyages he had been wrecked on desert islands like robinson crusoe and been attacked by cannibals and had a host of other exciting adventures so he was a delightful comrade for the little girl and whatever capn bill knew trot was sure to know in time  how do the mermaids live she asked are they in caves or just in the water like fishes or how  cant say trot he replied ive asked divers about that but none of em ever run acrost a mermaids nest yet as ive heard of  if theyre fairies she said their homes must be very pretty  mebbe so trot but damp they are sure to be damp you know  id like to see a mermaid capn bill said the child earnestly  what an git drownded he exclaimed  no and live to tell the tale if theyre beautiful and laughing and sweet there cant be much harm in them im sure  mermaids is mermaids remarked capn bill in his most solemn voice it wouldnt do us any good to mix up with em trot  mayre mayre called a voice from the house  yes mamma  you an capn bill come in to supper     chapter 2  the mermaids   the next morning as soon as trot had helped wipe the breakfast dishes and put them away in the cupboard the little girl and capn bill started out toward the bluff the air was soft and warm and the sun turned the edges of the waves into sparkling diamonds across the bay the last of the fisherboats was speeding away out to sea for well the fishermen knew this was an ideal day to catch rockbass barracuda and yellowtail  the old man and the young girl stood on the bluff and watched all this with interest here was their world it isnt a bit rough this morning lets have a boat ride capn bill said the child  suits me to a t declared the sailor so they found the winding path that led down the face of the cliff to the narrow beach below and cautiously began the descent trot never minded the steep path or the loose rocks at all but capn bills wooden leg was not so useful on a downgrade as on a level and he had to be careful not to slip and take a tumble  but by and by they reached the sands and walked to a spot just beneath the big acacia tree that grew on the bluff halfway to the top of the cliff hung suspended a little shedlike structure that sheltered trots rowboat for it was necessary to pull the boat out of reach of the waves which beat in fury against the rocks at high tide about as high up as capn bill could reach was an iron ring securely fastened to the cliff and to this ring was tied a rope the old sailor unfastened the knot and began paying out the rope and the rowboat came out of its shed and glided slowly downward to the beach it hung on a pair of davits and was lowered just as a boat is lowered from a ships side when it reached the sands the sailor unhooked the ropes and pushed the boat to the waters edge it was a pretty little craft light and strong and capn bill knew how to sail it or row it as trot might desire  today they decided to row so the girl climbed into the bow and her companion stuck his wooden leg into the waters edge so he wouldnt get his foot wet and pushed off the little boat as he climbed aboard then he seized the oars and began gently paddling  whither away commodore trot he asked gaily  i dont care capn its just fun enough to be on the water she answered trailing one hand overboard so he rowed around by the north promontory where the great caves were and much as they were enjoying the ride they soon began to feel the heat of the sun  thats dead mans cave cause a skellington was found there observed the child as they passed a dark yawning mouth in the cliff and thats bumble cave cause the bumblebees make nests in the top of it and heres smugglers cave cause the smugglers used to hide things in it  she knew all the caves well and so did capn bill many of them opened just at the waters edge and it was possible to row their boat far into their dusky depths  and heres echo cave she continued dreamily as they slowly moved along the coast and giants cave andoh capn bill do you spose there were ever any giants in that cave  pears like there must o been trot or they wouldnt o named it that name he replied pausing to wipe his bald head with the red handkerchief while the oars dragged in the water  weve never been into that cave capn she remarked looking at the small hole in the cliffan archway through which the water flowed lets go in now  what for trot  to see if theres a giant there  hm arent you fraid  no are you i just dont blieve its big enough for a giant to get into  your father was in there once remarked capn bill an he says its the biggest cave on the coast but low down its full o water an the waters deep down to the very bottom o the ocean but the rock roofs liable to bump your head at high tide   its low tide now returned trot and how could any giant live in there if the roof is so low down  why he couldnt mate i reckon they must have called it giants cave cause its so big an not cause any giant man lived there  lets go in said the girl again id like to splore it  all right replied the sailor itll be cooler in there than out here in the sun we wont go very far for when the tide turns we mightnt get out again he picked up the oars and rowed slowly toward the cave the black archway that marked its entrance seemed hardly big enough to admit the boat at first but as they drew nearer the opening became bigger the sea was very calm here for the headland shielded it from the breeze  look out fer your head trot cautioned capn bill as the boat glided slowly into the rocky arch but it was the sailor who had to duck instead of the little girl only for a moment though just beyond the opening the cave was higher and as the boat floated into the dim interior they found themselves on quite an extensive branch of the sea for a time neither of them spoke and only the soft lapping of the water against the sides of the boat was heard a beautiful sight met the eyes of the two adventurers and held them dumb with wonder and delight  it was not dark in this vast cave yet the light seemed to come from underneath the water which all around them glowed with an exquisite sapphire color where the little waves crept up the sides of the rocks they shone like brilliant jewels and every drop of spray seemed a gem fit to deck a queen trot leaned her chin on her hands and her elbows on her lap and gazed at this charming sight with real enjoyment capn bill drew in the oars and let the boat drift where it would while he also sat silently admiring the scene  slowly the little craft crept farther and farther into the dim interior of the vast cavern while its two passengers feasted their eyes on the beauties constantly revealed both the old seaman and the little girl loved the ocean in all its various moods to them it was a constant companion and a genial comrade if it stormed and raved they laughed with glee if it rolled great breakers against the shore they clapped their hands joyfully if it lay slumbering at their feet they petted and caressed it but always they loved it  here was the ocean yet it had crept under the dome of overhanging rock to reveal itself crowned with sapphires and dressed in azure gown revealing in this guise new and unexpected charms good morning mayre said a sweet voice  trot gave a start and looked around her in wonder just beside her in the water were little eddiescircles within circlessuch as are caused when anything sinks below the surface diddid you hear that capn bill she whispered solemnly  capn bill did not answer he was staring with eyes that fairly bulged out at a place behind trots back and he shook a little as if trembling from cold trot turned half around and then she stared too rising from the blue water was a fair face around which floated a mass of long blonde hair it was a sweet girlish face with eyes of the same deep blue as the water and red lips whose dainty smile disposed two rows of pearly teeth the cheeks were plump and rosy the brows gracefully penciled while the chin was rounded and had a pretty dimple in it  the most beautifulest in all the world murmured capn bill in a voice of horror an no one has ever lived toto tell the tale  there was a peal of merry laughter at this laughter that rippled and echoed throughout the cavern just at trots side appeared a new face even fairer than the other with a wealth of brown hair wreathing the lovely features and the eyes smiled kindly into those of the child are you aa mermaid asked trot curiously she was not a bit afraid they seemed both gentle and friendly  yes dear was the soft answer  we are all mermaids chimed a laughing chorus and here and there all about the boat appeared pretty faces lying just upon the surface of the water  are you part fishes asked trot greatly pleased by this wonderful sight  no we are all mermaid replied the one with the brown hair the fishes are partly like us because they live in the sea and must move about and you are partly like us mayre dear but have awkward stiff legs so you may walk on the land but the mermaids lived before fishes and before mankind so both have borrowed something from us  then you must be fairies if youve lived always remarked trot nodding wisely  we are dear we are the water fairies answered the one with the blonde hair coming nearer and rising till her slender white throat showed plainly  wewere goners trot sighed capn bill with a white woebegone face  i guess not capn she answered calmly these pretty mermaids arent going to hurt us im sure  no indeed said the first one who had spoken if we were wicked enough to wish to harm you our magic could reach you as easily upon the land as in this cave but we love little girls dearly and wish only to please them and make their lives more happy  i believe that cried trot earnestly  capn bill groaned  guess why we have appeared to you said another mermaid coming to the side of the boat  why asked the child  we heard you say yesterday you would like to see a mermaid and so we decided to grant your wish  that was real nice of you said trot gratefully  also we heard all the foolish things capn bill said about us remarked the brownhaired one smilingly and we wanted to prove to him that they were wrong  i ony said what ive heard protested capn bill never havin seen a mermaid afore i couldnt be ackerate an i never expected to see one an live to tell the tale  again the cave rang with merry laughter and as it died away trot said may i see your scales please and are they green and purple and pink like capn bill said they seemed undecided what to say to this and swam a little way off where the beautiful heads formed a group that was delightful to see perhaps they talked together for the brownhaired mermaid soon came back to the side of the boat and asked would you like to visit our kingdom and see all the wonders that exist below the sea  id like to replied trot promptly but i couldnt id get drowned  that you would mate cried capn bill  oh no said the mermaid we would make you both like one of ourselves and then you could live within the water as easily as we do  i dont know as id like that said the child at least for always  you need not stay with us a moment longer than you please returned the mermaid smiling as if amused at the remark whenever you are ready to return home we promise to bring you to this place again and restore to you the same forms you are now wearing  would i have a fishs tail asked trot earnestly  you would have a mermaids tail was the reply  what color would my scales bepink or purple  you may choose the color yourself  look ahere trot said capn bill in excitement you aint thinkin o doin such a fool thing are you  course i am declared the little girl we dont get such invtations every day capn and if i dont go now i may never find out how the mermaids live  i dont care how they live myself said capn bill i jes want em to let me live  theres no danger insisted trot  i do know bout that thats what all the other folks said when they dove after the mermaids an got drownded  who asked the girl  i dont know who but ive heard tell  youve heard that no one ever saw a mermaid and lived said trot  to tell the tale he added nodding an if we dives down like they says we wont live ourselves  all the mermaids laughed at this and the brownhaired one said well if you are afraid dont come you may row your boat out of this cave and never see us again if you like we merely thought it would please little mayre and were willing to show her the sights of our beautiful home  id like to see em all right said trot her eyes glistening with pleasure  so would i admitted capn bill if we would live to tell the tale  dont you believe us asked the mermaid fixing her lovely eyes on those of the old sailor and smiling prettily are you afraid to trust us to bring you safely back  nnno said capn bill taint that ive got to look after trot  then youll have to come with me said trot decidedly for im going to cept this invtation if you dont care to come capn bill you go home and tell mother im visitin the mermaids  shed scold me inter shivers moaned capn bill with a shudder i guess id ruther take my chance down below  all right im ready miss mermaid said trot what shall i do jump in clothes and all  give me your hand dear answered the mermaid lifting a lovely white arm from the water trot took the slender hand and found it warm and soft and not a bit fishy  my name is clia continued the mermaid and i am a princess in our deepsea kingdom  just then trot gave a flop and flopped right out of the boat into the water capn bill caught a gleam of pink scales as his little friend went overboard and the next moment there was trots face in the water among those of the mermaids she was laughing with glee as she looked up into capn bills face and called come on in capn it didnt hurt a bit     chapter 3  the depths of the deep blue sea   capn bill stood up in the boat as if undecided what to do never a sailor man was more bewildered than this old fellow by the strangeness of the adventure he had encountered at first he could hardly believe it was all true and that he was not dreaming but there was trot in the water laughing with the mermaids and floating comfortably about and he couldnt leave his dear little companion to make the trip to the depths of the ocean alone  take my hand please capn bill said princess clia reaching her dainty arm toward him and suddenly the old man took courage and clasped the soft fingers in his own he had to lean over the boat to do this and then there came a queer lightness to his legs and he had a great longing to be in the water so he gave a flop and flopped in beside trot where he found himself comfortable enough but somewhat frightened  law sakes he gasped heres me in the water with my rheumatics ill be that stiff termorrer i cant wiggle  youre wigglin all right now observed trot thats a fine tail youve got capn an its green scales is jus beautiful  are they green eh he asked twisting around to try to see them  green as emralds capn how do they feel  feel trot feel why this tail beats that ol wooden leg all holler i kin do stunts now that i couldnt o done in a thousand years with ol peg  and dont be afraid of the rheumatism advised the princess no mermaid ever catches cold or suffers pain in the water  is capn bill a mermaid now asked trot  why hes a merman i suppose laughed the pretty princess but when he gets home he will be just capn bill again  wooden leg an all inquired the child  to be sure my dear  the sailor was now trying his newly discovered power of swimming and became astonished at the feats he could accomplish he could dart this way and that with wonderful speed and turn and dive and caper about in the water far better than he had ever been able to do on landeven before he got the wooden leg and a curious thing about this present experience was that the water did not cling to him and wet him as it had always done before he still wore his flannel shirt and pea jacket and his sailor cap but although he was in the water and had been underneath the surface the cloth still seemed dry and warm as he dived down and came up again the drops flashed from his head and the fringe of beard but he never needed to wipe his face or eyes at all  trot too was having queer experiences and enjoying them when she ducked under water she saw plainly everything about her as easily and distinctly as she had ever seen anything above water and by looking over her shoulder she could watch the motion of her new tail all covered with pretty iridescent pink scales which gleamed like jewels she wore her dress the same as before and the water failed to affect it in the least  she now noticed that the mermaids were clothed too and their exquisite gowns were the loveliest thing the little girl had ever beheld they seemed made of a material that was like sheeny silk cut low in the neck and with wide flowing sleeves that seldom covered the shapely white arms of her new friends the gowns had trains that floated far behind the mermaids as they swam but were so fleecy and transparent that the sparkle of their scales might be seen reaching back of their waists where the human form ended and the fish part began the sea fairies wore strings of splendid pearls twined around their throats while more pearls were sewn upon their gowns for trimmings they did not dress their beautiful hair at all but let it float around them in clouds  the little girl had scarcely time to observe all this when the princess said now my dear if you are ready we will begin our journey for it is a long way to our palaces  all right answered trot and took the hand extended to her with a trustful smile  will you allow me to guide you capn bill asked the blonde mermaid extending her hand to the old sailor  of course maam he said taking her fingers rather bashfully  my name is merla she continued and i am cousin to princess clia we must all keep together you know and i will hold your hand to prevent your missing the way  while she spoke they began to descend through the water and it grew quite dark for a time because the cave shut out the light but presently trot who was eagerly looking around her began to notice the water lighten and saw they were coming into brighter parts of the sea we have left the cave now said clia and may swim straight home  i spose there are no winding roads in the ocean remarked the child swimming swiftly beside her new friend  oh yes indeed at the bottom the way is far from being straight or level replied clia but we are in midwater now where nothing will hinder our journey unless  she seemed to hesitate so trot asked unless what  unless we meet with disagreeable creatures said the princess the midwater is not as safe as the very bottom and that is the reason we are holding your hands  what good would that do asked trot  you must remember that we are fairies said princess clia for that reason nothing in the ocean can injure us but you two are mortals and therefore not entirely safe at all times unless we protect you  trot was thoughtful for a few moments and looked around her a little anxiously now and then a dark form would shoot across their pathway or pass them at some distance but none was near enough for the girl to see plainly what it might be suddenly they swam right into a big school of fishes all yellowtails and of very large size there must have been hundreds of them lying lazily in the water and when they saw the mermaids they merely wriggled to one side and opened a path for the sea fairies to pass through will they hurt us asked trot  no indeed laughed the princess fishes are stupid creatures mostly and this family is quite harmless  how about sharks asked capn bill who was swimming gracefully beside them his hand clutched in that of pretty merla  sharks may indeed be dangerous to you replied clia so i advise you to keep them at a safe distance they never dare attempt to bite a mermaid and it may be they will think you belong to our band but it is well to avoid them if possible  dont get careless capn added trot  i surely wont mate he replied you see i didnt use to be fraid o sharks cause if they came near id stick my wooden leg at em but now if they happens to fancy these green scales its all up with ol bill  never fear said merla ill take care of you on our journey and in our palaces you will find no sharks at all  cant they get in he asked anxiously  no the palaces of the mermaids are inhabited only by themselves  is there anything else to be afraid of in the sea asked the little girl after they had swum quite a while in silence  one or two things my dear answered princess clia of course we mermaids have great powers being fairies yet among the sea people is one nearly as powerful as we are and that is the devilfish  i know said trot ive seen em  you have seen the smaller ones i suppose which sometimes rise to the surface or go near the shore and are often caught by fishermen said clia but they are only second cousins of the terrible deepsea devilfish to which i refer  those ones are bad enough though declared capn bill if you know any worse ones i dont want a interduction to em  the monster devilfish inhabit caves in the rugged mountainous regions of the ocean resumed the princess and they are evil spirits who delight in injuring all who meet them none lives near our palaces so there is little danger of your meeting any while you are our guests  i hope we wont said trot  none for me added capn bill devils of any sort ought to be give a wide berth an devilfish is worser ner sea serpents  oh do you know the sea serpents asked merla as if surprised  not much i dont answered the sailor but ive heard tell of folks as has seen em  did they ever live to tell the tale asked trot  sometimes he replied theyre jes orful creatures mate  how easy it is to be mistaken said princess clia softly we know the sea serpents very well and we like them  you do exclaimed trot  yes dear there are only three of them in all the world and not only are they harmless but quite bashful and shy they are kindhearted too and although not beautiful in appearance they do many kind deeds and are generally beloved  where do they live asked the child  the oldest one who is king of this ocean lives quite near us said clia his name is anko  how old is he inquired capn bill curiously  no one knows he was here before the ocean came and he stayed here because he learned to like the water better than the land as a habitation perhaps king anko is ten thousand years old perhaps twenty thousand we often lose track of the centuries down here in the sea  thats pretty old isnt it said trot older than capn bill i guess  summat chuckled the sailor man summat older mate but not much praps the sea serpent aint got gray whiskers  oh yes he has responded merla with a laugh and so have his two brothers unko and inko they each have an ocean of their own you know and once every hundred years they come here to visit their brother anko so weve seen all three many times  why how old are mermaids then asked trot looking around at the beautiful creatures wonderingly  we are like all ladies of uncertain age rejoined the princess with a smile we dont care to tell  older than capn bill  yes dear said clia  but we havent any gray whiskers added merla merrily and our hearts are ever young  trot was thoughtful it made her feel solemn to be in the company of such old people the band of mermaids seemed to all appearances young and fresh and not a bit as if theyd been soaked in water for hundreds of years the girl began to take more notice of the sea maidens following after her more than a dozen were in the group all were lovely in appearance and clothed in the same gauzy robes as merla and the princess these attendants did not join in the conversation but darted here and there in sportive play and often trot heard the tinkling chorus of their laughter whatever doubts might have arisen in the childs mind through the ignorant tales of her sailor friend she now found the mermaids to be lighthearted joyous and gay and from the first she had not been in the least afraid of her new companions  how much farther do we have to go asked capn bill presently  are you getting tired merla inquired  no said he but im sorter anxious to see what your palaces look like inside the water aint as interestin as the top of it its fine swimmin ill agree an i like it but there aint nuthin special to see that i can make out  that is true sir replied the princess we have purposely led you through the midwater hoping you would see nothing to alarm you until you get more accustomed to our ocean life moreover we are able to travel more swiftly here how far do you think we have already come capn  oh bout two mile he answered  well we are now hundreds of miles from the cave where we started she told him  you dont mean it he exclaimed in wonder  then theres magic in it announced trot soberly  true my dear to avoid tiring you and to save time we have used a little of our fairy power said clia the result is that we are nearing our home let us go downward a bit now for you must know that the mermaid palaces are at the very bottom of the ocean and in its deepest part     chapter 4  the palace of queen aquareine   trot was surprised to find it was not at all dark or gloomy as they descended farther into the deep sea things were not quite so clear to her eyes as they had been in the bright sunshine above the oceans surface but every object was distinct nevertheless as if she saw through a pane of greentainted glass the water was very clear except for this green shading and the little girl had never before felt so light and buoyant as she did now it was no effort at all to dart through the water which seemed to support her on all sides  i dont believe i weigh anything at all she said to capn bill  no more do i trot said he but thats natral seein as were under water so far what bothers me most is how we manage to breathe havin no gills like fishes have  are you sure we havent any gills she asked lifting her free hand to feel her throat  sure ner the mermaids havent any either declared capn bill  then said trot were breathing by magic  the mermaids laughed at this shrewd remark and the princess said you have guessed correctly my dear go a little slower now for the palaces are in sight  where asked trot eagerly  just before you  in that grove of trees inquired the girl and really it seemed to her that they were approaching a beautiful grove the bottom of the sea was covered with white sand in which grew many varieties of sea shrubs with branches like those of trees not all of them were green however for the branches and leaves were of a variety of gorgeous colors some were purple shading down to a light lavender and there were reds all the way from a delicate rosepink to vivid shades of scarlet orange yellow and blue shades were there too mingling with the seagreens in a most charming manner altogether trot found the brilliant coloring somewhat bewildering  these sea shrubs which in size were quite as big and tall as the trees on earth were set so close together that their branches entwined but there were several avenues leading into the groves and at the entrance to each avenue the girl noticed several large fishes with long spikes growing upon their noses  those are swordfishes remarked the princess as she led the band past one of these avenues  are they dangrous asked trot  not to us was the reply the swordfishes are among our most valued and faithful servants guarding the entrances to the gardens which surround our palaces if any creatures try to enter uninvited these guards fight them and drive them away their swords are sharp and strong and they are fierce fighters i assure you  ive known em to attack ships an stick their swords right through the wood said capn bill  those belonged to the wandering tribes of swordfishes explained the princess these who are our servants are too sensible and intelligent to attack ships  the band now headed into a broad passage through the gardens as the mermaids called these gorgeous groves and the great swordfishes guarding the entrance made way for them to pass afterward resuming their posts with watchful eyes as they slowly swam along the avenue trot noticed that some of the bushes seemed to have fruits growing upon them but what these fruits might be neither she nor capn bill could guess  the way wound here and there for some distance till finally they came to a more open space all carpeted with sea flowers of exquisite colorings although trot did not know it these flowers resembled the rare orchids of earth in their fanciful shapes and marvelous hues the child did not examine them very closely for across the carpet of flowers loomed the magnificent and extensive palaces of the mermaids  these palaces were built of coral white pink and yellow being used and the colors arranged in graceful designs the front of the main palace which now faced them had circular ends connecting the straight wall not unlike the architecture we are all familiar with yet there seemed to be no windows to the building although a series of archways served as doors  arriving at one of the central archways the band of sea maidens separated princess clia and merla leading trot and capn bill into the palace while the other mermaids swam swiftly away to their own quarters  welcome said clia in her sweet voice here you are surrounded only by friends and are in perfect safety please accept our hospitality as freely as you desire for we consider you honored guests i hope you will like our home she added a little shyly  we are sure to dear princess trot hastened to say  then clia escorted them through the archway and into a lofty hall it was not a mere grotto but had smoothly built walls of pink coral inlaid with white trot at first thought there was no roof for looking upward she could see the water all above them but the princess reading her thought said with a smile yes there is a roof or we would be unable to keep all the sea people out of our palace but the roof is made of glass to admit the light  glass cried the astonished child then it must be an awful big pane of glass  it is agreed clia our roofs are considered quite wonderful and we owe them to the fairy powers of our queen of course you understand there is no natural way to make glass under water  no indeed said capn bill and then he asked does your queen live here  yes she is waiting now in her throne room to welcome you shall we go in  id just as soon replied trot rather timidly but she boldly followed the princess who glided through another arch into another small room where several mermaids were reclining upon couches of coral they were beautifully dressed and wore many sparkling jewels  her majesty is awaiting the strangers princess clia announced one of these you are asked to enter at once  come then said clia and once more taking trots hand she led the girl through still another arch while merla followed just behind them escorting capn bill they now entered an apartment so gorgeous that the child fairly gasped with astonishment the queens throne room was indeed the grandest and most beautiful chamber in all the ocean palaces its coral walls were thickly inlaid with motherofpearl exquisitely shaded and made into borders and floral decorations in the corners were cabinets upon the shelves of which many curious shells were arranged all beautifully polished the floor glittered with gems arranged in patterns of flowers like a brilliant carpet  near the center of the room was a raised platform of motherofpearl upon which stood a couch thickly studded with diamonds rubies emeralds and pearls here reclined queen aquareine a being so lovely that trot gazed upon her spellbound and capn bill took off his sailor cap and held it in his hands  all about the room were grouped other motherofpearl couches not raised like that of the queen and upon each of these reclined a pretty mermaid they could not sit down as we do trot readily understood because of their tails but they rested very gracefully upon the couches with their trailing gauzy robes arranged in fleecy folds  when clia and merla escorted the strangers down the length of the great room toward the royal throne they met with pleasant looks and smiles on every side for the sea maidens were too polite to indulge in curious stares they paused just before the throne and the queen raised her head upon one elbow to observe them welcome mayre she said and welcome capn bill i trust you are pleased with your glimpse of the life beneath the surface of our sea  i am answered trot looking admiringly at the beautiful face of the queen  its all mighty curous an strangelike said the sailor slowly id no idee you mermaids were like this at all  allow me to explain that it was to correct your wrong ideas about us that led me to invite you to visit us replied the queen we usually pay little heed to the earth people for we are content in our own dominions but of course we know all that goes on upon your earth so when princess clia chanced to overhear your absurd statements concerning us we were greatly amused and decided to let you see with your own eyes just what we are like  im glad you did answered capn bill dropping his eyes in some confusion as he remembered his former description of the mermaids  now that you are here continued the queen in a cordial friendly tone you may as well remain with us a few days and see the wonderful sights of our ocean  im much obliged to you maam said trot and id like to stay ever so much but mother worries jus dreadfully if we dont get home in time  ill arrange all that said aquareine with a smile  how asked the girl  i will make your mother forget the passage of time so she will not realize how long you are away then she cannot worry  can you do that inquired trot  very easily i will send your mother into a deep sleep that will last until you are ready to return home just at present she is seated in her chair by the front window engaged in knitting the queen paused to raise an arm and wave it slowly to and fro then she added now your good mother is asleep little mayre and instead of worries i promise her pleasant dreams  wont someone rob the house while shes asleep asked the child anxiously  no dear my charm will protect the house from any intrusion  thats fine exclaimed trot in delight  its jes wonerful said capn bill i wish i knew it was so trots mother has a awful sharp tongue when shes worried  you may see for yourselves declared the queen and waved her hand again at once they saw before them the room in the cottage with mayres mother asleep by the window her knitting was in her lap and the cat lay curled up beside her chair it was all so natural that trot thought she could hear the clock over the fireplace tick after a moment the scene faded away when the queen asked with another smile are you satisfied  oh yes cried trot but how could you do it  it is a form of mirage was the reply we are able to bring any earth scene before us whenever we wish sometimes these scenes are reflected above the water so that mortals also observe them  ive seen em said capn bill nodding ive seen mirages but i never knowed what caused em afore now  whenever you see anything you do not understand and wish to ask questions i will be very glad to answer them said the queen  one thing that bothers me said trot is why we dont get wet being in the ocean with water all around us  that is because no water really touches you explained the queen your bodies have been made just like those of the mermaids in order that you may fully enjoy your visit to us one of our peculiar qualities is that water is never permitted to quite touch our bodies or our gowns always there remains a very small space hardly a hairs breadth between us and the water which is the reason we are always warm and dry  i see said trot thats why you dont get soggy or withered  exactly laughed the queen and the other mermaids joined in her merriment  i spose thats how we can breathe without gills remarked capn bill thoughtfully  yes the air space is constantly replenished from the water which contains air and this enables us to breathe as freely as you do upon the earth  but we have fins said trot looking at the fin that stood upright on capn bills back  yes they allow us to guide ourselves as we swim and so are very useful replied the queen  they make us more finished said capn bill with a chuckle then suddenly becoming grave he added how about my rheumatics maam aint i likely to get stiffened up with all this dampness  no indeed aquareine answered there is no such thing as rheumatism in all our dominions i promise no evil result shall follow this visit to us so please be as happy and contented as possible     chapter 5  the seaserpent   just then trot happened to look up at the glass roof and saw a startling sight a big head with a face surrounded by stubby gray whiskers was poised just over them and the head was connected with a long curved body that looked much like a sewer pipe  oh there is king anko said the queen following the childs gaze open a door and let him in clia for i suppose our old friend is anxious to see the earth people  wont he hurt us asked the little girl with a shiver of fear  who anko oh no my dear we are very fond of the sea serpent who is king of this ocean although he does not rule the mermaids old anko is a very agreeable fellow as you will soon discover  can he talk asked trot  yes indeed  and can we understand what he says  perfectly replied the queen i have given you power while you remain here to understand the language of every inhabitant of the sea  thats nice said trot gratefully  the princess clia swam slowly to one of the walls of the throne room where at a wave of her hand a round hole appeared in the coral the sea serpent at once observed this opening and the head left the roof of glass only to reappear presently at the round hole through this he slowly crawled until his head was just beneath the throne of queen aquareine who said to him  good morning your majesty i hope you are quite well  quite well thank your majesty answered anko and then he turned to the strangers i suppose these are the earth folks you were expecting  yes returned the queen the girl is named mayre and the man capn bill  while the sea serpent looked at the visitors they ventured to look at him he certainly was a queer creature yet trot decided he was not at all frightful his head was round as a ball but his ears were sharppointed and had tassels at the ends of them his nose was flat and his mouth very wide indeed but his eyes were blue and gentle in expression the white stubby hairs that surrounded his face were not thick like a beard but scattered and scraggly from the head the long brown body of the sea serpent extended to the hole in the coral wall which was just big enough to admit it and how much more of the body remained outside the child could not tell on the back of the body were several fins which made the creature look more like an eel than a serpent  the girl is young and the man is old said king anko in a soft voice but im quite sure capn bill isnt as old as i am  how old are you asked the sailor  i cant say exactly i can remember several thousands of years back but beyond that my memory fails me hows your memory capn bill  youve got me beat was the reply ill give in that youre older than i am  this seemed to please the sea serpent are you well he asked  pretty fair said capn bill hows yourself  oh im very well thank you answered anko i never remember to have had a pain but three times in my life the last time was when julius sneezer was on earth  you mean julius caesar said trot correcting him  no i mean julius sneezer insisted the sea serpent that was his real namesneezer they called him caesar sometimes just because he took everything he could lay hands on i ought to know because i saw him when he was alive did you see him when he was alive capn bill  i reckon not admitted the sailor  that time i had a toothache continued anko but i got a lobster to pull the tooth with his claw so the pain was soon over  did it hurt to pull it asked trot  hurt exclaimed the sea serpent groaning at the recollection my dear those creatures have been called lobsters ever since the second pain i had way back in the time of nevercouldnever  oh i spose you mean nebuchadnezzar said trot  do you call him that now asked the sea serpent as if surprised he used to be called nevercouldnever when he was alive but this new way of spelling seems to get everything mixed up nebuchadnezzar doesnt mean anything at all it seems to me  it means he ate grass said the child  oh no he didnt declared the sea serpent he was the first to discover that lettuce was good to eat and he became very fond of it the people may have called it grass but they were wrong i ought to know because i was alive when nevercouldnever lived were you alive then  no said trot  the pain i had then remarked anko was caused by a kink in my tail about three hundred feet from the end there was an old octopus who did not like me and so he tied a knot in my tail when i wasnt looking  what did you do asked capn bill  well first i transformed the octopus into a jellyfish and then i waited for the tide to turn when my tail was untied the pain stopped  ii dont understand that said trot somewhat bewildered  thank you my dear replied the sea serpent in a grateful voice people who are always understood are very common you are sure to respect those you cant understand for you feel that perhaps they know more than you do  about how long do you happen to be inquired capn bill  when last measured i was seven thousand four hundred and eightytwo feet five inches and a quarter im not sure about the quarter but the rest is probably correct adam measured me when cain was a baby  wheres the rest of you then asked trot  safe at home i hope and coiled up in my parlor answered the sea serpent when i go out i usually take along only what is needed it saves a lot of bother and i can always find my way back in the darkest night by just coiling up the part that has been away  do you like to be a sea serpent inquired the child  yes for im king of my ocean and there is no other sea serpent to imagine he is just as good as i am i have two brothers who live in other oceans but one is seven inches shorter than i am and the other several feet shorter its curious to talk about feet when we havent any feet isnt it  seems so acknowledged trot  i feel i have much to be proud of continued anko in a dreamy tone my great age my undisputed sway and my exceptional length  i dont blieve id care to live so long remarked capn bill thoughtfully  so long as seven thousand four hundred and eightytwo feet five inches and a quarter asked the sea serpent  no i mean so many years replied the sailor  but what can one do if one happens to be a sea serpent anko inquired there is nothing in the sea that can hurt me and i cannot commit suicide because we have no carbolic acid or firearms or gas to turn on so it isnt a matter of choice and id about as soon be alive as dead it does not seem quite so monotonous you know but i guess ive stayed about long enough so ill go home to dinner come and see me when you have time  thank you said trot and merla added ill take you over to his majestys palace when we go out and let you see how he lives  yes do said anko and then he slowly slid out of the hole which immediately closed behind him leaving the coral wall as solid as before  oh exclaimed trot king anko forgot to tell us what his third pain was about  so he did said capn bill we must ask him about that when we see him but i guess the ol boys memry is failin an he cant be depended on for perticlars     chapter 6  exploring the ocean   the queen now requested her guests to recline upon couches that they might rest themselves from their long swim and talk more at their ease so the girl and the sailor allowed themselves to float downward until they rested their bodies on two of the couches nearest the throne which were willingly vacated for them by the mermaids who occupied them until then  the visitors soon found themselves answering a great many questions about their life on the earth for although the queen had said she kept track of what was going on on the land there were many details of human life in which all the mermaids seemed greatly interested  during the conversation several seamaids came swimming into the room bearing trays of sea apples and other fruit which they first offered to the queen and then passed the refreshments around to the company assembled trot and capn bill each took some and the little girl found the fruits delicious to eat as they had a richer flavor than any that grew upon land queen aquareine was much pleased when the old sailor asked for more but merla warned him dinner would soon be served and he must take care not to spoil his appetite for that meal our dinner is at noon for we have to cook in the middle of the day when the sun is shining she said  cook cried trot why you cant build a fire in the water can you  we have no need of fires was the reply the glass roof of our kitchen is so curved that it concentrates the heat of the suns rays which are then hot enough to cook anything we wish  but how do you get along if the day is cloudy and the sun doesnt shine inquired the little girl  then we use the hot springs that bubble up in another part of the palace merla answered but the sun is the best to cook by so it was no surprise to trot when about noon dinner was announced and all the mermaids headed by their queen and their guests swam into another spacious room where a great long table was laid the dishes were of polished gold and daintycut glass and the cloth and napkins of fine gossamer around the table were ranged rows of couches for the mermaids to recline upon as they ate only the nobility and favorites of queen aquareine were invited to partake of this repast for clia explained that tables were set for the other mermaids in different parts of the numerous palaces  trot wondered who would serve the meal but her curiosity was soon satisfied when several large lobsters came sliding into the room backward bearing in their claws trays loaded with food each of these lobsters had a golden band behind its neck to show it was the slave of the mermaids  these curious waiters were fussy creatures and trot found much amusement in watching their odd motions they were so spry and excitable that at times they ran against one another and upset the platters of food after which they began to scold and argue as to whose fault it was until one of the mermaids quietly rebuked them and asked them to be more quiet and more careful  the queens guests had no cause to complain of the dinner provided first the lobsters served bowls of turtle soup which proved hot and deliciously flavored then came salmon steaks fried in fish oil with a fungus bread that tasted much like field mushrooms oysters clams softshell crabs and various preparations of seafoods followed the salad was a delicate leaf from some seaweed that trot thought was much nicer than lettuce several courses were served and the lobsters changed the plates with each course chattering and scolding as they worked and as trot said doing everything backwards in their nervous fussy way  many of the things offered them to eat were unknown to the visitors and the child was suspicious of some of them but capn bill asked no questions and ate everything offered him so trot decided to follow his example certain it is they found the meal very satisfying and evidently there was no danger of their being hungry while they remained the guests of the mermaids when the fruits came trot thought that must be the last course of the big dinner but following the fruits were ice creams frozen into the shape of flowers  how funny said the child to be eating ice cream at the bottom of the sea  why does that surprise you inquired the queen  i cant see where you get the ice to freeze it trot replied  it is brought to us from the icebergs that float in the northern parts of the ocean explained merla  o course trot you orter thought o that i did said capn bill  the little girl was glad there was no more to eat for she was ashamed to feel she had eaten every morsel she could her only excuse for being so greedy was that evrything tasted just splendid as she told the queen  and now said aquareine i will send you out for a swim with merla who will show you some of the curious sights of our sea you need not go far this afternoon and when you return we will have another interesting talk together so the blonde mermaid led trot and capn bill outside the palace walls where they found themselves in the pretty flower gardens  id feel all right mate if i could have a smoke remarked the old sailor to the child but thats a thing as cant be did here in the water  why not asked merla who overheard him  a pipe has to be lighted an a match wouldnt burn he replied  try it suggested the mermaid i do not mind your smoking at all if it will give you pleasure  its a bad habit ive got an im too old to break myself of it said capn bill then he felt in the big pocket of his coat and took out a pipe and a bag of tobacco after he had carefully filled his pipe rejoicing in the fact that the tobacco was not at all wet he took out his matchbox and struck a light the match burned brightly and soon the sailor was puffing the smoke from his pipe in great contentment the smoke ascended through the water in the shape of bubbles and trot wondered what anyone who happened to be floating upon the surface of the ocean would think to see smoke coming from the water  well i find i can smoke all right remarked capn bill but it bothers me to understand why  it is because of the air space existing between the water and everything you have about you explained merla but now if you will come this way i will take you to visit some of our neighbors they passed over the carpet of sea flowers the gorgeous blossoms swaying on their stems as the motion of the people in the water above them disturbed their repose and presently the three entered the dense shrubbery surrounding the palace they had not proceeded far when they came to a clearing among the bushes and here merla paused  trot and capn bill paused too for floating in the clear water was a group of beautiful shapes that the child thought looked like molds of wine jelly they were round as a dinner plate soft and transparent but tinted in such lovely hues that no artists brush has ever been able to imitate them some were deep sapphire blue others rose pink still others a delicate topaz color they seemed to have neither heads eyes nor ears yet it was easy to see they were alive and able to float in any direction they wished to go in shape they resembled inverted flowerpots with the upper edges fluted and from the centers floated what seemed to be bouquets of flowers  how pretty exclaimed trot enraptured by the sight  yes this is a rare variety of jellyfish replied merla the creatures are not so delicate as they appear and live for a long timeunless they get too near the surface and the waves wash them ashore  after watching the jellyfish a few moments they followed merla through the grove and soon a low chant like that of an indian song fell upon their ears it was a chorus of many small voices and grew louder as they swam on presently a big rock rose suddenly before them from the bottom of the sea rearing its steep side far up into the water overhead and this rock was thickly covered with tiny shells that clung fast to its surface the chorus they heard appeared to come from these shells and merla said to her companions these are the singing barnacles they are really very amusing and if you listen carefully you can hear what they say  so trot and capn bill listened and this is what the barnacles sang    we went to topsyturvy land to see a manowar   and we were much attached to it because we simply were   we found an anchorite within the mud upon the lea   for the ghost of jonahs whale he ran away and went to sea   oh it was awful   it was unlawful   we rallied round the flag in sevral millions   they couldnt shake us   they had to take us   so the halibut and cod they danced cotillions  what does it all mean asked trot  i suppose they refer to the way barnacles have of clinging to ships replied merla but usually the songs mean nothing at all the little barnacles havent many brains so we usually find their songs quite stupid  do they write some comic operas asked the child  i think not answered the mermaid  they seem to like the songs themselves remarked capn bill  oh yes they sing all day long but it never matters to them whether their songs mean anything or not let us go in this direction and visit some other sea people  so they swam away from the barnaclecovered rock and trot heard the last chorus as she slowly followed their conductor the barnacles were singing  oh very well then i hear the curfew please go away and come some other day goliath tussels with samsons muscles yet the muscles never fight in oyster bay  its jus nonsense said trot scornfully why dont they sing annie laurie or home sweet home or else keep quiet  why if they were quiet replied merla they wouldnt be singing barnacles  they now came to one of the avenues which led from the sea garden out into the broad ocean and here two swordfishes were standing guard is all quiet merla asked them  just as usual your highness replied one of the guards mummercubble was sick this morning and grunted dreadfully but hes better now and has gone to sleep king anko has been stirring around some but is now taking his afterdinner nap i think it will be perfectly safe for you to swim out for a while if you wish  whos mummercubble asked trot as they passed out into deep water  hes the sea pig replied merla i am glad hes asleep for now we wont meet him  dont you like him inquired trot  oh he complains so bitterly of everything that he bores us merla answered mummercubble is never contented or happy for a single minute  ive seen people like that said capn bill with a nod of his head an they has a way of upsettin the happiest folks they meet  look out suddenly cried the mermaid look out for your fingers here are the snapping eels  who where asked trot anxiously  and now they were in the midst of a cluster of wriggling darting eels which sported all around them in the water with marvelous activity yes look out for your fingers and your noses said one of the eels making a dash for capn bill at first the sailor was tempted to put out a hand and push the creature away but remembering that his fingers would thus be exposed he remained quiet and the eel snapped harmlessly just before his face and then darted away  stop it said merla stop it this minute or ill report your impudence to aquareine  oh who cares shouted the eels were not afraid of the mermaids  shell stiffen you up again as she did once before said merla if you try to hurt the earth people  are these earth people asked one and then they all stopped their play and regarded trot and capn bill with their little black eyes  the old polliwog looks something like king anko said one of them  im not a polliwog answered capn bill angrily im a respecble sailor man an ill have you treat me decent or ill know why  sailor said another that means to float on the waternot in it what are you doing down here  im jes avisitin answered capn bill  he is the guest of our queen said merla and so is this little girl if you do not behave nicely to them you will surely be sorry  oh thats all right replied one of the biggest eels wriggling around in a circle and then snapping at a companion which as quickly snapped out of his way we know how to be polite to company as well as the mermaids we wont hurt them  come on fellows lets go scare old mummercubble cried another and then in a flash they all darted away and left our friends to themselves trot was greatly relieved  i dont like eels she said  they are more mischievous than harmful replied merla but i do not care much for them myself  no added capn bill they aint respecful     chapter 7  the aristocratic codfish   the three swam slowly along quite enjoying the cool depths of the water every little while they met with some strange creatureor one that seemed strange to the earth peoplefor although trot and capn bill had seen many kinds of fish after they had been caught and pulled from the water that was very different from meeting them in their own element face to face as trot expressed it now that the various fishes were swimming around free and unafraid in their deepsea home they were quite different from the gasping excited creatures struggling at the end of a fishline or flopping from a net  before long they came upon a group of large fishes lying lazily near the bottom of the sea they were a dark color upon their backs and silver underneath but not especially pretty to look at the fishes made no effort to get out of merlas way and remained motionless except for the gentle motion of their fins and gills  here said the mermaid pausing is the most aristocratic family of fish in all the sea  what are they asked the girl  codfish was the reply their only fault is that they are too haughty and foolishly proud of their pedigree  overhearing this speech one codfish said to another in a very dignified tone of voice what insolence  isnt it replied the other there ought to be a law to prevent these common mermaids from discussing their superiors  my sakes said trot astonished how stuck up they are arent they  for a moment the group of fishes stared at her solemnly then one of the remarked in a disdainful manner come my dear let us leave these vulgar creatures  im not as vulgar as you are exclaimed trot much offended by this speech where i come from we only eat codfish when theres nothing else in the house to eat  how absurd observed one of the creatures arrogantly  eat codfish indeed said another in a lofty manner  yes and youre pretty salty too i can tell you at home youre nothing but a pickup said trot  dear me exclaimed the first fish who had spoken must we stand this insulting languageand from a person to whom we have never been introduced  i dont need no interduction replied the girl ive eaten you and you always make me thirsty  merla laughed merrily at this and the codfish said with much dignity come fellow aristocrats let us go  never mind were going ourselves announced merla and followed by her guests the pretty mermaid swam away  ive heard tell of codfish aristocracy said capn bill but i never knowed zacly what it meant afore  they jus made me mad with all their airs observed trot so i gave em a piece of my mind  you surely did mate said the sailor but i aint sure they understand what theyre like when theyre salted an hung up in the pantry folks generly gets stuckup cause they dont know theirselves like other folks knows em  we are near crabville now declared merla shall we visit the crabs and see what they are doing  yes lets replied trot the crabs are lots of fun ive often caught them among the rocks on the shore and laughed at the way they act wasnt it funny at dinnertime to see the way they slid around with the plates  those were not crabs but lobsters and crawfish remarked the mermaid they are very intelligent creatures and by making them serve us we save ourselves much household work of course they are awkward and provoke us sometimes but no servants are perfect it is said so we get along with ours as well as we can  theyre all right protested the child even if they did tip things over once in a while but it is easy to work in a sea palace im sure because theres no dusting or sweeping to be done  or scrubbin added capn bill  the crabs said merla are second cousins to the lobsters although much smaller in size there are many families or varieties of crabs and so many of them live in one place near here that we call it crabville i think you will enjoy seeing these little creatures in their native haunts  they now approached a kelp bed the straight thin stems of the kelp running far upward to the surface of the water here and there upon the stalks were leaves but trot thought the growing kelp looked much like sticks of macaroni except they were a rich redbrown color it was beyond the kelpwhich they had to push aside as they swam through so thickly did it growthat they came to a higher level a sort of plateau on the oceans bottom it was covered with scattered rocks of all sizes which appeared to have broken off from big shelving rocks they observed nearby the place they entered seemed like one of the rocky canyons you often see upon the earth  here live the fiddler crabs said merla but we must have taken them by surprise it is so quiet  even as she spoke there was a stirring and scrambling among the rocks and soon scores of lightgreen crabs were gathered before the visitors the crabs bore fiddles of all sorts and shapes in their claws and one big fellow carried a leaders baton the latter crab climbed upon a flat rock and in an excited voice called out ready nowready good fiddlers well play number 19 hail to the mermaids ready take aim fire away  at this command every crab began scraping at his fiddle as hard as he could and the sounds were so shrill and unmusical that trot wondered when they would begin to play a tune but they never did it was one regular mixup of sounds from beginning to end when the noise finally stopped the leader turned to his visitors and waving his baton toward them asked well what did you think of that  not much said trot honestly whats it all about  i composed it myself said the fiddler crab but its highly classical i admit all really great music is an acquired taste  i dont like it remarked capn bill it might do all right to stir up a racket new years eve but to call that screechin music  just then the crabs started fiddling again harder than ever and as it promised to be a long performance they left the little creatures scraping away at their fiddles as if for dear life and swam along the rocky canyon until on turning a corner they came upon a new and different scene  there were crabs here too many of them and they were performing the queerest antics imaginable some were building themselves into a pyramid each standing on edge with the biggest and strongest ones at the bottom when the crabs were five or six rows high they would all tumble over still clinging to one another and having reached the ground they would separate and commence to build the pyramid over again others were chasing one another around in a circle always moving backward or sidewise and trying to play leapfrog as they went still others were swinging on slight branches of seaweed or turning cartwheels or indulging in similar antics  merla and the earth people watched the busy little creatures for some time before they were themselves observed but finally trot gave a laugh when one crab fell on its back and began frantically waving its legs to get rightsideup again at the sound of her laughter they all stopped their play and came toward the visitors in a flock looking up at them with their bright eyes in a most comical way  welcome home cried one as he turned a back somersault and knocked another crab over  whats the difference between a mermaid and a tadpole asked another in a loud voice and without a pause continued why one drops its tail and the other holds onto it ha ha ho ho hee hee  these said merla are the clown crabs they are very silly things as you may already have discovered but for a short time they are rather amusing one tires of them very soon  theyre funny said trot laughing again its almost as good as a circus i dont think they would make me tired but then im not a mermaid  the clown crabs had now formed a row in front of them mr johnsing asked one why is a mermaid like an automobile  i dont know tommy blimken answered a big crab in the middle of the row why do you think a mermaid is like an automobile  because they both get tired said tommy blimken then all the crabs laughed and tommy seemed to laugh louder than the rest  how do the crabs in the sea know anything bout automobiles asked trot  why tommy blimken and harry hustle were both captured once by humans and put in an aquarium answered the mermaid but one day they climbed out and escaped finally making their way back to the sea and home again so they are quite traveled you see and great favorites among the crabs while they were on land they saw a great many curious things and so i suppose they saw automobiles  we did we did cried harry hustle an awkward crab with one big claw and one little one and we saw earth people with legs awfully funny they were and animals called horses with legs and other creatures with legs and the people cover themselves with the queerest thingsthey even wear feathers and flowers on their heads and  oh we know all about that said trot we live on the earth ourselves  well youre lucky to get off from it and into the good water said the crab i nearly died on the earth it was so stupid dry and airy but the circus was great they held the performance right in front of the aquarium where we lived and tommy and i learned all the tricks of the tumblers hi come on fellows and show the earth people what you can do  at this the crabs began performing their antics again but they did the same things over and over so capn bill and trot soon tired as merla said they would and decided they had seen enough of the crab circus so they proceeded to swim farther up the rocky canyon and near its upper end they came to a lot of conch shells lying upon the sandy bottom a funnylooking crab was sticking his head out from each of these shells  these are the hermit crabs said one of the mermaids they steal these shells and live in them so no enemies can attack them  dont they get lonesome asked trot  perhaps so my dear but they do not seem to mind being lonesome they are great cowards and think if they can but protect their lives there is nothing else to care for unlike the jolly crabs we have just left the hermits are cross and unsociable  oh keep quiet and go away said one of the hermit crabs in a grumpy voice no one wants mermaids around here then every crab withdrew its head into its shell and our friends saw them no more  theyre not very polite observed trot following the mermaid as merla swam upward into the middle water  i know now why cross people are called crabbed said capn bill theyve got dispositions jes like these ere hermit crabs  presently they came upon a small flock of mackerel and noticed that the fishes seemed much excited when they saw the mermaid they cried out oh merla what do you think our flippity has just gone to glory  when asked the mermaid  just now one replied we were lying in the water talking quietly together when a spinning shining thing came along and our dear flippity ate it then he went shooting up to the top of the water and gave a flop andwent to glory isnt it splendid merla  poor flippity sighed the mermaid im sorry for he was the prettiest and nicest mackerel in your whole flock  what does it mean asked trot how did flippity go to glory  why he was caught by a hook and pulled out of the water into some boat merla explained but these poor stupid creatures do not understand that and when one of them is jerked out of the water and disappears they have the idea he has gone to glory which means to them some unknown but beautiful sea  ive often wondered said trot why fishes are foolish enough to bite on hooks  they must know enough to know theyre hooks added capn bill musingly  oh they do replied merla ive seen fishes gather around a hook and look at it carefully for a long time they all know it is a hook and that if they bite the bait upon it they will be pulled out of the water but they are curious to know what will happen to them afterward and think it means happiness instead of death so finally one takes the hook and disappears and the others never know what becomes of him  why dont you tell em the truth asked trot  oh we do the mermaids have warned them many times but it does no good at all the fish are stupid creatures  but i wish i was flippity said one of the mackerel staring at trot with his big round eyes he went to glory before i could eat the hook myself  youre lucky answered the child flippity will be fried in a pan for someones dinner you wouldnt like that would you  flippity has gone to glory said another and then they swam away in haste to tell the news to all they met  i never heard of anything so foolish remarked trot as she swam slowly on through the clear blue water  yes it is very foolish and very sad answered merla but if the fish were wise men could not catch them for food and many poor people on your earth make their living by fishing  it seems wicked to catch such pretty things said the child  i do not think so merla replied laughingly for they were born to become food for someone and men are not the only ones that eat fishes many creatures of the sea feed upon them they even eat one another at times and if none was ever destroyed they would soon become so numerous that they would clog the waters of the ocean and leave no room for the rest of us so after all perhaps it is just as well they are thoughtless and foolish  presently they came to some round balls that looked much like balloons in shape and were gaily colored they floated quietly in the water and trot inquired what they were  balloonfish answered merla they are helpless creatures but have little spikes all over them so their enemies dare not bite them for fear of getting pricked  trot found the balloonfish quite interesting they had little dots of eyes and dots for mouths but she could see no noses and their fins and tails were very small  they catch these fish in the south sea islands and make lanterns of em said capn bill they first skin em and sew the skin up again to let it dry and then they put candles inside and the light shines through the dried skin  many other curious sights they saw in the ocean that afternoon and both capn bill and trot thoroughly enjoyed their glimpse of sea life at last merla said it was time to return to the palace from which she claimed they had not at any time been very far distant we must prepare for dinner as it will soon begin to grow dark in the water continued their conductor so they swam leisurely back to the groves that surrounded the palaces and as they entered the gardens the sun sank and deep shadows began to form in the ocean depths     chapter 8  a banquet under water   the palaces of the mermaids were all aglow with lights as they approached them and trot was amazed at the sight  where do the lamps come from she asked their guide wonderingly  they are not lamps my dear replied merla much amused at this suggestion we use electric lights in our palaces and have done so for thousands of yearslong before the earth people knew of electric lights  but where do you get em inquired capn bill who was as much astonished as the girl  from a transparent jellyfish which naturally emits a strong and beautiful electric light was the answer we have many hundreds of them in our palaces as you will presently see  their way was now lighted by small phosphorescent creatures scattered about the sea gardens and which merla informed them were hyalaea or sea glowworms but their light was dim when compared to that of the electric jellyfish which they found placed in clusters upon the ceilings of all the rooms of the palaces rendering them light as day trot watched these curious creatures with delight for delicately colored lights ran around their bodies in every direction in a continuous stream shedding splendid rays throughout the vast halls  a group of mermaids met the visitors in the hall of the main palace and told merla the queen had instructed them to show the guests to their rooms as soon as they arrived so trot followed two of them through several passages after which they swam upward and entered a circular opening there were no stairs here because there was no need of them and the little girl soon found herself in an upper room that was very beautiful indeed  all the walls were covered with iridescent shells polished till they resembled motherofpearl and upon the glass ceiling were clusters of the brilliant electric jellyfish rendering the room bright and cheerful with their radiance in one corner stood a couch of white coral with gossamer draperies hanging around it from the four high posts upon examining it the child found the couch was covered with soft amber sponges which rendered it very comfortable to lie upon in a wardrobe she found several beautiful gossamer gowns richly embroidered in colored seaweeds and these mayre was told she might wear while she remained the guest of the mermaids she also found a toilet table with brushes combs and other conveniences all of which were made of polished tortoiseshell  really the room was more dainty and comfortable than one might suppose possible in a palace far beneath the surface of the sea and trot was greatly delighted with her new quarters the mermaid attendants assisted the child to dress herself in one of the prettiest robes which she found to be quite dry and fitted her comfortably then the seamaids brushed and dressed her hair and tied it with ribbons of cherryred seaweed finally they placed around her neck a string of pearls that would have been priceless upon the earth and now the little girl announced she was ready for supper and had a good appetite  capn bill had been given a similar room near trot but the old sailor refused to change his clothes for any others offered him for which reason he was ready for supper long before his comrade what bothers me mate he said to the little girl as the y swam toward the great banquet hall where queen aquareine awaited them is why aint we crushed by the pressin of the water agin us bein as were down here in the deep sea  hows that capn why should we be crushed she asked  why evrbody knows that the deeper you go in the sea the more the water presses agin you he explained even the divers in their steel jackets cant stand it very deep down an here we be miles from the top o the water i spect an we dont feel crowded a bit  i know why answered the child wisely the water dont touch us you see if it did it might crush us but it dont its always held a little way off from our bodies by the magic of the fairy mermaids  true enough trot declared the sailor man what an idjut i was not to think o that myself  in the royal banquet hall were assembled many of the mermaids headed by the lovely queen and as soon as their earth guests arrived aquareine ordered the meal to be served the lobsters again waited upon the table wearing little white caps and aprons which made them look very funny but trot was so hungry after her afternoons excursion that she did not pay as much attention to the lobsters as she did to her supper which was very delicious and consisted of many courses a lobster spilled some soup on capn bills bald head and made him yell for a minute because it was hot and he had not expected it but the queen apologized very sweetly for the awkwardness of her servants and the sailor soon forgot all about the incident in his enjoyment of the meal  after the feast ended they all went to the big reception room where some of the mermaids played upon harps while others sang pretty songs they danced together tooa graceful swimming dance so queer to the little girl that it interested and amused her greatly capn bill seemed a bit bashful among so many beautiful mermaids yet he was pleased when the queen offered him a place beside her throne where he could see and hear all the delightful entertainment provided for the royal guests he did not talk much being a man of few words except when alone with trot but his lightblue eyes were big and round with wonder at the sights he saw  trot and the sailor man went to bed early and slept soundly upon their spongecovered couches the little girl never wakened until long after the sun was shining down through the glass roof of her room and when she opened her eyes she was startled to find a number of big small and middlesized fishes staring at her through the glass thats one bad thing bout this mermaid palace she said to herself its too public everthing in the sea can look at you through the glass as much as it likes i wouldnt mind fishes looking at me if they hadnt such big eyes angoodness me theres a monster thats all head and there goes a fish with a sail on its back an heres old mummercubble im sure for hes got a head just like a pig  she might have watched the fishes on the roof for hours had she not remembered it was late and breakfast must be ready so she dressed and made her toilet and swam down into the palace to find capn bill and the mermaids politely waiting for her to join them the sea maidens were as fresh and lovely as ever while each and all proved sweet tempered and merry even at the breakfast tableand that is where people are cross if they ever are during the meal the queen said i shall take you this morning to the most interesting part of the ocean where the largest and most remarkable sea creatures live and we must visit king anko too for the sea serpent would feel hurt and slighted if i did not bring my guests to call upon him  that will be nice said trot eagerly  but capn bill asked is there any danger maam  i think not replied queen aquareine i cannot say that you will be exposed to any danger at all so long as im with you but we are going into the neighborhood of such fierce and even terrible beings which would attack you at once did they suspect you to be earth people so in order to guard your safety i intend to draw the magic circle around both of you before we start  what is the magic circle asked trot  a fairy charm that prevents any enemy from touching you no monster of the sea however powerful will be able to reach your body while you are protected by the magic circle declared the queen  oh then ill not be a bit afraid returned the child with perfect confidence  am i to have the magic circle drawn around me too asked capn bill  of course answered aquareine you will need no other protection than that yet both princess clia and i will both be with you for today i shall leave merla to rule our palaces in my place until we return  no sooner was breakfast finished than trot was anxious to start the girl was also curious to discover what the powerful magic circle might prove to be but she was a little disappointed in the ceremony the queen merely grasped her fairy wand in her right hand and swam around the child in a circle from left to right then she took her wand in her left hand and swam around trot in another circle from right to left now my dear said she you are safe from any creature we are liable to meet  she performed the same ceremony for capn bill who was doubtful about the magic circle because he felt the same after it as he had before but he said nothing of his unbelief and soon they left the palace and started upon their journey     chapter 9  the bashful octopus   it was a lovely day and the sea was like azure under the rays of the sun  over the flower beds and through the gardens they swam emerging into the open sea in a direction opposite that taken by the visitors the day before the party consisted of but four queen aquareine princess clia trot and capn bill  people who live upon the land know only those sea creatures which they are able to catch in nets or upon hooks or those which become disabled and are washed ashore remarked the queen as they swam swiftly through the clear water and those who sail in ships see only the creatures who chance to come to the surface but in the deep ocean caverns are queer beings that no mortal has ever heard of or beheld and some of these we are to visit we shall also see some sea shrubs and flowering weeds which are sure to delight you with their beauty  the sights really began before they had gone very far from the palace and a school of butterfly fish having gorgeous colors spattered over their broad wings was first to delight the strangers they swam just as butterflies fly with a darting jerky motion and called a merry good morning to the mermaids as they passed  these butterfly fish are remarkably active said the princess and their quick motions protect them from their enemies we like to meet them they are always so gay and goodnatured  why so am i cried a sharp voice just beside them and they all paused to discover what creature had spoken to them  take care said clia in a low voice its an octopus  trot looked eagerly around a long brown arm stretched across their way in front and another just behind them but that did not worry her the octopus himself came slowly sliding up to them and proved to be well worth looking at he wore a red coat with brass buttons and a silk hat was tipped over one ear his eyes were somewhat dull and watery and he had a moustache of long hairlike feelers that curled stiffly at the ends when he tried to smile at them he showed two rows of sharp white teeth in spite of his red coat and yellowembroidered vest his standing collar and carefully tied cravat the legs of the octopus were bare and trot noticed he used some of his legs for arms as in one of them was held a slender cane and in another a handkerchief  well well said the octopus are you all dumb or dont you know enough to be civil when you meet a neighbor  we know how to be civil to our friends replied trot who did not like the way he spoke  well are we not friends then asked the octopus in an airy tone of voice  i think not said the little girl octopuses are horrid creatures  octopi if you please octopi said the monster with a laugh  i dont see any pie that pleases me replied trot beginning to get angry  octopus means one of us two or more are called octopi remarked the creature as if correcting her speech  i suppose a lot of you would be a whole bakery she said scornfully  our name is latin it was given to us by learned scientists years ago said the octopus  thats true enough agreed capn bill the learned scientists named evry blamed thing they come across an generly they picked out names as nobody could understand or pernounce  that isnt our fault sir said the octopus indeed its pretty hard for us to go through life with such terrible names think of the poor little seahorse he used to be a merry and cheerful fellow but since they named him hippocampus he hasnt smiled once  lets go said trot i dont like to sociate with octopuses  octopi said the creature again correcting her  youre jus as horrid whether youre puses or pies she declared  horrid cried the monster in a shocked tone of voice  not only horrid but horrible persisted the girl  may i ask in what way he inquired and it was easy to see he was offended  why evrybody knows that octopuses are jus wicked an deceitful she said up on the earth where i live we call the stannerd oil company an octopus an the coal trust an octopus an  stop stop cried the monster in a pleading voice do you mean to tell me that the earth people whom i have always respected compare me to the stannerd oil company  yes said trot positively  oh what a disgrace what a cruel direful dreadful disgrace moaned the octopus drooping his head in shame and trot could see great tears falling down his cheeks  this comes of having a bad name said the queen gently for she was moved by the monsters grief  it is unjust it is cruel and unjust sobbed the creature mournfully just because we have several long arms and take whatever we can reach they accuse us of being likelikeoh i cannot say it it is too shameful too humiliating  come lets go said trot again so they left the poor octopus weeping and wiping his watery eyes with his handkerchief and swam on their way im not a bit sorry for him remarked the child for his legs remind me of serpents  so they do me agreed capn bill  but the octopi are not very bad said the princess and we get along with them much better than we do with their cousins the sea devils  oh are the sea devils their cousins asked trot  yes and they are the only creatures of the ocean which we greatly fear replied aquareine i hope we shall meet none today for we are going near to the dismal caverns where they live  what are the sea devils like maam inquired capn bill a little uneasily  something like the octopus you just saw only much larger and of a bright scarlet color striped with black answered the queen they are very fierce and terrible creatures and nearly as much dreaded by the inhabitants of the ocean as is zog and nearly as powerful as king anko himself  zog who is zog questioned the girl i havent heard of him before now  we do not like to mention zogs name responded the queen in a low voice he is the wicked genius of the sea and a magician of great power  whats he like asked capn bill  he is a dreadful creature part fish part man part beast and part serpent centuries ago they cast him off the earth into the sea where he has caused much trouble once he waged a terrible war against king anko but the sea serpent finally conquered zog and drove the magician into his castle where he now stays shut up for if ever anko catches the monster outside of his enchanted castle he will kill him and zog knows that very well  seems like you have your troubles down here just as we do on top the ground remarked capn bill  but im glad old zog is shut up in his castle added trot is it a sea castle like your own palace  i cannot say my dear for the enchantment makes it invisible to all eyes but those of its inhabitants replied aquareine no one sees zog now and we scarcely ever hear of him but all the sea people know he is here someplace and fear his power even in the old days before anko conquered him zog was the enemy of the mermaids as he was of all the good and respectable seafolk but do not worry about the magician i beg of you for he has not dared to do an evil deed in many many years  oh im not afraid asserted trot  im glad of that said the queen keep together friends and be careful not to separate for here comes an army of sawfishes  even as aquareine spoke they saw a swirl and commotion in the water ahead of them while a sound like a muffled roar fell upon their ears then swiftly there dashed upon them a group of great fishes with long saws sticking out in front of their noses armed with sharp hooked teeth all set in a row they were larger than the swordfishes and seemed more fierce and bold but the mermaids and trot and capn bill quietly awaited their attack and instead of tearing them with their saws as they expected to do the fishes were unable to touch them at all they tried every possible way to get at their proposed victims but the magic circle was all powerful and turned aside the ugly saws so our friends were not disturbed at all seeing this the sawfishes soon abandoned the attempt and with growls and roars of disappointment swam away and were quickly out of sight  trot had been a wee bit frightened during the attack but now she laughed gleefully and told the queen that it seemed very nice to be protected by fairy powers the water grew a darker blue as they descended into its depths farther and farther away from the rays of the sun trot was surprised to find she could see so plainly through the high wall of water above her but the sun was able to shoot its beams straight down through the transparent sea and they seemed to penetrate to every nook and crevice of the rocky bottom  in this deeper part of the ocean some of the fishes had a phosphorescent light of their own and these could be seen far ahead as if they were lanterns the explorers met a school of argonauts going up to the surface for a sail and the child watched these strange creatures with much curiosity the argonauts live in shells in which they are able to hide in case of danger from prowling wolf fishes but otherwise they crawl out and carry their shells like humps upon their backs then they spread their skinny sails above them and sail away under water till they come to the surface where they float and let the currents of air carry them along the same as the currents of water had done before trot thought the argonauts comical little creatures with their big eyes and sharp noses and to her they looked like a fleet of tiny ships  it is said that men got their first idea of boats and of how to sail them from watching these little argonauts     chapter 10  the undiscovered island   in following the fleet of argonauts the four explorers had risen higher in the water and soon found they had wandered to an open space that seemed to trot like the flat top of a high hill the sands were covered with a growth of weeds so gorgeously colored that one who had never peered beneath the surface of the sea would scarcely believe they were not the product of a dye shop every known hue seemed represented in the delicate fernlike leaves that swayed softly to and fro as the current moved them they were not set close together these branches of magnificent hues but were scattered sparsely over the sandy bottom of the sea so that while from a distance they seemed thick a nearer view found them spread out with ample spaces of sand between them  in these sandy spaces lay the real attractiveness of the place for here were many of those wonders of the deep that have surprised and interested people in all ages  first were the starfisheshundreds of them it seemedlying sleepily on the bottom with their five or six points extended outward they were of various colors some rich and brilliant others of dark brown hues a few had wound their arms around the weeds or were creeping slowly from one place to another in the latter case turning their points downward and using them as legs but most of them were lying motionless and as trot looked down upon them she thought they resembled stars in the sky on a bright night except that the blue of the heavens was here replaced by the white sand and the twinkling diamond stars by the colored starfish  we are near an island said the queen and that is why so many starfishes are here as they love to keep close to shore also the little seahorses love these weeds and to me they are more interesting than the starfish  trot now noticed the seahorses for the first time they were quite smallmerely two or three inches highbut had funny little heads that were shaped much like the head of a horse and bright intelligent eyes they had no legs though for their bodies ended in tails which they twined around the stems of seaweeds to support themselves and keep the currents from carrying them away  trot bent down close to examine one of the queer little creatures and exclaimed why the seahorses havent any fins or anything to swim with  oh yes we have replied the sea horse in a tiny but distinct voice these things on the side of my head are fins  i thought they were ears said the girl  so they are fins and ears at the same time answered the little sea animal also there are small fins on our backs of course we cant swim as the mermaids do or even as swiftly as fishes but we manage to get around thank you  dont the fishes catch and eat you inquired trot curiously  sometimes admitted the sea horse and there are many other living things that have a way of destroying us but here i am as you see over six weeks old and during that time i have escaped every danger that isnt so bad is it  phoo said a starfish lying near im over three months old youre a mere baby sea horse  im not cried the sea horse excitedly im fullgrown and may live to be as old as you are  not if i keep on living said the starfish calmly and trot knew he was correct in his statement  the little girl now noticed several sea spiders creeping around and drew back because she did not think them very pretty they were shaped not unlike the starfishes but had slender legs and big heads with wickedlooking eyes sticking out of them  oh i dont like those things said trot coming closer to her companions  you dont eh said a big sea spider in a cross voice why do you come around here then scaring away my dinner when youre not wanted  it isnt your ocean replied trot  no and it isnt yours snapped the spider but as its big enough for us both id like you to go away  so we will said aquareine gently and at once she moved toward the surface of the water trot and capn bill followed with clia and the child asked what island are we near  it has no name answered the queen for it is not inhabited by man nor has it ever yet been discovered by them perhaps you will be the first humans to see this island but it is a barren rocky place and only fit for seals and turtles  are any of them there now capn bill inquired  i think so we will see  trot was astonished to find how near they were to the top of the ocean for they had not ascended through the water very long when suddenly her head popped into the air and she gave a gasp of surprise to find herself looking at the clear sky for the first time since she had started upon this adventure by rowing into giants cave  she floated comfortably in the water with her head and face just out of it and began to look around her capn bill was at her side and so were the two mermaids the day was fair and the surface of the sea which stretched far away as the eye could reach rippled under a gentle breeze they had risen almost at the edge of a small rocky islet high in the middle but gradually slanting down to the water no trees or bushes or grass grew anywhere about only rocks gray and bleak were to be seen  trot scarcely noticed this at first however for the island seemed covered with groups of forms some still and some moving which the old sailor promptly recognized as seals many were lying asleep or sunning themselves others crept awkwardly around using their strong fins as legs or paddles and caring little if they disturbed the slumbers of the others once in a while one of those crowded out of place would give a loud and angry bark which awakened others and set them to barking likewise  baby seals were there in great numbers and were more active and playful than their elders it was really wonderful how they could scramble around on the land and trot laughed more than once at their antics  at the edge of the water lay many huge turtles some as big around as a wagon wheel and others much smaller in size  the big ones are very old said the queen seeing trots eyes fixed on the turtles  how old asked the child  hundreds of years i think they live to a great age for nothing can harm them when they withdraw their legs and heads into their thick shells we use some of the turtles for food but prefer the younger ones men also fish for turtles and eat them but of course no men ever come to this outoftheway place in the ocean so the inhabitants of this little island know they are perfectly safe  in the center of the island rose high cliffs on top of which were to be seen great flocks of seagulls some whirling in the air while others were perched upon the points of rock  what do the birds find to eat asked capn bill  they often feed upon seals which die of accident or old age and they are expert fishermen explained queen aquareine curiously enough the seals also feed upon these birds which they are often able to catch in their strong jaws when the gulls venture too near and then the seals frequently rob the nests of eggs of which they are very fond  id like a few gulls eggs now remarked a big seal that lay near them upon the shore trot had thought him sound asleep but now he opened his eyes to blink lazily at the group in the water  good morning said the queen arent you chief muffruff  i am answered the old seal and you are aquareine the mermaid queen you see i remember you although you havent been here for years and isnt that princess clia to be sure but the other mermaids are strangers to me especially the baldheaded one  im not a mermaid asserted capn bill im a sailor jes avisitin the mermaids  our friends are earth dwellers explained the queen  thats odd said muffruff i cant remember that any earth dwellers ever came this way before i never travel far you see for im chief of this disorderly family of seals that live on this islandon it and off it that is  youre a poor chief said a big turtle lying beside the seal if your people are disorderly it is your own fault  muffruff gave a chuckling laugh then with a movement quick as lightning he pushed his head under the shell of the turtle and gave it a sudden jerk the huge turtle was tossed up on edge and then turned flat upon its back where its short legs struggled vainly to right its overturned body  there snorted the seal contemptuously perhaps youll dare insult me again in the presence of visitors you old mudwallower  seeing the plight of the turtle several young seals came laughingly wabbling to the spot and as they approached the helpless creature drew in his legs and head and closed his two shells tightly together the seals bumped against the turtle and gave it a push that sent it sliding down the beach like a toboggan and a minute later it splashed into the water and sank out of sight but that was just what the creature wanted on shore the upset turtle was quite helpless but the mischievous seals saved him for as soon as he touched the water he was able to turn and right himself which he promptly did then he raised his head above the water and asked  is it peace or war muffruff  whichever you like answered the seal indifferently  perhaps the turtle was angry for it ran on shore with remarkable swiftness uttering a shrill cry as it advanced at once all the other turtles awoke to life and with upraised heads joined their comrade in the rush for the seals most of chief muffruffs band scrambled hastily down the rocks and plunged into the water of the sea without waiting for the turtles to reach them but the chief himself was slow in escaping it may be that he was ashamed to run while the mermaids were watching but if this was so he made a great mistake the turtles snapped at his fins and tail and began biting round chunks out of them so that chief muffruff screamed with pain and anger and floundered into the water as fast as he could go the vengeful turtles were certainly the victors and now held undisputed possession of the island  trot laughed joyously at the incident not feeling a bit sorry for the old seal who had foolishly begun the battle even the gentle queen smiled as she said  these quarrels between the turtles and the seals are very frequent but they are soon ended an hour from now they will all be lying asleep together just as we found them but we will not wait for that let us go  she sank slowly beneath the water again and the others followed after her     chapter 11  zog the terrible and his sea devils   the sun must be going under a cloud said trot looking ahead  they had descended far into the ocean depths againfurther the girl thought than they had ever been before  no the queen answered after a glance ahead of them that is a cuttlefish and he is dyeing the sea around him with ink so that he can hide from us let us turn a little to the left for we could see nothing at all in that inky water  following her advice they made a broad curve to the left and at once the water began to darken in that direction  why theres another of em said capn bill as the little party came to a sudden halt  so there is returned the queen and trot thought there was a little quiver of anxiety in her voice we must go far to the right to escape the ink  so they again started this time almost at a right angle to their former course the little girl inquired  how can the cuttlefish color the water so very black  they carry big sacks in front of them where they conceal the ink princess clia answered whenever they choose the cuttlefish are able to press out this ink and it colors the water for a great space around them  the direction in which they were now swimming was taking them far out of their way aquareine did not wish to travel very far to the right so when she thought they had gone far enough to escape the inky water she turned to lead her party toward the leftthe direction in which she did wish to go at once another cloud of ink stained the water and drove them to the right again  is anything wrong maam asked capn bill seeing a frown gather upon the queens lovely face  i hope not she said but i must warn you that these cuttlefish are the servants of the terrible sea devils and from the way they are acting they seem determined to drive us toward the devil caves which i wished to avoid  this admission on the part of their powerful protector the fairy mermaid sent a chill to the hearts of the earth people neither spoke for a time but finally capn bill asked in a timid voice  hadnt we better go back maam  yes decided aquareine after a moments thought i think it will be wise to retreat the sea devils are evidently aware of our movements and wish to annoy us for my part i have no fear of them but i do not care to have you meet such creatures  but when they turned around to abandon their journey another inky cloud was to be seen behind them they really had no choice but to swim in the only streak of clear water they could find and the mermaids well knew this would lead them nearer and nearer to the caves of their enemies  but aquareine led the way moving very slowly and the others followed her in every other direction they were hemmed in by the black waters and they did not dare to halt because the inky fluid crept swiftly up behind them and drove them on  the queen and the princess had now become silent and grave they swam on either side of their guests as if to better protect them  dont look up whispered clia pressing close to the little girls side  why not asked trot and then she did exactly what she had been told not to do she lifted her head and saw stretched over them a network of scrawny crimson arms interlaced like the branches of trees in winter when the leaves have fallen and left them bare  capn bill gave a start and muttered land sakes for he too had gazed upward and seen the crimson network of limbs  are these the sea devils asked the child more curious than frightened  yes dear replied the queen but i advise you to pay no attention to them remember they cannot touch us  in order to avoid the threatening arms overhead which followed them as they swam our friends kept near to the bottom of the sea which was here thickly covered with rough and jagged rocks the inky water had now been left far behind but when trot looked over her shoulder she shuddered to find a great crimson monster following closely after them with a dozen long snaky feelers stretched out as if to grab anyone that lagged behind and there at the side of princess clia was another devil leering silently with his cruel bulging eyes at the pretty mermaid beside the queen swam still another of their enemies indeed the sea devils had crept upon them and surrounded them everywhere except at the front and trot began to feel nervous and worried for the first time  capn bill kept mumbling queer words under his breath for he had a way of talking to himself when anything upsot him as he would quaintly remark trot always knew he was disturbed or in trouble when he began to growl  the only way now open was straight ahead they swam slowly yet fast enough to keep a safe distance from the dreadful creature behind them  im afraid they are driving us into a trap whispered the queen softly but whatever happens do not lose courage earth friends clia and i are here to protect you and our fairy powers are sufficient to keep you from all harm  oh i dont mind so very much declared trot calmly its like the fairy adventures in storybooks and ive often thought id like that kind of adventures cause the story always turns out the right way  capn bill growled something just then but the only words trot could make out were never lived to tell the tale  oh pshaw capn she said we may be in danger right enough an to be honest i dont like the looks of these sea devils at all but im sure its no killing matter for weve got the fairy circles all around us  ha ha laughed the monster beside her we know all about the fairy circles dont we migg  ho ho laughed the monster on the other side we do slibb my boy and we dont think much of fairy circles either  they have foiled our enemies many a time declared the princess with much dignity  ha ha laughed one thats why were here now  ho ho laughed the other weve learned a trick or two and weve got you fast this time  then all the sea devilsthose above and the one behind and the two on the sideslaughed all together and their laughter was so horrible that it made even trot shudder  but now the queen stopped short and the others stopped with her  i will go no farther she said firmly not caring if the monsters overheard her it is evident that these monsters are trying to drive us into some secret place and it is well known that they are in league with zog the terrible whom they serve because they are as wicked as he is we must be somewhere near the hidden castle of zog so i prefer to stay here rather than be driven into some place far more dangerous as for the sea devils they are powerless to injure us in any way not one of those thousand arms about us can possibly touch our bodies  the only reply to this defiant speech was another burst of horrible laughter and now there suddenly appeared before them still another of the monsters which thus completely hemmed them in then the creatures began interlacing their long armsor feelersuntil they formed a perfect cage around the prisoners not an opening being left that was large enough for one of them to escape through  the mermaids and the girl and sailor man kept huddled close together for although they might be walled in by the sea devils their captors could not touch them because of the protecting magic circles  all at once trot exclaimed why we must be moving  this was startling news but by watching the flow of water past them they saw that the little girl was right the sea devils were swimming all together and as the cage they were in moved forward our friends were carried with it  queen aquareine had a stern look upon her beautiful face capn bill guessed from this look that the mermaid was angry for it seemed much like the look trots mother wore when they came home late to dinner but however angry the queen might be she was unable to help herself or her guests just now or to escape from the guidance of the dreaded sea devils the rest of the party had become sober and thoughtful and in dignified silence they awaited the outcome of this strange adventure     chapter 12  the enchanted island   all at once it grew dark around them neither capn bill nor trot liked this gloom for it made them nervous not to be able to see their enemies  we must be near a sea cavern if not within one whispered princess clia and even as she spoke the network of scarlet arms parted before them leaving an avenue for them to swim out of the cage there was brighter water ahead too so the queen said without hesitation  come along dear friends but let us clasp hands and keep close together  they obeyed her commands and swam swiftly out of their prison and into the clear water before them glad to put a distance between themselves and the loathesome sea devils the monsters made no attempt to follow them but they burst into a chorus of harsh laughter which warned our friends that they had not yet accomplished their escape  the four now found themselves in a broad rocky passage which was dimly lighted from some unknown source the walls overhead below them and at the sides all glistened as if made of silver and in places were set small statues of birds beasts and fishes occupying niches in the walls and seemingly made from the same glistening material  the queen swam more slowly now that the sea devils had been left behind and she looked exceedingly grave and thoughtful  have you ever been here before asked trot  no dear said the queen with a sigh  and do you know where we are continued the girl  i can guess replied aquareine there is only one place in all the sea where such a passage as that we are in could exist without my knowledge and that is in the hidden dominions of zog if we are indeed in the power of that fearful magician we must summon all our courage to resist him or we are lost  is zog more powerful than the mermaids asked trot anxiously  i do not know for we have never before met to measure our strength answered aquareine but if king anko could defeat the magician as he surely did then i think i shall be able to do so  i wish i was sure of it muttered capn bill  absolute silence reigned in the silver passage no fish were there not even a sea flower grew to relieve the stern grandeur of this vast corridor trot began to be impressed with the fact that she was a good way from her home and mother and she wondered if she would ever get back again to the white cottage on the cliff here she was at the bottom of the great ocean swimming through a big tunnel that had an enchanted castle at the end and a group of horrible sea devils at the other in spite of this thought she was not very much afraid although two fairy mermaids were her companions she relied strange to say more upon her tried and true friend capn bill than upon her newer acquaintances to see her safely out of her present trouble  capn bill himself did not feel very confident  i dont care two cents what becomes o me he told princess clia in a low voice but im dreaful worried over our trot shes too sweet an young to be made an end of in this ere fashion  clia smiled at this speech im sure you will find the little girls end a good way off she replied trust to our powerful queen and be sure she will find some means for us all to escape uninjured  the light grew brighter as they advanced until finally they perceived a magnificent archway just ahead of them aquareine hesitated a moment whether to go on or turn back but there was no escaping the sea devils behind them and she decided the best way out of their difficulties was to bravely face the unknown zog and rely upon her fairy powers to prevent his doing any mischief to herself or her friends so she led the way and together they approached the archway and passed through it  they now found themselves in a vast cavern so great in extent that the dome overhead looked like the sky when seen from earth in the center of this immense sea cavern rose the towers of a splendid castle all built of coral inlaid with silver and having windows of clear glass  surrounding the castle were beds of beautiful sea flowers many being in full bloom and these were laid out with great care in artistic designs goldfish and silverfish darted here and there among the foliage and the whole scene was so pretty and peaceful that trot began to doubt there was any danger lurking in such a lovely place  as they approached to look around them a brilliantly colored gregfish approached and gazed at them curiously with his big saucerlike eyes so zog has got you at last he said in a pitying tone how foolish you were to swim into that part of the sea where he is powerful  the sea devils made us explained clia  well im sorry for you im sure remarked the greg and with a flash of his tail he disappeared among the sea foliage  let us go to the castle said the queen in a determined voice we may as well boldly defy our fate as to wait until zog seeks us out  so they swam to the entrance of the castle the doors stood wide open and the interior seemed as well lighted as the cavern itself although none of them could discover from whence the light came  at each side of the entrance lay a fish such as they had never seen before it was flat as a doormat and seemed to cling fast to the coral floor upon its back were quills like those of a porcupine all pointed and sharp from the center of the fish arose a head shaped like a round ball with a circle of piercing beadlike eyes set in it these strange guardians of the entrance might be able to tell what their numerous eyes saw yet they remained silent and watchful even aquareine gazed upon them curiously and she gave a little shudder as she did so  inside the entrance was a domed hall with a flight of stairs leading to an upper balcony around the hall were several doorways hung with curtains made of woven seaweeds chairs and benches stood against the wall and these astonished the visitors because neither stairs nor chairs seemed useful in a kingdom where every living thing was supposed to swim and have a fishs tail in queen aquareines palaces benches for reclining were used and stairs were wholly unnecessary but in the palace of zog the furniture and fittings were much like those of a house upon earth and except that every space here was filled with water instead of air trot and capn bill might have imagined themselves in a handsome earthly castle  the little group paused half fearfully in the hall yet so far there was surely nothing to be afraid of they were wondering what to do next when the curtains of an archway were pushed aside and a boy entered to trots astonishment he had legs and walked upon them naturally and with perfect ease he was a delicate fraillooking little fellow dressed in a black velvet suit with knee breeches the bows at his throat and knees were of colored seaweeds woven into broad ribbons his hair was yellow and banged across his forehead his eyes were large and dark with a pleasant merry sparkle in them around his neck he wore a high ruff but in spite of this trot could see that below his plump cheeks were several scarletedged slits that looked like the gills of fishes for they gently opened and closed as the boy breathed in the water by which he was surrounded these gills did not greatly mar the lads delicate beauty and he spread out his arms and bowed low and gracefully in greeting  hello said trot  why id like to replied the boy with a laugh but being a mere slave it isnt proper for me to hello but its good to see earth people again and im glad youre here  were not glad observed the girl were afraid  youll get over that declared the boy smilingly people lose a lot of time being afraid once i was myself afraid but i found it was no fun so i gave it up  why were we brought here inquired queen aquareine gently  i cant say madam being a mere slave replied the boy but you have reminded me of my errand i am sent to inform you all that zog the forsaken who hates all the world and is hated by all the world commands your presence in his den  do you hate zog too asked trot  oh no answered the boy people lose a lot of time in hating others and theres no fun in it at all zog may be hateful but im not going to waste time hating him you may do so if you like  you are a queer child remarked the mermaid queen looking at him attentively will you tell us who you are  once i was prince sacho of sacharhineolaland which is a sweet country but hard to pronounce he answered but in this domain i have but one title and one name and that is slave  how came you to be zogs slave asked clia  the funniest adventure you ever heard of asserted the boy with eager pride i sailed in a ship that went to pieces in a storm all on board were drowned but me and i came mighty near it to tell the truth i went down deep deep into the sea and at the bottom was zog watching the people drown i tumbled on his head and he grabbed and saved me saying i would make a useful slave by his magic power he made me able to live under water as the fishes live and he brought me to this castle and taught me to wait upon him as his other slaves do  isnt it a dreadful lonely life asked trot  no indeed said sacho we havent any time to be lonely and the dreadful things zog does are very exciting and amusing i assure you he keeps us guessing every minute and that makes the life here interesting things were getting a bit slow an hour ago but now that you are here im in hopes we will all be kept busy and amused for some time  are there many others in the castle besides you and zog asked aquareine  dozens of us perhaps hundreds ive never counted them said the boy but zog is the only master all the rest of us are in the same class so there is no jealousy among the slaves  what is zog like capn bill questioned  at this the boy laughed and the laugh was full of mischief if i could tell you what zog is like it would take me a year was the reply but i cant tell you every one has a different idea of what hes like and soon you will see him yourselves  are you fond of him asked trot  if i said yes id get a good whipping declared sacho i am commanded to hate zog and being a good servant i try to obey if anyone dared to like zog i am sure hed be instantly fed to the turtles so i advise you not to like him  oh we wont promised trot  but were keeping the master waiting and that is also a dangerous thing to do continued the boy if we dont hurry up zog will begin to smile and when he smiles there is trouble brewing  the queen sighed lead the way sacho she said we will follow  the boy bowed again and going to an archway held aside the curtains for them they first swam into a small anteroom which led into a long corridor at the end of which was another curtained arch through this sacho also guided them and now they found themselves in a cleverly constructed maze every few feet were twists and turns and sharp corners and sometimes the passage would be wide and again so narrow that they could just squeeze through in single file seems like were gettin further into the trap growled capn bill we couldnt find our way out o here to save our lives  oh yes we could replied clia who was just behind him such a maze may indeed puzzle you but the queen or i could lead you safely through it again i assure you zog is not so clever as he thinks himself  the sailor however found the maze very bewildering and so did trot passages ran in every direction crossing and recrossing and it seemed wonderful that the boy sacho knew just which way to go but he never hesitated an instant trot looked carefully to see if there were any marks to guide him but every wall was of plain polished marble and every turning looked just like all the others suddenly sacho stopped short they were now in a broader passage but as they gathered around their conductor they found further advance blocked solid walls faced them and here the corridor seemed to end  enter said a clear voice  but we cant protested trot  swim straight ahead whispered the boy in soft tones there is no real barrier before you your eyes are merely deceived by magic  ah i understand said aquareine nodding her pretty head and then she took mayres hand and swam boldly forward while capn bill followed holding the hand of clia and behold the marble wall melted away before them and they found themselves in a chamber more splendid than even the fairy mermaids had ever seen before     chapter 13  prisoners of the sea monster   the room in the enchanted castle which zog called the den and in which the wicked sea monster passed most of his time was a perfectly shaped dome of solid gold the upper part of this dome was thickly set with precious jewelsdiamonds rubies sapphires and emeralds which sparkled beautifully through the crystal water the lower walls were as thickly studded with pearls all being of perfect shape and color many of the pearls were larger than any which may be found upon earth for the sea people knew where to find the very best and hide them away where men cannot discover them  the golden floor was engraved with designs of rare beauty depicting not only sea life but many adventures upon land in the room were several large golden cabinets the doors of which were closed and locked and in addition to the cabinets there were tables chairs and sofas the latter upholstered with softest sealskins handsome rugs of exquisitely woven seaweeds were scattered about the colors of which were artistically blended together in one corner a fountain of air bubbled up through the water the entire room was lighted as brilliantly as if exposed to the direct rays of the sun yet where this light came from our friends could not imagine no lamp or other similar device was visible anywhere  the strangers at first scarcely glanced at all these beautiful things for in an easy chair sat zog himself more wonderful than any other living creature and as they gazed upon him their eyes seemed fascinated as if held by a spell zogs face was the face of a man except that the tops of his ears were pointed like horns and he had small horns instead of eyebrows and a horn on the end of his chin in spite of these deformities the expression of the face was not unpleasant or repulsive his hair was carefully parted and brushed and his mouth and nose were not only perfect in shape but quite handsome  only the eyes betrayed zog and made him terrible to all beholders they seemed like coals of glowing fire and sparkled so fiercely that no one ever cared to meet their gaze for more than an instant perhaps the monster realized this for he usually drooped his long lashes over his fiery eyes to shut out their glare zog had two wellshaped legs which ended in the hoofs of beasts instead of feet and these hoofs were shod with gold his body was a shapeless mass covered with richly embroidered raiment over which a great robe of cloth of gold fell in many folds this robe was intended to hide the magicians body from view but trot noticed that the cloth moved constantly in little ripples as if what lay underneath would not keep still  the best features of which zog could boast were his arms and hands the latter being as well formed as delicate and white as those of a wellbred woman when he spoke his voice sounded sweet and clear and its tones were very gentle he had given them a few moments to stare at him for he was examining them in turn with considerable curiosity well said he do you not find me the most hateful creature you have ever beheld  the queen refrained from answering but trot said promptly we do nothing could be more horrider or more disgustin than you are it seems to me  very good very good indeed declared the monster lifting his lashes to flash his glowing eyes upon them then he turned toward capn bill manfish he continued what do you think of me  mighty little the sailor replied you orter be shamed to ask sech a question knowin you look worse ner the devil himself  very true answered zog frowning he felt that he had received a high compliment and the frown showed he was pleased with capn bill  but now queen aquareine advanced to a position in front of their captor and said tell me zog why have you trapped us and brought us here  to destroy you was the quick answer and the magician turned for an instant to flash his eyes upon the beautiful mermaid for two hundred years i have been awaiting a chance to get within my power some friend of anko the sea serpentof anko whom i hate he added smiling sweetly when you left your palace today my swift spies warned me and so i sent the sea devils to capture you often have they tried to do this before but always failed today acting by my command they tricked you and by surrounding you forced you to the entrance of my enchanted castle the result is a fine capture of important personages i have now in my power the queen and princess of the fairy mermaids as well as two wandering earth people and i assure you i shall take great pleasure in destroying you utterly  you are a coward declared the queen proudly you dared not meet us in the open sea  no i dare not leave this castle zog admitted still smiling but here in my own domain my power is supreme nothing can interfere with my vengeance  that remains to be seen said aquareine firmly meeting the gaze of the terrible eyes  of course he answered nodding his head with a graceful movement you will try to thwart me and escape you will pit your fairy power against my powers of magic that will give me great pleasure for the more you struggle the greater will be my revenge  but why should you seek revenge upon us asked clia we have never harmed you  that is true replied zog i bear you no personal ill will but you are friends of my great enemy king anko and it will annoy him very much when he finds that you have been destroyed by me i cannot hurt the rascally old sea serpent himself but through you i can make him feel my vengeance  the mermaids have existed thousands of years said the queen in a tone of pride do you imagine the despised and conquered zog has power to destroy them  i do not know was the quiet answer it will be interesting to discover which is the more powerful  i challenge you to begin the test at once vile magician exclaimed aquareine  there is no hurry fair queen answered zog in his softest tones i have been so many years in accomplishing your capture that it is foolish to act hastily now besides i am lonely here in my forced retirement i see only those uninteresting earth mortals whom i have made my slaves for all sea dwellers are forbidden to serve me save the sea devils and they dare not enter my castle i have saved many mortals from drowning and brought them here to people my castle but i do not love mortals two lovely mermaids are much more interesting and before i allow you to perish i shall have much amusement in witnessing your despair and your struggles to escape you are now my prisoners by slow degrees i shall wear out your fairy powers and break your hearts as well as the hearts of these earth dwellers who have no magic powers and i think it will be a long time before i finally permit you to die  thats all right said trot cheerfully the longer you take the better ill be satisfied  thats how i feel about it added capn bill dont get in a hurry to kill us zog itll be such a wear an tear on your nerves jes take it easy an let us live as long as we can  dont you care to die asked the magician  its a thing i never longed for the sailor replied you see we had no business to go on a trip with the mermaids to begin with ive allus heard tell that mermaids is dangerous an no one as met em ever lived to tell the tale eh trot  thats what you said capn bill  so i guess were done for one way r nother an it dont matter much which but trots a good child an mighty young an tender it dont seem like her time has come to die id like to have her sent safe home to her mother so ive got this ere proposition to make zog if your magic could make me die twice or even three times fer good measure why you go ahead an do it an i wont complain all i ask is fer you to send this little girl safe back to dry land again  dont you do it zog cried trot indignantly and turning to capn bill she added im not goin to leave you down here in all this mess capn and dont you think it if one of us gets out of the muddle were in well both get out so dont you make any bargains with zog to die twice  zog listened to this conversation very carefully the dying does not amount to much he said it is the thinking about it that hurts you mortals most ive watched many a shipwreck at sea and the people would howl and scream for hours before the ship broke up their terror was very enjoyable but when the end came they all drowned as peacefully as if they were going to sleep so it didnt amuse me at all  im not worrying said trot  ner me said capn bill youll find we can take what comes jes as easy as anybody  i do not expect to get much from you poor mortals said zog carelessly you are merely a side show to my circus a sort of dessert to my feast of vengeance when the time comes i can find a hundred ways to kill you my most interesting prisoners are these pretty mermaids who claim that none of their race has ever yet died or been destroyed the first mermaid ever created is living yet and i am told she is none other than queen aquareine so i have a pretty problem before me to invent some way to destroy the mermaids or put them out of existence and it will require some thought  also it will require some power you do not possess suggested the queen  that may be replied zog softly but i am going to experiment and i believe i shall be able to cause you a lot of pain and sorrow before i finally make an end of you i have not lived twentyseven thousand years aquareine without getting a certain amount of wisdom and i am more powerful than you suspect  you are a monster and a wicked magician said the mermaid queen  i am agreed zog but i cannot help it i was created part man part bird part fish part beast and part reptile and such a monstrosity could not be otherwise than wicked everybody hates me and i hate everybody  why dont you kill yourself asked trot  ive tried that and failed he answered only one being in the world has power to destroy me and that is king anko the sea serpent  then youd better let him do it advised the little girl  no much as i long to die i cannot allow king anko the pleasure of killing me he has always been my worst enemy and it would be such a joy to him to kill me that i really cannot allow him indeed i have always hoped to kill anko i have now been three thousand six hundred and fortytwo years eleven months and nine days figuring out a plan to destroy old anko and as yet i have not discovered a way  id give it up if i were you advised trot dont you think you could get some fun out of trying to be good  no cried zog and his voice was not so soft as before listen aquareine you and your attendants shall be prisoners in this castle until i can manage to stop you from living rooms will be placed at your disposal and i wish you to go to them at o nce as i am tired of looking at you  youre no more tired than we are remarked trot its lucky you cant see yourself zog  he turned his glowing eyes full upon her the worst of my queer body i keep concealed he said if ever you see it you will scream with terror he touched a bell beside him and the girl was surprised to find how clearly its tones rang out through the water in an instant the boy sacho appeared and bowed low before his dreadful master take the mermaids and the child to the rose chamber commanded zog and take the old manfish to the peony room  sacho turned to obey are the outer passages well guarded asked the monster  yes as you have commanded said the boy  then you may allow the prisoners to roam at will throughout the castle now go  the prisoners followed sacho from the room glad to get away the presence of this evil being had grown oppressive to them and zog had himself seemed ill at ease during the last few minutes the robe so closely wound around his body moved jerkily as if something beneath disturbed it and at such times zog shifted nervously in his seat  sachos thin little legs trotted through the water and led the way into a different passage from the one by which they had entered they swam slowly after him and breathed easier when they had left the golden domed chamber where their wicked enemy sat enthroned well how do you like him asked sacho with a laugh  we hate him declared trot emphatically  of course you do replied sacho but youre wasting time hating anything it doesnt do you any good or him any harm can you sing  a little said trot but i dont feel like singing now  youre wrong about that the boy asserted anything that keeps you from singing is foolishness unless its laughter laughter joy and song are the only good things in the world  trot did not answer this queer speech for just then they came to a flight of stairs and sacho climbed up them while the others swam and now they were in a lofty broad corridor having many doors hung with seaweed draperies at one of these doorways sacho stopped and said here is the rose chamber where the master commands you to live until you die you may wander anywhere in the castle as you please to leave it is impossible whenever you return to the rose chamber you will know it by this design of roses sewn in pearls upon the hangings the peony room where the manfish is to live is the next one farther on  thank you replied queen aquareine are we to be fed  meals will be served in your rooms if you desire anything ring the bell and some of the slaves will be sure to answer it i am mostly in attendance upon my master but whenever i am at liberty i will look after your comfort myself  again they thanked the strange boy and he turned and left them they could hear him whistle and sing as he returned along the passage then princess clia parted the curtains that her queen and companions might enter the rose chamber     chapter 14  capn joe and capn bill   the rooms zog had given his prisoners were as handsome as all other parts of this strange enchanted castle gold was used plentifully in the decorations and in the rose chamber occupied by the mermaids and trot golden roses formed a border around the entire room the sea maidens had evidently been expected for the magician had provided couches for them to recline upon similar to the ones used in the mermaid palaces the frames were of mother of pearl and the cushions of soft white sponges in the room were toilet tables mirrors ornaments and many articles used by earth people which they afterward learned had been plundered by zog from sunken ships and brought to his castle by his allies the sea devils  while the mermaids were examining and admiring their room capn bill went to the peony room to see what it was like and found his quarters were very cozy and interesting there were pictures on the wall portraits of gravelooking porpoises bashful seals and smug and smiling walruses some of the wall panels were formed of mirrors and reflected clearly the interior of the room around the ceiling was a frieze of imitation peonies in silver and the furniture was peonyshaped the broad leaves being bent to form seats and couches beside a pretty dressing table hung a bell cord with a tassel at the end capn bill did not know it was a bell cord so he pulled it to see what would happen and was puzzled to find that nothing seemed to happen at all the bell being too far away for him to hear it then he began looking at the treasures contained in this royal apartment and was much pleased with a golden statue of a mermaid that resembled princess clia in feature a silver flower vase upon a stand contained a bouquet of gorgeous peonies as natral as life said capn bill although he saw plainly that they must be made of metal  trot came in just then to see how her dear friend was located she entered from the doorway that connected the two rooms and said isnt it pretty capn and whod ever think that awful creature zog owned such a splendid castle and kept his prisoners in such lovely rooms  i once heard tell said the sailor of a foreign people that sacrificed humans to please their pagan gods an before they killed em outright they stuffed the victims full of good things to eat an dressed em in pretty clothes an treated em like princes thats why i dont take much comfort in our fine surroundins trot this zog is a pagan if ever there was one an he dont mean us any good you may depend on t  no replied trot soberly im sure he does not expect us to be happy here but im going to fool him and have just as good a time as i can as she spoke they both turned aroundan easy thing to do with a single flop of their flexible tailsand capn bill uttered a cry of surprise just across the room stood a perfect duplicate of himself the round head with its bald top and scraggly whiskers the sailor cap and shirt the wide pantaloons even the wooden leg each and every one were exact copies of those owned by capn bill even the expression in the lightblue eyes was the same and it is no wonder the old sailor stared at his double in amazement but the next minute he laughed and said why trot its me reflected in a mirror but at first i thought it was someone else  trot was staring too look capn she whispered look at the wooden leg  well its my wooden leg aint it he inquired  if it is it cant be a reflection in a mirror she argued for you havent got a wooden leg youve got a fishs tail  the old sailor was so startled by this truth that he gave a great flop with his tail that upset his balance and made him keel a somersault in the water before he got right side up again then he found the other sailor man laughing at him and was horrified to find the reflection advancing toward them by stumping along on its wooden leg keep away get out there yelled capn bill youre a ghost the ghost o me that once was an i cant bear the sight o you git out  did you ring jes to tell me to git out asked the other in a mild voice  ii didnt ring declared capn bill  you did you pulled that bell cord said the onelegged one or more lines missing here in this edition  oh did pullin that thing ring a bell inquired the capn a little ashamed of his ignorance and reassured by hearing the ghost talk  it surely did was the reply and sacho told me to answer your bell and look after you so im alookin after you  i wish you wouldnt protested capn bill ive no use ferfer ghostses anyhow  the strange sailor began to chuckle at hearing this and his chuckle was just like capn bills chuckle so full of merry humor that it usually made everyone laugh with him  who are you asked trot who was very curious and much surprised  im capn joe was the reply capn joe weedles formerly o the brig gladsome an now a slave o zog at the bottom o the sea  jjjoe weeweedles gasped capn bill amazed joe weedles o the gladsome why dash my eyes mate you must be my brother  are you bill weedles asked the other and then he added but no you cant be bill wasnt no mermaid he were a human critter like myself  thats what i am said capn bill hastily im a human critter too ive jes borrered this fish tail to swim with while im visitin the mermaids  well well said capn joe in astonishment whod o thought it an whod ever o thought as id find my longlost brother in zogs enchanted castle full fifty fathoms deep down in the wet wet water  why as fer that replied capn bill its you as is the longlost brother not me you an your ship disappeared many a year ago an aint never been heard of since while as you see im livin on earth yet  you dont look it to all appearances remarked capn joe in a reflective tone of voice but ill agree its many a year since i saw the top o the water an im not expectin to ever tramp on dry land again  are you dead or drownded or what asked capn bill  neither one nor tother was the answer but zog gave me gills sos i could live in the water like fishes do an if i got on land i couldnt breathe air any moren a fish out o water can so i guess as long as i live ill hev to stay down here  do you like it asked trot  oh i dont objec much said capn joe there aint much excitement here fer we dont catch a flock o mermaids evry day but the work is easy an the rations fair i might o been worse off you know for when my brig was wrecked id a gone to davy joness locker if zog hadnt happened to find me an made me a fish  you dont look as much like a fish as capn bill does observed trot  praps

legs asserted capn bill for when im on earth im fitted with one wooden leg jes the same as you are joe  oh i hadnt heard o that bill but im not surprised replied brother joe many a sailor gets to wear

life under water  whats the odds asked capn joe i never could keep away from the water since i was a boy an theres more dangers to be met floatin on it than there is soakin in it an one other thing

happier than i was when she kep scoldin me from mornin to night every minute i was home  is zog a kind master asked trot  i cant say hes kind replied capn joe for hes as near a devil as any livin critter can be he grumbles an growls in his soft voice all day an hates himself an everybody else but i dont see much of him theres so many of us slaves here that zog dont pay much attention to us an we have a pretty good time when the ol magician is shut up in his den as he mostly is  could you help us to escape asked the child  why i dont know how admitted capn joe theres magic all around us and we slaves are never allowed to leave this great cave ill do what i can o course but sacho is the boy to help you if anyone can that little chap knows a heap i can tell you so now if nothin mores wanted i must get back to work  what work do you do capn bill asked  i sew buttons on zogs clothes every time he gets mad he busts his buttons off an i have to sew em on again as hes mad most o the time it keeps me busy  ill see you again wont i joe said capn bill  no reason why you shouldnt if you manage to keep alive said capn joe but you mustnt forget bill this zog has his grip on you an ive never known anything to escape him yet  saying this the old sailor began to stump toward the door but tripped his foot against his wooden leg and gave a swift dive forward he would have fallen flat had he not grabbed the drapery at the doorway and saved himself by holding fast to it with both hands even then he rolled and twisted so awkwardly before he could get upon his legs that trot had to laugh outright at his antics this hickry leg said capn joe is so blamed light that it always wants to float aggagroo the goldworker has promised me a gold leg that will stay down but he never has time to make it youre mighty lucky bill to have a mermans tail instead o legs  i guess i am joe replied capn bill for in such a wet country the fishes have the best of it but i aint sure id like this sort o thing always  think o the money youd make in a side show said capn joe with his funny chuckling laugh then he pounded his wooden leg against the hard floor and managed to hobble from the room without more accidents  when he had gone trot said arent you glad to find your brother again capn bill  why soso replied the sailor i dont know much about joe seein as we havent met before for many a long year an all i remember about our boyhood days is that we fit an pulled hair most o the time but what worries me most is joes lookin so much like me myself wooden leg an all dont you think its rather cheeky an unbrotherly trot  perhaps he cant help it suggested the child and anyhow hell never be able to live on land again  no said capn bill with a sigh joes a fish now an so he aint likely to be took for me by one of our friends on the earth     chapter 15  the magic of the mermaids   when trot and capn bill entered the rose chamber they found the two mermaids reclining before an air fountain that was sending thousands of tiny bubbles up through the water  these fountains of air are excellent things remarked queen aquareine for they keep the water fresh and sweet and that is the more necessary when it is confined by walls as it is in this castle but now let us counsel together and decide what to do in the emergency that confronts us  how can we tell what to do without knowing whats going to happen asked trot  somethins sure to happen said capn bill  as if to prove his words a gong suddenly sounded at their door and in walked a fat little man clothed all in white including a white apron and white cap his face was round and jolly and he had a big mustache that curled up at the ends  well well said the little man spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his hips as he stood looking at them of all the queer things in the sea youre the queerest mermaids eh  dont bunch us that way protested capn bill  you are quite wrong said trot im aa girl  with a fishs tail he asked laughing at her  thats only just for a while she said while im in the water you know when im at home on the land i walk just as you do an so does capn bill  but we havent any gills remarked the capn looking closely at the little mans throat so i take it were not as fishy as some others  if you mean me i must admit you are right said the little man twisting his mustache im as near a fish as a man can be but you see capn without the gills that make me a fish i could not live under water  when it comes to that youve no business to live under water asserted the sailor but i spose youre a slave and cant help it  im chief cook for that old horror zog and that reminds me good mermaids or good people or good girls and sailors or whatever you are that im sent here to ask what youd like to eat  good to see you sir said capn bill im nearly starved myself  i had it in mind said the little man to prepare a regular mermaid dinner but since youre not mermaids  oh two of us are said the queen smiling i my good cook am aquareine the ruler of the mermaids and this is the princess clia  ive often heard of you your majesty returned the chief cook bowing respectfully and i must say ive heard only good of you now that you have unfortunately become my masters prisoners it will give me pleasure to serve you as well as i am able  we thank you good sir said aquareine  what have you got to eat inquired trot seems to me im hollow way down to my toesmy tail i meanand itll take a lot to fill me up we havent eaten a morsel since breakfast you know  i think i shall be able to give you almost anything you would like said the cook zog is a wonderful magician and can procure anything that exists with no more effort than a wiggle of his thumb but some eatables you know are hard to serve under water because they get so damp that they are soon ruined  ah it is different with the mermaids said princess clia  yes all your things are kept dry because they are surrounded by air ive heard how the mermaids live but here it is different  take this ring said the queen handing the chief cook a circlet which she drew from her finger while it is in your possession the food you prepare will not get wet or even moist  i thank your majesty returned the cook taking the ring my name is tom atto and ill do my best to please you how would you like for luncheon some oysters on the halfshell clam broth shrimp salad broiled turtle steak and watermelon  that will do very nicely answered the queen  do watermelons grow in the sea asked trot  of course that is why they are called watermelons replied tom atto i think i shall serve you a water ice in addition to the rest water ice is an appropriate sea food  have some watercress with the salad said capn bill  id thought of that declared the cook doesnt my bill of fare make your mouths water  hurry up and get it ready suggested trot  tom atto at once bowed and retired and when they were done capn bill said to the queen do you think maam we can manage to escape from zog and his castle  i hope we shall find a way replied aquareine the evil powers of magic which zog controls may not prove to be as strong as the fairy powers i possess but of course i cannot be positive until i discover what this wicked magician is able to do  princess clia was looking out of one of the windows i think i can see an opening far up in the top of the dome she said they all hastened to the windows to look and although trot and capn bill could see nothing but a solid dome above the castleperhaps because it was so far away from themthe sharp eyes of aquareine were not to be deceived  yes she announced there is surely an opening in the center of the great dome a little thought must convince us that such an opening is bound to exist for otherwise the water confined within the dome would not be fresh or clear  then if we could escape from this castle we could swim up to the hole in the dome and get free exclaimed trot  why zog has probably ordered the opening well guarded as he has all the other outlets responded the queen yet it may be worth while for us to make the attempt to get back into the broad ocean this way the night would be the best time when all are asleep and surely it will be quicker to reach the ocean through this hole in the roof than by means of the long winding passages by which we entered  but we will have to break out of the castle in some way observed capn bill  that will not be difficult answered aquareine it will be no trouble for me to shatter one of these panes of glass allowing us to pass out and swim straight up to the top of the dome  lets do it now said trot eagerly  no my dear we must wait for a good opportunity when we are not watched closely we do not wish the terrible zog to thwart our plan answered the queen gently  presently two sailor boys entered bearing trays of food which they placed upon a large table they were cheeryfaced young fellows with gills at their throats but had laughing eyes and trot was astonished not to find any of the slaves of zog weeping or miserable instead they were as jolly and goodnatured as could be and seemed to like their life under the water capn bill asked one of the boys how many slaves were in the castle and the youth replied that he would try to count them and let him know  tom atto had they found prepared for them an excellent meal and they ate heartily because they were really hungry after luncheon capn bill smoked his pipe contentedly and they renewed their conversation planning various ways to outwit zog and make their escape while thus engaged the gong at the door sounded and sacho entered  my diabolical master commands you to attend him said the boy  when asked aquareine  at once your majesty  very well we will follow you she said so they swam down the corridors following sacho until they again reached the goldendomed room they had formerly visited here sat zog just as they had left him seemingly but when his prisoners entered the magician arose and stood upon his cloven feet and then silently walked to a curtained archway  sacho commanded the prisoners to follow and beyond the archway they found a vast chamber that occupied the center of the castle and was as big as a ballroom zog who seemed to walk with much difficulty because his ungainly body swayed back and forth did not go far beyond the arched entrance a golden throne was set nearby and in this the monster seated himself at one side of the throne stood a group of slaves they were men women and children all had broad gold bands clasped around their ankles as a badge of servitude and at each throat were the fishs gills that enabled them to breathe and live under water yet every face was smiling and serene even in the presence of their dread master in parts of the big hall were groups of other slaves  sacho ranged the prisoners in a circle before zogs throne and slowly the magician turned his eyes glowing like live coals upon the four captives said he speaking in his clear sweet voice in our first interview you defied me and both the mermaid queen and the princess declared they could not die but if that is a true statement as i have yet to discover there are various ways to make you miserable and unhappy and this i propose to do in order to amuse myself at your expense you have been brought here to undergo the first trial of strength between us none of the prisoners replied to this speech so zog turned to one of his slaves and said rivivi bring in the yellmaker  rivivi was a big fellow brown of skin and with flashing black eyes he bowed to his master and left the room by an archway covered with heavy draperies the next moment these curtains were violently pushed aside and a dreadful sea creature swam into the hall it had a body much like that of a crab only more round and of a jetblack color its eyes were bright yellow balls set on the ends of two horns that stuck out of its head they were cruellooking eyes too and seemed able to see every person in the room at the same time the legs of the yellmaker however were the most curious part of the creature there were six of them slender and black as coal and each extended twelve to fifteen feet from its body when stretched out in a straight line they were hinged in several places so they could be folded up or extended at will at the ends of these thin legs were immense claws shaped like those of a lobster and they were real nippers of a most dangerous sort  the prisoners knew as soon as they saw the awful claws why the thing was called the yellmaker and trot gave a little shiver and crept closer to capn bill zog looked with approval upon the creature he had summoned and said to it i give you four victims the four people with fishs tails let me hear how loud they can yell  the yellmaker uttered a grunt of pleasure and in a flash stretched out one of its long legs toward the queens nose where its powerful claws came together with a loud noise aquareine did not stir she only smiled both zog and the creature that had attacked her seemed much surprised to find she was unhurt again cried zog and again the yellmakers claw shot out and tried to pinch the queens pretty ear but the magic of the fairy mermaid was proof against this searascals strength and swiftness nor could he touch any part of aquareine although he tried again and again roaring with anger like a mad bull  trot began to enjoy this performance and as her merry childish laughter rang out the yellmaker turned furiously upon the little girl two of the dreadful claws trying to nip her at the same time she had no chance to cry out or jump backward yet she remained unharmed for the fairy circle of queen aquareine kept her safe now capn bill was attacked and princess clia as well the halfdozen slender legs darted in every direction like sword thrusts to reach their victims and the cruel claws snapped so rapidly that the sound was like the rattling of castanets but the four prisoners regarded their enemy with smiling composure and no yell greeted the yellmakers efforts  enough said zog softly and sweetly you may retire my poor yellmaker for with these people you are powerless  the creature paused and rolled its yellow eyes may i nip just one of the slaves oh zog it asked pleadingly i hate to leave without pleasing your ears with a single yell  let my slaves alone was zogs answer they are here to serve me and must not be injured go feeble one  not so cried the queen it is a shame zog that such an evil thing should exist in our fair sea with this she drew her fairy wand from a fold of her gown and waved it toward the creature at once the yellmaker sank down unconscious upon the floor its legs fell apart in many pieces the claws tumbling in a heap beside the body then all grew withered and lost shape becoming a pulpy mass like gelatin a few moments later the creature had melted away to nothing at all forever disappearing from the ocean where it had caused so much horror and pain  zog watched this destruction with surprising patience when it was all over he nodded his head and smiled and trot noticed that whenever zog smiled his slaves lost their jolly looks and began to tremble that is very pretty magic aquareine said the monster i myself learned the trick several thousand years ago so it does not astonish me have you fairies nothing that is new to show me  we desire only to protect ourselves replied the queen with dignity  then i will give you a chance to do so said zog as he spoke the great marble blocks in the ceiling of the room directly over the heads of the captives gave way and came crashing down upon them many tons of weight were in these marble blocks and the magician had planned to crush his victims where they stood but the four were still unharmed the marble being unable to touch them was diverted from its course and when the roar of the great crash had died away zog saw his intended victims standing quietly in their places and smiling scornfully at his weak attempts to destroy them     chapter 16  the top of the great dome   capn bills heart was beating pretty vast but he did not let zog know that trot was so sure of the protection of the fairy mermaids that she would not allow herself to become frightened aquareine and clia were as calm as if nothing had happened  please excuse this little interruption said zog i knew very well the marble blocks would not hurt you but the play is over for a time you may now retire to your rooms and when i again invite you to my presence i shall have found some better ways to entertain you  without reply to this threat they turned and followed sacho from the hall and the boy led them straight back to their own rooms  zog is making a great mistake said sacho with a laugh he has no time for vengeance but the great magician does not know that  what is he trying to do anyway asked trot  he does not tell me all his secrets but ive an idea he wants to kill you replied sacho how absurd it is to be plotting such a thing when he might spend his time in laughing and being jolly isnt it now  zog is a wicked wicked creature exclaimed trot  but he had his good points replied sacho cheerfully there is no one about in the world so bad that there is nothing good about him  im not so sure of that said capn bill what are zogs good points  all his slaves were saved from drowning and he is kind to them said sacho  that is merely the kindness of selfishness said aquareine tell me my lad is the opening in the great dome outside guarded  yes indeed was the reply you cannot hope to escape in that way for the prince of the sea devils who is the largest and fiercest of his race lies crouched over the opening night and day and none can pass his network of curling legs  is there no avenue that is not guarded continued aquareine  none at all your majesty zog is always careful to be well guarded for he fears the approach of an enemy what this enemy can be to terrify the great magician i do not know but zog is always afraid and never leaves an entrance unguarded besides it is an enchanted castle you know and none in the ocean can see it unless zog wishes him to so it will be very hard for his enemy to find him  we wish to escape said clia will you help us sacho  in any way i can replied the boy  if we succeed we will take you with us continued the princess  but sacho shook his head and laughed i would indeed like to see you escape zogs vengeance said he for vengeance is wrong and you are too pretty and too good to be destroyed but i am happy here and have no wish to go away having no other home or friends other than my fellow slaves  then he left them and when they were again alone aquareine said we were able to escape zogs attacks today but i am quite sure he will plan more powerful ways to destroy us he has shown that he knows some clever magic and perhaps i shall not be able to foil it so it will be well for us to escape tonight if possible  can you fight and conquer the big sea devil up in the dome asked trot  the queen was thoughtful and did not reply to this question at once but capn bill said uneasily i cant abide them devil critters an i hopes for my part we wont be called on to tackle em you see trot were in considerble of a bad mess an if we ever live to tell the tale  why not capn asked the child were safe enough so far cant you trust our good friend the queen  she dont seem plumb sure o things herself remarked the sailor the mermaids is all right an friendly mate but this ere magic maker ol zog is a bad one out n out an means to kill us if he can  but he cant cried trot bravely  i hope youre right dear i wouldnt want to bet on zogs chances jes yet an at the same time it would be riskin money to bet on our chances seems to me its a case of luck which wins  dont worry friend said the queen i have a plan to save us let us wait patiently until nightfall they waited in the rose chamber a long time talking earnestly together but the brilliant light that flooded both the room and the great dome outside did not fade in the least after several hours had passed away the gong sounded and tom atto again appeared followed by four slaves bearing many golden dishes upon silver trays the friendly cook had prepared a fine dinner and they were all glad to find that whatever zog intended to do to them he had no intention of starving them perhaps the magician realized that aquareines fairy powers if put to the test would be able to provide food for her companions but whatever his object may have been their enemy had given them splendid rooms and plenty to eat  isnt it nearly nighttime asked the queen as tom atto spread the table with a cloth of woven seaweed and directed his men to place the dishes upon it  night he exclaimed as if surprised there is no night here  doesnt it ever get dark inquired trot  never we know nothing of the passage of time or of day or night the light always shines just as you see it now and we sleep whenever we are tired and rise again as soon as we are rested  what causes the light princess clia asked  its magic your highness said the cook solemnly its one of the curious things zog is able to do but you must remember all this place is a big cave in which the castle stands so the light is never seen by anyone except those who live here  but why does zog keep his light going all the time asked the queen  i suppose it is because he himself never sleeps replied tom atto they say the master hasnt slept for hundreds of years not since anko the sea serpent defeated him and drove him into this place  they asked no more questions and began to eat their dinner in silence before long capn joe came in to visit his brother and took a seat at the table with the prisoners he proved a jolly fellow and when he and capn bill talked about their boyhood days the stories were so funny that everybody laughed and for a time forgot their worries  when dinner was over however and capn joe had gone back to his work of sewing on buttons and the servants had carried away the dishes the prisoners remembered their troubles and the fate that awaited them i am much disappointed said the queen to find there is no night here and that zog never sleeps it will make our escape more difficult yet we must make the attempt and as we are tired and a great struggle is before us it will be best for us to sleep and refresh ourselves  they agreed to this for the day had been long and adventurous so capn bill kissed trot and went in to the peony room where he lay down upon his spongy couch and fell fast asleep the mermaids and trot followed this example and i think none of them was much worried after all because they quickly sank into peaceful slumber and forgot all the dangers that threatened them     chapter 17  the queens golden sword   goodness me exclaimed trot raising herself by a flirt of her pinkscaled tail and a wave of her fins isnt it dreadful hot here  the mermaids had risen at the same time and capn bill came swimming in from the peony room in time to hear the little girls speech  hot echoed the sailor why i feel like the inside of a steam engine  the perspiration was rolling down his round red face and he took out his handkerchief and carefully wiped it away waving his fish tail gently at the same time  what we need most in this room said he is a fan  whats the trouble do you spose inquired trot  it is another trick of the monster zog answered the queen calmly he has made the water in our rooms boiling hot and if it could touch us we would be well cooked by this time even as it is we are all made uncomfortable by breathing the heated air  what shall we do maam the sailor man asked with a groan i expected to get into hot water afore weve done with this foolishness but i dont like the feel o bein parboiled jes the same  the queen was waving her fairy wand and paid no attention to capn bills moans already the water felt cooler and they began to breathe more easily in a few moments more the heat had passed from the surrounding water altogether and all danger from this source was over  this is better said trot gratefully  do you care to sleep again asked the queen  no im wide awake now answered the child  im afraid if i goes to sleep agin ill wake up a pot roast said capn bill  let us consider ways to escape suggested clia it seems useless for us to remain here quietly until zog discovers a way to destroy us  but we must not blunder added aquareine cautiously to fail in our attempt would be to acknowledge zogs superior power so we must think well upon our plan before we begin to carry it out what do you advise sir she asked turning to capn bill  my opinion maam is that the only way for us to escape is to get out o here was the sailors vague answer how to do it is your business seein as i aint no fairy myself either in looks or in eddication  the queen smiled and said to trot what is your opinion my dear  i think we might swim out the same way we came in answered the child if we could get sacho to lead us back through the maze we would follow that long tunnel to the open ocean and  and there would be the sea devils waitin for us added capn bill with a shake of his bald head theyd drive us back inter the tunnel like they did the first time trot it wont do mate it wont do  have you a suggestion clia inquired the queen  i have thought of an undertaking replied the pretty princess but it is a bold plan your majesty and you may not care to risk it  let us hear it anyway said aquareine encouragingly  it is to destroy zog himself and put him out of the world forever then we would be free to go home whenever we pleased  can you suggest a way to destroy zog asked aquareine  no your majesty clia answered i must leave the way for you to determine  in the old days said the queen thoughtfully the mighty king anko could not destroy this monster he succeeded in defeating zog and drove him into this great cavern but even anko could not destroy him  i have heard the sea serpent explain that it was because he could not reach the magician returned clia if king anko could have seized zog in his coils he would have made an end of the wicked monster quickly zog knows this and that is why he does not venture forth from his retreat anko is the enemy he constantly dreads but with you my queen the case is different you may easily reach zog and the only question is whether your power is sufficient to destroy him  for a while aquareine remained silent i am not sure of my power over him she said at last and for that reason i hesitate to attack him personally his slaves and his allies the sea devils i can easily conquer so i prefer to find a way to overcome the guards at the entrances rather than to encounter their terrible master but even the guards have been given strength and power by the magician as we have already discovered so i must procure a weapon with which to fight them  a weapon maam said capn bill and then he took a jackknife from his coat pocket and opened the big blade afterward handing it to the queen that aint a bad weapon he announced  but it is useless in this case she replied smiling at the old sailors earnestness for my purpose i must have a golden sword  well theres plenty of gold around this castle said trot looking around her even in this room theres enough to make a hundred golden swords  but we cant melt or forge gold under water mate the capn said  why not dont you spose all these gold roses and things were made under water asked the little girl  like enough remarked the sailor but i dont see how  just then the gong at the door sounded and the boy sacho came in smiling and cheerful as ever he said zog had sent him to inquire after their health and happiness you may tell him that his water became a trifle too warm so we cooled it replied the queen then they told sacho how the boiling water had made them uncomfortable while they slept  sacho whistled a little tune and seemed thoughtful zog is foolish said he how often have i told him that vengeance is a waste of time he is worried to know how to destroy you and that is wasting more time you are worried for fear he will injure you and so you also are wasting time my my what a waste of time is going on in this castle  seems to me that we have so much time it doesnt matter said trot whats time for anyhow  time is given us to be happy and for no other reason replied the boy soberly when we waste time we waste happiness but there is no time for preaching so ill go  please wait a moment sacho said the queen  can i do anything to make you happy he asked smiling again  yes answered aquareine we are curious to know who does all this beautiful gold work and ornamentation  some of the slaves here are goldsmiths having been taught by zog to forge and work metal under water explained sacho in parts of the ocean lie many rocks filled with veins of pure gold and golden nuggets and we get large supplies from sunken ships as well there is no lack of gold here but it is not as precious as it is upon the earth because here we have no need of money  we would like to see the goldsmiths at work announced the queen  the boy hesitated a moment then he said i will take you to their room where you may watch them for a time i will not ask zogs permission to do this for he might refuse but my orders were to allow you the liberty of the castle and so i will let you see the goldsmiths shop  thank you replied aquareine quietly and then the four followed sacho along various corridors until they came to a large room where a dozen men were busily at work lying here and there were heaps of virgin gold some in its natural state and some already fashioned into ornaments and furniture of various sorts each man worked at a bench where there was a curious iron furnace in which glowed a vivid white light although this workshop was all under water and the workmen were all obliged to breathe as fishes do the furnaces glowed so hot that the water touching them was turned into steam gold or other metal held over a furnace quickly softened or melted when it could be forged or molded into any shape desired  the furnaces are electric explained sacho and heat as well under water as they would in the open air let me introduce you to the foreman who will tell you of his work better than i can  the foreman was a slave named aggagroo who was lean and lank and had an expression more surly and unhappy than any slave they had yet seen yet he seemed willing to leave his work and explain to the visitors how he made so many beautiful things out of gold for he took much pride in this labor and knew its artistic worth moreover since he had been in zogs castle these were the first strangers to enter his workshop so he welcomed them in his own gruff way  the queen asked him if he was happy and he shook his head and replied it isnt like calcutta where i used to work in gold before i was wrecked at sea and nearly drowned zog rescued me and brought me here a slave it is a stupid life we lead doing the same things over and over every day but perhaps it is better than being dead im not sure the only pleasure i get in life is in creating pretty things out of gold  could you forge me a golden sword asked the queen smiling sweetly upon the goldsmith  i could madam but i wont unless zog orders me to do it  do you like zog better than you do me inquired aquareine  no was the answer i hate zog  then wont you make the sword to please me and to show your skill pleaded the pretty mermaid  im afraid of my master he might not like it the man replied  but he will never know said princess clia  you cannot say what zog knows or what he doesnt know growled the man i cant take chances of offending zog for i must live with him always as a slave with this he turned away and resumed his work hammering the leaf of a golden ship  capn bill had listened carefully to this conversation and being a wise old sailor in his way he thought he understood the nature of old aggagroo better than the mermaids did so he went close to the goldsmith and feeling in the pockets of his coat drew out a silver compass shaped like a watch ill give you this if youll make the queen the golden sword he said  aggagroo looked at the compass with interest and tested its power of pointing north then he shook his head and handed it back to capn bill the sailor dived into his pocket again and pulled out a pair of scissors which he placed beside the compass on the palm of his big hand you may have them both he said  aggagroo hesitated for he wanted the scissors badly but finally he shook his head again capn bill added a piece of cord an iron thimble some fishhooks four buttons and a safety pin but still the goldsmith would not be tempted so with a sigh the sailor brought out his fine big jackknife and at sight of this aggagroos eyes began to sparkle steel was not to be had at the bottom of the sea although gold was so plentiful all right friend he said give me that lot of trinkets and ill make you a pretty gold sword but it wont be any good except to look at for our gold is so pure that it is very soft  never mind that replied capn bill all we want is the sword  the goldsmith set to work at once and so skillful was he that in a few minutes he had forged a fine sword of yellow gold with an ornamental handle the shape was graceful and the blade keen and slender it was evident to them all that the golden sword would not stand hard use for the edge of the blade would nick and curl like lead but the queen was delighted with the prize and took it eagerly in her hand  just then sacho returned to say that they must go back to their rooms and after thanking the goldsmith who was so busy examining his newly acquired treasure that he made no response they joyfully followed the boy back to the rose chamber sacho told them that he had just come from zog who was still wasting time in plotting vengeance you must be careful he advised them for my cruel master intends to stop you from living and he may succeed dont be unhappy but be careful zog is angry because you escaped his yellmaker and the falling stones and the hot water while he is angry he is wasting time but that will not help you take care not to waste any time yourselves  do you know what zog intends to do to us next asked princess clia  no said sacho but it is reasonable to guess that being evil he intends evil he never intends to do good i assure you then the boy went away  i am no longer afraid declared the mermaid queen when they were alone when i have bestowed certain fairy powers upon this golden sword it will fight its way against any who dare oppose us and even zog himself will not care to face so powerful a weapon i am now able to promise you that we shall make our escape  good cried trot joyfully shall we start now  not yet my dear it will take me a little while to charm this golden blade so that it will obey my commands and do my work there is no need of undue haste so i propose we all sleep for a time and obtain what rest we can we must be fresh and ready for our great adventure  as their former nap had been interrupted they readily agreed to aquareines proposal and at once went to their couches and composed themselves to slumber when they were asleep the fairy mermaid charmed her golden sword and then she also lay down to rest herself     chapter 18  a dash for liberty   trot dreamed that she was at home in her own bed but the night seemed chilly and she wanted to draw the coverlet up to her chin she was not wide awake but realized that she was cold and unable to move her arms to cover herself up she tried but could not stir then she roused herself a little more and tried again yes it was cold very cold really she must do something to get warm she thought she opened her eyes and stared at a great wall of ice in front of her  she was awake now and frightened too but she could not move because the ice was all around her she was frozen inside of it and the air space around her was not big enough to allow her to turn over  at once the little girl realized what had happened their wicked enemy zog had by his magic art frozen all the water in their room while they slept and now they were all imprisoned and helpless trot and capn bill were sure to freeze to death in a short time for only a tiny air space remained between their bodies and the ice and this air was like that of a winter day when the thermometer is below zero  across the room trot could see the mermaid queen lying on her couch for the solid ice was clear as crystal aquareine was imprisoned just as trot was and although she held her fairy wand in one hand and the golden sword in the other she seemed unable to move either of them and the girl remembered that the queen always waved her magic wand to accomplish anything princess clias couch was behind that of trot so the child could not see her and capn bill was in his own room probably frozen fast in the ice as the others were  the terrible zog has surely been very clever in this last attempt to destroy them trot thought it all over and she decided that inasmuch as the queen was unable to wave her fairy wand she could do nothing to release herself or her friends  but in this the girl was mistaken the fairy mermaid was even now at work trying to save them and in a few minutes trot was astonished and delighted to see the queen rise from her couch she could not go far from it at first but the ice was melting rapidly all around her so that gradually aquareine approached the place where the child lay trot could hear the mermaids voice sounding through the ice as if from afar off but it grew more distinct until she could make out that the queen was saying courage friends do not despair for soon you will be free  before very long the ice between trot and the queen had melted away entirely and with a cry of joy the little girl flopped her pink tail and swam to the side of her deliverer  are you very cold asked aquareine  nnot vvvery replied trot but her teeth chattered and she was still shivering  the water will be warm in a few minutes said the queen but now i must melt the rest of the ice and liberate clia  this she did in an astonishingly brief time and the pretty princess being herself a fairy had not been at all affected by the cold surrounding her  they now swam to the door of capn bills room and found the peony chamber a solid block of ice the queen worked her magic power as hard as she could and the ice flowed and melted quickly before her fairy wand yet when they reached the old sailor he was almost frozen stiff and trot and clia had to rub his hands and nose and ears very briskly to warm him up and bring him back to life  capn bill was pretty tough and he came around in time and opened his eyes and sneezed and asked if the blizzard was over so the queen waved her wand over his head a few times to restore him to his natural condition of warmth and soon the old sailor became quite comfortable and was able to understand all about the strange adventure from which he had so marvelously escaped  ive made up my mind to one thing trot he said confidentially if ever i get out o this mess im in i wont be an arctic explorer whatever else happens shivers an shakes aint to my likin an this ice business aint what its sometimes cracked up to be to be friz once is enough fer anybody an if i was a gal like you i wouldnt even wear frizzes on my hair  you havent any hair capn bill answered trot so you neednt worry  the queen and clia had been talking together very earnestly they now approached their earth friends and aquareine said  we have decided not to remain in this castle any longer zogs cruel designs upon our lives and happiness are becoming too dangerous for us to endure the golden sword now bears a fairy charm and by its aid i will cut a way through our enemies are you ready and willing to follow me  of course we are cried trot  it dont seem zactly right to ask a lady to do the fightin remarked capn bill but magic aint my strong pint and it seems to be yours maam so swim ahead and well wiggle the same way you do an try to wiggle out of our troubles  if i chance to fail said the queen try not to blame me i will do all in my power to provide for our escape and i am willing to risk everything because i well know that to remain here will mean to perish in the end  thats all right said trot with fine courage lets have it over with  then we will leave here at once said aquareine  she approached the window of the room and with one blow of her golden sword shattered the thick pane of glass the opening thus made was large enough for them to swim through if they were careful not to scrape against the broken points of glass the queen went first followed by trot and capn bill with clia last of all  and now they were in the vast dome in which the castle and gardens of zog had been built around them was a clear stretch of water and far abovefull half a mile distantwas the opening in the roof guarded by the prince of the sea devils the mermaid queen had determined to attack this monster if she succeeded in destroying it with her golden sword the little band of fugitives might then swim through the opening into the clear waters of the ocean although this prince of the sea devils was said to be big and wise and mighty there was but one of him to fight whereas if they attempted to escape through any of the passages they must encounter scores of such enemies  swim straight for the opening in the dome cried aquareine and in answer to the command the four whisked their glittering tails waved their fins and shot away through the water at full speed their course slanting upward toward the top of the dome     chapter 19  king anko to the rescue   the great magician zog never slept he was always watchful and alert some strange power warned him that his prisoners were about to escape  scarcely had the four left the castle by the broken window when the monster stepped from a doorway below and saw them instantly he blew upon a golden whistle and at the summons a band of wolffish appeared and dashed after the prisoners these creatures swam so swiftly that soon they were between the fugitives and the dome and then they turned and with wicked eyes and sharp fangs began a fierce attack upon the mermaids and the earth dwellers  trot was a little frightened at the evil looks of the sea wolves whose heads were enormous and whose jaws contained rows of curved and pointed teeth but aquareine advanced upon them with her golden sword and every touch of the charmed weapon instantly killed an enemy so that one by one the wolffish rolled over upon their backs and sank helplessly downward through the water leaving the prisoners free to continue their way toward the opening in the dome  zog witnessed the destruction of his wolves and uttered a loud laugh that was terrible to hear then the dread monster determined to arrest the fugitives himself and in order to do this he was forced to discover himself in all the horror of his awful form a form he was so ashamed of and loathed so greatly that he always strove to keep it concealed even from his own view but it was important that his prisoners should not escape hastily casting off the folds of the robe that enveloped him zog allowed his body to uncoil and shoot upward through the water in swift pursuit of his victims his cloven hoofs upon which he usually walked being now useless were drawn up under him while coil after coil of his eellike body wriggled away like a serpent at his shoulders two broad feathery wings expanded and these enabled the monster to cleave his way through the water with terrific force  zog was part man part beast part fish part fowl and part reptile his undulating body was broad and thin and like the body of an eel it was as repulsive as one could well imagine and no wonder zog hated it and kept it covered with his robe now with his horned head and its glowing eyes thrust forward wings flapping from his shoulders and his eely bodyending in a fishs tailwriggling far behind him this strange and evil creature was a thing of terror even to the sea dwellers who were accustomed to remarkable sights  the mermaids the sailor and the child one after another looking back as they swam toward liberty and safety saw the monster coming and shuddered with uncontrollable fear they were drawing nearer to the dome by this time yet it was still some distance away the four redoubled their speed darting through the water with the swiftness of skyrockets but fast as they swam zog swam faster and the good queens heart began to throb as she realized she would be forced to fight her loathesome foe  presently zogs long body was circling around them like a whirlwind lashing the water into foam and gradually drawing nearer and nearer to his victims his eyes were no longer glowing coals they were balls of flame and as he circled around them he laughed aloud that horrible laugh which was far more terrifying than any cry of rage could be the queen struck out with her golden sword but zog wrapped a coil of his thin body around it and wrestling it from her hand crushed the weapon into a shapeless mass then aquareine waved her fairy wand but in a flash the monster sent it flying away through the water  capn bill now decided that they were lost he drew trot closer to his side and placed one arm around her i cant save you dear little mate he said sadly but weve lived a long time together an now well die together i knew trot when first we sawr them mermaids as wedwed  never live to tell the tale said the child but never mind capn bill weve done the best we could and weve had a fine time  forgive me oh forgive me cried aquareine despairingly i tried to save you my poor friends but  whats that exclaimed the princess pointing upward they all looked past zogs whirling body which was slowly enveloping them in its folds toward the round opening in the dome a dark object had appeared there sliding downward like a huge rope and descending toward them with lightning rapidly they gave a great gasp as they recognized the countenance of king anko the sea serpent its gray hair and whiskers bristling like those of an angry cat and the usually mild blue eyes glowing with a ferocity even more terrifying than the orbs of zog  the magician gave a shrill scream at sight of his dreaded enemy and abandoning his intended victims zog made a quick dash to escape but nothing in the sea could equal the strength and quickness of king anko when he was roused in a flash the sea serpent had caught zog fast in his coils and his mighty body swept round the monster and imprisoned him tightly the four so suddenly rescued swam away to a safer distance from the struggle and then they turned to watch the encounter between the two great opposing powers of the oceans depths yet there was no desperate fight to observe for the combatants were unequal the end came before they were aware of it zog had been taken by surprise and his great fear of anko destroyed all of his magic power when the sea serpent slowly released those awful coils a mass of jellylike pulp floated downward through the water with no remnant of life remaining in it no form to show it had once been zog the magician  then anko shook his body that the water might cleanse it and advanced his head toward the group of four whom he had so opportunely rescued it is all over friends said he in his gentle tones while a mild expression once more reigned on his comical features you may go home at any time you please for the way through the dome will be open as soon as i get my own body through it  indeed so amazing was the length of the great sea serpent that only a part of him had descended through the hole into the dome without waiting for the thanks of those he had rescued he swiftly retreated to the ocean above and with grateful hearts they followed him glad to leave the cavern where they had endured so much anxiety and danger     chapter 20  the home of the ocean monarch   trot sobbed quietly with her head on capn bills shoulder she had been a brave little girl during the trying times they had experienced and never once had she given way to tears however desperate their fate had seemed to be but now that the one enemy in all the sea to be dreaded was utterly destroyed and all dangers were past the reaction was so great that she could not help having just one good cry as she naively expressed it  capn bill was a big sailor man hardened by age and many adventures but even he felt a lump in his throat that he could not swallow try as hard as he might capn bill was glad he was mostly glad on trots account for he loved his sweet childish companion very dearly and did not want any harm to befall her  they were now in the wide open sea with liberty to go wherever they wished and if capn bill could have had his way he would have gone straight home and carried trot to her mother but the mermaids must be considered aquareine and clia had been true and faithful friends to their earth guests while dangers were threatening and it would not be very gracious to leave them at once moreover king anko was now with them his big head keeping pace with the mermaids as they swam and this mighty preserver had a distinct claim upon trot and capn bill the sailor felt that it would not be polite to ask to go home so soon  if you people had come to visit me as i invited you to do said the sea serpent all this bother and trouble would have been saved i had my palace put in order to receive the earth dwellers and sat in my den waiting patiently to receive you yet you never came at all  that reminds me said trot drying her eyes you never told us about that third pain you once had  finally continued anko i sent to inquire as to what had become of you and merla said you had been gone from the palace a long time and she was getting anxious about you then i made inquiries everyone in the sea loves to serve meexcept those sea devils and their cousins the octopiand it wasnt long before i heard you had been captured by zog  was the third pain as bad as the other two asked trot  naturally this news disturbed me and made me unhappy said anko for i well knew my aquareine that the magicians evil powers were greater than your own fairy accomplishments but i had never been able to find zogs enchanted castle and so i was at a loss to know how to save you from your dreadful fate after i had wasted a good deal of time thinking it over i decided that if the sea devils were slaves of zog the prince of the sea devils must know where the enchanted castle was located  i knew this prince and where to find him for he always lay on a hollow rock on the bottom of the sea and never moved from that position his people brought food to him and took his commands so i had no trouble in finding this evil prince and i went to him and asked the way to zogs castle of course he would not tell me he was even cross and disrespectful just as i had expected him to be so i allowed myself to become angry and killed him thinking he was much better dead than alive but after the sea devil was destroyed what was my surprise to find that all these years he had been lying over a round hole in the rock and covering it with his scarlet body  a light shone through this hole so i thrust my head in and found a great domed cave underneath with a splendid silver castle built at the bottom you my friends were at that moment swimming toward me as fast as you could come and the monster zog my enemy for centuries past was close behind you well the rest of the story you know i would be angry with all of you for so carelessly getting captured had the incident not led to the destruction of the one evil genius in all my ocean i shall rest easier and be much happier now that zog is dead he has defied me for hundreds of years  but about that third pain said trot if you dont tell us now im afraid that ill forget to ask you  if you should happen to forget just remind me of it said anko and ill be sure to tell you  while trot was thinking this over the swimmers drew near to a great circular palace made all of solid alabaster polished as smooth as ivory its roof was a vast dome for domes seemed to be fashionable in the ocean houses there were no doors or windows but instead of these several round holes appeared in different parts of the dome some being high up and some low down and some in between out of one of these holes which it just fitted stretched the long brown body of the sea serpent trot being astonished at this sight asked didnt you take all of you when you went to the cavern anko  nearly all my dear was the reply accompanied by a cheerful smile for anko was proud of his great length but not quite all some of me remained as usual to keep house while my head was away but ive been coiling up ever since we started back and you will soon be able to see every inch of me all together  even as he spoke his head slid into the round hole and at a signal from aquareine they all paused outside and waited presently there came to them four beautiful winged fishes with faces like doll babies their long hair and eyelashes were of a purple color and their cheeks had rosy spots that looked as if they had been painted upon them his majesty bids you welcome said one of the doll fishes in a sweet voice be kind enough to enter the royal palace and our ocean monarch will graciously receive you  seems to me said trot to the queen these things are putting on airs perhaps they dont know were friends of anko  the king insists on certain formalities when anyone visits him was aquareines reply it is right that his dignity should be maintained  they followed their winged conductors to one of the upper openings and as they entered it aquareine said in a clear voice may the glory and power of the ocean king continue forever then she touched the palm of her hand to her forehead in token of allegiance and clia did the same so capn bill and trot followed suit the brief ceremony being ended the child looked curiously around to see what the palace of the mighty anko was like  an extensive hall lined with alabaster was before them in the floor were five of the round holes upon the walls were engraved many interesting scenes of ocean life all chiseled very artistically by the tusks of walruses who trot was afterward informed are greatly skilled in such work a few handsome rugs of woven sea grasses were spread upon the floor but otherwise the vast hall was bare of furniture the dollfaced fishes escorted them to an upper room where a table was set and here the revelers were invited to refresh themselves as all four were exceedingly hungry they welcomed the repast which was served by an army of lobsters in royal purple aprons and caps  the meal being finished they again descended to the hall which seemed to occupy all the middle of the building and now their conductors said his majesty is ready to receive you in his den  they swam downward through one of the round holes in the floor and found themselves in a brilliantly lighted chamber which appeared bigger than all the rest of the palace put together in the center was the quaint head of king anko and around it was spread a great coverlet of purple and gold woven together this concealed all of his body and stretched from wall to wall of the circular room welcome friends said anko pleasantly how do you like my home  its very grand replied trot  just the place for a sea serpent seems to me said capn bill  im glad you admire it said the king perhaps i ought to tell you that from this day you four belong to me  hows that asked the girl surprised  it is a law of the ocean declared anko that whoever saves any living creature from violent death owns that creature forever afterward while life lasts you will realize how just this law is when you remember that had i not saved you from zog you would now be dead the law was suggested by captain kid glove when he once visited me  do you mean captain kidd asked trot because if you do  give him his full name said anko captain kid glove was  theres no glove to it protested trot i ought to know cause ive read about him  didnt it say anything about a glove asked anko  nothing at all it jus called him capn kidd replied trot  shes right ol man added capn bill  books said the sea serpent are good enough as far as they go but it seems to me your earth books dont go far enough captain kid glove was a gentleman pirate a kidglove pirate to leave off the glove and call him just kidd is very disrespectful  oh you told me to remind you of that third pain said the little girl  which proves my friendship for you returned the sea serpent blinking his blue eyes thoughtfully no one likes to be reminded of a pain and that third pain waswas  what was it asked trot  it was a stomach ache replied the king with a sigh  what made it she inquired  just my carelessness said anko id been away to foreign parts seeing how the earth people were getting along i found the germans dancing the german and the dutch making dutch cheese and the belgians combing their belgian hares and the turks eating turkey and the sardinians sardonically pickling sardines then i called on the prince of whales and  you mean the prince of wales corrected trot  i mean what i say my dear i saw the battlefield where the bull run but the americans didnt and when i got to france i paid a napoleon to see napoleon with his boney apart he was  of course you mean trot was beginning but the king would not give her a chance to correct him this time  he was very hungry for hungary he continued and was russian so fast toward the poles that i thought hed discover them so as i was not accorded a royal welcome i took french leave and came home again  but the pain  on the way home continued anko calmly i was a little absentminded and ate an anchor there was a long chain attached to it and as i continued to swallow the anchor i continued to eat the chain i never realized what i had done until i found a ship on the other end of the chain then i bit it off  the ship asked trot  no the chain i didnt care for the ship as i saw it contained some skippers on the way home the chain and anchor began to lie heavily on my stomach i didnt seem to digest them properly and by the time i got to my palace where you will notice there is no throne i was thrown into throes of severe pain so i at once sent for dr shark  are all your doctors sharks asked the child  yes arent your doctors sharks he replied  not all of them said trot  that is true remarked capn bill but when you talk of lawyers  im not talking of lawyers said anko reprovingly im talking about my pain i dont imagine anyone could suffer more than i did with that stomach ache  did you suffer long inquired trot  why about seven thousand four hundred and eightytwo feet and  i mean a long time  it seemed like a long time answered the king dr shark said i ought to put a mustard poultice on my stomach so i uncoiled myself and summoned my servants and they began putting on the mustard plaster it had to be bound all around me so it wouldnt slip off and i began to look like an express package in about four weeks fully onehalf of the pain had been covered by the mustard poultice which got so hot that it hurt me worse than the stomach ache did  i know said trot i had one once  one what asked anko  a mustard plaster they smart pretty bad but i guess theyre a good thing  i got myself unwrapped as soon as i could continued the king and then i hunted for the doctor who hid himself until my anger had subsided he has never sent in a bill so i think he must be terribly ashamed of himself  youre lucky sir to have escaped so easy said capn bill but you seem pretty well now  yes im more careful of what i eat replied the sea serpent but i was saying when trot interrupted me that you all belong to me because i have saved your lives by the law of the ocean you must obey me in everything  the sailor scowled a little at hearing this but trot laughed and said the law of the ocean isnt our law cause we live on land  just now you are living in the ocean declared anko and as long as you live here you must obey my commands  what are your commands inquired the child  ah thats the point i was coming to returned the king with his comical smile the ocean is a beautiful place and we who belong here love it dearly in many ways its a nicer place for a home than the earth for we have no sunstroke mosquitoes earthquakes or candy ships to bother us but i am convinced that the ocean is no proper dwelling place for earth people and i believe the mermaids did an unwise thing when they invited you to visit them  i dont protested the girl weve had a fine time havent we capn bill  well its been diffrent from what i expected admitted the sailor  our only thought was to give the earth people pleasure your majesty pleaded aquareine  i know i know my dear queen and it was very good of you replied anko but still it was an unwise act for earth people are as constantly in danger under water as we would be upon the land so having won the right to command you all i order you to take little mayre and capn bill straight home and there restore them to their natural forms its a dreadful condition i know and they must each have two stumbling legs instead of a strong beautiful fish tail but it is the fate of earth dwellers and they cannot escape it  in my case your majesty make it one leg suggested capn bill  ah yes i remember one leg and a wooden stick to keep it company i issue this order dear friends not because i am not fond of your society but to keep you from getting into more trouble in a country where all is strange and unnatural to you am i right or do you think i am wrong  youre quite correct sir said capn bill nodding his head in approval  well im ready to go home said trot but in spite of zog ive enjoyed my visit and i shall always love the mermaids for being so good to me that speech pleased aquareine and clia who smiled upon the child and kissed her affectionately  we shall escort you home at once announced the queen  but before you go said king anko i will give you a rare treat it is one you will remember as long as you live you shall see every inch of the mightiest sea serpent in the world all at one time  as he spoke the purple and gold cloth was lifted by unseen hands and disappeared from view and now capn bill and trot looked down upon thousands and thousands of coils of the sea serpents body which filled all of the space at the bottom of the immense circular room it reminded them of a great coil of garden hose only it was so much bigger around and very much longer  except for the astonishing size of the ocean king the sight was not an especially interesting one but they told old anko that they were pleased to see him because it was evident he was very fond of his figure then the cloth descended again and covered all but the head after which they bade the king goodbye and thanked him for all his kindness to them  i used to think sea serpents were horrid creatures said trot but now i know they are good andandand  and big added capn bill realizing his little friend could not find another word that was complimentary     chapter 21  king joe   as they swam out of ankos palace and the dollfaced fishes left them aquareine asked  would you rather go back to our mermaid home for a time and rest yourselves or would you prefer to start for giants cave at once  i guess wed better go back home decided trot to our own home i mean weve been away quite a while and king anko seemed to think it was best  very well replied the queen let us turn in this direction then  you can say goodbye to merla for us continued trot she was very nice to us an specially to capn bill  so she was mate agreed the sailor an a prettier lady i never knew even if she is a mermaid beggin your pardon maam  are we going anywhere near zogs castle asked the girl  our way leads directly past the opening in the dome said aquareine  then lets stop and see what sacho and the others are doing suggested trot they cant be slaves any longer you know cause they havent any master i wonder if theyre any happier than they were before  they seemed to be pretty happy as it was remarked capn bill  it will do no harm to pay them a brief visit said princess clia all danger disappeared from the cavern with the destruction of zog  i really ought to say goodbye to brother joe observed the sailor man i wont see him again you know and i dont want to seem unbrotherly  very well said the queen we will reenter the cavern for i too am anxious to know what will be the fate of the poor slaves of the magician  when they came to the hole in the top of the dome they dropped through it and swam leisurely down toward the castle the water was clear and undisturbed and the silver castle looked very quiet and peaceful under the radiant light that still filled the cavern they met no one at all and passing around to the front of the building they reached the broad entrance and passed into the golden hall  here a strange scene met their eyes all the slaves of zog hundreds in number were assembled in the room while standing before the throne formerly occupied by the wicked magician was the boy sacho who was just beginning to make a speech to his fellow slaves at one time or another he said all of us were born upon the earth and lived in the thin air but now we are all living as the fishes live and our home is in the water of the ocean one by one we have come to this place having been saved from drowning by zog the magician and by him given power to exist in comfort under water the powerful master who made us his slaves has now passed away forever but we continue to live and are unable to return to our native land where we would quickly perish there is no one but us to inherit zogs possessions and so it will be best for us to remain in this fine castle and occupy ourselves as we have done before in providing for the comforts of the community only in labor is happiness to be found and we may as well labor for ourselves as for others  but we must have a king not an evil cruel master like zog but one who will maintain order and issue laws for the benefit of all we will govern ourselves most happily by having a ruler or head selected from among ourselves by popular vote therefore i ask you to decide who shall be our king for only one who is accepted by all can sit in zogs throne  the slaves applauded this speech but they seemed puzzled to make the choice of a ruler finally the chief cook came forward and said we all have our duties to perform and so cannot spend the time to be king but you sacho who were zogs own attendant have now no duties at all so it will be best for you to rule us what say you comrades shall we make sacho king  yes yes they all cried  but i do not wish to be king replied sacho a king is a useless sort of person who merely issues orders for others to carry out i want to be busy and useful whoever is king will need a good attendant as well as an officer who will see that his commands are obeyed i am used to such duties having served zog in this same way  who then has the time to rule over us asked aggagroo the goldsmith  it seems to me that capn joe is the proper person for king replied sacho his former duty was to sew buttons on zogs garments so now he is out of a job and has plenty of time to be king for he can sew on his own buttons what do you say capn joe  oh i dont mind agreed capn joe that is if you all want me to rule you  we do shouted the slaves glad to find someone willing to take the job  but ill want a few pointers continued capn bills brother i aint used to this sort o work you know an if i aint properly posted im liable to make mistakes  sacho will tell you said tom atto encouragingly and now i must go back to the kitchen and look after my dumplings or you people wont have any dinner today  very well announced sacho i hereby proclaim capn joe elected king of the castle which is the enchanted castle no longer you may all return to your work  the slaves went away well contented and the boy and capn joe now came forward to greet their visitors were on our way home explained capn bill an we dont expec to travel this way again but it pleases me to know joe that youre the king o such a fine castle an ill rest easier now that youre well pervided for  oh im all right bill returned capn joe its an easy life here an a peaceful one i wish you were as well fixed  if ever you need friends sacho or any assistance or counsel come to me said the mermaid queen to the boy  thank you madam he replied now that zog has gone i am sure we shall be very safe and contented but i shall not forget to come to you if we need you we are not going to waste any time in anger or revenge or evil deeds so i believe we shall prosper from now on  im sure you will declared trot  they now decided that they must continue their journey and as neither sacho nor king joe could ascend to the top of the dome without swimming in the human way which was slow and tedious work for them the goodbyes were said at the castle entrance and the four visitors started on their return trot took one last view of the beautiful silver castle from the hole high up in the dome which was now open and unguarded and the next moment she was in the broad ocean again swimming toward home beside her mermaid friends     chapter 22  trot lives to tell the tale   aquareine was thoughtful for a time then she drew from her finger a ring a plain gold band set with a pearl of great value and gave it to the little girl  if at any period of your life the mermaids can be of service to you my dear she said you have but to come to the edge of the ocean and call aquareine if you are wearing the ring at the time i shall instantly hear you and come to your assistance  thank you cried the child slipping the ring over her own chubby finger which it fitted perfectly i shall never forget that i have good and loyal friends in the ocean you may be sure  away and away they swam swiftly and in a straight line keeping in the middle water where they were not liable to meet many sea people they passed a few schools of fishes where the teachers were explaining to the young ones how to swim properly and to conduct themselves in a dignified manner but trot did not care to stop and watch the exercises  although the queen had lost her fairy wand in zogs domed chamber she had still enough magic power to carry them all across the ocean in wonderfully quick time and before trot and capn bill were aware of the distance they had come the mermaids paused while princess clia said  now we must go a little deeper for here is the giants cave and the entrance to it is near the bottom of the sea  what already cried the girl joyfully and then through the dark water they swam passing through the rocky entrance and began to ascend slowly into the azureblue water of the cave  youve been awfully good to us and i dont know jus how to thank you said trot earnestly  we have enjoyed your visit to us said beautiful queen aquareine smiling upon her little friend and you may easily repay any pleasure we have given you by speaking well of the mermaids when you hear ignorant earth people condemning us  ill do that of course exclaimed the child  how about changin us back to our reglar shapes inquired capn bill anxiously  that will be very easy replied princess clia with her merry laugh see here we are at the surface of the water  they pushed their heads above the blue water and looked around the cave it was silent and deserted floating gently near the spot where they had left it was their own little boat capn bill swam to it took hold of the side and then turned an inquiring face toward the mermaids climb in said the queen so he pulled himself up and awkwardly tumbled forward into the boat as he did so he heard his wooden leg clatter against the seat and turned around to look at it wonderingly  its me all right he muttered one meat one an one hickry one thats the same as belongs to me  will you lift mayre aboard asked princess clia  the old sailor aroused himself and as trot lifted up her arms he seized them and drew her safely into the boat she was dressed just as usual and her chubby legs wore shoes and stockings strangely enough neither of them were at all wet or even damp in any part of their clothing  i wonder where our legs have been while weve been gone mused capn bill gazing at his little friend in great delight  and i wonder whats become of our pretty pink and green scaled tails returned the girl laughing with glee for it seemed good to be herself again  queen aquareine and princess clia were a little way off lying with their pretty faces just out of the water while their hair floated in soft clouds around them  goodbye friends they called  goodbye shouted both trot and capn bill and the little girl blew two kisses from her fingers toward the mermaids  then the faces disappeared leaving little ripples on the surface of the water  capn bill picked up the oars and slowly headed the boat toward the mouth of the cave  i wonder trot if your ma has missed us he remarked uneasily  of course not replied the girl shes been sound asleep you know  as the boat crept out into the bright sunlight they were both silent but each sighed with pleasure at beholding their own everyday world again  finally trot said softly the lands the best capn  it is mate for livin on he answered  but im glad to have seen the mermaids she added  well som i trot he agreed but i wouldnt a believed any mortal could ever a seen em anan  trot laughed merrily  an lived to tell the tale she cried her eyes dancing with mischief oh capn bill how little we mortals know  true enough mate he replied but were alearnin something evry day     the end
