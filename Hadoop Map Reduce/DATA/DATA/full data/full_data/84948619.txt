 steps at a time  harold  hallo freda  patience on the monument  lets have a sniff  for miss lanfarne bill come down yet  freda  no mr harold       harold crosses the hall whistling and follows latter

girl with a rather charming irish face comes slowly down  and      at sight of her fredas whole figure becomes set and meaningfull  freda  for you miss lanfarne from my lady  mabel  in whose speech is

   without the roses freda still lingers  at the slamming of a      door above and hasty footsteps she shrinks back against the      stairs  bill runs down and comes on her suddenly  he is a      tall goodlooking edition of his father with the same stubborn      look of veiled choler  bill  freda and as she shrinks still further back whats the matter  then at some sound he looks round uneasily and draws away from her  arent you glad to see me  freda  ive something to say to you mr bill  after dinner  bill  mister       she passes him and rushes away upstairs  and bill who stands      frowning and looking after her recovers himself sharply as the      drawingroom door is opened and sir william and miss lanfarne      come forth followed by keith dot harold christine latter      and joan all leaning across each other and talking  by      herself behind them comes lady cheshire a refinedlooking      woman of fifty with silvery dark hair and an expression at      once gentle and ironic

disconcerted  if theyre tired of each other they ought not to marry and if fathers going to make them  christine  you dont understand in the least  its for the sake of the  dot  out with it old sweetness  the approaching infant  god bless it       there is a sudden silence for keith and latter are seen coming      from the diningroom  latter  that must be so ronny  keith  no john not a bit

into the billiardroom  lady cheshire  wheres bill ronny  keith  with a grimace  i rather think sir william and he are in committee of supplymemsahib  lady cheshire  oh       she looks uneasily at the diningroom then follows the girls      out  latter  in the tone of one resuming an argument  there cant be two opinions about it ronny  young dunnings refusal is simply indefensible  keith  i dont agree a bit john  latter  of course if you wont listen  keith  clipping a cigar  draw it mild my dear chap  weve had the whole thing over twice at least  latter  my point is this  keith  regarding latter quizzically with his halfclosed eyes i knowi knowbut the point is how far your point is simply professional  latter  if a man wrongs a woman he ought to right her again theres no answer to that  keith  it all depends  latter  thats rank opportunism  keith  rats  look hereoh hang it john one cant argue this out with a parson  latter  frigidly  why not  harold  who has entered from the diningroom  pull devil pull baker  keith  shut up harold  latter  to play the game is the religion even of the army  keith  exactly but what is the game  latter  what else can it be in this case  keith  youre too puritanical young john  you cant help itline of country laid down for you  all draghuntin  what  latter  with concentration  look here  harold  imitating the action of a man pulling at a horses head come hup i say you hugly beast  keith  to latter  youre not going to draw me old chap  you dont see where youd land us all  he smokes calmly  latter  how do you imagine vice takes its rise  from precisely this sort of thing of young dunnings  keith  from human nature i should have thought john  i admit that i dont like a fellows leavin a girl in the lurch but i dont see the use in drawin hard and fast rules  you only have to break em sir william and you would just tie dunning and the girl up together willynilly to save appearances and ten to one but therell be the deuce to pay in a years time  you can take a horse to the water you cant make him drink  latter  i entirely and absolutely disagree with you  harold  good old john  latter  at all events we know where your principles take you  keith  rather dangerously  where please  harold turns up his eyes and points downwards  dry up harold  latter  did you ever hear the story of faust  keith  now look here john with all due respect to your cloth and all the politeness in the world you may go toblazes  latter  well i must say ronnyof all the rude boorshe turns towards the billiardroom  keith  sorry i smashed the glass old chap       latter passes out  there comes a mingled sound through the      opened door of female voices laughter and the click of      billiard balls dipped of by the sudden closing of the door  keith  impersonally  deuced odd the way a parson puts ones back up  because you know i agree with him really young dunning ought to play the game and i hope sir williamll make him       the butler jackson has entered from the door under the stairs      followed by the keeper studdenham a man between fifty and      sixty in a fullskirted coat with big pockets cord breeches      and gaiters he has a steady self respecting weathered face      with blue eyes and a short grey beard which has obviously once      been red  keith  hullo  studdenham  studdenham touching his forehead evenin captain keith  jackson  sir william still in the diningroom with mr bill sir  harold  with a grimace  he is jackson       jackson goes out to the diningroom  keith  youve shot no pheasants yet

irony  a husband and two sons not counting  then as the door under the stairs is opened  bill now do  sir william  ill be gentle with him  sharply  come in       lady cheshire retires to the billiardroom  she gives a look      back and a half smile at young dunning a fair young man dressed      in broom cords and leggings and holding his cap in his hand      then goes out  sir william

 dunning  yes  sir william  sir william  well now go along and take a day to think it over       bill who has sauntered moody from the diningroom stands by the      stairs listening  catching sight of him dunning raises his      hand to his forelock  dunning  very good sir william  he turns fumbles and turns again  my old mothers dependent on me  sir william  now dunning ive no more to say      dunning goes sadly away under the stairs  sir william  following  and look here  just understand this      he too goes out       bill lighting a cigarette has approached the writingtable      he looks very glum  the billiardroom door is flung open      mabel lanfarne appears and makes him a little curtsey  mabel  against my will i am bidden to bring you in to pool  bill  sorry  ive got letters  mabel  you seem to have become very conscientious  bill  oh  i dont know  mabel  do you remember the last day of the covert shooting  bits  i do  mabel  suddenly  what a pretty girl freda studdenhams grown  bill  has she  mabel  she walks in beauty  bill  really  hadnt noticed  mabel  have you been taking lessons in conversation  bill  dont think so  mabel  oh  there is a silence  mr cheshire  bill  miss lanfarne  mabel  whats the matter with you arent you rather queer considering that i dont bite and was rather a pal  bill  stolidly im sorry       then seeing that his mother has came in from the billiardroom      he sits down at the writingtable  lady cheshire  mabel dear do take my cue  wont you play too bill and try and stop ronny hes too terrible  bill  thanks  ive got these letters  mabel taking the cue passes back into the billiardroom whence comes out the sound of talk and laughter  lady cheshire  going over and standing behind her sons chair anything wrong darling  bill  nothing thanks  suddenly  i say i wish you hadnt asked that girl here  lady cheshire  mabel  why  shes wanted for rehearsals  i thought you got on so well with her last christmas  bill  with a sort of sullen exasperation  a year ago  lady cheshire  the girls like her so does your father personally i must say i think shes rather nice and irish  bill  shes all right i daresay       he looks round as if to show his mother that he wishes to be      left alone  but lady cheshire having seen that he is about to      look at her is not looking at him  lady cheshire  im afraid your fathers been talking to you bill  bill  he has  lady cheshire  debts  do try and make allowances  with a faint smile of course he is a little  bill  he is  lady cheshire  i wish i could  bill  oh lord  dont you get mixed up in it  lady cheshire  it seems almost a pity that you told him  bill  he wrote and asked me point blank what i owed  lady cheshire  oh  forcing herself to speak in a casual voice i happen to have a little money billi think it would be simpler if  bill  now look here mother youve tried that before  i cant help spending money i never shall be able unless i go to the colonies or something of the kind  lady cheshire  dont talk like that dear  bill  i would for two straws  lady cheshire  its only because your father thinks such a lot of the place and the name and your career  the cheshires are all like that  theyve been here so long theyre allroot  bill  deuced funny business my career will be i expect  lady cheshire  fluttering but restraining herself lest he should see but bill why must you spend more than your allowance  bill  whyanything i didnt make myself  lady cheshire  im afraid we did that  it was inconsiderate perhaps  bill  yes youd better have left me out  lady cheshire  but why are you soonly a little fuss about money  bill  yees  lady cheshire  youre not keeping anything from me are you  bill  facing her no  he then turns very deliberately to the writing things and takes up a pen i must write these letters please  lady cheshire  bill if theres any real trouble you will tell me wont you  bill  theres nothing whatever       he suddenly gets up and walks about  lady cheshire too moves      over to the fireplace and after an uneasy look at him turns to      the fire  then as if trying to switch of his mood she changes      the subject abruptly  lady cheshire  isnt it a pity about young dunning  im so sorry for rose taylor       there is a silence  stealthily under the staircase freda has      entered and seeing only bill advances to speak to him  bill  suddenly  oh  wellyou cant help these things in the country       as he speaks freda stops dead perceiving that he is not alone      bill too catching sight of her starts  lady cheshire  still speaking to the fire it seems dreadful to force him  i do so believe in people doing things of their own accord  then seeing freda standing so uncertainly by the stairs do you want me freda  freda  only your cloak my lady  shall ibegin it       at this moment sir william enters from the drawingroom  lady cheshire  yes yes  sir william  genially  can you give me another five minutes bill pointing to the billiardroom  well come directly my dear       freda with a look at bill has gone back whence she came and      lady cheshire goes reluctantly away into the billiardroom  sir william  i shall give young dunning short shrift  he moves over to the fireplace and divides hip coattails  now about you bill  i dont want to bully you the moment you come down but you know this cant go on  ive paid your debts twice  shant pay them this time unless i see a disposition to change your mode of life a pause  you get your extravagance from your mother  shes very queera pauseall the winterleighs are like that about money  bill  mothers particularly generous if thats what you mean  sir william  drily  we will put it that way  a pause  at the present moment you owe as i understand it eleven hundred pounds  bill  about that  sir william  mere fleabite  a pause  ive a proposition to make  bill  wont it do tomorrow sir  sir william  tomorrow appears to be your motto in life  bill  thanks  sir william  im anxious to change it today  bill looks at him in silence  its time you took your position seriously instead of hanging about town racing and playing polo and what not  bill  go ahead       at something dangerous in his voice sir william modifies his      attitude  sir william  the propositions very simple  i cant suppose anything so rational and to your advantage will appeal to you but drily i mention it  marry a nice girl settle down and stand for the division you can have the dower house and fifteen hundred a year and ill pay your debts into the bargain  if youre elected ill make it two thousand  plenty of time to work up the constituency before we kick out these infernal rads  carpetbagger against you if you go hard at it in the summer itll be odd if you dont manage to get in your three days a week next season  you can take rocketer and that fouryearoldhes well up to your weight fully eight and a half inches of bone  youll only want one other and if missif your wife means to hunt  bill  youve chosen my wife then  sir  william  with a quick look  i imagine youve some girl in your mind  bill  ah  sir william used not to be unnatural at your age  i married your mother at twentyeight  here you are eldest son of a family that stands for something  the more i see of the times the more im convinced that everybody who is anybody has got to buckle to and save the landmarks left  unless were true to our caste and prepared to work for it the landed classes are going to go under to this infernal democratic spirit in the air  the outlooks very serious  were threatened in a hundred ways  if you mean business youll want a wife  when i came into the property i should have been lost without your mother  bill  i thought this was coming  sir william  with a certain geniality  my dear fellow i dont want to put a pistol to your head  youve had a slack rein so far ive never objected to your sowing a few wild oatsso long as you erunseen by sir william bill makes a sudden movement  short of thatat all events ive not inquired into your affairs  i can only judge by theerpecuniary evidence youve been good enough to afford me from time to time  i imagine youve lived like a good many young men in your positionim not blaming you but theres a time for all things  bill  why dont you say outright that you want me to marry mabel lanfarne  sits william  well i do  girls a nice one  good familygot a little moneyrides well  isnt she goodlooking enough for you or what  bill  quite thanks  sir william  i understood from your mother that you and she were on good terms  bill  please dont drag mother into it  sir william  with dangerous politeness  perhaps youll be good enough to state your objections  bill  must we go on with this  sir william  ive never asked you to do anything for me before i expect you to pay attention now  ive no wish to dragoon you into this particular marriage  if you dont care for miss lanfarne marry a girl youre fond of  bill  i refuse  sir william  in that case you know what to look out for  with a sudden rush of choler  you young  he checks himself and stands glaring at bill who glares back at him  this means i suppose that youve got some entanglement or other  bill  suppose what you like sir  sits william  i warn you if you play the blackguard  bill  you cant force me like young dunning       hearing the raised voices lady cheshire has come back from the      billiardroom  lady cheshire  closing the door what is it  sir william  you deliberately refuse  go away dorothy  lady cheshire  resolutely i havent seen bill for two months  sir william  what  hesitating  wellwe must talk it over again  lady cheshire  come to the billiardroom both of you  bill do finish those letters       with a deft movement she draws sir william toward the      billiardroom and glances back at bill before going out but he      has turned to the writingtable  when the door is closed bill      looks into the drawingroom them opens the door under the      stairs and backing away towards the writingtable sits down      there and takes up a pen  freda who has evidently been      waiting comes in and stands by the table  bill  i say this is dangerous you know  freda  yesbut i must  bill  well thenwith natural recklessness  arent you going to kiss me       without moving she looks at him with a sort of miserable inquiry  bill  do you know you havent seen me for eight weeks  freda  quitelong enoughfor you to have forgotten  bill  forgotten  i dont forget people so soon  freda  no  bill  whats the matter with

enters      his hunting clothes are splashed his face very grim and set      he walks to the fore without a glance at any one and stands      looking down into it very quietly every one but lady cheshire      steals away  lady cheshire  what have you done  sir william  you there  lady cheshire  dont keep me in suspense  sir william  the fool  my god  dorothy  i didnt think i had a blackguard

it breaks      with the pressure of his hand and falls into the fireplace      while he stands looking at it blankly there is a knock  sir william  come in       freda enters from the corridor  sir william  ive asked you to be good enough to come in order thatpointing to chairyou may sit down       but though she advances two or three steps she does not sit      down  sir william  this is a sad business  freda  below her breath yes sir william  sir william  becoming conscious of the depths of feeling before him ierare you attached to my son  freda in a whisper yes  sir william its very painful to me to have to do this he turns away from her and speaks to the fire  i sent for youtoask quickly how old are you  freda twentytwo  sir william more resolutely do you expect me to sanction such a mad idea as a marriage  freda i dont expect anything  sir william you knowyou havent earned the right to be considered  freda not yet  sir william what  that oughtnt to help you  on the

  lady cheshire and bill come in and freda passing them goes      into the billiardroom to wait  sir william speaking with a pause between each sentence your mother and i have spoken of thiscalamity  i imagine that even you have some dim perception of the monstrous nature of it  i must tell you this if you do this mad thing you fend for yourself  youll receive nothing from me now or hereafter  i consider that only due to the position our family has always held here  your brother will take your place  we shallget on as best we can without you there is a dead silence till he adds sharply well

rotter in all  you put the butt end of the pistol to dunnings head yesterday you put the other end to mine today  well  he turns round to go out let the dd thing off  lady cheshire  bill  bill  turning to her im not going to leave her in the lurch  sir william  do me the justice to admit that i have not attempted to persuade you to  bill  no youve chucked me out  i dont see what else you

naturally can never hope to forget  i shall carry this down to my death  we shall all of us do that  i have had the misfortune all my life to believe in our position hereto believe that we counted for somethingthat the country wanted us  i have tried to do my duty by that position  i find in one moment that it is gone smokegone  my philosophy is not equal to that  to countenance this marriage would be unnatural  bill  i know  im sorry  ive got her into thisi dont see any other way out  its a bad business for me father as well as for you       he stops seeing that jackson has route in and is
