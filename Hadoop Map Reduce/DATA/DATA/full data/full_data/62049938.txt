62049938	sir walter raleigh and his time 1  by charles kingsley     truth is stranger than fiction  a trite remark  we all say it again and again  but how few of us believe it  how few of us when we read the history of heroical times and heroical men take the story simply as it stands  on the contrary we try to explain it away to prove it all not to have been so very wonderful to impute accident circumstance mean and commonplace motives to lower every story down to the level of our own littleness or what we unjustly to ourselves and to the god who is near us all choose to consider our level to rationalise away all the wonders till we make them at last impossible and give up caring to believe them and prove to our own melancholy satisfaction that alexander conquered the world with a pin in his sleep by accident  and yet in this mood as in most there is a sort of lefthanded truth involved  these heroes are not so far removed from us after all  they were men of like passions with ourselves with the same flesh about them the same spirit within them the same world outside the same devil beneath the same god above  they and their deeds were not so very wonderful  every child who is born into the world is just as wonderful and for aught we know might mutatis mutandis do just as wonderful deeds  if accident and circumstance helped them the same may help us  have helped us if we will look back down our years far more than we have made use of  they were men certainly very much of our own level  but may we not put that level somewhat too low  they were certainly not what we are for if they had been they would have done no more than we  but is not a mans real level not what he is but what he can be and therefore ought to be  no doubt they were compact of good and evil just as we  but so was david no man more though a more heroical personage save one appears not in all human records but may not the secret of their success have been that on the whole though they found it a sore battle they refused the evil and chose the good it is true again that their great deeds may be more or less explained attributed to laws rationalised  but is explaining always explaining away  is it to degrade a thing to attribute it to a law  and do you do anything more by rationalising mens deeds than prove that they were rational men men who saw certain fixed laws and obeyed them and succeeded thereby according to the baconian apophthegm that nature is conquered by obeying her  but what laws  to that question perhaps the eleventh chapter of the epistle to the hebrews will give the best answer where it says that by faith were done all the truly great deeds and by faith lived all the truly great men who have ever appeared on earth  there are of course higher and lower degrees of this faith its object is one more or less worthy  but it is in all cases the belief in certain unseen eternal facts by keeping true to which a man must in the long run succeed  must because he is more or less in harmony with heaven and earth and the maker thereof and has therefore fighting on his side a great portion of the universe perhaps the whole for as he who breaks one commandment of the law is guilty of the whole because he denies the fount of all law so he who with his whole soul keeps one commandment of it is likely to be in harmony with the whole because he testifies of the fount of all law  i shall devote a few pages to the story of an old hero of a man of like passions with ourselves of one who had the most intense and awful sense of the unseen laws and succeeded mightily thereby of one who had hard struggles with a flesh and blood which made him at times forget those laws and failed mightily thereby of one whom god so loved that he caused each slightest sin as with david to bring its own punishment with it that while the flesh was delivered over to satan the man himself might be saved in the day of the lord of one finally of whom nine hundred and ninetynine men out of a thousand may say i have done worse deeds than he  but i have never done as good ones  in a poor farmhouse among the pleasant valleys of south devon among the white appleorchards and the rich watermeadows and the red fallows and red kine in the year of grace 1552 a boy was born as beautiful as day and christened walter raleigh  his father was a gentleman of ancient blood  few older in the land  but impoverished he had settled down upon the wreck of his estate in that poor farmhouse  no record of him now remains but he must have been a man worth knowing and worth loving or he would not have won the wife he did  she was a champernoun proudest of norman squires and could probably boast of having in her veins the blood of courtneys emperors of byzant  she had been the wife of the famous knight sir otho gilbert and lady of compton castle and had borne him three brave sons john humphrey and adrian all three destined to win knighthood also in due time and the two latter already giving promises which they well fulfilled of becoming most remarkable men of their time  and yet the fair champernoun at her husbands death had chosen to wed mr raleigh and share life with him in the little farmhouse at hayes  she must have been a grand woman if the law holds true that great men always have great mothers an especially grand woman indeed for few can boast of having borne to two different husbands such sons as she bore  no record as far as we know remains of her nor of her boys early years  one can imagine them nevertheless  just as he awakes to consciousness the smithfield fires are extinguished  he can recollect perhaps hearing of the burning of the exeter martyrs  and he does not forget it no one forgot or dared forget it in those days  he is brought up in the simple and manly yet highbred ways of english gentlemen in the times of an old courtier of the queens  his two elder halfbrothers also living some thirty miles away in the quaint and gloomy towers of compton castle amid the appleorchards of torbay are men as noble as ever formed a young lads taste  humphrey and adrian gilbert who afterwards both of them rise to knighthood arewhat are they notsoldiers scholars christians discoverers and planters of foreign lands geographers alchemists miners platonical philosophers manysided highminded men not without fantastic enthusiasm living heroic lives and destined one of them to die a heroic death  from them raleighs fancy has been fired and his appetite for learning quickened while he is yet a daring boy fishing in the gray troutbrooks or going up with his father to the dartmoor hills to hunt the deer with hound and horn amid the wooded gorges of holne or over the dreary downs of hartland warren and the cloudcapt thickets of cators beam and looking down from thence upon the far blue southern sea wondering when he shall sail thereon to fight the spaniard and discover like columbus some fairyland of gold and gems  for before this boys mind as before all intense english minds of that day rise from the first three fixed ideas which yet are but onethe pope the spaniard and america  the two first are the sworn and internecine enemies whether they pretend a formal peace or not of law and freedom bible and queen and all that makes an englishmans life dear to him  are they not the incarnations of antichrist  their moloch sacrifices flame through all lands  the earth groans because of them and refuses to cover the blood of her slain  and america is the new world of boundless wonder and beauty wealth and fertility to which these two evil powers arrogate an exclusive and divine right and god has delivered it into their hands and they have done evil therein with all their might till the story of their greed and cruelty rings through all earth and heaven  is this the will of god  will he not avenge for these things as surely as he is the lord who executeth justice and judgment in the earth  these are the young boys thoughts  these were his thoughts for sixtysix eventful years  in whatsoever else he wavered he never wavered in that creed  he learnt it in his boyhood while he read foxs martyrs beside his mothers knee  he learnt it as a lad when he saw his neighbours hawkins and drake changed by spanish tyranny and treachery from peaceful merchantmen into fierce scourges of god  he learnt it scholastically from fathers and divines as an oxford scholar in days when oxford was a protestant indeed in whom there was no guile  he learnt it when he went over at seventeen years old with his gallant kinsman henry champernoun and his band of a hundred gentlemen volunteers to flesh his maiden sword in behalf of the persecuted french protestants  he learnt it as he listened to the shrieks of the san bartholomew he learnt it as he watched the dragonnades the tortures the massacres of the netherlands and fought manfully under norris in behalf of those victims of the pope and spain  he preached it in far stronger and wiser words than i can express it for him in that noble tract of 1591 on sir richard grenvilles death at the azoresa tyrtaean trumpetblast such as has seldom rung in human ears he discussed it like a cool statesman in his pamphlet of 1596 on a war with spain he sacrificed for it the last hopes of his old age the wreck of his fortunes his just recovered liberty and he died with the old gods battlecry upon his lips when it awoke no response from the hearts of a coward profligate and unbelieving generation  this is the background the keynote of the mans whole life  if we lose the recollection of it and content ourselves by slurring it over in the last pages of his biography with some halfsneer about his putting like the rest of elizabeths old admirals the spaniard the pope and the devil in the same category then we shall understand very little about raleigh though of course we shall save ourselves the trouble of pronouncing as to whether the spaniard and the pope were really in the same category as the devil or indeed which might be equally puzzling to a good many historians of the last century and a half whether there be any devil at all  the books which i have chosen to head this review are all of them more or less good with one exception and that is bishop goodmans memoirs on which much stress has been lately laid as throwing light on various passages of raleigh essex cecil and jamess lives having read it carefully i must say plainly that i think the book an altogether foolish pedantic and untrustworthy book without any power of insight or gleam of reason without even the care to be selfconsistent having but one object the whitewashing of james and of every noble lord whom the bishop has ever known  but in whitewashing each the poor old flunkey so bespatters all the rest of his pets that when the work is done the whole party look if possible rather dirtier than before  and so i leave bishop goodman  mr fraser tytlers book is well known and it is on the whole a good one because he really loves and admires the man of whom he writes but he is sometimes careless as to authorities and too often makes the wish father to the thought  moreover he has the usual sentiment about mary queen of scots and the usual scandal about elizabeth which is simply anathema and which prevents his really seeing the time in which raleigh lived and the element in which he moved  this sort of talk is happily dying out just now but no one can approach the history of the elizabethan age perhaps of any age without finding that truth is all but buried under mountains of dirt and chaffan augaean stable which perhaps will never be swept clean yet i have seen with great delight several attempts toward removal of the said superstratum of dirt and chaff from the elizabethan histories in several articles all evidently from the same pen and that one more perfectly master of english prose than any man living in the westminster review and frasers magazine 2  sir robert schomburgks edition of the guiana voyage contains an excellent life of raleigh perhaps the best yet written of which i only complain when it gives in to the stockcharges against raleigh as it were at secondhand and just because they are stockcharges and when too the illustrious editor unable to conceal his admiration of a discoverer in many points so like himself takes all through an apologetic tone of please dont laugh at me  i daresay it is very foolish but i cant help loving the man  mr napiers little book is a reprint of two edinburgh review articles on bacon and raleigh  the first a learned statement of facts in answer to some unwisdom of a quarterly reviewer possibly an oxford aristotelian for we think we do know that sweet roman hand  it is clear accurate convincing complete  there is no more to be said about the matter save that facts are stubborn things  the article on raleigh is very valuable first because mr napier has had access to many documents unknown to former biographers and next because he clears raleigh completely from the old imputation of deceit about the guiana mine as well as of other minor charges with his general opinion of raleighs last and fatal guiana voyage i have the misfortune to differ from him toto coelo on the strength of the very documents which he quotes  but mr napier is always careful always temperate and always just except where he as i think does not enter into the feelings of the man whom he is analysing  let readers buy the book it will tell them a hundred things they do not know and be judge between mr napier and me  in the meanwhile one cannot help watching with a smile how good old times scrubbingbrush which clears away paint and whitewash from church pillars does the same by such characters as raleighs  after each fresh examination some fresh count in the hundredheaded indictment breaks down  the truth is that as people begin to believe more in nobleness and to gird up their loins to the doing of noble deeds they discover more nobleness in others  raleighs character was in its lowest nadir in the days of voltaire and hume what shame to him  for so were more sacred characters than his shall the disciple be above his master especially when that disciple was but too inconsistent and gave occasion to the uncircumcised to blaspheme  but cayley after a few years refutes triumphantly humes silly slanders  he is a stupid writer  but he has sense enough being patient honest and loving to do that  mr fraser tytler shovels away a little more of the dirtheap mr napier clears him for which we owe him many thanks by simple statement of facts from the charge of having deserted and neglected his virginia colonists humboldt and schomburgk clear him from the charge of having lied about guiana and so on each successive writer giving in generally on merest hearsay to the general complaint against him either from fear of running counter to big names or from mere laziness and yet absolving him from that particular charge of which his own knowledge enables him to judge  in the trust that i may be able to clear him from a few more charges i write these pages premising that i do not profess to have access to any new and recondite documents  i merely take the broad facts of the story from documents open to all and comment on them as every man should wish his own life to be commented on  but i do so on a method which i cannot give up and that is the bible method  i say boldly that historians have hitherto failed in understanding not only raleigh and elizabeth but ninetenths of the persons and facts in his day because they will not judge them by the canons which the bible lays downby which i mean not only the new testament but the old which as english churchmen say and scotch presbyterians have ere now testified with sacred blood is not contrary to the new  mr napier has a passage about raleigh for which i am sorry coming as it does from a countryman of john knox  society it would seem was yet in a state in which such a man could seriously plead that the madness he feigned was justified his last word is unfair for raleigh only hopes that it is no sin by the example of david king of israel  what a shocking state of society when men actually believed their bibles not too little but too much  for my part i think that if poor dear raleigh had considered the example of david a little more closely he need never have feigned madness at all and that his error lay quite in an opposite direction from looking on the bible heroes david especially as too sure models  at all events let us try raleigh by the very scriptural standard which he himself lays down not merely in this case unwisely but in his history of the world more wisely than any historian whom i have ever read and say judged as the bible taught our puritan forefathers to judge every man the character is intelligible enough tragic but noble and triumphant  judged as men have been judged in history for the last hundred years by hardly any canon save those of the private judgment which philosophic cant maudlin sentimentality or fear of public opinion may happen to have forged the man is a phenomenon only less confused abnormal suspicious than his biographers notions about him  again i say i have not solved the problem  but it will be enough if i make some think it both soluble and worth solving  let us look round then and see into what sort of a country into what sort of a world the young adventurer is going forth at seventeen years of age to seek his fortune  born in 1552 his young life has sprung up and grown with the young life of england  the earliest fact perhaps which he can recollect is the flash of joy on every face which proclaims that mary tudor is dead and elizabeth reigns at last  as he grows the young man sees all the hope and adoration of the english people centre in that wondrous maid and his own centre in her likewise  he had been base had he been otherwise  she comes to the throne with such a prestige as never sovereign came since the days when isaiah sang his paean over young hezekiahs accession  young learned witty beautiful as with such a father and mother she could not help being with an expression of countenance remarkable i speak of those early days rather for its tenderness and intellectual depth than its strength she comes forward as the champion of the reformed faith the interpretress of the will and conscience of the people of england herself persecuted all but to the death and purified by affliction like gold tried in the fire  she gathers round her one by one young men of promise and trains them herself to their work  and they fulfil it and serve her and grow grayheaded in her service working as faithfully as righteously as patriotically as men ever worked on earth  they are her favourites because they are men who deserve favour men who count not their own lives dear to themselves for the sake of the queen and of that commonweal which their hearts and reasons tell them is one with her  they are still men though and some of them have their grudgings and envyings against each other  she keeps the balance even between them on the whole skilfully gently justly in spite of weaknesses and prejudices without which she had been more than human  some have their conceited hopes of marrying her becoming her masters  she rebukes and pardons  out of the dust i took you sir go and do your duty humbly and rationally henceforth or into the dust i trample you again  and they reconsider themselves and obey  but many or most of them are new men country gentlemen and younger sons  she will follow her fathers plan of keeping down the overgrown feudal princes who though brought low by the wars of the roses are still strong enough to throw everything into confusion by resisting at once the crown and commons  proud nobles reply by rebellion come down southwards with ignorant popish henchmen at their backs will restore popery marry the queen of scots make the middle class and the majority submit to the feudal lords and the minority  elizabeth with her aristocracy of genius is too strong for them  the peoples heart is with her and not with dukes  each mine only blows up its diggers and there are many dry eyes at their ruin  her people ask her to marry  she answers gently proudly eloquently she is marriedthe people of england is her husband  she has vowed it  and yet there is a tone of sadness in that great speech  her womans heart yearns after love after children after a strong bosom on which to repose that weary head  more than once she is ready to give way  but she knows that it must not be  she has her reward whosoever gives up husband or child for my sake and the gospels shall receive them back a hundredfold in this present life as elizabeth does  her reward is an adoration from high and low which is to us now inexplicable impossible overstrained which was not so then  for the whole nation is in a mood of exaltation england is fairyland the times are the last daysstrange terrible and glorious  at home are jesuits plotting dark crookedpathed going up and down in all manner of disguises doing the devils work if men ever did it trying to sow discord between man and man class and class putting out books full of filthy calumnies declaring the queen illegitimate excommunicate a usurper english law null and all state appointments void by virtue of a certain bull and calling on the subjects to rebellion and assassination even on the bedchamberwoman to do to her as judith did to holofernes  she answers by calm contempt  now and then burleigh and walsingham catch some of the rogues and they meet their deserts but she for the most part lets them have their way  god is on her side and she will not fear what man can do to her  abroad the sky is dark and wild and yet full of fantastic splendour  spain stands strong and awful a rising worldtyranny with its darksouled cortezes and pizarros alvas don johns and parmas men whose path is like the lava stream who go forth slaying and to slay in the name of their gods like those old assyrian conquerors on the walls of nineveh with tutelary genii flying above their heads mingled with the eagles who trail the entrails of the slain  by conquest intermarriage or intrigue she has made all the southern nations her vassals or her tools close to our own shores the netherlands are struggling vainly for their liberties abroad the western islands and the whole trade of africa and india will in a few years be hers  and already the pope whose most catholic and faithful servant she is has repaid her services in the cause of darkness by the gift of the whole new worlda gift which she has claimed by cruelties and massacres unexampled since the days of timour and zinghis khan  there she spreads and spreads as drake found her picture in the government house at st domingo the horse leaping through the globe and underneath non sufficit orbis  who shall withstand her armed as she is with the threeedged sword of antichristsuperstition strength and gold  english merchantmen longing for some share in the riches of the new world go out to trade in guinea in the azores in new spain  and are answered by shot and steel  both policy and religion as fray simon says fifty years afterwards forbid christians to trade with heretics  lutheran devils and enemies of god are the answer they get in words  in deeds whenever they have a superior force they may be allowed to land and to water their ships even to trade under exorbitant restrictions  but generally this is merely a trap for them  forces are hurried up and the english are attacked treacherously in spite of solemn compacts for no faith need be kept with heretics  and woe to them if any be taken prisoners even wrecked  the galleys and the rack and the stake are their certain doom for the inquisition claims the bodies and souls of heretics all over the world and thinks it sin to lose its own  a few years of such wrong raise questions in the sturdy english heart  what right have these spaniards to the new world  the popes gift  why he gave it by the same authority by which he claims the whole world the formula used when an indian village is sacked is that god gave the whole world to st peter and that he has given it to his successors and they the indies to the king of spain  to acknowledge that lie would be to acknowledge the very power by which the pope claims a right to depose queen elizabeth and give her dominions to whomsoever he will  a fico for bulls  by possession then  that may hold for mexico peru new grenada paraguay which have been colonised though they were gained by means which make every one concerned in conquering them worthy of the gallows and the right is only that of the thief to the purse whose owner he has murdered  but as for the restwhy the spaniard has not colonised even explored onefifth of the new world not even one fifth of the coast  is the existence of a few petty factories often hundreds of miles apart at a few rivermouths to give them a claim to the whole intermediate coast much less to the vast unknown tracts inside  we will try that  if they appeal to the sword so be it the men are treacherous robbers we will indemnify ourselves for our losses and god defend the right  so argued the english and so sprung up that strange war of reprisals in which for eighteen years it was held that there was no peace between england and spain beyond the line ie beyond the parallel of longitude where the popes gift of the western world was said to begin and as the quarrel thickened and neared extended to the azores canaries and coasts of africa where english and spaniards flew at each other as soon as seen mutually and by common consent as natural enemies each invoking god in the battle with antichrist  into such a world as this goes forth young raleigh his heart full of chivalrous worship for englands tutelary genius his brain aflame with the true miracles of the newfound hesperides full of vague hopes vast imaginations and consciousness of enormous power  and yet he is no wayward dreamer unfit for this workday world  with a vein of song most lofty insolent and passionate indeed unable to see aught without a poetic glow over the whole he is eminently practical contented to begin at the beginning that he may end at the end one who could toil terribly who always laboured at the matter in hand as if he were born only for that  accordingly he sets to work faithfully and stoutly to learn his trade of soldiering and learns it in silence and obscurity  he shares it seems in the retreat at moncontour and is by at the death of conde and toils on for five years marching and skirmishing smoking the enemy out of mountaincaves in languedoc and all the wild work of war  during the san bartholomew massacre we hear nothing of him perhaps he took refuge with sidney and others in walsinghams house no records of these years remain save a few scattered reminiscences in his works which mark the shrewd observant eye of the future statesman  when he returned we know not  we trace him in 1576 by some verses prefixed to gascoignes satire the steele glass solid stately epigrammatic by walter rawley of the middle temple  the style is his spelling of names matters nought in days in which a man would spell his own name three different ways in one document  gascoigne like raleigh knew lord grey of wilton and most men about town too and had been a soldier abroad like raleigh probably with him  it seems to have been the fashion for young idlers to lodge among the templars indeed toward the end of the century they had to be cleared out as crowding the wigs and gowns too much and perhaps proving noisy neighbours as raleigh may have done  to this period may be referred probably his justice done on mr charles chester ben jonsons carlo buffone a perpetual talker and made a noise like a drum in a room so one time at a tavern raleigh beats him and seals up his mouth his upper and nether beard with hard wax  for there is a great laugh in raleighs heart a genial contempt of asses and one that will make him enemies hereafter perhaps shorten his days  one hears of him next but only by report in the netherlands under norris where the nucleus of the english line especially of its musquetry was training  for don john of austria intends not only to crush the liberties and creeds of the flemings but afterwards to marry the queen of scots and conquer england  and elizabeth unwillingly and slowly for she cannot stomach rebels has sent men and money to the states to stop don john in time which the valiant english and scotch do on lammas day 1578 and that in a fashion till then unseen in war  for coming up late and panting and being more sensible of a little heat of the sun than of any cold fear of death they throw off their armour and clothes and in their shirts not overclean one fears give don johns rashness such a rebuff that two months more see that wild meteor with lost hopes and tarnished fame lie down and vanish below the stormy horizon  in these days probably it is that he knew colonel bingham a soldier of fortune of a fancy high and wild too desultory and overvoluble who had among his hundred and one schemes one for the plantation of america as poor sir thomas stukely whom raleigh must have known well uncle of the traitor lewis had for the peopling of florida  raleigh returns  ten years has he been learning his soldiers trade in silence  he will take a lesson in seamanship next  the court may come in time  for by now the poor squires younger son must have discoveredperhaps even too fullythat he is not as other men are that he can speak and watch and dare and endure as none around him can do  however there are good adventures toward as the morte darthur would say and he will off with his halfbrother humphrey gilbert to carry out his patent for planting meta incognita the unknown goal as queen elizabeth has named itwhich will prove to be too truly and fatally unknown  in a latitude south of england and with an italian summer who can guess that the winter will outfreeze russia itself  the merchantseaman like the statesman had yet many a thing to learn  instead of smiling at our forefathers ignorance let us honour the men who bought knowledge for us their children at the price of lives nobler than our own  so raleigh goes on his voyage with humphrey gilbert to carry out the patent for discovering and planting in meta incognita but the voyage prospers not  a smart brush with the spaniards sends them home again with the loss of morgan their best captain and a tall ship and meta incognita is forgotten for a while but not the spaniards  who are these who forbid all english by virtue of the popes bull to cross the atlantic  that must be settled hereafter and raleigh ever busy is off to ireland to command a company in that common weal or rather common woe as he calls it in a letter to leicester  two years and more pass here and all the records of him which remain are of a man valiant daring and yet prudent beyond his fellows  he hates his work and is not on too good terms with stern and sour but brave and faithful lord grey but lord grey is leicesters friend and raleigh works patiently under him like a sensible man just because he is leicesters friend  some modern gentleman of notei forget who and do not care to recollectsays that raleighs prudence never bore any proportion to his genius the next biographer we open accuses him of being too calculating cunning timeserving and so forth  perhaps both are true  the mans was a character very likely to fall alternately into either sindoubtless did so a hundred times  perhaps both are false  the mans character was on occasion certain to rise above both faults we have evidence that he did so his whole life long  he is tired of ireland at last  nothing goes right there when has it  nothing is to be done there  that which is crooked cannot be made straight and that which is wanting cannot be numbered  he comes to london and to court  but how  by spreading his cloak over a muddy place for queen elizabeth to step on  it is very likely to be a true story but biographers have slurred over a few facts in their hurry to carry out their theory of favourites and to prove that elizabeth took up raleigh on the same grounds that a boarding school miss might have done  not that i deny the cloak story to be a very pretty story perhaps it justifies taken alone elizabeths fondness for him  there may have been selfinterest in it we are bound as men of the world to impute the dirtiest motive that we can find but how many selfinterested men do we know who would have had quickness and daring to do such a thing  men who are thinking about themselves are not generally either so quickwitted or so inclined to throw away a good cloak when by much scraping and saving they have got one  i never met a cunning selfish ambitious man who would have done such a thing  the reader may but even if he has we must ask him for queen elizabeths sake to consider that this young quixote is the close relation of three of the finest public men then living champernoun gilbert and carew  that he is a friend of sidney a pet of leicester that he has left behind him at oxford and brought with him from ireland the reputation of being a rara avis a new star in the firmament that he had been a soldier in her majestys service and in one in which she has a peculiar private interest for twelve years that he has held her commission as one of the triumvirate for governing munster and has been the commander of the garrison at cork and that it is possible that she may have heard something of him before he threw his cloak under her feet especially as there has been some controversy which we have in vain tried to fathom between him and lord grey about that terrible smerwick slaughter of the results of which we know little but that raleigh being called in question about it in london made such good play with his tongue that his reputation as an orator and a man of talent was fixed once and for ever  within the twelve months he is sent on some secret diplomatic mission about the anjou marriage he is in fact now installed in his place as a favourite  and why not  if a man is found to be wise and witty ready and useful able to do whatsoever he is put to why is a sovereign who has eyes to see the mans worth and courage to use it to be accused of i know not what because the said man happens to be goodlooking  now comes the turningpoint of raleighs life  what does he intend to be  soldier statesman scholar or seaadventurer  he takes the most natural yet not the wisest course  he will try and be all four at once  he has intellect for it by worldly wisdom he may have money for it also  even now he has contrived no one can tell whence to build a good bark of two hundred tons and send her out with humphrey gilbert on his second and fatal voyage  luckily for raleigh she deserts and comes home while not yet out of the channel or she surely had gone the way of the rest of gilberts squadron raleigh of course loses money by the failure as well as the hopes which he had grounded on his brothers transatlantic viceroyalty and a bitter pang it must have been to him to find himself bereft of that pure and heroic counsellor just at his entering into life  but with the same elasticity which sent him to the grave he is busy within six months in a fresh expedition  if meta incognita be not worth planting there must be so raleigh thinks a vast extent of coast between it and florida which is more genial in climate perhaps more rich in produce and he sends philip amadas and arthur barlow to look for the same and not in vain  on these virginian discoveries i shall say but little  those who wish to enjoy them should read them in all their naive freshness in the originals and they will subscribe to s t coleridges dictum that no one nowadays can write travels as well as the old worthies who figure in hakluyt and purchas  but to return to the questionwhat does this man intend to be  a discoverer and colonist a vindicator of some part at least of america from spanish claims  perhaps not altogether  else he would have gone himself to virginia at least the second voyage instead of sending others  but here it seems is the fatal and yet pardonable mistake which haunts the man throughout  he tries to be too many men at once  fatal  because though he leaves his trace on more things than one man is wont to do he strictly speaking conquers nothing brings nothing to a consummation  virginia guiana the history of the world his own career as a statesmanas dictator for he might have been dictator had he chosenall are left unfinished  and yet most pardonable for if a man feels that he can do many different things how hard to teach himself that he must not do them all  how hard to say to himself i must cut off the right hand and pluck out the right eye  i must be less than myself in order really to be anything  i must concentrate my powers on one subject and that perhaps by no means the most seemingly noble or useful still less the most pleasant and forego so many branches of activity in which i might be so distinguished so useful  this is a hard lesson  raleigh took just sixtysix years learning it and had to carry the result of his experience to the other side of the dark river for there was no time left to use it on this side  some readers may have learnt the lesson already  if so happy and blessed are they  but let them not therefore exalt themselves above walter raleigh for that lesson is of course soonest learnt by the man who can excel in few things later by him who can excel in many and latest of all by him who like raleigh can excel in all  few details remain concerning the earlier court days of raleigh  he rises rapidly as we have seen  he has an estate given him in ireland near his friend spenser where he tries to do well and wisely colonising tilling and planting it  but like his virginia expeditions principally at second hand  for he has swallowed there is no denying it the painted bait  he will discover he will colonise he will do all manner of beautiful things at second hand but he himself will be a courtier  it is very tempting  who would not at the age of thirty have wished to have been one of that chosen band of geniuses and heroes whom elizabeth had gathered round her  who would not at the age of thirty have given his pound of flesh to be captain of her guard and to go with her whithersoever she went  it is not merely the intense gratification to carnal vanitywhich if any man denies or scoffs at always mark him down as especially guiltywhich is to be considered but the real actual honour in the mind of one who looked on elizabeth as the most precious and glorious being which the earth had seen for centuries to be appreciated by her to be loved by her to serve her to guard her what could man desire more on earth  beside he becomes a member of parliament now lord warden of the stannaries business which of course keeps him in england business which he performs as he does all things wisely and well  such a generation as this ought really to respect raleigh a little more if it be only for his excellence in their own especial spherethat of business  raleigh is a thorough man of business  he can toil terribly and what is more toil to the purpose  in all the everyday affairs of life he remains without a blot a diligent methodical prudent man who though he plays for great stakes ventures and loses his whole fortune again and again yet never seems to omit the doing the duty which lies nearest him never gets into mean money scrapes never neglects tenants or duty never gives way for one instant to the eccentricities of genius  if he had done so be sure that we should have heard of it  for no man can become what he has become without making many an enemy and he has his enemies already  on which statement naturally occurs the questionwhy  an important question too because several of his later biographers seem to have running in their minds some such train of thought as thisraleigh must have been a bad fellow or he would not have had so many enemies and because he was a bad fellow there is an a priori reason that charges against him are true  whether this be arguing in a circle or not it is worth searching out the beginning of this enmity and the reputed causes of it  in after years it will be because he is damnable proud because he hated essex and so forth  of which in their places  but what is the earliest count against him  naunton who hated raleigh and was moreover a rogue has no reason to give but that the queen took him for a kind of oracle which much nettled them all yea those he relied on began to take this his sudden favour for an alarm to be sensible of their own supplantation and to project his which shortly made him to sing fortune my foe  now be this true or not and we do not put much faith in it it gives no reason for the early dislike of raleigh save the somewhat unsatisfactory one which cain would have given for his dislike of abel  moreover there exists a letter of essexs written as thoroughly in the cain spirit as any we ever read and we wonder that after reading that letter men can find courage to repeat the old sentimentalism about the noble and unfortunate earl  his hatred of raleighwhich as we shall see hereafter raleigh not only bears patiently but requites with good deeds as long as he can springs by his own confession simply from envy and disappointed vanity  the spoilt boy insults queen elizabeth about her liking for the knave raleigh  she taking hold of one word disdain tells essex that there was no such cause why i should thus disdain him on which says essex as near as i could i did describe unto her what he had been and what he was and then i did let her see whether i had come to disdain his competition of love or whether i could have comfort to give myself over to the service of a mistress that was in awe of such a man  i spake for grief and choler as much against him as i could  and i think he standing at the door might very well hear the worst that i spoke of him  in the end i saw she was resolved to defend him and to cross me  whereupon follows a scene the naughty boy raging and stamping till he insults the queen and calls raleigh a wretch whereon poor elizabeth who loved the coxcomb for his fathers sake turned her away to my lady warwick and essex goes grumbling forth  raleighs next few years are brilliant and busy ones and gladly did space permit would i give details of those brilliant adventures which make this part of his life that of a true knighterrant  but they are mere episodes in the history and we must pass them quickly by only saying that they corroborate in all things our original notion of the manjust humane wise greatly daring and enduring greatly and filled with the one fixed idea which has grown with his growth and strengthened with his strength the destruction of the spanish power and colonisation of america by english  his brother humphrey makes a second attempt to colonise newfoundland and perishes as heroically as he had lived  raleigh undaunted by his own loss in the adventure and his brothers failure sends out a fleet of his own to discover to the southward and finds virginia one might spend pages on this beautiful episode on the simple descriptions of the fair new land which the seakings bring home on the profound for those times at least knowledge which prompted raleigh to make the attempt in that particular direction which had as yet escaped the notice of the spaniards on the quiet patience with which undaunted by the illsuccess of the first colonists he sends out fleet after fleet to keep the hold which he had once gained till unable any longer to support the huge expense he makes over his patent for discovery to a company of merchants who fare for many years as ill as raleigh himself did  but one thing one has a right to say that to this one man under the providence of almighty god do the whole of the united states of america owe their existence the work was double  the colony however small had to be kept in possession at all hazards and he did it  but that was not enough spain must be prevented from extending her operations northward from florida she must be crippled along the whole east coast of america and raleigh did that too  we find him for years to come a part adventurer in almost every attack on the spaniards  we find him preaching war against them on these very grounds and setting others to preach it also  good old hariot raleighs mathematical tutor whom he sent to virginia reechoes his pupils trumpetblast hooker in his epistle dedicatory of his irish history strikes the same note and a right noble one it is  these spaniards are trying to build up a worldtyranny by rapine and cruelty  you sir call on us to deliver the earth from them by doing justly and loving mercy and we will obey you is the answer which raleigh receives as far as i can find from every noblernatured englishman  it was an immense conception  a glorious one  it stood out so clear  there was no mistake about its being the absolutely right wise patriotic thing and so feasible too if raleigh could but find six cents hommes qui savaient mourir  but that was just what he could not find  he could draw round him and did by the spiritual magnetism of his genius many a noble soul but he could not organise them as he seems to have tried to do into a coherent body  the english spirit of independent action never stronger than in that age and most wisely encouraged for other reasons by good queen bess was too strong for him  his pupils will fight on their own hook like so many yankee rangers  quarrel with each other grumble at him  for the truth is he demands of them too high a standard of thought and purpose  he is often a whole heaven above them in the hugeness of his imagination the nobleness of his motive and don quixote can often find no better squire than sancho panza even glorious sir richard grenvile makes a mistake  burns an indian village because they steal a silver cup throws back the colonisation of virginia ten years with his overstrict notions of discipline and retributive justice and raleigh requites him for his offence by embalming him his valour and his death not in immortal verse but in immortal prose  the true relation of the fight at the azores gives the keynote of raleighs heart  if readers will not take that as the text on which his whole life is a commentary they may know a great deal about him but him they will never know  the game becomes fiercer and fiercer  blow and counterblow between the spanish king for the whole westindian commerce was a government job and the merchant nobles of england  at last the great armada comes and the great armada goes again  venit vidit fugit as the medals said of it  and to walter raleighs counsel by the testimony of all contemporaries the mighty victory is to be principally attributed  where all men did heroically it were invidious to bestow on him alone a crown ob patriam servatam  but henceforth elizabeth knows well that she has not been mistaken in her choice and raleigh is better loved than ever heaped with fresh wealth and honours  and who deserves them better  the immense value of his services in the defence of england should excuse him from the complaint which one has been often inclined to bring against himwhy instead of sending others westward ho did be not go himself  surely he could have reconciled the jarring instruments with which he was working  he could have organised such a body of men as perhaps never went out before or since on the same errand  he could have done all that cortez did and more and done it more justly and mercifully  true  and here seems as far as little folk dare judge great folk to have been raleighs mistake  he is too wide for real success  he has too many plans he is fond of too many pursuits  the man who succeeds is generally the narrow mall the man of one idea who works at nothing but that sees everything only through the light of that sacrifices everything to that  the fanatic in short  by fanatics whether military commercial or religious and not by liberal minded men at all has the worlds work been done in all ages  amid the modern cants one of the most mistaken is the cant about the mission of genius the mission of the poet  poets we hear in some quarters are the anointed kings of mankindat least so the little poets sing each to his little fiddle  there is no greater mistake  it is the practical prosaical fanatic who does the work and the poet if he tries to do it is certain to put down his spade every five minutes to look at the prospect and pick flowers and moralise on dead asses till he ends a neron malgre luimeme fiddling melodiously while rome is burning  and perhaps this is the secret of raleighs failure  he is a fanatic no doubt a true knighterrant  but he is too much of a poet withal  the sense of beauty enthrals him at every step  glorianas fairy court with its chivalries and its euphuisms its masques and its tourneys and he the most charming personage in it are too charming for himas they would have been for us reader  and he cannot give them up and go about the one work  he justifies his doublemindedness to himself no doubt as he does to the world by working wisely indefatigably and bravely  but still he has put his trust in princes and in the children of men  his sin as far as we can see is not against man but against god one which we do not nowadays call a sin but a weakness  be it so  god punished him for it swiftly and sharply which i hold to be a sure sign that god also forgave him for it  so he stays at home spends sooner or later 40000 pounds on virginia writes charming courtpoetry with oxford buckhurst and paget brings over spenser from ireland and introduces colin clout to gloriana who lovesas who would not have lovedthat most beautiful of faces and of souls helps poor puritan udall out of his scrape as far as he can begs for captain spring begs for many more whose names are only known by being connected with some good deed of his  when sir walter asks queen bess will you cease to be a beggar  when your majesty ceases to be a benefactor  perhaps it is in these days that he set up his office of addresssome sort of agency for discovering and relieving the wants of worthy men  so all seems to go well  if he has lost in virginia he has gained by spanish prizes his winepatent is bringing him in a large revenue and the heavens smile on him  thou sayest i am rich and increased in goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art poor and miserable and blind and naked  thou shalt learn it then and pay dearly for thy lesson  for in the meanwhile raleigh falls into a very great sin for which as usual with his elect god inflicts swift and instant punishment on which as usual biographers talk much unwisdom  he seduces miss throgmorton one of the maids of honour  elizabeth is very wroth and had she not good reason to be wroth  is it either fair or reasonable to talk of her demanding a monopoly of love and being incensed at the temerity of her favourite in presuming to fall in love and marry without her consent  away with such cant the plain facts are  that a man nearly forty years old abuses his wonderful gifts of body and mind to ruin a girl nearly twenty years younger than himself  what wonder if a virtuous womanand queen elizabeth was virtuousthought it a base deed and punished it accordingly  there is no more to be discovered in the matter save by the vulturine nose which smells carrion in every rosebed raleigh has a great attempt on the platefleets in hand he hurries off from chatham and writes to young cecil on the 10th of march i mean not to come away as some say i will for fear of a marriage and i know not what    for i protest before god there is none on the face of the earth that i would be fastened unto  this famous passage is one of those over which the virtuosity of modern times rejoicing in evil has hung so fondly as giving melancholy proof of the duplicity of raleighs character as if a man who once in his life had told an untruth was proved by that fact to be a rogue from birth to death  while others have kindly given him the benefit of a doubt whether the letter were not written after a private marriage and therefore raleigh being joined unto some one already had a right to say that he did not wish to be joined to any one  but i do not concur in this doubt  four months after sir edward stafford writes to anthony bacon if you have anything to do with sir w  r or any love to make to mistress throgmorton at the tower tomorrow you may speak with them  this implies that no marriage had yet taken place  and surely if there had been private marriage two people who were about to be sent to the tower for their folly would have made the marriage public at once as the only possible selfjustification  but it is a pity in my opinion that biographers before pronouncing upon that supposed lie of raleighs had not taken the trouble to find out what the words mean  in their virtuous haste to prove him a liar they have overlooked the fact that the words as they stand are unintelligible and the argument selfcontradictory  he wants to prove we suppose that he does not go to sea for fear of being forced to marry miss throgmorton  it is at least an unexpected method of so doing in a shrewd man like raleigh to say that he wishes to marry no one at all  dont think that i run away for fear of a marriage for i do not wish to marry any one on the face of the earth is a speech which may prove raleigh to have been a fool and we must understand it before we can say that it proves him a rogue  if we had received such a letter from a friend we should have said at once why the man in his hurry and confusion has omitted the word he must have meant to write not there is none on the face of the earth that i would be fastened to but there is none on the face of the earth that i would rather be fastened to which would at once make sense and suit fact  for raleigh not only married miss throgmorton forthwith but made her the best of husbands  my conjectural emendation may go for what it is worth  but that the passage as it stands in murdins state papers the mss i have not seen is either misquoted or mis written by raleigh himself i cannot doubt  he was not one to think nonsense even if he scribbled it  the spanish raid turns out well  raleigh overlooks elizabeths letters of recall till he finds out that the king of spain has stopped the platefleet for fear of his coming and then returns sending on sir john burrough to the azores where he takes the great carack the largest prize 1600 tons which had ever been brought into england  the details of that gallant fight stand in the pages of hakluyt  it raised raleigh once more to wealth though not to favour  shortly after he returns from the sea he finds himself where he deserves to be in the tower where he does more than one thing which brought him no credit  how far we are justified in calling his quarrel with sir george carew his keeper for not letting him disguise himself and get into a pair of oars to ease his mind but with a sight of the queen or his heart would break hypocrisy is a very different matter  honest arthur gorges a staunch friend of raleighs tells the story laughingly and lovingly as if he thought raleigh sincere but somewhat mad  and yet honest gorges has a good right to say a bitter thing for after having been ready to break with laughing at seeing them two brawl and scramble like madmen and sir georges new periwig torn off his crown he sees the iron walking and daggers out and playing the part of him who taketh a dog by the ears purchased such a rap on the knuckles that i wished both their pates broken and so with much ado they staid their brawl to see my bloody fingers and then set to work to abuse the hapless peacemaker  after which things raleigh writes a letter to cecil which is still more offensive in the eyes of virtuous biographershow his heart was never broken till this day when he hears the queen goes so far off whom he followed with love and desire on so many journeys and am now left behind in a dark prison all alone    i that was wont to behold her riding like alexander hunting like diana walking like venus the gentle wind blowing her fair hair about her pure cheeks and so forth in a style in which the vulturine nose must needs scent carrion just because the roses are more fragrant than they should be in a world where all ought to be either vultures or carrion for their dinners as for his despair had he not good reason to be in despair  by his own sin he has hurled himself down the hill which he has so painfully climbed  he is in the towersurely no pleasant or hopeful place for any man  elizabeth is exceedingly wroth with him and what is worse he deserves what he has got  his whole fortune is ventured in an expedition over which he has no control which has been unsuccessful in its first object and which may be altogether unsuccessful in that which it has undertaken as a pisaller and so leave him penniless there want not too those who will trample on the fallen  the deputy has been cruelly distraining on his irish tenants for a supposed debt of his to the queen of 400 pounds for rent which was indeed but fifty marks and which was paid and has carried off 500 milch kine from the poor settlers whom he has planted there and forcibly thrust him out of possession of a castle  moreover the whole irish estates are likely to come to ruin for nothing prevails but rascality among the english soldiers impotence among the governors and rebellion among the natives  three thousand burkes are up in arms his prophecy of this rebellion ten days ago was laughed at and now has come true and altogether walter raleigh and all belonging to him is in as evil case as he ever was on earth  no wonder poor fellow if he behowls himself lustily and not always wisely to cecil and every one else who will listen to him  as for his fine speeches about elizabeth why forget the standing point from which such speeches were made  over and above his present ruin it was and ought to have been an utterly horrible and unbearable thing to raleigh or any man to have fallen into disgrace with elizabeth by his own fault  he feels and perhaps rightly that he is as it were excommunicated from england and the mission and the glory of england  instead of being as he was till now one of a body of brave men working together in one great common cause he has cut himself off from the congregation by his own selfish lust and there he is left alone with his shame  we must try to realise to ourselves the way in which such men as raleigh looked not only at elizabeth but at all the world  there was in plain palpable fact something about the queen her history her policy the times the glorious part which england and she as the incarnation of the then english spirit were playing upon earth which raised imaginative and heroical souls into a permanent exaltationa fairyland as they called it themselves which seems to us fantastic and would be fantastic in us because we are not at their work or in their days there can be no doubt that a number of as noble men as ever stood together on the earth did worship that woman fight for her toil for her risk all for her with a pure chivalrous affection which has furnished one of the most beautiful pages in all the book of history blots there must needs have been and inconsistencies selfishnesses follies for they too were men of like passions with ourselves but let us look at the fair vision as a whole and thank god that such a thing has for once existed even imperfectly on this sinful earth instead of playing the part of ham and falling under his cursethe penalty of slavishness cowardice loss of noble daring which surely falls on any generation which is banausos to use aristotles word which rejoices in its forefathers shame and unable to believe in the nobleness of others is unable to become noble itself  as for the alexander and diana affectations they were the language of the time  and certainly this generation has no reason to find fault with them or with a good deal more of the affectations and flattery of elizabethan times while it listens complacently night after night to honourable members complimenting not queen elizabeth but sir jabesh windbag fiddle faddle redtape and party with protestations of deepest respect and fullest confidence in the very speeches in which they bring accusations of every offence short of high treasonto be understood of course in a parliamentary sense as mr pickwicks were in a pickwickian one if a generation of knoxes and mortons burleighs and raleighs shall ever arise again one wonders by what name they will call the parliamentary morality and parliamentary courtesy of a generation which has meted out such measure to their ancestors failings  but queen elizabeth was an old woman then  i thank the objector even for that then for it is much nowadays to find any one who believes that queen elizabeth was ever young or who does not talk of her as if she was born about seventy years of age covered with rouge and wrinkles  i will undertake to say that as to the beauty of this woman there is a greater mass of testimony and from the very best judges too than there is of the beauty of any personage in history and yet it has become the fashion now to deny even that  the plain facts seem that she was very graceful active accomplished in all outward manners of a perfect figure and of that style of intellectual beauty depending on expression which attracted and we trust always will attract britons far more than that merely sensuous loveliness in which no doubt mary stuart far surpassed her  and there seems little doubt that like many englishwomen she retained her beauty to a very late period in life not to mention that she was in 1592 just at that age of rejuvenescence which makes many a woman more lovely at sixty than she has been since she was thirty five  no doubt too she used every artificial means to preserve her famous complexion and quite right she was  this beauty of hers had been a talent as all beauty is committed to her by god it had been an important element in her great success men had accepted it as what beauty of form and expression generally is an outward and visible sign of the inward and spiritual grace and while the inward was unchanged what wonder if she tried to preserve the outward  if she was the same why should she not try to look the same  and what blame to those who worshipped her if knowing that she was the same they too should fancy that she looked the same the elizabeth of their youth and should talk as if the fair flesh as well as the fair spirit was immortal  does not every loving husband do so when he forgets the gray hair and the sunken cheek and all the wastes of time and sees the partner of many joys and sorrows not as she has become but as she was ay and is to him and will be to him he trusts through all eternity  there is no feeling in these elizabethan worshippers which we have not seen potential and crude again and again in the best and noblest of young men whom we have met till it was crushed in them by the luxury effeminacy and unbelief in chivalry which are the sure accompaniment of a long peace which war may burn up with beneficent fire  but we must hasten on now for raleigh is out of prison in september and by the next spring in parliament speaking wisely and well especially on his fixed idea war with spain which he is rewarded for forthwith in father parsons andreae philopatris responsio by a charge of founding a school of atheism for the corruption of young gentlemen a charge which lord chiefjustice popham protestant as he is will find it useful one day to recollect  elizabeth however now that raleigh has married the fair throgmorton and done wisely in other matters restores him to favour  if he has sinned he has suffered  but he is as useful as ever now that his senses have returned to him and he is making good speeches in parliament instead of bad ones to weak maidens so we find him once more in favour and possessor of sherborne manor where he builds and beautifies with groves and gardens of much variety and great delight  and god too seems to have forgiven him perhaps has forgiven for there the fair throgmorton brings him a noble boy  ut sis vitalis metuo puer  raleigh will quote davids example one day not wisely or well  does davids example ever cross him now and those sad wordsthe lord hath put away thy sin    nevertheless the child that is born unto thee shall die  let that be as it may all is sunshine once more  sherborne manor a rich share in the great carack a beautiful wife a child what more does this man want to make him happy  why should he not settle down upon his lees like ninetynine out of the hundred or at least try a peaceful and easy path toward more praise and pudding  the world answers or his biographers answer for him that he needs to reinstate himself in his mistresss affection which is true or not according as we take it  if they mean thereby as most seem to mean that it was a mere selfish and ambitious scheme by which to wriggle into court favour once morewhy let them mean it  i shall only observe that the method which raleigh took was a rather more dangerous and selfsacrificing one than courtiers are wont to take but if it be meant that walter raleigh spoke somewhat thus with himselfi have done a base and dirty deed and have been punished for it  i have hurt the good name of a sweet woman who loves me and whom i find to be a treasure and god instead of punishing me by taking her from me has rendered me good for evil by giving her to me  i have justly offended a mistress whom i worship and who after having shown her just indignation has returned me good for evil by giving me these fair lands of sherborne and only forbid me her presence till the scandal has passed away  she sees and rewards my good in spite of my evil and i too know that i am better than i have seemed that i am fit for nobler deeds than seducing maids of honour  how can i prove that  how can i redeem my lost name for patriotism and public daring  how can i win glory for my wife seek that men shall forget her past shame in the thought she is walter raleighs wife  how can i show my mistress that i loved her all along that i acknowledge her bounty her mingled justice and mercy how can i render to god for all the benefits which he has done unto me  how can i do a deed the like of which was never done in england  if all this had passed through walter raleighs mind what could we say of it but that it was the natural and rational feeling of an honourable and righthearted man burning to rise to the level which he knew ought to be his because he knew that he had fallen below it and what right better way of testifying these feelings than to do what as we shall see raleigh did  what right have we to impute to him lower motives than these while we confess that these righteous and noble motives would have been natural and rationalindeed just what we flatter ourselves that we should have felt in his place  of course in his grand scheme the thought came in and i shall win to myself honour and glory and wealthof course  and pray sir does it not come in in your grand schemes and yours and yours  if you made a fortune tomorrow by some wisely and benevolently managed factory would you forbid all speech of the said wisdom and benevolence because you had intended that wisdom and benevolence should pay you a good percentage  away with cant and let him that is without sin among you cast the first stone  so raleigh hits upon a noble project a desperate one true  but he will do it or die  he will leave pleasant sherborne and the bosom of the beautiful bride and the firstborn son and all which to most makes life worth having and which raleigh enjoys more intensely than most men for he is a poet and a man of strong nervous passions withal  but    i could not love thee dear so much loved i not honour more   and he will go forth to endure heat hunger fever danger of death in battle danger of the inquisition rack and stake in search of el dorado  what so strange in that  i have known half a dozen men who in his case and conscious of his powers would have done the same from the same noble motive  he begins prudently and sends a devonshire man captain whiddon probably one of the whiddons of beautiful chagfordto spy out the orinoco  he finds that the spaniards are there already that berreo who has attempted el dorado from the westward starting from new granada and going down the rivers is trying to settle on the orinoco mouth that he is hanging the poor natives encouraging the caribs to hunt them and sell them for slaves imprisoning the caciques to extort their gold torturing ravishing kidnapping and conducting himself as was usual among spaniards of those days  raleighs spirit is stirred within him  if uncle toms cabin fiction as it is once excited us how must a far worse reality have excited raleigh as he remembered that these spaniards are as yet triumphant in iniquity and as he remembered too that these same men are the sworn foes of england her liberty her bible and her queen  what a deed to be beforehand with them for once  to dispossess them of one corner of that western world where they have left no trace but blood and flame  he will go himself  he will find el dorado and its golden emperor and instead of conquering plundering and murdering him as cortez did montezuma and pizarro atahuallpa he will show him english strength espouse his quarrel against the spaniards make him glad to become queen elizabeths vassal tributary perhaps leave him a bodyguard of english veterans perhaps colonise his country and so at once avenge and protect the oppressed indians and fill the queens treasury with the riches of a land equal if not superior to peru and mexico  such is his dream vague perhaps  but far less vague than those with which cortez and pizarro started and succeeded  after a careful survey of the whole matter i must give it as my deliberate opinion that raleigh was more reasonable in his attempt and had more fair evidence of its feasibility than either cortez or pizarro had for theirs  it is a bold assertion  if any reader doubts its truth he cannot do better than to read the whole of the documents connected with the two successful and the one unsuccessful attempts at finding a golden kingdom  let them read first prescotts conquests of mexico and peru and then schomburgks edition of raleighs guiana  they will at least confess when they have finished that truth is stranger than fiction  of raleighs credulity in believing in el dorado much has been said i am sorry to find even so wise a man as sir robert schomburgk after bearing good testimony to raleighs wonderful accuracy about all matters which he had an opportunity of observing using this term of credulity  i must dare to differ on that point even with sir robert and ask by what right the word is used  first raleigh says nothing about el dorado as every one is forced to confess but what spaniard on spaniard had been saying for fifty years  therefore the blame of credulity ought to rest with the spaniards from philip von huten orellano and george of spires upward to berreo  but it rests really with no one  for nothing if we will examine the documents is told of the riches of el dorado which had not been found to be true and seen by the eyes of men still living in peru and mexico not onefifth of america had been explored and already two el dorados had been found and conquered  what more rational than to suppose that there was a third a fourth a fifth in the remaining fourfifths  the reports of el dorado among the savages were just of the same kind as those by which cortez and pizarro hunted out mexico and peru saving that they were far more widely spread and confirmed by a succession of adventurers  i entreat readers to examine this matter in raleigh schomburgk humboldt and condamine and judge for themselves  as for humes accusations i pass them by as equally silly and shameless only saying for the benefit of readers that they have been refuted completely by every one who has written since humes days and to those who are inclined to laugh at raleigh for believing in amazons and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders i can only answer thus   about the amazons raleigh told what he was told what the spaniards who went before him and condamine who came after him were told humboldt thinks the story possibly founded on fact and i must say that after reviewing all that has been said thereon it does seem to me the simplest solution of the matter just to believe it true to believe that there was about his time or a little before somewhere about the upper orinoco a warlike community of women  humboldt shows how likely such would be to spring up where women flee from their male tyrants into the forests  as for the fable which connected them with the lake manoa and the city of el dorado we can only answer if not true there and then it is true elsewhere now for the amazonian guards of the king of dahomey at this moment as all know surpass in strangeness and in ferocity all that has been reported of the orinocquan viragos and thus prove once more that truth is stranger than fiction 3  besideand here i stand stubborn regardless of gibes and sneersit is not yet proven that there was not in the sixteenth century some rich and civilised kingdom like peru or mexico in the interior of south america  sir robert schomburgk has disproved the existence of lake parima but it will take a long time and more explorers than one to prove that there are no ruins of ancient cities such as stephens stumbled on in yucatan still buried in the depths of the forest  fifty years of ruin would suffice to wrap them in a leafy veil which would hide them from every one who did not literally run against them  tribes would die out or change place as the atures and other great nations have done in those parts and every traditional record of them perish gradually for it is only gradually and lately that it has perished  while if it be asked what has become of the people themselves the answer is that when any race like most of the american races in the sixteenth century is in a dying state it hardly needs war to thin it down and reduce the remnant to savagery  greater nations than el dorado was even supposed to be have vanished ere now and left not a trace behind and so may they  but enough of this  i leave the quarrel to that honest and patient warder of tourneys old time who will surely do right at last and go on to the dogheaded worthies without necks and long hair hanging down behind who as a cacique told raleigh that they had of late years slain many hundreds of his fathers people and in whom even humboldt was not always allowed he says to disbelieve so much for humes scoff at raleigh as a liar one old cacique boasting to him that he had seen them with his own eyes humboldts explanation is that the caribs being the cleverest and strongest indians are also the most imaginative and therefore being fallen children of adam the greatest liars and that they invented both el dorado and the dogheads out of pure wickedness  be it so  but all lies crystallise round some nucleus of truth and it really seems to me nothing very wonderful if the story should be on the whole true and these worthies were in the habit of dressing themselves up like foolish savages as they were in the skins of the aguara dog with what not of stuffing and tails and so forth in order to astonish the weak minds of the caribs just as the red indians dress up in their feasts as bears wolves and deer with foxtails false bustles of bison skin and so forth  there are plenty of traces of such foolish attempts at playing bogy in the history of savages even of our own teutonic forefathers and this i suspect to be the simple explanation of the whole mares nest  as for raleigh being a fool for believing it the reasons he gives for believing it are very rational the reasons hume gives for calling him a fool rest merely on the storys being strange  on which grounds one might disbelieve most matters in heaven and earth from ones own existence to what one sees in every drop of water under the microscope yea to the growth of every seed  the only sound proof that dogheaded men are impossible is to be found in comparative anatomy a science of which hume knew no more than raleigh and which for one marvel it has destroyed has revealed a hundred  i do not doubt that if raleigh had seen and described a kangaroo especially its all but miraculous process of gestation hume would have called that a lie also but i will waste no more time in proving that no man is so credulous as the unbelieverthe man who has such mighty and worldembracing faith in himself that he makes his own little brain the measure of the universe  let the dead bury their dead  raleigh sails for guiana  the details of his voyage should be read at length  everywhere they show the eye of a poet as well as of a man of science  he sees enough to excite his hopes more wildly than ever he goes hundreds of miles up the orinoco in an open boat suffering every misery but keeping up the hearts of his men who cry out let us go on we care not how far  he makes friendship with the caciques and enters into alliance with them on behalf of queen elizabeth against the spaniards  unable to pass the falls of the caroli and the rainy season drawing on he returns beloved and honoured by all the indians boasting that during the whole time he was there no woman was the worse for any man of his crew altogether we know few episodes of history so noble righteous and merciful as this guiana voyage  but he has not forgotten the spaniards  at trinidad he payed his ships with the asphalt of the famous pitchlake and stoodand with what awe such a man must have stoodbeneath the noble forest of moriche fanpalms on its brink he then attacked not by his own confession without something too like treachery the new town of san jose takes berreo prisoner and delivers from captivity five caciques whom berreo kept bound in one chain basting their bodies with burning baconan old trick of the conquistadoresto make them discover their gold  he tells them that he was the servant of a queen who was the greatest cacique of the north and a virgin who had more caciqui under her than there were trees on that island that she was an enemy of the castellani spaniards in behalf of their tyranny and oppression and that she delivered all such nations about her as were by them oppressed and having freed all the coast of the northern world from their servitude had sent me to free them also and withal to defend the country of guiana from their invasion and conquest  after which perfectly true and rational speech he subjoins as we think equally honestly and rationally i showed them her majestys picture which they so admired and honoured as it had been easy to have brought them idolaters thereof  this is one of the stock charges against raleigh at which all biographers except quiet sensible oldys who dull as he is is far more fair and rational than most of his successors break into virtuous shrieks of flattery meanness adulation courtiership and so forth  one biographer is of opinion that the indians would have admired far more the picture of a red monkey sir robert schomburgk unfortunately for the red monkey theory though he quite agrees that raleighs flattery was very shocking says that from what he knowsand no man knows moreof indian taste they would have far preferred to the portrait which raleigh showed themnot a red monkey butsuch a picture as that at hampton court in which elizabeth is represented in a fantastic court dress raleigh it seems must be made out a rogue at all risks though by the most opposite charges  the monkey theory is answered however by sir robert and sir robert is answered i think by the plain fact that of course raleighs portrait was exactly such a one as sir robert says they would have admired a picture probably in a tawdry frame representing queen bess just as queens were always painted then bedizened with browches pearls and owches satin and ruff and probably with crown on head and sceptre in hand made up as likely as not expressly for the purpose for which it was used  in the name of all simplicity and honesty i ask why is raleigh to be accused of saying that the indians admired queen elizabeths beauty when he never even hints at it  and why do all commentators deliberately forget the preceding paragraphraleighs proclamation to the indians and the circumstances under which it was spoken  the indians are being murdered ravished sold for slaves basted with burning fat and grand white men come like avenging angels and in one day sweep their tyrants out of the land restore them to liberty and life and say to them a great queen far across the seas has sent us to do this  thousands of miles away she has heard of your misery and taken pity on you and if you will be faithful to her she will love you and deal justly with you and protect you against these spaniards who are devouring you as they have devoured all the indians round you and for a token of ita sign that we tell you truth and that there is really such a great queen who is the indians friendhere is the picture of her  what wonder if the poor idolatrous creatures had fallen down and worshipped the picture just as millions do that of the virgin mary without a thousandth part as sound and practical reasonas that of a divine allknowing allmerciful deliverer  as for its being the picture of a beautiful woman or not they would never think of that  the fair complexion and golden hair would be a sign to them that she belonged to the mighty white people even if there were no bedizenment of jewels and crowns over and above and that would be enough for them  when will biographers learn to do common justice to their fellowmen by exerting now and then some small amount of dramatic imagination just sufficient to put themselves for a moment in the place of those of whom they write  so ends his voyage in which he says from myself i have deserved no thanks for i am returned a beggar and withered  the only thing which as far as i can find he brought home was some of the delicious scaly peaches of the moriche palmthe arbol de vida or tree of life which gives sustenance and all else needful to whole tribes of indians  but i might have bettered my poor estate if i had not only respected her majestys future honour and riches  it became not the former fortune in which i once lived to go journeys of piccory pillage and it had sorted ill with the offices of honour which by her majestys grace i hold this day in england to run from cape to cape and place to place for the pillage of ordinary prizes  so speaks one whom it has been the fashion to consider as little better than a pirate and that too in days when the noblest blood in england thought no shame as indeed it was no shame to enrich themselves with spanish gold  but so it is throughout this mans life  if there be a nobler word than usual to be spoken or a more wise word either if there be a more chivalrous deed to be done or a more prudent deed either that word and that deed are pretty sure to be walter raleighs  but the blatant beast has been busy at home and in spite of chapmans heroical verses he meets with little but cold looks never mind  if the world will not help to do the deed he will do it by himself and no time must be lost for the spaniards on their part will lose none  so after six months the faithful keymis sails again again helped by the lord high admiral and sir robert cecil it is a hard race for one private man against the whole power and wealth of spain and the spaniard has been beforehand with them and reoccupied the country  they have fortified themselves at the mouth of the caroli so it is impossible to get to the gold mines they are enslaving the wretched indians carrying off their women intending to transplant some tribes and to expel others and arming cannibal tribes against the inhabitants  all is misery and rapine the scattered remnant comes asking piteously why raleigh does not come over to deliver them  have the spaniards slain him too  keymis comforts them as he best can hears of more gold mines and gets back safe a little to his own astonishment for eightandtwenty ships of war have been sent to trinidad to guard the entrance to el dorado not surely as keymis well says to keep us only from tobacco  a colony of 500 persons is expected from spain  the spaniard is well aware of the richness of the prize says keymis who all through shows himself a worthy pupil of his master  a careful observant man he seems to have been trained by that great example to overlook no fact even the smallest  he brings home lists of rivers towns caciques poisonherbs words what not he has fresh news of gold spleenstones kidneystones and some fresh specimens but be that as it may he without going as far as his eyes can warrant can promise brazilwood honey cotton balsamum and drugs to defray charges  he would fain copy raleighs style too and whence his lamp had oil borrow light also seasoning his unsavoury speech with some of the leaven of raleighs discourse  which indeed he does even to little pedantries and attempts at classicality and after professing that himself and the remnant of his few years he hath bequeathed wholly to raleana and his thoughts live only in that action he rises into something like grandeur when he begins to speak of that everfertile subject the spanish cruelties to the indians doth not the cry of the poor succourless ascend unto the heavens hath god forgotten to be gracious to the work of his own hands  or shall not his judgments in a day of visitation by the ministry of his chosen servant come upon these bloodthirsty butchers like rain into a fleece of wool  poor keymis  to us he is by no means the least beautiful figure in this romance a faithful diligent loving man unable as the event proved to do great deeds by himself but inspired with a great idea by contact with a mightier spirit to whom he clings through evil report and poverty and prison careless of self to the last and ends tragically faithful unto death in the most awful sense  but here remark two things  first that cecil believes in raleighs guiana scheme next that the occupation of orinoco by the spaniards which raleigh is accused of having concealed from james in 1617 has been ever since 1595 matter of the most public notoriety  raleigh has not been idle in the meanwhile  it has been found necessary after all to take the counsel which he gave in vain in 1588 to burn the spanish fleet in harbour and the heroes are gone down to cadiz fight and in one day of thunder storm the sevastopol of spain  here as usual we find raleigh though in an inferior command leading the whole by virtue of superior wisdom  when the good lord admiral will needs be cautious and land the soldiers first it is raleigh who persuades him to force his way into the harbour to the joy of all captains  when hotheaded essex casting his hat into the sea for joy shouts intramos and will in at once raleighs time for caution comes and he persuades them to wait till the next morning and arrange the order of attack  that too raleigh has to do and moreover to lead it and lead it he does under the forts are seventeen galleys the channel is scoured with cannon  but on holds raleighs warspite far ahead of the rest through the thickest of the fire answering forts and galleys with a blur of the trumpet to each piece disdaining to shoot at those esteemed dreadful monsters  for there is a nobler enemy ahead right in front lie the galleons and among them the philip and the andrew two of those who boarded the revenge  this day there shall be a reckoning for the blood of his old friend he is resolved to be revenged for the revenge sir richard grenviles fatal ship or second her with his own life and well he keeps his vow  three hours pass of desperate valour during which so narrow is the passage only seven english ships thrusting past each other all but quarrelling in their noble rivalry engage the whole spanish fleet of fiftyseven sail and destroy it utterly  the philip and thomas burn themselves despairing  the english boats save the andrew and matthew  one passes over the hideous record  if any man says raleigh had a desire to see hell itself it was there most lively figured  keymiss prayer is answered in part even while he writes it and the cry of the indians has not ascended in vain before the throne of god  the soldiers are landed the city stormed and sacked not without mercies and courtesies though to women and unarmed folk which win the hearts of the vanquished and live till this day in wellknown ballads  the flemings begin a merciless slaughter  raleigh and the lord admiral beat them off  raleigh is carried on shore with a splinter wound in the leg which lames him for life  but returns on board in an hour in agony for there is no admiral left to order the fleet and all are run headlong to the sack  in vain he attempts to get together sailors the following morning and attack the indian fleet in porto real roads within twentyfour hours it is burnt by the spaniards themselves and all raleigh wins is no booty a lame leg and the honour of having been the real author of a victory even more glorious than that of 1588  so he returns having written to cecil the highest praises of essex whom he treats with all courtesy and fairness which those who will may call cunning  we have as good a right to say that he was returning good for evil  there were noble qualities in essex  all the world gave him credit for them and far more than he deserved why should not raleigh have been just to him even have conceived like the rest of the world high hopes of him till he himself destroyed these hopes  for now storms are rising fast  on their return cecil is in power  he has been made secretary of state instead of bodley essexs pet and the spoilt child begins to sulk on which matter i am sorry to say historians talk much unwisdom about essexs being too open and generous etc for a courtier and presuming on his mistresss passion for him and representing elizabeth as desiring to be thought beautiful and affecting at sixty the sighs loves tears and tastes of a girl of sixteen and so forth  it is really time to get rid of some of this fulsome talk culled from such triflers as osborne if not from the darker and fouler sources of parsons and the jesuit slanderers which i meet with a flat denial  there is simply no proof  she in love with essex or cecil  yes as a mother with a son  were they not the children of her dearest and most faithful servants men who had lived heroic lives for her sake  what wonder if she fancied that she saw the fathers in the sons  they had been trained under her eye  what wonder if she fancied that they could work as their fathers worked before them  and what shame if her childless heart yearned over them with unspeakable affection and longed in her old age to lay her hands upon the shoulders of those two young men and say to england behold the children which god and not the flesh has given me most strange it is too that women who ought at least to know a womans heart have been especially forward in publishing these scandals and sullying their pages by retailing pruriences against such a one as queen elizabeth  but to return  raleigh attaches himself to cecil and he has good reason  cecil is the cleverest man in england saving himself  he has trusted and helped him too in two guiana voyages so the connection is one of gratitude as well as prudence  we know not whether he helped him in the third guiana voyage in the same year under captain berry a north devon man from grenviles country who found a mighty folk who were something pleasant having drunk much that day and carried bows with golden handles  but failed in finding the lake parima and so came home  raleighs first use of his friendship with cecil is to reconcile him to the astonishment of the world with essex alleging how much good may grow by it for now the queens continual unquietness will grow to contentment  that too those who will may call policy  we have as good a right to call it the act of a wise and faithful subject and to say blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god  he has his reward for it in full restoration to the queens favour he deserves it  he proves himself once more worthy of power and it is given to him  then there is to be a second great expedition  but this time its aim is the azores philip only maddened by the loss at cadiz is preparing a third armament for the invasion of england and ireland and it is said to lie at the islands to protect the indian fleet  raleigh has the victualling of the landforces and like everything else he takes in hand it is very well done  lord howard declines the chief command and it is given to essex  raleigh is to be rearadmiral  by the time they reach the azores essex has got up a foolish quarrel against raleigh for disrespect in having stayed behind to bring up some stragglers  but when no armada is to be found at the azores essex has after all to ask raleigh what he shall do next  conquer the azores says raleigh and the thing is agreed on  raleigh and essex are to attack fayal  essex sails away before raleigh has watered  raleigh follows as fast as he can and at fayal finds no essex  he must water there then and at once  his own veterans want him to attack forthwith for the spaniards are fortifying fast  but he will wait for essex  still no essex comes  raleigh attempts to water is defied finds himself in for it and takes the island out of hand in the most masterly fashion to the infuriation of essex good lord howard patches up the matter and the hotheaded coxcomb is once more pacified  they go on to graciosa where essexs weakness of will again comes out and he does not take the island  three rich caracks however are picked up  though we shall be little the better for them says raleigh privately to sir arthur gorges his faithful captain yet i am heartily glad for our generals sake because they will in great measure give content to her majesty so that there may be no repining against this poor lord for the expense of the voyage  raleigh begins to see that essex is only to be pitied that the voyage is not over likely to end well  but he takes it in spite of illusage as a kindhearted man should  again essex makes a fool of himself  they are to steer one way in order to intercept the plate fleet  essex having agreed to the course pointed out alters his course on a fancy then alters it a second time though the hapless monson with the whole platefleet in sight is hanging out lights firing guns and shrieking vainly for the general who is gone on a new course in which he might have caught the fleet after all in spite of his two mistakes but that he chooses to go a roundabout way instead of a short one and away goes the whole fleet save one carack which runs itself on shore and burns and the game is played out and lost  all want essex to go home as the season is getting late  but the wilful and weak man will linger still and while he is hovering to the south philips armament has sailed from the groyne on the undefended shores of england and only gods hand saves us from the effects of essexs folly  a third time the armadas of spain are overwhelmed by the avenging tempests and essex returns to disgrace having proved himself at once intemperate and incapable  even in coming home there is confusion and essex is all but lost on the bishop and clerks by scilly in spite of the warnings of raleighs sailingmaster old broadbent who is so exasperated at the general stupidity that he wants raleigh to leave essex and his squadron to get out of their own scrape as they can  essex goes off to sulk at wanstead but vere excuses him and in a few days he comes back and will needs fight good lord howard for being made earl of nottingham for his services against the armada and at cadiz  baulked of this he begins laying the blame of the failure at the azores on raleigh  let the spoilt naughty boy take care even that admirable temper for which raleigh is famed may be worn out at last  these years are raleighs noonstormy enough at best yet brilliant there is a pomp about him outward and inward which is terrible to others dangerous to himself  one has gorgeous glimpses of that grand durham house of his with its carvings and its antique marbles armorial escutcheons beds with green silk hangings and legs like dolphins overlaid with gold  and the man himself tall beautiful and graceful perfect alike in body and in mind walking to and fro his beautiful wife upon his arm his noble boy beside his knee in his white satin doublet embroidered with pearls and a great chain of pearls about his neck lording it among the lords with an awfulness and ascendency above other mortals for which men say that his naeve is that he is damnable proud and no wonder  the reduced squires younger son has gone forth to conquer the world and he fancies poor fool that he has conquered it just as it really has conquered him and he will stand now on his blood and his pedigree no bad one either and all the more stiffly because puppies like lord oxford who instead of making their fortunes have squandered them call him jack and upstart and make impertinent faces while the queen is playing the virginals about how when jacks go up heads go down  proud  no wonder if the man be proud  is not this great babylon which i have built  and yet all the while he has the most affecting consciousness that all this is not gods will but the will of the flesh that the house of fame is not the house of god that its floor is not the rock of ages but the sea of glass mingled with fire which may crack beneath him any moment and let the nether flame burst up  he knows that he is living in a splendid lie that he is not what god meant him to be  he longs to flee away and be at peace  it is to this period not to his death hour that the lie belongs 4 saddest of poems with its melodious contempt and lifeweariness  all is a liecourt church statesmen courtiers wit and science town and country all are shams the days are evil the canker is at the root of all things the old heroes are dying one by one the elizabethan age is rotting down as all human things do and nothing is left but to bewail with spenser the ruins of time the glory and virtue which have been the greater glory and virtue which might be even now if men would but arise and repent and work righteousness as their fathers did before them  but no  even to such a world as this he will cling and flaunt it about as captain of the guard in the queens progresses and masques and pageants with swordbelt studded with diamonds and rubies or at tournaments in armour of solid silver and a gallant train with orangetawny feathers provoking essex to bring in a far larger train in the same colours and swallow up raleighs pomp in his own so achieving that famous feather triumph by which he gains little but bad blood and a good jest  for essex is no better tilter than he is general and having run very ill in his orangetawny comes next day in green and runs still worse and yet is seen to be the same cavalier whereon a spectator shrewdly observes that he changed his colours that it may be reported that there was one in green who ran worse than he in orangetawny  but enough of these toys while gods handwriting is upon the wall above all heads  raleigh knows that the handwriting is there  the spirit which drove him forth to virginia and guiana is fallen asleep  but he longs for sherborne and quiet country life and escapes thither during essexs imprisonment taking cecils son with him and writes as only he can write about the shepherds peaceful joys contrasted with courts and masques and proud towers       here are no false entrapping baits    too hasty for too hasty fates       unless it be       the fond credulity of silly fish that worlding who still look upon the bait but never on the hook       nor envy unless among    the birds for prize of their sweet song     go let the diving negro seek    for pearls hid in some forlorn creek       we all pearls scorn       save what the dewy morn congeals upon some little spire of grass which careless shepherds beat down as they pass       and gold neer here appears    save what the yellow ceres bears   tragic enough are the after scenes of raleighs life  but most tragic of all are these scenes of vainglory in which he sees the better part and yet chooses the worse and pours out his self discontent in song which proves the fount of delicacy and beauty which lies pure and bright beneath the gaudy artificial crust  what might not this man have been  and he knows that too  the stately rooms of durham house pall on him and he delights to hide up in his little study among his books and his chemical experiments and smoke his silver pipe and look out on the clear thames and the green surrey hills and dream about guiana and the tropics or to sit in the society of antiquaries with selden and cotton camden and stow or in his own mermaid club with ben jonson fletcher beaumont and at last with shakspeares self to hear and utter      words that have been so nimble and so full of subtle flame as if that every one from whom they came had meant to put his whole wit in a jest   anything to forget the handwriting on the wall which will not be forgotten  but he will do all the good which he can meanwhile nevertheless  he will serve god and mammon  so complete a man will surely be able to do both  unfortunately the thing is impossible as he discovers too late  but he certainly goes as near success in the attempt as ever man did  everywhere we find him doing justly and loving mercy  wherever this man steps he leaves his footprint ineffaceably in deeds of benevolence  for one year only it seems he is governor of jersey yet to this day it is said the islanders honour his name only second to that of duke rollo as their great benefactor the founder of their newfoundland trade  in the west country he is as a king with ears and mouth always open to hear and deliver their grievances feet and hands ready to go and work their redress  the tinmerchants have become usurers of fifty in the hundred  raleigh works till he has put down their abominable and cutthroat dealing  there is a burdensome westcountry tax on curing fish raleigh works till it is revoked  in parliament he is busy with liberal measures always before his generation  he puts down a foolish act for compulsory sowing of hemp in a speech on the freedom of labour worthy of the nineteenth century  he argues against raising the subsidy from the threepound mencall you this mr francis bacon par jugum when a poor man pays as much as a rich  he is equally rational and spirited against the exportation of ordnance to the enemy and when the question of abolishing monopolies is mooted he has his wise word  he too is a monopolist of tin as lord warden of the stannaries  but he has so wrought as to bring good out of evil for before the granting of his patent let the price of tin be never so high the poor workman never had but two shillings a week yet now so has he extended and organised the tin works that any man who will can find work be tin at what price soever and have four shillings a week truly paid    yet if all others may be repealed i will give my consent as freely to the cancelling of this as any member of this house  most of the monopolies were repealed  but we do not find that raleighs was among them  why should it be if its issue was more tin full work and double wages  in all things this man approves himself faithful in his generation  his sins are not against man but against god such as the world thinks no sins and hates them not from morality but from envy  in the meanwhile the evil which so spenser had prophesied only waited raleighs death breaks out in his absence and ireland is all aflame with tyrones rebellion  raleigh is sent for  he will not accept the post of lord deputy and go to put it down  perhaps he does not expect fair play as long as essex is at home  perhaps he knows too much of the common weal or rather common woe and thinks that what is crooked cannot be made straight  perhaps he is afraid to lose by absence his ground at court  would that he had gone for irelands sake and his own  however it must not be  ormond is recalled and knollys shall be sent  but essex will have none but sir george carew whom naunton says he hates and wishes to oust from court  he and elizabeth argue it out  he turns his back on her and she gives himor does not give him for one has found so many of these racy anecdotes vanish on inspection into simple wind that one believes none of thema box on the ear which if she did she did the most wise just and practical thing which she could do with such a puppy  he claps his handor does notto his sword he would not have taken it from henry viii and is turned out forthwith  in vain egerton the lord keeper tries to bring him to reason  he storms insanely  every one on earth is wrong but he every one is conspiring against him he talks of solomons fool too  had he read the proverbs a little more closely he might have left the said fool alone as being a too painfully exact likeness of himself  it ends by his being worsted and raleigh rising higher than ever  i cannot see why raleigh should be represented as henceforth becoming essexs avowed enemy save on the ground that all good men are and ought to be the enemies of bad men when they see them about to do harm and to ruin the country  essex is one of the many persons upon whom this age has lavished a quantity of sentimentality which suits oddly enough with its professions of impartiality  but there is an impartiality which ends in utter injustice which by saying carelessly to every quarrel both are right and both are wrong leaves only the impression that all men are wrong and ends by being unjust to every one  so has elizabeth and essexs quarrel been treated  there was some evil in essex therefore elizabeth was a fool for liking him  there was some good in essex therefore elizabeth was cruel in punishing him  this is the sort of slipshod dilemma by which elizabeth is proved to be wrong even while essex is confessed to be wrong too while the patent facts of the case are that elizabeth bore with him as long as she could and a great deal longer than any one else could  why raleigh should be accused of helping to send essex into ireland i do not know  camden confesses at the same time that he gives a hint of the kind that essex would let no one go but himself  and if this was his humour one can hardly wonder at cecil and raleigh as well as elizabeth bidding the man begone and try his hand at government and be filled with the fruit of his own devices  he goes does nothing or rather worse than nothing for in addition to the notorious illmanagement of the whole matter we may fairly say that he killed elizabeth  she never held up her head again after tyrones rebellion  elizabeth still clings to him changing her mind about him every hour and at last writes him such a letter as he deserves  he has had power money men such as no one ever had before  why has he done nothing but bring england to shame  he comes home franticallythe story of his bursting into the dressingroom rests on no good authoritywith a party of friends at his heels leaving ireland to take care of itself  whatever entertainment he met with from the fond old woman he met with the coldness which he deserved from raleigh and cecil who can wonder  what had he done to deserve aught else  but he all but conquers and raleigh takes to his bed in consequence sick of the whole matter as one would have been inclined to do oneself  he is examined and arraigned writes a maudlin letter to elizabeth elizabeth has been called a fool for listening to such pathetical love letters  and then hardhearted for not listening to them poor lady do what she would she found it hard enough to please all parties while alive must she be condemned over and above in aeternum to be wrong whatsoever she did  why is she not to have the benefit of the plain straightforward interpretation which would be allowed to any other human being namely that she approved of such fine talk as long as it was proved to be sincere by fine deeds  but that when these were wanting the fine talk became hollow fulsome a fresh cause of anger and disgust  yet still she weeps over essex when he falls sick as any mother would and would visit him if she could with honour  but a malignant influence counteracts every disposition to relent  no doubt a mans own folly passion and insolence has generally a very malignant influence on his fortunes and he may consider himself a very happy man if all that befalls to him thereby is what befell essex namely deprivation of his offices and imprisonment in his own house  he is forgiven after all but the spoilt child refuses his bread and butter without sugar  what is the pardon to him without a renewal of his licence of sweet wines because he is not to have that the queens conditions are as crooked as her carcase  flesh and blood can stand no more and ought to stand no more  after all that elizabeth has been to him that speech is the speech of a brutal and ungrateful nature  and such he shows himself to be in the hour of trial  what if the patent for sweet wines is refused him  such gifts were meant as the reward of merit and what merit has he to show  he never thinks of that blind with fury he begins to intrigue with james and slanders to him under colour of helping his succession all whom he fancies opposed to him  what is worse he intrigues with tyrone about bringing over an army of irish papists to help him against the queen and this at the very time that his sole claim to popularity rests on his being the leader of the puritans  a man must have been very far gone either in baseness or in hatred who represents raleigh to james as dangerous to the commonweal on account of his great power in the west of england and jersey places fit for the spaniard to land in  cobham as warden of the cinque ports is included in his slander and both he and raleigh will hear of it again  some make much of a letter supposed to be written about this time by raleigh to cecil bidding cecil keep down essex even crush him now that he is once down  i do not happen to think the letter to be raleighs  his initials are subscribed to it but not his name and the style is not like his  but as for seeing unforgiveness and revenge in it whose soever it may be i hold and say there is not a word which can bear such a construction  it is a dark letter  but about a dark matter and a dark man  it is a worldly and expediential letter appealing to low motives in cecil though for a right end such a letter in short as statesmen are wont to write nowadays  if raleigh wrote it god punished him for doing so speedily enough  he does not usually punish statesmen nowadays for such letters perhaps because he does not love them as well as raleigh  but as for the letter itself  essex is called a tyrant because he had shown himself one  the queen is to hold bothwell because while she hath him he will even be the canker of her estate and safety and the writer has seen the last of her good days and of ours after his liberty  on which accounts cecil is not to be deterred from doing what is right and necessary by any fear of afterrevenges and conjectures from causes remote as many a stronger instancegiven will prove but look to the present and so do wisely  there is no real cause for cecils fear  if the man who has now lost a power which he ought never to have had be now kept down then neither he nor his son will ever be able to harm the man who has kept him at his just level  what revenge selfishness and craft there can be in all this it is difficult to see as difficult as to see why essex is to be talked of as unfortunate and the blame of his frightful end thrown on every one but himself  the fact being that essexs end was brought on by his having chosen one sunday morning for breaking out into open rebellion for the purpose of seizing the city of london and the queens person and compelling her to make him lord and master of the british isles in which attempt he and his fought with the civil and military authorities till artillery had to be brought up and many lives were lost  such little escapades may be pardonable enough in noble and unfortunate earls  but readers will perhaps agree that if they chose to try a similar experiment they could not complain if they found themselves shortly after in company with mr mitchell at spike island or mr oxford in bedlam  however those were days in which such sabbath amusements on the part of one of the most important and powerful personages of the realm could not be passed over so lightly especially when accompanied by severe loss of life and as there existed in england certain statutes concerning rebellion and high treason which must needs have been framed for some purpose or other the authorities of england may be excused for fancying that they bore some reference to such acts as that which the noble and unfortunate earl had just committed as wantonly selfishly and needlessly it seems to me as ever did man on earth  i may seem to jest too much upon so solemn a matter as the life of a human being  but if i am not to touch the popular talk about essex in this tone i can only touch it in a far sterner one and if ridicule is forbidden express disgust instead  i have entered into this matter of essex somewhat at length because on it is founded one of the mean slanders from which raleigh never completely recovered  the very mob who after raleighs death made him a protestant martyras indeed he waslooked upon essex in the same light hated raleigh as the cause of his death and accused him of glutting his eyes with essexs misery puffing tobacco out of a window and what notall mere inventions so raleigh declared upon the scaffold  he was there in his office as captain of the guard and could do no less than be there  essex it is said asked for raleigh just before he died  but raleigh had withdrawn the mob having murmured  what had essex to say to him  was it asks oldys shrewdly enough to ask him pardon for the wicked slanders which he had been pouring into jamess credulous and cowardly ears  we will hope so and leave poor essex to god and the mercy of god asserting once more that no man ever brought ruin and death more thoroughly on himself by his own act needing no imaginary help downwards from raleigh cecil or other human being  and now begins the fourth act of this strange tragedy  queen elizabeth dies and dies of grief  it has been the fashion to attribute to her i know not why remorse for essexs death and the foolish and false tale about lady nottingham and the ring has been accepted as history  the fact seems to be that she never really held up her head after burleighs death  she could not speak of him without tears forbade his name to be mentioned in the council  no wonder never had mistress a better servant  for nearly half a century have these two noble souls loved each other trusted each other worked with each other and gods blessing has been on their deeds and now the faithful godfearing man is gone to his reward and she is growing old and knows that the ancient fire is dying out in her and who will be to her what he was  buckhurst is a good man and one of her old pupils and she makes him lord treasurer in burleighs place  but beyond that all is dark  i am a miserable forlorn woman there is none about me that i can trust  she sees through cecil through henry howard  essex has proved himself worthless and pays the penalty of his sins  men are growing worse than their fathers  spanish gold is bringing in luxury and sin  the last ten years of her reign are years of decadence profligacy falsehood and she cannot but see it  tyrones rebellion is the last drop which fills the cup  after fifty years of war after a drain of money all but fabulous expended on keeping ireland quiet the volcano bursts forth again just as it seemed extinguished more fiercely than ever and the whole work has to be done over again when there is neither time nor a man to do it  and ahead what hope is there for england  who will be her successor  she knows in her heart that it will be james  but she cannot bring herself to name him  to bequeath the fruit of all her labours to a tyrant a liar and a coward  for she knows the man but too well  it is too hideous to be faced  this is the end then  oh that i were a milke maide with a paile upon mine arm  but it cannot be  it never could have been and she must endure to the end  therefore i hated life yea i hated all my labour which i had taken under the sun because i should leave it to the man that shall be after me  and who knows whether he shall be a wise man or a fool yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein i have showed myself wise in wisdom and knowledge and equity    vanity of vanities and vexation of spirit  and so with a whole book of ecclesiastes written on that mighty heart the old lioness coils herself up in her lair refuses food and dies  i know few passages in the worlds history more tragic than that death  why did she not trust raleigh  first because raleigh as we have seen was not the sort of man whom she needed  he was not the steadfast singleeyed statesman but the manysided genius  besides he was the ringleader of the warparty  and she like burleigh before his death was tired of the war saw that it was demoralising england was anxious for peace  raleigh would not see that  it was to him a divine mission which must be fulfilled at all risks  as long as the spaniards were opposing the indians conquering america there must be no peace  both were right from their own point of view  god ordered the matter from a third point of view  besides we know that essex and after him cecil and henry howard had been slandering raleigh basely to james  can we doubt that the same poison had been poured into elizabeths ears  she might distrust cecil too much to act upon what he said of raleigh and yet distrust raleigh too much to put the kingdom into his hands however she is gone now and a new king has arisen who knoweth not joseph  james comes down to take possession  insolence luxury and lawlessness mark his first steps on his going amid the adulations of a fallen people he hangs a poor wretch without trial wastes his time in hunting by the waya bad and base man whose only redeeming pointif in his case it be oneis his fondness for little children but that will not make a king  the wiser elders take counsel together  raleigh and good judge fortescue are for requiring conditions from the newcomer and constitutional liberty makes its last stand among the men of devon the old county of warriors discoverers and statesmen of which queen bess had said that the men of devon were her right hand  but in vain james has his way cecil and henry howard are willing enough to give it him  so down comes rehoboam taking counsel with the young men and makes answer to england my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions  he takes a base pleasure shocking to the french ambassador in sneering at the memory of queen elizabeth a perverse delight in honouring every rascal whom she had punished tyrone must come to england to be received into favour maddening the soul of honest sir john harrington  essex is christened my martyr apparently for having plotted treason against elizabeth with tyrone raleigh is received with a punby my soul i have heard rawly of thee mon and when the great nobles and gentlemen come to court with their retinues james tries to hide his dread of them in an insult poohpoohs their splendour and says he doubts not that he should have been able to win england for himself had they kept him out  raleigh answers boldly would god that had been put to the trial  why  because then you would have known your friends from your foes  a reason says old aubrey never forgotten or forgiven  aubrey is no great authority but the speech smacks so of raleighs offhand daring that one cannot but believe it as one does also the other story of his having advised the lords to keep out james and erect a republic  not that he could have been silly enough to propose such a thing seriously at that moment but that he most likely in his bold way may have said well if we are to have this man in without conditions better a republic at once  which if he did say he said what the next forty years proved to be strictly true  however he will go on his own way as best he can  if james will give him a loan he and the rest of the old heroes will join fit out a fleet against spain and crush her now that she is tottering and impoverished once and for ever  but james has no stomach for fighting cannot abide the sight of a drawn sword would not provoke spain for the worldwhy they might send jesuits and assassinate him and as for the money he wants that for very different purposes  so the answer which he makes to raleighs proposal of war against spain is to send him to the tower and sentence him to be hanged drawn and quartered on a charge of plotting with spain  having read i believe nearly all that has been written on the subject of this dark cobham plot i find but one thing come brightly out of the infinite confusion and mystery which will never be cleared up till the day of judgment and that is raleighs innocence  he and all england and the very men who condemned him knew that he was innocent  every biographer is forced to confess this more or less in spite of all efforts to be what is called impartial  so i shall waste no words upon the matter only observing that whereas raleigh is said to have slandered cecil to james in the same way that cecil had slandered him one passage of this cobham plot disproves utterly such a story which after all rests as far as i know only on hearsay being spoken of in a manuscript written by one buck secretary to chancellor egerton for in writing to his own wife in the expectation of immediate death raleigh speaks of cecil in a very different tone as one in whom he trusted most and who has left him in the hour of need  i ask the reader to peruse that letter and say whether any man would write thus with death and judgment before his face of one whom he knew that he had betrayed or indeed of one who he knew had betrayed him  i see no reason to doubt that raleigh kept good faith with cecil and that he was ignorant till after his trial that cecil was in the plot against him  i do not care to enter into the tracasseries of this cobham plot every one knows them no one can unravel them  the moral and spiritual significance of the fact is more interesting than all questions as to cobhams lies brookes lies arembergs lies cokes lies jamess lies let the dead bury their dead  it is the broad aspect of the thing which is so wonderful to see how   the eagle towering in his pride of place was by a mousing owl hawked at and killed   this is the man who six months ago perhaps thought that he and cecil were to rule england together while all else were the puppets whose wires they pulled  the lord hath taken him up and dashed him down and by such means too and on such a charge  betraying his country to spain  absurdincrediblehe would laugh it to scorn but it is bitter earnest  there is no escape  true or false he sees that his enemies will have his head  it is maddening  a horrible nightmare  he cannot bear it he cannot faceso he writes to that beloved wifethe scorn the taunts the loss of honour the cruel words of lawyers  he stabs himself  read that letter of his written after the mad blow had been struck it is sublime from intensity of agony  the way in which the chastisement was taken proves how utterly it was needed ere that proud successswollen worldentangled heart could be brought right with god  and it is brought right  the wound is not mortal  he comes slowly to a better mind and takes his doom like a man  that first farewell to his wife was written out of hell  the second rather out of heaven  read it too and compare and then see how the lord has been working upon this great soul  infinite sadness infinite tenderness and patience and trust in god for himself and his poor wife  god is my witness it was for you and yours that i desired life but it is true that i disdain myself for begging it  for know dear wife that your son is the son of a true man and one who in his own respect despiseth death and all his ugly and misshapen forms    the everlasting powerful infinite and omnipotent god who is goodness itself the true life and light keep thee and thine have mercy upon me and teach me to forgive my persecutors and accusers and send us to meet in his glorious kingdom  is it come to this then  is he fit to die at last  then he is fit to live and live he shall  the tyrants have not the heart to carry out their own crime and raleigh shall be respited  but not pardoned  no more return for him into that sinful world where he flaunted on the edge of the precipice and dropped heedless over it  god will hide him in the secret place of his presence and keep him in his tabernacle from the strife of tongues and a new life shall begin for him a wiser perhaps a happier than he has known since he was a little lad in the farmhouse in pleasant devon far away  on the 15th of december he enters the tower  little dreams he that for more than twelve years those doleful walls would be his home  lady raleigh obtains leave to share his prison with him and after having passed ten years without a child brings him a boy to comfort the weary heart  the child of sorrow is christened carew  little think those around him what strange things that child will see before his hairs be gray  she has her maid and he his three servants some five or six friends are allowed to repair to him at convenient times  he has a chamberdoor always open into the lieutenants garden where he has converted a little henhouse into a stillroom and spends his time all the day in distillation  the next spring a grant is made of his goods and chattels forfeited by attainder to trustees named by himself for the benefit of his family  so far so well or at least not as ill as it might be but there are those who cannot leave the caged lion in peace  sanderson who had married his niece instead of paying up the arrears which he owes on the wine and other offices brings in a claim of 2000 pounds  but the rogue meets his match and finds himself at the end of a lawsuit in prison for debt  greater rogues however will have better fortune and break through the law cobwebs which have stopped a poor little fly like sanderson  for carr afterwards lord somerset casts his eyes on the sherborne land it has been included in the conveyance and should be safe but there are others who by instigation surely of the devil himself have had eyes to see a flaw in the deed  sir john popham is appealed to  who could doubt the result  he answers that there is no doubt that the words were omitted by the inattention of the engrossercarew raleigh says that but one single word was wanting which word was found notwithstanding in the paperbook ie the draftbut that the word not being there the deed is worthless and the devil may have his way  to carr who has nothing of his own it seems reasonable enough to help himself to what belongs to others and james gives him the land  raleigh writes to him gently gracefully loftily  here is an extract  and for yourself sir seeing your fair day is now in the dawn and mine drawn to the evening your own virtues and the kings grace assuring you of many favours and much honour i beseech you not to begin your first building upon the ruins of the innocent and that their sorrows with mine may not attend your first plantation  he speaks strongly of the fairness sympathy and pity by which the scots in general had laid him under obligation  argues from it his own evident innocence and ends with a quiet warning to the young favourite not to undergo the curse of them that enter into the fields of the fatherless  in vain  lady raleigh with her children entreats james on her knees  in vain again  i mun ha the land is the answer i mun ha it for carr  and he has it patching up the matter after a while by a gift of 8000 pounds to her and her elder son in requital for an estate of 5000 pounds a year  so there sits raleigh growing poorer day by day and clinging more and more to that fair wife and her noble boy and the babe whose laughter makes music within that dreary cage  and all day long as we have seen he sits over his still compounding and discovering and sometimes showing himself on the wall to the people who gather to gaze at him till wade forbids it fearing popular feeling  in fact the world outside has a sort of mysterious awe of him as if he were a chained magician who if he were let loose might do with them all what he would  certain great nobles are of the same mind woe to them if that silver tongue should once again be unlocked  the queen with a womans faith in greatness sends to him for cordials  here is one of them famous in charles the seconds days as sir walters cordial   b  zedoary and saffron each       05 lb distilled water                       3 pints macerate etc and reduce to       15 pint compound powder of crabs claws      16 oz cinnamon and nutmegs                  2 oz cloves                                1 oz cardamom seeds                      05 oz  double refined sugar                  2 lb         make a confection   which so the world believes will cure all ills which flesh is heir to  it does not seem that raleigh so boasted himself but the people after the fashion of the time seem to have called all his medicines cordials and probably took for granted that it was by this particular one that the enchanter cured queen anne of a desperate sickness whereof the physicians were at the farthest end of their studies no great way to go in those days to find the cause and at a nonplus for the cure  raleighthis is sir anthony weldens account which may go for what it is worthasks for his reward only justice  will the queen ask that certain lords may be sent to examine cobham whether he had at any time accused sir walter of any treason under his hand  six are sent  cobham answers never nor could i  that villain wade often solicited me and not so prevailing got me by a trick to write my name on a piece of white paper  so that if a charge come under my hand it was forged by that villain wade by writing something above my hand without my consent or knowledge  they return  an equivocation was ready  sir my lord cobham has made good all that ever he wrote or said having by his own account written nothing but his name  this is sir anthony weldens story  one hopes for the six lords sake it may not be true but there is no reason in the morality of jamess court why it should not have been  so raleigh must remain where he is and work on  and he does work as his captivity becomes more and more hopeless so comes out more and more the stateliness selfhelp and energy of the man  till now he has played with his pen  now he will use it in earnest and use it as few prisoners have done  many a good book has been written in a dungeondon quixote the pilgrims progress  beautiful each in its way and destined to immortality  raleigh begins the history of the world the most godfearing and godseeing history which i know of among english writings though blotted by flattery of james in the preface  wrong  but pardonable in a man trying in the tower to get out of that doleful prison  but all his writings are thirty years too late they express the creed of a buried generation of the men who defied spain in the name of a god of righteousnessnot of men who cringe before her in the name of a god of power and cunning the captive eagle has written with a quill from his own winga quill which has been wont ere now to soar to heaven  every line smacks of the memories of nombre and of zutphen of tilbury fort and of calais roads and many a grayheaded veteran as he read them must have turned away his face to hide the noble tears as ulysses from demodocus when he sang the song of troy  so there sits raleigh like the prophet of old in his lonely tower above the thames watching the darkness gather upon the land year by year like the morning spread over the mountains the darkness which comes before the dawn of the day of the lord which he shall never see on earth though it be very near at hand and asks of each newcomer watchman what of the night  but there is one bright point at least in the darkness one on whom raleighs eyes and those of all england are fixed in boundless hope one who by the sympathy which attracts all noble natures to each other clings to the hero utterly henry the crown prince  no king but my father would keep such a bird in a cage  the noble lad tries to open the door for the captive eagle but in vain  at least he will make what use he can of his wisdom  he asks him for advice about the new ship he is building and has a simple practical letter in return and over and above probably the two valuable pamphlets of the invention of ships and observations on the navy and sea service which the prince will never see  in 1611 he asks raleighs advice about the foolish double marriage with the prince and princess of savoy and receives for answer two plainspoken discourses as full of historical learning as of practical sound sense  these are benefits which must be repaid  the father will repay them hereafter in his own way  in the meanwhile the son does so in his way by soliciting the sherborne estate as for himself intending to restore it to raleigh  he succeeds  carr is bought off for 25000 pounds where lady raleigh has been bought off with 8000 pounds but neither raleigh nor his widow will ever be the better for that bargain and carr will get sherborne back again and probably in the kings silly dotage keep the 25000 pounds also  in november 1612 prince henry falls sick  when he is at the last gasp the poor queen sends to raleigh for some of the same cordial which had cured her  medicine is sent with a tender letter as it well might be for raleigh knew how much hung not only for himself but for england on the cracking threads of that fair young life  it is questioned at first whether it shall be administered  the cordial raleigh says will cure him or any other of a fever except in case of poison  the cordial is administered but it comes too late  the prince dies and with him the hopes of all good men      at last after twelve years of prison raleigh is free  he is sixty six years old now grayheaded and worn down by confinement study and want of exercise  but he will not remember that   still in his ashes live their wonted fire   now for guiana at last which he has never forgotten to which he has been sending with his slender means ship after ship to keep the indians in hope  he is freed in march  at once he is busy in his project  in august he has obtained the kings commission by the help of sir ralph winwood secretary of state who seems to have believed in raleigh at least raleigh believed in him  in march next year he has sailed and with him thirteen ships and more than a hundred knights and gentlemen and among them strange to say sir warham st leger this is certainly not the quondam marshal of munster under whom raleigh served at smerwick sixandthirty years ago  he would be nearly eighty years old and as lord donerailes pedigree gives three sir warhams we cannot identify the man  but it is a strong argument in raleighs favour that a st leger of a devon family which had served with him in ireland and intimately connected with him his whole life should keep his faith in raleigh after all his reverses nevertheless the mere fact of an unpardoned criminal said to be non ens in law being able in a few months to gather round him such a party is proof patent of what slender grounds there are for calling raleigh suspected and unpopular  but he does not sail without a struggle or two  james is too proud to allow his heir to match with any but a mighty king is infatuated about the spanish marriage and gondomar is with him playing with his hopes and with his fears also  the people are furious and have to be silenced again and again there is even fear of rioting  the charming and smoothtongued gondomar can hate and can revenge too  five prentices who have insulted him for striking a little child are imprisoned and fined several hundred pounds each  and as for hating raleigh gondomar had been no spaniard to let alone the private reasons which some have supposed had he not hated spains ancient scourge and unswerving enemy  he comes to james complaining that raleigh is about to break the peace with spain  nothing is to be refused him which can further the one darling fancy of james and raleigh has to give in writing the number of his ships men and ordnance and moreover the name of the country and the very river whither he is going  this paper was given carew raleigh asserts positively under jamess solemn promise not to reveal it and raleigh himself seems to have believed that it was to be kept private for he writes afterwards to secretary winwood in a tone of astonishment and indignation that the information contained in his paper had been sent on to the king of spain before he sailed from the thames  winwood could have told him as much already for buckingham had written to winwood on march 28 to ask him why he had not been to the spanish ambassador to acquaint him with the order taken by his majesty about sir w rs voyage but however unwilling the secretary as one of the furtherers of the voyage may have been to meddle in the matter gondomar had had news enough from another source perhaps from jamess own mouth  for the first letter to the west indies about raleigh was dated from madrid march 19 and most remarkable it is that in jamess declaration or rather apology for his own conduct no mention whatsoever is made of his having given information to gondomar  gondomar offered says james to let raleigh go with one or two ships only  he might work a mine and the king of spain would give him a safe convoy home with all his gold  how kind  and how likely would raleigh and his fellowadventurers have been to accept such an offer how likely too to find men who would sail with them on such an errand to be flayed alive as many who travelled to the indies of late years had been or to have their throats cut tied back to back after trading unarmed and peaceably for a month as thirtysix of raleighs men had been but two or three years before in that very orinoco  so james is forced to let the large fleet go and to let it go well armed also for the plain reason that otherwise it dare not go at all and in the meanwhile letters are sent from spain in which the spaniards call the fleet english enemies and ships and troops are moved up as fast as possible from the spanish main  but say some james was justified in telling gondomar and the spaniards in defending themselves  on the latter point there is no doubt   they may get who have the will and they may keep who can   but it does seem hard on raleigh after having laboured in this guiana business for years and after having spent his money in vain attempts to deliver these guianians from their oppressors  it is hard and he feels it so  he sees that he is not trusted that as james himself confesses his pardon is refused simply to keep a hold on him that if he fails he is ruined  as he well asks afterwards if the king did not think that guiana was his why let me go thither at all  he knows that it was his by the law of nations for he made mr harcourt a grant of part of it if it be as gondomar says the king of spains then i had no more right to work a mine in it than to burn a town  an argument which seems to me unanswerable  but says james and others with him he was forbid to meddle with any country occupate or possessed by spaniards  southey too blames him severely for not having told james that the country was already settled by spaniards  i can excuse southey but not james for overlooking the broad fact that all england knew it as i have shown since 1594 that if they did not gondomar would have taken care to tell them and that he could not go to guiana without meddling with spaniards  his former voyages and publications made no secret of it  on the contrary one chief argument for the plan had been all through the delivery of the indians from these very spaniards who though they could not conquer them illused them in every way  and in his agreement with the lords about the guiana voyage in 1611 he makes especial mention of the very place which will soon fill such a part in our story san thome where the spaniards inhabit and tells the lords whom to ask as to the number of men who will be wanted to secure keymishs passage to the mine against these very spaniards  what can be more clear save to those who will not see  the plain fact is that raleigh went with his eyes open to take possession of a country to which he believed that he and king james had a right and that james and his favourites when they as he pleads might have stopped him by a word let him go knowing as well as the spaniards what he intended for what purpose but to have an excuse for the tragedy which ended all it is difficult to conceive it is evident wisely says sir robert schomburgk that they winked at consequences which they must have foreseen  and here mr napier on the authority of count desmarets brings a grave charge against raleigh  raleigh in his apology protests that he only saw desmarets once on board of his vessel  desmarets says in his despatches that he was on board of her several timeswhether he saw raleigh more than once does not appearand that raleigh complained to him of having been unjustly imprisoned stripped of his estate and so forth and that he was on that account resolved to abandon his country and if the expedition succeeded offer himself and the fruit of his labour to the king of france  if this be true raleigh was very wrong  but sir robert schomburgk points out that this passage which mr napier says occurs in the last despatch was written a month after raleigh had sailed and that the previous despatch written only four days after raleigh sailed says nothing about the matter  so that it could not have been a very important or fixed resolution on raleighs part if it was only to be recollected a month after  i do not sayas sir robert schomburgk is very much inclined to dothat it was altogether a bubble of french fancy  it is possible that raleigh in his just rage at finding that james was betraying him and sending him out with a halter round his neck to all but certain ruin did say wild wordsthat it was better for him to serve the frenchman than such a masterthat perhaps he might go over to the frenchman after allor some folly of the kind in that same rash tone which as we have seen has got him into trouble so often already  and so i leave the matter saying beware of making any man an offender for a word much less one who is being hunted to death in his old age and knows it  however this may be the fleet sails but with no bright auguries the mass of the sailors are a scum of men they are mutinous and troublesome and what is worse have got among them as perhaps they were intended to have the notion that raleighs being still non ens in law absolves them from obeying him when they do not choose and permits them to say of him behind his back what they list  they have long delays at plymouth  sir warhams ship cannot get out of the thames  pennington at the isle of wight cannot redeem his bread from the bakers and has to ride back to london to get money from lady raleigh  the poor lady has it not and gives a note of hand to mr wood of portsmouth  alas for her  she has sunk her 8000 pounds and beside that sold her wickham estate for 2500 pounds and all is on board the fleet  a hundred pieces are all the ready money the hapless pair had left on earth and they have parted them together  raleigh has fiftyfive and she fortyfive till god send it backif indeed he ever send it  the star is sinking low in the west  trouble on trouble  sir john fane has neither men nor money captain witney has not provisions enough and raleigh has to sell his plate in plymouth to help him  courage one last struggle to redeem his good name  then storms off sicilya pinnace is sunk faithful captain king drives back into bristol the rest have to lie by a while in some irish port for a fair wind  then bailey deserts with the southampton at the canaries then unnatural weather so that a fourteen days voyage takes forty days  then the distemper breaks out under the line  the simple diary of that sad voyage still remains full of curious and valuable nautical hints but recording the loss of friend on friend four or five officers and to our great grief our principal refiner mr fowler  crab my old servant  next a lamentable twentyfour hours in which they lose pigott the lieutenantgeneral mine honest frinde mr john talbot one that had lived with me a leven yeeres in the tower an excellent general skoller and a faithful and true man as ever lived with two very fair conditioned gentleman and mine own cook francis  then more officers and men and my cusen payton  then the water is near spent and they are forced to come to half allowance till they save and drink greedily whole canfuls of the bitter rain water  at last raleighs own turn comes running on deck in a squall he gets wet through and has twenty days of burning fever never man suffered a more furious heat during which he eats nothing but now and then a stewed prune  at last they make the land at the mouth of the urapoho far south of their intended goal  they ask for leonard the indian who lived with me in england three or four years the same man that took mr harcourts brother and fifty men when they were in extreme distress and had no means to live there but by the help of this indian whom they made believe that they were my men but the faithful indian is gone up the country and they stand away for cayenne where the cacique harry was also my servant and had lived with me in the tower two years  courage once more brave old heart  here at least thou art among friends who know thee for what thou art and look out longingly for thee as their deliverer  courage for thou art in fairyland once more the land of boundless hope and possibility  though england and englands heart be changed yet gods earth endures and the harvest is still here waiting to be reaped by those who dare  twenty stormy years may have changed thee but they have not changed the fairyland of thy prison dreams  still the mighty ceiba trees with their wealth of parasites and creepers tower above the palmfringed islets still the dark mangrove thickets guard the mouths of unknown streams whose granite sands are rich with gold  friendly indians come and harry with them bringing maize peccari pork and armadillos plantains and pineapples and all eat and gather strength and raleigh writes home to his wife to say that i may yet be king of the indians here were a vanity  but my name hath lived among themas well it might for many a year those simple hearts shall look for him in vain and more than two centuries and a half afterwards dim traditions of the great white chief who bade them stand out to the last against the spaniards and he would come and dwell among them shall linger among the carib tribes even say some the tattered relics of an english flag which he left among them that they might distinguish his countrymen  happy for him had he stayed there indeed and been their king  how easy for him to have grown old in peace at cayenne  but no he must on for honours sake and bring home if it were but a basketful of that ore to show the king that he may save his credit  he has promised arundel that he will return  and return he will  so onward he goes to the triangle islands  there he sends off five small vessels for the orinoco with four hundred men  the faithful keymis has to command and guide the expedition  sir warham is lying ill of the fever all but dead so george raleigh is sent in his place as sergeantmajor and with him five land companies one of which is commanded by young walter raleighs son another by a captain parker of whom we shall have a word to say presently  keymiss orders are explicit  he is to go up find the mine and open it and if the spaniards attack him repel force by force  but he is to avoid if possible an encounter with them  not for fear of breaking the peace but because he has a scum of men a few gentlemen excepted and i would not for all the world receive a blow from the spaniards to the dishonour of our nation  there we have no concealment of hostile instructions any more than in raleighs admirable instructions to his fleet which after laying down excellent laws for morality religion and discipline go on with clause after clause as to what is to be done if they meet the enemy  what enemy  why all spanish ships which sail the seas and who if they happen to be sufficiently numerous will assuredly attack sink burn and destroy raleighs whole squadron for daring to sail for that continent which spain claims as its own  raleigh runs up the coast to trinidad once more in through the serpents mouth and round punto gallo to the lake of pitch where all recruit themselves with fish and armadillos pheasant penelope palmitos moriche palm fruit and guavas and await the return of the expedition from the last day of december to the middle of february  they see something of the spaniards meanwhile sir john ferns is sent up to port of spain to try if they will trade for tobacco  the spaniards parley in the midst of the parley pour a volley of musketry into them at forty paces yet hurt never a man and send them off calling them thieves and traitors  fray simons spanish account of the matter is that raleigh intended to disembark his men that they might march inland on san joseph  he may be excused for the guess seeing that raleigh had done the very same thing some seventeen years before  if raleigh was treacherous then his treason punished itself now  however i must believe that raleigh is not likely to have told a lie for his own private amusement in his own private diary  on the 29th the spaniards attack three men and a boy who are ashore boiling the fossil pitch kill one man and carry off the boy raleigh instead of going up to port of spain and demanding satisfaction as he would have been justified in doing after this second attack remains quietly where he is expecting daily to be attacked by spanish armadas and resolved to burn by their sides happily or unhappily he escapes them  probably he thinks they waited for him at margarita expecting him to range the spanish main  at last the weary days of sickness and anxiety succeeded to days of terror  on the 1st of february a strange report comes by an indian an inland savage has brought confused and contradictory news down the river that san thome is sacked the governor and two spanish captains slain names given and two english captains nameless  after this entry follow a few confused ones set down as happening in january concerning attempts to extract the truth from the indians and the negligence of the mariners who are diligent in nothing but pillaging and stealing  and so ends abruptly this sad document  the truth comes at lastbut when does not appearin a letter from keymis dated january 8  san thome has been stormed sacked and burnt  four refiners houses were found in it the best in the town so that the spaniards have been mining there but no coin or bullion except a little plate  one english captain is killed and that captain is walter raleigh his firstborn  he died leading them on when some more careful of valour and safety began to recoil shamefully  his last words were lord have mercy upon me and prosper our enterprise  a spanish captain erinetta struck him down with the butt of a musket after he had received a bullet  john plessington his sergeant avenged him by running erinetta through with his halbert  keymis has not yet been to the mine he could not by reason of the murmurings discords and vexations but he will go at once make trial of the mine and come down to trinidad by the macareo mouth he sends a parcel of scattered papers a roll of tobacco a tortoise some oranges and lemons  praying god to give you health and strength of body and a mind armed against all extremities i rest ever to be commanded your lordships keymish  oh absalom my son my son would god i had died for thee  but weeping is in vain  the noble lad sleeps there under the palmtrees beside the mighty tropic stream while the fair basset his bride in the sight of god recks not of him as she wanders in the woods of umberleigh wife to the son of raleighs deadliest foe  raleigh raleigh surely gods blessing is not on this voyage of thine surely he hath set thy misdeeds before him and thy secret sins in the light of his countenance  another blank of misery  but his honour is still safe  keymis will return with that gold ore that pledge of his good faith for which he has ventured all  surely god will let that come after all now that he has paid as its price his firstborns blood  at last keymis returns with thinned numbers  all are weary spirit broken discontented mutinous  where is the gold ore  there is none  keymis has never been to the mine after all  his companions curse him as a traitor who has helped raleigh to deceive them into ruin the mine is imaginarya lie  the crews are ready to break into open mutiny after a while they will do so  yes god is setting this mans secret sins in the light of his countenance  if he has been ambitious his ambition has punished itself now  if he has cared more for his own honour than for his wife and children that sin too has punished itself  if he has which i affirm not tampered with truth for the sake of what seemed to him noble and just ends that too has punished itself for his men do not trust him  if he has which i affirm not done any wrong in that matter of cobham that too has punished itself  for his men counting him as non ens in law will not respect or obey him  if he has spoken after his old fashion rash and exaggerated words and goes on speaking them even though it be through the pressure of despair that too shall punish itself and for every idle word that he shall say god will bring him into judgment  and why but because he is noble  why but because he is nearer to god by a whole heaven than others whom god lets fatten on their own sins having no understanding because they are in honour and having children at their hearts desire and leaving the rest of their substance to their babes  not so does god deal with his elect when they will try to worship at once self and him he requires truth in the inward parts and will purge them till they are true and singleeyed and full of light  keymis returns with the wreck of his party  the scene between him and raleigh may be guessed  keymis has excuse on excuse  he could not get obeyed after young raleighs death  he expected to find that sir walter was either dead of his sickness or of grief for his son and had no wish to enrich a company of rascals who made no account of him  he dare not go up to the mine because and here raleigh thinks his excuse fair the fugitive spaniards lay in the craggy woods through which he would have to pass and that he had not men enough even to hold the town securely  if he reached the mine and left a company there he had no provisions for them and he dared not send backward and forward to the town while the spaniards were in the woods  the warnings sent by gondomar had undone all and jamess treachery had done its work  so keymis thinking it a greater error so he said to discover the mine to the spaniards than to excuse himself to the company said that he could not find it  from all which one thing at least is evident that keymis believed in the existence of the mine  raleigh rejects these fancies tells him before divers gentlemen that a blind man might find it by the marks which keymis himself had set down under his hand  that his case of losing so many men in the woods was a mere pretence  after walter was slain he knew that keymis had no care of any mans surviving  you have undone me wounded my credit with the king past recovery  as you have followed your own advice and not mine you must satisfy his majesty  it shall be glad if you can do it  but i cannot  there is no use dwelling on such vain regrets and reproaches  raleigh perhaps is bitter unjust  as he himself writes twice to his wife and sir ralph winwood his brains are broken  he writes to them both and reopens the letters to add long postscripts at his wits end keymis goes off spends a few miserable days and then enters raleighs cabin  he has written his apology to lord arundel and begs raleigh to allow of it  no  you have undone me by your obstinacy  i will not favour or colour your former folly  is that your resolution sir  it is  i know not then sir what course to take  and so he goes out and into his own cabin overhead  a minute after a pistolshot is heard  raleigh sends up a boy to know the reason  keymis answers from within that he has fired it off because it had been long charged and all is quiet  half an hour after the boy goes into the cabin  keymis is lying on his bed the pistol by him  the boy moves him  the pistolshot has broken a rib and gone no further but as the corpse is turned over a long knife is buried in that desperate heart  another of the old heroes is gone to his wild account  gradually drops of explanation ooze out  the sergeantmajor raleighs nephew and others confess that keymis told them that he could have brought them in two hours to the mine  but as the young heir was slain and his father was unpardoned and not like to live he had no reason to open the mine either for the spaniard or the king  those latter words are significant  what cared the old elizabethan seaman for the weal of such a king  and indeed what good to such a king would all the mines in guiana be  they answered that the king nevertheless had granted raleigh his hearts desire under the great seal  he replied that the grant to raleigh was to a man non ens in law and therefore of no force  here too jamess policy has worked well  how could men dare or persevere under such a cloud  how indeed could they have found heart to sail at all  the only answer is that they knew raleigh well enough to have utter faith in him and that keymis himself knew of the mine  puppies at home in england gave out that he had killed himself from remorse at having deceived so many gentlemen with an imaginary phantom  every one of course according to his measure of charity has power and liberty to assume any motive which he will  mine is simply the one which shows upon the face of the documents that the old follower devoted alike to the dead son and to the doomed father feeling that he had he scarce knew how failed in the hour of need frittered away the last chance of a mighty enterprise which had been his fixed idea for years and ruined the man whom he adored avenged upon himself the fault of having disobeyed orders given peremptorily and to be peremptorily executed  here perhaps my tale should end for all beyond is but the waking of the corpse  the last deathstruggle of the elizabethan heroism is over and all its remains vanish slowly in an undignified sickening way  all epics end so  after the war of troy achilles must die by coward pariss arrow in some mysterious confused pitiful fashion and stately hecuba must rail herself into a very dog and bark for ever shamefully around lonely cynossema  young david ends as a dotardsolomon as worse  glorious alexander must die half of fever half of drunkenness as the fool dieth  charles the fifth having thrown all away but his follies ends in a convent a superstitious imbecile napoleon squabbles to the last with sir hudson lowe about champagne  it must be so and the glory must be gods alone  for in great men and great times there is nothing good or vital but what is of god and not of mans self and when he taketh away that divine breath they die and return again to their dust  but the earth does not lose for when he sendeth forth his spirit they live and renew the face of the earth  a new generation arises with clearer sight with fuller experience sometimes with nobler aims and   the old order changeth giveth place to the new and god fulfils himself in many ways   the elizabethan epic did not end a day too soon  there was no more life left in it and god had something better in store for england raleighs ideal was a noble one  but gods was nobler far  raleigh would have made her a gold kingdom like spain and destroyed her very vitals by that gold as spain was destroyed  and all the while the great and good god was looking steadfastly upon that little struggling virginian village raleighs firstborn forgotten in his new mighty dreams and saying here will i dwell for i have a delight therein  there and not in guiana upon the simple tillers of the soil not among wild reckless goldhunters would his blessing rest  the very coming darkness would bring brighter light  the evil age itself would be the parent of new good and drive across the seas steadfast pilgrim fathers and generous royalist cavaliers to be the parents of a mightier nation than has ever yet possessed the earth verily gods ways are wonderful and his counsels in the great deep  so ends the elizabethan epic  must we follow the corpse to the grave  it is necessary  and now you gentlemen of england who sit at home at ease what would you have done in like caseyour last die thrown your last stake lost your honour as you fancy stained for ever your eldest son dead in battlewhat would you have done  what walter raleigh did was this  he kept his promise  he had promised lord arundel to return to england and return he did  but it is said his real intention as he himself confessed was to turn pirate and take the mexico fleet  that wild thoughts of such a deed may have crossed his mind may have been a terrible temptation to him may even have broken out in hasty words one does not deny  he himself says that he spoke of such a thing to keep his men together  all depends on how the words were spoken  the form of the sentence the tone of voice is everything who could blame him if seeing some of the captains whom he had most trusted deserting him his men heaping him with every slander and as he solemnly swore on the scaffold calling witnesses thereto by name forcing him to take an oath that he would not return to england before they would have him and locking him into his own cabinwho could blame him i ask for saying in that daring offhand way of his which has so often before got him into trouble come my lads do not despair  if the worst comes to the worst there is the plate fleet to fall back upon  when i remember too that the taking of the said platefleet was in raleighs eyes an altogether just thing and that he knew perfectly that if he succeeded therein he would be backed by the public opinion of all england and probably buy his pardon of james who if he loved spain well loved money better my surprise rather is that he did not go and do it  as for any meeting of captains in his cabin and serious proposal of such a plan i believe it to be simply one of the innumerable lies which james inserted in his declaration gathered from the tales of men who fearing and reasonably lest their heads should follow raleighs tried to curry favour by slandering him  this declaration has been so often exposed that i may safely pass it by and pass by almost as safely the argument which some have drawn from a chance expression of his in his pathetic letter to lady raleigh in which he hopes that god would send him somewhat before his return  to prove an intention of piracy in the despairing words of a ruined man writing to comfort a ruined wife for the loss of her firstborn is surely to deal out hard measure  heaven have mercy upon us if all the hasty words which woe has wrung from our hearts are to be so judged either by man or god  sir julius caesar again one of the commission appointed to examine him informs us that on being confronted with captains st leger and pennington he confessed that he proposed the taking of the mexico fleet if the mine failed  to which i can only answer that all depends on how the thing was said and that this is the last fact which we should find in sir juliuss notes which are it is confessed so confused obscure and full of gaps as to be often hardly intelligible  the same remark applies to wilsons story which i agree with mr tytler in thinking worthless  wilson it must be understood is employed after raleighs return as a spy upon him which office he executes all confess and wilson himself as much as any as falsely treacherously and hypocritically as did ever sinful man and inter alia he has this this day he told me what discourse he and the lord chancellor had about taking the plate fleet which he confessed he would have taken had he lighted on it to which my lord chancellor said why you would have been a pirate  oh quoth he did you ever know of any that were pirates for millions  they only that wish for small things are pirates now setting aside the improbability that raleigh should go out of his way to impeach himself to the man whom he must have known was set there to find matter for his death all we say depends on how it was said  if the lord chancellor ever said to raleigh to take the mexico fleet would be piracy it would have been just like raleigh to give such an answer  the speech is a perfectly true one  raleigh knew the world no man better and saw through its hollowness and the cant and hypocrisy of his generation and he sardonically states an undeniable fact  he is not expressing his own morality but that of the world just as he is doing in that passage of his apology about which i must complain of mr napier  it was a maxim of his says mr napier that good success admits of no examination  this is not fair  the sentence in the original goes on so the contrary allows of no excuse however reasonable and just whatsoever  his argument all through the beginning of the apology supported by instance on instance from history isi cannot get a just hearing because i have failed in opening this mine  so it is always  glory covers the multitude of sins  but a man who has failed is a fair mark for every slanderer puppy ignoramus discontented mutineer as i am now  what else in the name of common sense could have been his argument  does mr napier really think that raleigh even if in the face of all the noble and pious words which he had written he held so immoral a doctrine would have been shameless and senseless enough to assert his own rascality in an apology addressed to the most religious of kings in the most canting of generations  but still more astonished am i at the use which has been made of captain parkers letter  the letter is written by a man in a state of frantic rage and disappointment  there never was any mine he believes now  keymiss delays we found mere delusions for he was false to all men and hateful to himself loathing to live since he could do no more villany  i will speak no more of this hateful fellow to god and man  and it is on the testimony of a man in this temper that we are asked to believe that the admiral and vice admiral raleigh and st leger are going to the western islands to look for homewardbound men  if indeed the looking for homeward bound men means really looking for the spanish fleet and not merely for recruits for their crews  i never recollectand i have read pretty fully the searecords of those dayssuch a synonym used either for the mexican or indian fleet  but let this be as it may the letter proves too much  for first it proves that whosoever is not going to turn pirate our calm and charitable friend captain parker is for my part by the permission of god i will either make a voyage or bury myself in the sea  now what making a voyage meant there is no doubt and the sum total of the letter is that a man intending to turn rover himself accuses under the influence of violent passion his comrades of doing the like  we may believe him about himself  about others we shall wait for testimony a little less interested  but the letter proves too much again  for parker says that witney and woolaston are gone off ahead to look for homewardbound men thus agreeing with raleighs message to his wife that witney for whom i sold all my plate at plymouth and to whom i gave more credit and countenance than to all the captains of my fleet ran from me at the grenadas and woolaston with him  and now reader how does this of witney and woolaston and parkers intentions to pirate separately if it be true agree with king jamess story of raleighs calling a council of war and proposing an attack on the platefleet  one or the other must needs be a lie probably both  witneys ship was of only 160 tons woolastons probably smaller  five such ships would be required as any reader of hakluyt must know to take a single carack and it would be no use running the risk of hanging for any less prize  the spanish main was warned and armed and the western isles also  is it possible that these two men would have been insane enough in such circumstances to go without raleigh if they could have gone with him  and is it possible that he if he had any set purpose of attacking the plate fleet would not have kept them in order to attempt that with him which neither they nor he could do without each other  moreover no piratical act ever took place if any had we should have heard enough about it and why is parker to be believed against raleigh alone when there is little doubt that he slandered all the rest of the captains  lastly it was to this very parker with mr tresham and another gentleman that raleigh appealed by name on the scaffold as witnesses that it was his crew who tried to keep him from going home and not he them  my own belief is and it is surely simple and rational enough that raleighs brains as he said were broken that he had no distinct plan  but that loth to leave the new world without a second attempt on guiana he went up to newfoundland to revictual and with good hope as he wrote to winwood himself of keeping the sea till august with some four reasonable good ships probably as oldys remarks to try a trading voyage but found his gentlemen too dispirited and incredulous his men too mutinous to do anything and seeing his ships go home one by one at last followed them himself because he had promised arundel and pembroke so to do having after all as he declared on the scaffold extreme difficulty in persuading his men to land at all in england  the other lies about him as of his having intended to desert his soldiers in guiana his having taken no tools to work the mine and so forth one only notices to say that the declaration takes care to make the most of them without deigning after its fashion to adduce any proof but anonymous hearsays  if it be true that bacon drew up that famous document it reflects no credit either on his honesty or his inductive science  so raleigh returns anchors in plymouth  he finds that captain north has brought home the news of his mishaps and that there is a proclamation against him which by the bye lies for it talks of limitations and cautions given to raleigh which do not appear in his commission and moreover that a warrant is out for his apprehension  he sends his men on shore and starts for london to surrender himself in company with faithful captain king who alone clings to him to the last and from whom we have details of the next few days  near ashburton he is met by sir lewis stukely his near kinsman viceadmiral of devon who has orders to arrest him raleigh tells him that he has saved him the trouble and the two return to plymouth where stukely strangely enough leaves him at liberty and rides about the country  we should be slow in imputing baseness  but one cannot help suspecting from stukelys subsequent conduct that he had from the first private orders to give raleigh a chance of trying to escape in order to have a handle against him such as his own deeds had not yet given  the ruse if it existed then as it did afterwards succeeds raleigh hears bad news  gondomar hasor has nottold his story to the king by crying piratas piratas piratas and then rushing out without explanation  james is in terror lest what had happened should break off the darling spanish match  raleigh foresees ruin perhaps death  life is sweet and guiana is yet where it was  he may win a basketful of the ore still and prove himself no liar  he will escape to france  faithful king finds him a rochelle ship he takes boat to her goes half way and returns honour is sweeter than life and james may yet be just  the next day he bribes the master to wait for him one more day starts for the ship once more and again returns to plymouthso king will make oathof his own free will  the temptation must have been terrible and the sin none  what kept him from yielding but innocence and honour  he will clear himself and if not abide the worst  stukely and james found out these facts and made good use of them afterwards  for now comes a severe letter from my lords to bring raleigh up as speedily as his health will permit and with it comes one mannourie a french quack of whom honest king takes little note at the time but who will make himself remembered  and now begins a series of scenes most pitiable raleighs brains are indeed broken  he is old wornout with the effects of his fever lamed ruined brokenhearted and for the first time in his life weak and silly  he takes into his head the paltriest notion that he can gain time to pacify the king by feigning himself sick  he puts implicit faith in the rogue mannourie whom he has never seen before he sends forward lady raleigh to londonperhaps ashamedas who would not have beento play the fool in that sweet presence and with her good captain king who is to engage one cotterell an old servant of raleighs to find a ship wherein to escape if the worst comes to the worst  cotterell sends king to an old boatswain of his who owns a ketch  she is to lie off tilbury and so king waits raleighs arrival  what passed in the next four or five days will never be truly known for our only account comes from two self convicted villains stukely and mannourie  on these details i shall not enter  first because one cannot trust a word of them secondly because no one will wish to hear them who feels as i do how pitiable and painful is the sight of a great heart and mind utterly broken  neither shall i spend time on stukelys villanous treatment of raleigh for which he had a commission from james in writing his pretending to help him to escape his going down the thames in a boat with him his trying in vain to make honest king as great a rogue as himself  like most rascalities stukelys conduct even as he himself states it is very obscure  all that we can see is that cotterell told stukely everything  that stukely bade cotterell carry on the deceit that stukely had orders from headquarters to incite raleigh to say or do something which might form a fresh ground of accusal that being a clumsy rogue he failed and fell back on abetting raleighs escape as a last resource  be it as it may he throws off the mask as soon as raleigh has done enough to prove an intent to escape arrests him and conducts him to the tower  there two shameful months are spent in trying to find out some excuse for raleighs murder  wilson is set over him as a spy his letters to his wife are intercepted  every art is used to extort a confession of a great plot with france and every art fails utterly simply it seems to me because there was no plot  raleigh writes an apology letters of entreaty selfjustification what not all in my opinion just and true enough but like his speech on the scaffold weak confusedthe product of a broken brain  however his head must come off and as a last resource it must be taken off upon the sentence of fifteen years ago and he who was condemned for plotting with spain must die for plotting against her  it is a pitiable business  but as osborne says in a passage p108 of his memoirs of james for which one freely forgives him all his sins and lies and they are manyas the foolish idolaters were wont to sacrifice the choicest of their children to the devil so our king gave up his incomparable jewel to the will of this monster of ambition the spaniard under the pretence of a superannuated transgression contrary to the opinion of the more honest sort of gownsmen who maintained that his majestys pardon lay inclusively in the commission he gave him on his setting out to sea it being incongruous that he who remained under the notion of one dead in the law should as a general dispose of the lives of others not being himself master of his own  but no matter  he must die  the queen intercedes for him as do all honest men  but in vain  he has twentyfour hours notice to prepare for death eats a good breakfast takes a cup of sack and a pipe makes a rambling speech in which one notes only the intense belief that he is an honest man and the intense desire to make others believe so in the very smallest matters and then dies smilingly as one weary of life  one makes no comment  raleighs life really ended on that day that poor keymis returned from san thome  and then  as we said truth is stranger than fiction  no dramatist dare invent a poetic justice more perfect than fell upon the traitor  it is not always so no doubt  god reserves many a greater sinner for that most awful of all punishmentsimpunity  but there are crises in a nations life in which god makes terrible examples to put before the most stupid and sensual the choice of hercules the upward road of life the downward one which leads to the pit  since the time of pharaoh and the red sea host history is full of such palpable unmistakable revelations of the divine nemesis and in england too at that moment the crisis was there and the judgment of god was revealed accordingly  sir lewis stukely remained it seems at court high in favour with james  but he found nevertheless that people looked darkly on him  like many selfconvicted rogues he must needs thrust his head into his own shame and one day he goes to good old lord charles howards house for being viceadmiral of devon he has affairs with the old armada hero  the old lion explodes in an unexpected roar  darest thou come into my presence thou base fellow who art reputed the common scorn and contempt of all men  were it not in mine own house i would cudgel thee with my staff for presuming to speak to me  stukely his tail between his legs goes off and complains to james  what should i do with him  hang him  on my sawle mon if i hung all that spoke ill of thee all the trees in the island were too few  such is the gratitude of kings thinks stukely and retires to write foolish pamphlets in selfjustification which unfortunately for his memory still remain to make bad worse  within twelve months he the rich and proud viceadmiral of devon with a shield of sixteen quarterings and the bloodroyal in his veins was detected debasing the kings coin within the precincts of the royal palace together with his old accomplice mannourie who being taken confessed that his charges against raleigh were false he fled a ruined man back to his native county and his noble old seat of affton but ate is on the heels of such    slowly she tracks him and sure as a lymehound sudden she grips him crushing him blind in his pride for a sign and a terror to mortals   a terrible plebiscitum had been passed in the west country against the betrayer of its last worthy  the gentlemen closed their doors against him the poor refused himso goes the legendfire and water  driven by the furies he fled from affton and wandered westward down the vale of taw away to appledore and there took boat and out into the boundless atlantic over the bar now crowded with shipping for which raleighs genius had discovered a new trade and a new world  sixteen miles to the westward like a blue cloud on the horizon rises the ultima thule of devon the little isle of lundy  there one outlying peak of granite carrying up a shelf of slate upon its southern flank has defied the waves and formed an island some three miles long desolate flatheaded fretted by every frost and storm walled all round with four hundred feet of granite cliff sacred only then at least to puffins and pirates  over the single landingplace frowns from the cliff the keep of an old ruin moresco castle as they call it still where some bold rover sir john de moresco in the times of the old edwards worked his works of darkness  a gray weird uncanny pile of moorstone through which all the winds of heaven howl day and night  in a chamber of that ruin died sir lewis stukely lord of affton cursing god and man  these things are true  said i not well that reality is stranger than romance  but no nemesis followed james  the answer will depend much upon what readers consider to be a nemesis  if to have found england one of the greatest countries in europe and to have left it one of the most inconsiderable and despicable if to be fooled by flatterers to the top of his bent until he fancied himself all but a god while he was not even a man and could neither speak the truth keep himself sober nor look on a drawn sword without shrinking if lastly to have left behind him a son who in spite of many chivalrous instincts unknown to his father had been so indoctrinated in that fathers vices as to find it impossible to speak the truth even when it served his purpose if all these things be no nemesis then none fell on james stuart  but of that son at least the innocent blood was required  he too had his share in the sin  in carew raleighs simple and manful petition to the commons of england for the restoration of his inheritance we find a significant fact stated without one word of comment bitter or otherwise  at prince henrys death the sherborne lands had been given again to carr lord somerset  to him too the whirligig of time brought round its revenges and he lost them when arraigned and condemned for poisoning sir thomas overbury  then sir john digby afterwards earl of bristol begged sherborne of the king and had it  pembroke shakspeares pembroke brought young carew to court hoping to move the tyrants heart  james saw him and shuddered perhaps conscience stricken perhaps of mere cowardice he looked like the ghost of his father as he well might to that guilty soul  good pembroke advised his young kinsman to travel which he did till jamess death in the next year  then coming over this is his own storyhe asked of parliament to be restored in blood that he might inherit aught that might fall to him in england his petition was read twice in the lords  whereon king charles sent sir james fullarton then of the bedchamber to mr raleigh to command him to come to him and being brought in the king after using him with great civility notwithstanding told him plainly that when he was prince he had promised the earl of bristol to secure his title to sherborne against the heirs of sir walter raleigh whereon the earl had given him then prince ten thousand pounds that now he was bound to make good his promise being king that therefore unless he would quit his right and title to sherborne he neither could nor would pass his bill of restoration  young raleigh like a good englishman urged he says the justness of his cause that he desired only the liberty of the subject and to be left to the law which was never denied any freeman  the king remained obstinate  his noble brothers love for the mighty dead weighed nothing with him much less justice  poor young raleigh was forced to submit  the act for his restoration was passed reserving sherborne for lord bristol and charles patched up the affair by allowing to lady raleigh and her son after her a life pension of four hundred a year  young carew tells his story simply and without a note of bitterness though he professes his intent to range himself and his two sons for the future under the banner of the commons of england he may be a royalist for any word beside  even where he mentions the awful curse of his mother he only alludes to its fulfilment bythat which hath happened since to that royal family is too sad and disastrous for me to repeat and yet too visible not to be discerned  we can have no doubt that he tells the exact truth  indeed the whole story fits charless character to the smallest details  the want of any real sense of justice combined with the false notion of honour the implacable obstinacy the contempt for that law by which alone he held his crown the combination of unkingliness in commanding a private interview and shamelessness in confessing his own meanness all these are true notes of the man whose deliberate suicide stands written a warning to all bad rulers till the end of time  but he must have been a rogue early in life and a needy rogue too  that ten thousand pounds of lord bristols money should make many a sentimentalist reconsiderif indeed sentimentalists can be made to reconsider or even to consider anythingtheir notion of him as the incarnation of pious chivalry  at least the ten thousand pounds cost charles dear  the widows curse followed him home  naseby fight and the whitehall scaffold were surely gods judgment of such deeds whatever mans may be    footnotes
