bentinck  is inscribed  this political biography  one for whom he entertained a deep affection  and whose talents and virtues  he shares    lord george bentinck  a political biography  illustration bentinkpage009     chapter i       the man  the political career of lord george bentinck was peculiar he had to use his own expression sate in eight parliaments without having taken part in any great debate when remarkable events suddenly impelled him to advance and occupy not only a considerable but a leading position in our public affairs during three years under circumstances of great difficulty he displayed some of the highest qualities of political life courage and a lofty spirit a mastery of details which experience usually alone confers a quick apprehension and a clear intelligence indomitable firmness promptness punctuality and perseverance which never failed an energy seldom surpassed and a capacity for labour which was perhaps never equalled at the very moment when he had overcome many contrarieties and prejudices when he had been most successful in the house of commons and sustained only by his own resources had considerably modified the legislation of the government which he opposed on a measure of paramount importance when the nation which had long watched him with interest began to congratulate itself on the devotion of such a man to the business of the country he was in an instant taken from us then it was that the memory of the past and the hope of the future blending together all men seemed to mourn over this untimely end and there was that pang in the public heart which accompanies the unexpected disappearance of a strong character  what manner of man this was who thus on a sudden in the middle term of life relinquished all the ease and pleasure of a patrician existence to work often eighteen hours daily not for a vain and brilliant notoriety which was foreign alike both to his tastes and his turn of mind but for the advancement of principles the advocacy of which in the chief scene of his efforts was sure to obtain for him only contention and unkindly feelings what were his motives purposes and opinions how and why did he labour what were the whole scope and tendency of this original vigorous and selfschooled intelligence these would appear to be subjects not unworthy of contemplation and especially not uninteresting to a free and political community  the difficulty of treating cotemporary characters and events has been ever acknowledged but it may be doubted whether the difficulty is diminished when we would commemorate the men and things that have preceded us the cloud of passion in the first instance or in the other the mist of time may render it equally hard and perplexing to discriminate  it should not be forgotten that the most authentic and interesting histories are those which have been composed by actors in the transactions which they record the cotemporary writer who is personally familiar with his theme has unquestionably a great advantage but it is assumed that his pen can scarcely escape the bias of private friendship or political connection yet truth after all is the sovereign passion of mankind nor is the writer of these pages prepared to relinquish his conviction that it is possible to combine the accuracy of the present with the impartiality of the future  lord george bentinck had sat for eighteen years in parliament and before he entered it had been for three years private secretary to mr canning who had married the sister of the duchess of portland such a post would seem a happy commencement of a public career but whether it were the untimely death of his distinguished relative or a natural indisposition lord georgethough he retained the seat for kings lynn in which he had succeeded his uncle the late governorgeneral of indiadirected his energies to other than parliamentary pursuits for some time he had followed his profession which was that of arms but of late years he had become absorbed in the pastime and fortunes of the turf in which his whole being seemed engrossed and which he pursued on a scale that perhaps has never been equalled  lord george had withdrawn his support from the government of the duke of wellington when the friends of mr canning quitted that administration and when in time they formed not the least considerable portion of the cabinet of lord grey he resumed his seat on the ministerial benches on that occasion an administrative post was offered him and declined and on subsequent occasions similar requests to him to take office were equally in vain lord george therefore was an original and hearty supporter of the reform bill and he continued to uphold the whigs in all their policy until the secession of lord stanley between whom and himself there subsisted warm personal as well as political sympathies although he was not only a friend to religious liberty as we shall have occasion afterwards to remark but always viewed with great sympathy the condition of the roman catholic portion of the irish population he shrank from the taint of the ultramontane intrigue accompanying lord stanley he became in due time a member of the great conservative opposition and as he never did anything by halves became one of the most earnest as he certainly was one of the most enlightened supporters of sir robert peel his trust in that minister was indeed absolute and he has subsequently stated in conversation that when towards the end of the session of 45 a member of the tory party ventured to predict and denounce the impending defection of the minister there was no member of the conservative party who more violently condemned the unfounded attack or more readily impugned the motives of the assailant  he was not a very frequent attendant in the house he might be counted on for a party division and when towards the termination of the melbourne ministry the forces were very nearly balanced and the struggle became very close he might have been observed on more than one occasion entering the house at a late hour clad in a white greatcoat which softened but did not conceal the scarlet huntingcoat  although he took no part in debate and attended the house rather as a club than as a senate he possessed a great and peculiar influence in it he was viewed with interest and often with extraordinary regard by every sporting man in the house with almost all of these he was acquainted some of them on either side were his intimate companions and confederates  his eager and energetic disposition his quick perception clear judgment and prompt decision the tenacity with which he clung to his opinions his frankness and love of truth his daring and speculative spirit his lofty bearing blended as it was with a simplicity of manner very remarkable the ardour of his friendships even the fierceness of his hates and prejudicesall combined to form one of those strong characters who whatever may be their pursuit must always direct and lead  nature had clothed this vehement spirit with a material form which was in perfect harmony with its noble and commanding character he was tall and remarkable for his presence his countenance almost a model of manly beauty the face oval the complexion clear and mantling the forehead lofty and white the nose aquiline and delicately moulded the upper lip short but it was in the darkbrown eye which flashed with piercing scrutiny that all the character of the man came forth a brilliant glance not soft but ardent acute imperious incapable of deception or of being deceived  although he had not much sustained his literary culture and of late years at any rate had not given his mind to political study he had in the course of his life seen and heard a great deal and with profit nothing escaped his observation he forgot nothing and always thought so it was that on all the great political questions of the day he had arrived at conclusions which guided him he always took large views and had no prejudices about things whatever he might indulge in as to persons he was always singularly anxious to acquire the truth and would spare no pains for that purpose but when once his mind was made up it was impossible to influence him  in politics he was a whig of 1688 which became him modified however by all the experience of the present age he wished to see our society founded on a broad basis of civil and religious liberty he retained much of the old jealousy of the court but had none of popular franchises he was for the established church but for nothing more and was very repugnant to priestly domination as for the industrial question he was sincerely opposed to the manchester scheme because he thought that its full development would impair and might subvert our territorial constitution which he held to be the real security of our freedom and because he believed that it would greatly injure ireland and certainly dissolve our colonial empire  he had a great respect for merchants though he looked with some degree of jealousy on the development of our merely foreign trade his knowledge of character qualified him in a great degree to govern men and if some drawbacks from this influence might be experienced in his too rigid tenacity of opinion and in some quickness of temper which however always sprang from a too sensitive heart great compensation might be found in the fact that there probably never was a human being so entirely devoid of conceit and so completely exempt from selfishness nothing delighted him more than to assist and advance others all the fruits of his laborious investigations were always at the service of his friends without reserve or selfconsideration he encouraged them by making occasions for their exertions and would relinquish his own opportunity without a moments hesitation if he thought the abandonment might aid a better man     chapter ii       the protection problem  there was at this time a metropolitan society for the protection of agriculture of which the duke of richmond was chairman and which had been established to counteract the proceedings of the manchester confederation it was in communication with the local protection societies throughout the country and although the adhesion to its service by the parliamentary members of the old conservative party had been more limited than might have been expected nevertheless many county members were enrolled in its ranks and a few of the most eminent were actively engaged in its management in this they were assisted by an equal number of the most considerable tenantfarmers in the present state of affairs the council of the protection society afforded the earliest and readiest means to collect opinion and methodize action and it was therefore resolved among its managers to invite all members of parliament who sympathized with their purpose though they might not be members of their society to attend their meeting and aid them at the present crisis with their counsel  a compliance with this request occasioned the first public appearance of lord george bentinck as one of the organizers of a political partyfor he aspired to no more the question was whether a third political party could be created and sustaineda result at all times and under any circumstances difficult to achieve and which had failed even under the auspices of accomplished and experienced statesmen in the present emergency was there that degree of outraged public feeling in the country which would overcome all obstacles and submit to any inconveniences in order to ensure its representation in the house of commons it was the opinion of lord george bentinck that such was the case that if for the moment that feeling was inert and latent it was an apathy which arose from the sudden shock of public confidence and the despair which under such circumstances takes possession of men that if it could be shown to the country that the great bulk of the conservative party were true to their faith and were not afraid even against the fearful odds which they would have to encounter to proclaim it the confidence and the courage of the country would rally and the party in the house of commons would find external sympathy and support  with these views it became of paramount importance that the discussion on the government measure should be sustained on the part of the protectionists with their utmost powers they must prove to the country that they could represent their cause in debate and to this end all their energies must be directed it would be fatal to them if the discussion were confined to one or two nights and they overborne by the leading and habitual speakers they must bring forward new men they must encourage the efforts of those now unrecognized and comparatively unknown they must overcome all reserve and false shame and act as became men called upon to a critical and leading part not by their arrogance or ambition but by the desertion and treachery of those to whose abilities they had bowed without impatience and reluctance there was a probability of several vacancies immediately taking place in counties where the seats were filled by converts but men of too scrupulous an honour to retain the charge which they had sought and accepted as the professors of opinions contrary to those which now received their mournful adhesion the result of these elections would greatly depend upon the spirit and figure of the party in the house of commons in their first encounter with the enemy  these views so just and so spirited advanced with highbred earnestness by one rarely met in political turmoils and enforced with a freshness and an affable simplicity which were very winning wonderfully encouraged those to whom they were addressed all seemed touched by the flame which burned in the breast of that man so lofty in his thoughts but so humble in his ambition who counselled ever the highest deeds and was himself ever prepared to undertake the humblest duties  the business of this day was notable calculations were made of those who might be fairly counted on to take a part in debate some discussion even ensued as to who should venture to reply late at night to the minister a committee was appointed to communicate with all members on either side supposed to be favourable to the principle of protection to the labour of the country a parliamentary staff was organized not only to secure the attendance of members but to guard over the elections finally the form of the amendment to the government measure was discussed and settled and it was agreed that if possible it should be moved by mr philip miles the member for the city of bristol and who had the ear of the house not merely from the importance of his constituency and seconded by sir william heathcote the member for the county of hampshire a country gentleman of great accomplishments and so highly considered by both sides that he was very generally spoken of as a probable successor to the chair  all was furnished by this lately forlorn party except a leader and even then many eyes were turned and some hopeful murmurs addressed towards lord george bentinck who in the course of this morning had given such various proofs of his fitness and such evidence of his resource but he shook his head with a sort of suppressed smile a faint blush and an air of proud humility that was natural to him i think he said we have had enough of leaders it is not in my way i shall remain the last of the rank and file  so little desirous originally was lord george bentinck to interfere actively in that great controversy in which ultimately he took so leading a part that before the meeting of parliament in 1846 he begged a gentleman whom he greatly esteemed a member of the legal profession and since raised to its highest honours to call upon him at harcourt house when he said that he had taken great pains to master the case of the protective system that he was convinced its abrogation would ultimately be very injurious to this country but although both in point of argument and materials he feared no opponent he felt constitutionally so incapable of ever making a speech that he wished to induce some eminent lawyer to enter the house of commons and avail himself of his views and materials which he had with that object reduced to writing he begged therefore that his friend although a freetrader would assist him by suggesting a fitting person for this office  accordingly the name of a distinguished member of the bar who had already published a work of merit impugning the principles of the new commercial system was mentioned and this learned gentleman was applied to and was not indisposed to accept the task a mere accident prevented this arrangement being accomplished lord george then requested his friend to make some other selection but his adviser very sensibly replied that although the house of commons would have listened with respect to a gentleman who had given evidence of the sincerity of his convictions by the publication of a work which had no reference to parliament they would not endure the instance of a lawyer brought into the house merely to speak from his brief and that the attempt would be utterly fruitless he earnestly counselled lord george himself to make the effort but lord george with characteristic tenacity clung for some time to his project though his efforts to accomplish it were fortunately not successful  some of the friends of lord george bentinck remembering his inexperience in debate aware of the great length at which he must necessarily treat the theme and mindful that he was not physically wellqualified for controlling popular assemblies not having a strong voice or naturally a very fluent manner were anxious that he should not postpone his speech until an hour so late that an audience jaded by twelve nights discussion would be illattuned to statistical arguments and economical details but still clinging to the hope that some accident might yet again postpone the division so that the protectionists might gain the vote of mr hildyard who had been returned that day for south notts having defeated a cabinet minister lord george remained motionless until long past midnight mr cobden having spoken on the part of the confederation the closing of the debate was felt to be inevitable even then by inducing a protectionist to solicit the speakers eye lord george attempted to avert the division but no supporter of the government measure of any colour advancing to reply to this volunteer bentinck was obliged to rise he came out like a lion forced from his lair and so it happened that after all his labours of body and mind after all his research and unwearied application and singular vigilance after having been at his post for a month never leaving the house even for refreshment he had to undertake the most difficult enterprise in which a man can well embark with a concurrence of every disadvantage which could ensure failure and defeat it would seem that the audience the subject and the orator must be equally exhausted for the assembly had listened for twelve nights to the controversy and he who was about to address them had according to his strange habit taken no sustenance the whole day it being his custom to dine after the house was up which was very often long after midnight and this with the exception of a slender breakfast rigidly restricted to dry toast was his only meal in the fourandtwenty hours  he had been forced to this regimen from food exercising a lethargic influence over him so that in addition to some constitutional weakness in his organ he usually laboured when he addressed the house under the disadvantage of general exhaustion and this was no doubt a principal cause of that overexcitement and apparently unnecessary energy in his manner of speaking of which he was himself perfectly and even painfully conscious he was wont to say that before he could speak he had to make a voice and as it were to pump it from the very core of his frame one who took a great interest in his success once impressed on him the expediency of trusting entirely to his natural voice and the interest and gravity of his matter which combined with his position as the recognized leader of a great party would be adequate to command the attention of his audience and he subsequently endeavoured very often to comply with this suggestion he endeavoured also very much to control his redundancy of action and gesture when that peculiarity was pointed out to him with the delicacy but the sincerity of friendship he entirely freed himself from a very awkward feature of his first style of speaking namely the frequent repetition of a sentence which seemed at first a habit inveterate with him but such was his force of will that when the necessity of ridding himself of this drawback was properly pointed out to him he achieved the desired result no one bore criticism more gently and kindly so long as it was confined to his personal and intellectual characteristics for he was a man absolutely without vanity or conceit who thought very humbly of himself in respect of abilities and deemed no labour too great to achieve even a slight improvement but though in these respects the very child of simplicity he was a man of almost unexampled pride and chafed under criticism when his convictions or his conduct were questioned he was very tenacious of his opinion almost inexorable and it required a courage nearly equal to his own combined with a serene temper successfully to impugn his conclusions  not therefore excited by vanity but sustained by selfrespect by an overpowering feeling that he owed it to himself and the opinions he held to show to the world that they had not been lightly adopted and should not be lightly laid aside bentinck rose long past the noon of night at the end of this memorable debate to undertake an office from which the most successful and most experienced rhetoricians of parliament would have shrunk with intuitive discretion but duty scorns prudence and criticism has few terrors for a man with a great purpose unshaken by the adverse hour and circumstances he proceeded to accomplish the object which he had long meditated and for which he was fully prepared  reminding the house while he appealed to their indulgence that though he had had the honour of a seat for eight parliaments he had never once ventured to trespass on its time on any subject of great debate he at once took a clear and comprehensive ground of objection to the government scheme he opposed it not only because he objected to the great change contemplated with respect to the agricultural interest but on principle to the entire measure a great commercial revolution which we are of opinion that the circumstances of the country do not by any means require  noticing the observation of the secretary at war that the agricultural interest in submitting to this great change might now accept it with honour instead of its being eventually extorted by force he happily retorted that vicious as he thought the measure he should feel it deprived of half its vice if it could be carried without loss of honour damage to reputation and forfeiture of public character to a vast number of gentlemen now present and he proceeded to show among other testimonies by an appeal to the distinct language of the speech from the throne on the dissolution of 1841 that every member who occupied a seat in this house was returned pledged either to oppose or maintain the principle of protection to national industry  adverting to the new position that the experience of the last three years justified the reversal of the system which the existing administration had been summoned to office to uphold he wisely remarked that the country will not be satisfied with three years experience of any system three years experience is not sufficiently extensive to afford a proper criterion by which we may decide the failure or success of any description of policy whatsoever  noticing that the minister had more especially founded his present belief in doctrines contrary to those which he had heretofore uniformly maintained by the assumption that the price of corn would not be more reduced than the price of cattle and other commodities affected by the tariff of 1842 and also by the results of previous experiments in the instances of silk and wool lord george accepted his challenge on these grounds and proceeded in great detail to investigate these examples  the house listened with great attention for full two hours during which he treated these subjects this attention no doubt was generally accorded because it was felt due to the occasion and under the circumstances to the speaker but those who however contrary might be the results at which they had arrived had themselves deeply entered into these investigations recognized very soon that bentinck was master of his subject sir robert peel looked round very often with that expression of appreciation which it was impossible for his nature to refuse to parliamentary success even when the ability displayed was hostile to his projects the minister with reference to the wool trade had dwelt on the year 1842 when prices were much depressed while they had greatly rallied in 1844 when the importation of foreign wool had risen from fortyfive to sixtyfive millions of pounds and he had drawn a triumphant inference that the increase of importation and the increase of price were in consequence of the reduction of the duty this instance had produced a great effect but lord george showed the house by a reference to the tables of 1836 that the importation of foreign wool had then risen to sixtyfive millions of pounds and that large foreign importation was consistent with high prices to the domestic grower nor was he less successful about the foreign cattle he reminded his friends on the treasury bench how strenuously previously to the introduction of the tariff of 1842 they had urged upon their agricultural friends that no foreign cattle could enter under their regulations and that the whole object of the change was to strengthen the hands of the agricultural interest as regarded more essential protection by removing the odium of a nominal protection convinced by my right honourable friends in 1842 that their tariff would be as inoperative as it has proved i gave my cordial support to the measure  perceiving that the house began to be wearied with the details of the silk trade which he had investigated with extraordinary zeal he postponed until the specific vote in committee his objections to the reduction of the timber duties the fact is he had so thoroughly mastered all these topics that his observations on each of them would have themselves formed a speech of sufficient length and interest but he successfully checked any interruption by what may be fairly styled his dignified diffidence  i trust the house will recollect that i am fighting the battle of a party whose leaders have deserted them and though i cannot wield my weapons with the skill of the right honourable gentleman on the treasury bench i trust the house will remember the emergency which has dragged me out to intrude upon their indulgence  and again when he announced that he was now about to investigate the pretext of famine in the land and some impatience was exhibited he drew up and said i think having sat eighteen years in this house and never once having trespassed on its time before in any one single great debate i may appeal to the past as a proof that i duly weigh the measure of my abilities and that i am painfully conscious of my proper place in this house  it was impossible to resist such appeals from such a person even at three oclock in the morning and diffident but determined he then entered into what was perhaps the most remarkable portion of his speechan investigation of what was the real position of the country with respect to the supply of food in the past autumn and at the present moment having shown from the trade circulars that far from there being at present a wheat famine the stocks in the granaries in bond were more than double in amount to what they were in the year 1845 a year admitted by all to be a year of extraordinary abundance he proceeded to the irish part of the question i beg leave to say that though this debate has now continued for three weeks i am the first gentleman who has at all entered into the real state of the case as regards the allegation of a potato famine in ireland upon which be it remembered is founded the sole case of her majestys ministers for a repeal of the corn laws  and this was very true the fact is though the protectionist party had made a most unexpected and gallant defence no one was really prepared for the contest except bentinck between the end of november and the meeting of parliament he had thrown all the energies of his passionate mind into this question he had sought information on all points and always at the fountainhead he had placed himself in immediate communication with the ablest representatives of every considerable interest attacked and being ardent and indefatigable gifted with a tenacious memory and a very clear and searching spirit there was scarcely a detail or an argument connected with his subject which was not immediately at his command no speeches in favour of the protective system have ever been made in the house of commons compared with his in depth and range of knowledge and had there been any member not connected with the government who had been able to vindicate the merits of british agriculture as he did when the final struggle occurred the impression which was made by the toooften unanswered speeches of the manchester confederation would never have been effected but the great conservative party exhausted by the labours of ten years of opposition thought that after the triumph of 41 it might claim a furlough the defence of their cause was left entirely to the ministers of their choice and ministers distracted with detail and wearied with official labour are not always the most willing or the most efficient champions of the organic principles of a party  sir robert peel with respect to the disease in the irish potato had largely referred to the statements of the inspectors of police lord george wanted to know why the reports of the lieutenants of the irish counties were not given being wellinformed upon this head he asked the government to produce the report of lord duncannon the lord lieutenant of carlow especially that of his noble father the earl of besborough lord lieutenant of kilkenny is there any man in england or in ireland whose opinion from his businesslike habits his great practical knowledge and the warm and affectionate interest which for a long period of years he has taken in everything which concerns the interests of ireland especially of the irish peasantryis there any man whose opinion would have greater weight the opinion of lord besborough on an irish subject the lieutenant of an irish county and himself long a cabinet minister well sir i am assured that having taken the utmost pains to investigate this matter lord besborough has made an elaborate report to the irish government well then i desire to know why lord besboroughs report to the irish government is suppressed is it because that report would not assist the present policy of her majestys government  he alleged the names of many other individuals of high station who had officially reported on the subject to the government of lord castlereagh the lieutenant of down a member of the house of lord de vesci whose son was sitting for the queens county over which his father presided in the name of the queen a murmur ran round the house that it would have been as well if these reports had been produced  the last portion of this argumentative harangue referred to the most important division of the subject bentinck met it boldly without evasion nor was there any portion of his address more interesting more satisfactory and more successful i now come he said to the great challenge which is ever and anon put forth by the anticorn law league and now by their disciples her majestys ministers how are we they ask with our limited extent of territory to feed a population annually and rapidly increasing at the rate of three hundred thousand ayear as generally stated by the member for stockporta rate increased by my noble friend the member for the west riding to a thousand a day or three hundred and sixtyfive thousand a year  he first proved in a complete manner that from the year 1821 to the year 1844 the population of the country had increased at the rate of less than thirtytwo per cent while the growth of wheat during the same period had increased no less than sixtyfour per cent he then proceeded to inquire why with such an increased produce we were still as regards bread corn to a certain extent an importing nation this he accounted for by the universally improved condition of the people and the enlarged command of food by the working classes he drew an animated picture founded entirely on the representations of writers and public men adverse to the protective system of the superior condition of the people of england happy england to that of other countries how they consumed much more of the best food and lived much longer this was under protection which lord john russell had stigmatized in his letter the bane of agriculture in the history of my noble friends illustrious family he continued i should have thought that he would have found a remarkable refutation of such a notion and then he drew a lively sketch of the colossal and patriotic works of the earls and dukes of bedford whereby they had drained and reclaimed three hundred thousand acres of land drowned in water and brought them into cultivation and thus converted into fertile fields a vast morass extending over seven counties in england could the system which had inspired such enterprise be justly denounced as baneful  to show the means of the country to sustain even a muchincreasing population and that those means were in operation he entered into one of the most original and interesting calculations that was perhaps ever offered to the house of commons reminding the house that in the preceding year 1845 the farmers of england at a cost of two millions sterling had imported two hundred and eighty thousand tons of guano he proceeded to estimate what would be the effect on the productive powers of the land of that novel application two hundred thousand tons or in other words four million hundredweight were expended on the land in 1845 half of these he assumed would be applied to the growth of wheat and the other half to the growth of turnips preparatory to the wheat crop of the ensuing year according to the experiments tried and recorded in the royal agricultural journal it would seem that by the application of two hundredweight of guano to an acre of wheat land the produce would be increased by one quarter per acre at this rate one hundred thousand tons or two million hundredweight of guano would add one million quarters of wheat to the crop or bread for one year for one million of people but as he was very careful never to overstate a case lord george assumed that it would require three hundred hundredweight of guano to an acre to produce an extra quarter of wheat according to this estimate one hundred thousand tons of guano applied to the land in 1845 must have added six hundred and sixtysix thousand six hundred and sixtysix quarters of grain to the wheat crop or in other words bread for six hundred and sixtysix thousand six hundred and sixtysix additional mouths and now for turnips he continued the norfolk authorities whom he quoted have in like manner proved that two hundredweight of guano will add ten tons per acre to the turnip crop but again for fear of exaggeration he supposed that three hundredweight would be requisite to create such increased fertility in this case two million hundredweight of guano would add six million six hundred and sixtysix thousand six hundred and sixty tons to the natural unmanured produce of the crop now it is generally considered that one ton of swedes would last twenty sheep three weeks and that each sheep should gain half a pound of meat per week or one pound and a half in three weeks thus twenty sheep feeding on one ton of turnips in three weeks should in the aggregate make as the graziers say thirty pounds of mutton but to be safe in his estimate he would assume that one ton of turnips makes only half this quantity multiply then exclaimed bentinck with the earnest air of a crusader six million six hundred and sixtysix thousand six hundred and sixty by fifteen and you have no less than ninetynine million nine hundred and ninetynine thousand and nine hundred pounds of mutton as the fruits of one hundred thousand tons of guano which at ninetytwo pounds per manthe average englishmans allowanceaffords meat for one million eight hundred and sixty thousand nine hundred and fiftyfivenearly two million of her majestys subjects  this is a specimen of those original and startling calculations to which the house was soon to become accustomed from his lips they were received at first with astonishment and incredulity but they were never impugned the fact is he was extremely cautious in his data and no man was more accustomed ever to impress upon his friends the extreme expediency of not overstating a case it should also be remarked of lord george bentinck that in his most complicated calculations he never sought aid from notes  we have necessarily only noticed a few of the traits of this remarkable performance its termination was impressive  we have heard in the course of these discussions a good deal about an ancient monarchy a reformed house of commons and a proud aristocracy sir with regard to our ancient monarchy i have no observation to make but if so humble an individual as myself might be permitted to whisper a word in the ear of that illustrious and royal personage who as he stands nearest so is he justly dearest to her who sits upon the throne i would take leave to say that i cannot but think he listened to ill advice when on the first night of this great discussion he allowed himself to be seduced by the first minister of the crown to come down to this house to usher in to give éclat and as it were by reflection from the queen to give the semblance of the personal sanction of her majesty to a measure which be it for good or for evil a great majority at least of the landed aristocracy of england of scotland and of ireland imagine fraught with deep injury if not ruin to them  a measure which not confined in its operation to this great class is calculated to grind down countless smaller interests engaged in the domestic trades and interests of the empire transferring the profits of all these interestsenglish scotch irish and colonial  great and small alike from englishmen from scotchmen and from irishmen to americans to frenchmen to russians to poles to prussians and to germans sir i come now to the reformed house of commons and as one who was a party to that great measure i cannot but feel a deep interest in its success and more especially in that portion of it which extended the franchise to the largest and the most respectable body in the kingdomi mean the landed tenantry of england and deeply should i regret should any large proportion of those members who have been sent to parliament to represent them in this house prove to be the men to bring lasting dishonour upon themselves their constituencies and this house by an act of tergiversation so gross as to be altogether unprecedented in the annals of any reformed or unreformed house of commons sir lastly i come to the proud aristocracy we are a proud aristocracy but if we are proud it is that we are proud in the chastity of our honour if we assisted in 41 in turning the whigs out of office because we did not consider a fixed duty of eight shillings a quarter on foreign corn a sufficient protection it was with honesty of purpose and in singlemindedness we did so and as we were not before the fact we will not be accomplices after the fact in the fraud by which the whig ministers were expelled from power if we are a proud aristocracy we are proud of our honour inasmuch as we never have been guilty and never can be guilty of doubledealing with the farmers of englandof swindling our opponents deceiving our friends or betraying our constituents  the division was called the westindia interest notwithstanding the amendment was moved by the member for bristol deserted the protectionists deaf to the appeals and the remonstrances and the warnings of lord george one of their leading members replied with a smile of triumphant content that they had made a satisfactory arrangement for themselves how satisfactory did the westindians find it four months subsequently all the shipping interest deserted the land they were for everything free except navigation there was no danger of that being interfered with it rested on quite distinct groundsnational grounds they were warned but they smiled in derisive selfcomplacency lord george bentinck lived to have the westindia interest and the shipping interest on their knees to him to defend their perilled or to restore their ruined fortunes and with characteristic generosity and proud consistency he undertook the task and sacrificed his life in the attempt  notwithstanding these terrible defalcations when the numbers were announced at nearly four oclock in the morning the majority had not reached those three magical figures supposed necessary under the circumstances to success in a house of five hundred and eightyone members present the amendment of the protectionists was defeated only by ninetyseven and two hundred and fortytwo gentlemen in spite of desertion difficulty and defeat still maintained the chastity of their honour     chapter iii       the irish question  in the meantime besides the prolonged and unforeseen resistance of the protectionists there were other and unexpected causes at work which equally or perhaps even more powerfully tended to the fulfilment of the scheme of delay which lord george bentinck had recommended his friends to adopt and encourage  in the latter months of the year 1845 there broke out in some of the counties of ireland one of those series of outrages which have hitherto periodically occurred in districts of that country assassination and crimes of violence were rife men on the queens highway were shot from behind hedges or suddenly torn from their horses and beaten to death with clubs houses were visited in the night by bodies of men masked and armedtheir owners dragged from their beds and in the presence of their wives and children maimed and mutilated the administration of unlawful oaths with circumstances of terror indicated the existence of secret confederations whose fell intents profusely and ostentatiously announced by threatening letters were frequently and savagely perpetrated  these barbarous distempers had their origin in the tenure of land in ireland and in the modes of its occupation a combination of causes political social and economical had for more than a century unduly stimulated the population of a country which had no considerable resources except in the soil that soil had become divided into minute allotments held by a pauper tenantry at exorbitant rents of a class of middlemen themselves necessitous and who were mere traders in land a fierce competition raged amid the squalid multitude for these strips of earth which were their sole means of existence to regulate this fatal rivalry and restrain this emulation of despair the peasantry enrolled in secret societies found refuge in an inexorable code he who supplanted another in the occupation of the soil was doomed by an occult tribunal from which there was no appeal to a terrible retribution his house was visited in the night by whitefeet and ribbonmenhis doom was communicated to him by the post in letters signed by terry alt or molly mguire or he was suddenly shot like a dog by the orders of captain rock yet even these violent inflictions rather punished than prevented the conduct against which they were directed the irish peasant had to choose between starving and assassination if in deference to an anonymous mandate he relinquished his holding he and those who depended on him were outcasts and wanderers if he retained or accepted it his life might be the forfeit but subsistence was secured and in poor and lawless countries the means of living are more valued than life those who have treated of the agrarian crimes of ireland have remarked that the facility with which these outrages have been committed has only been equalled by the difficulty of punishing them a murder perpetrated at noonday in the sight of many persons cannot be proved in a court of justice the spectators are never witnesses and it has been inferred from this that the outrage is national and that the heart of the populace is with the criminal but though a chief landlord or a stipendiary magistrate may occasionally be sacrificed the great majority of victims are furnished by the humblest class not sympathy but terror seals the lip and clouds the eye of the bystander and this is proved by the fact that while those who have suffered have almost always publicly declared that they were unable to recognize their assailants and believed them to be strangers they have frequently in confidence furnished the police with the names of the guilty  thus there is this remarkable characteristic of the agrarian anarchy of ireland which marks it out from all similar conditions of other countries it is a war of the poor against the poor  before the rapid increase of population had forced governments to study political economy and to investigate the means of subsisting a people statesmen had contented themselves by attributing to political causes these predial disturbances and by recommending for them political remedies the course of time which had aggravated the condition of the irish peasantry had increased the numbers the wealth and the general importance of those of the middle classes of ireland who professed the roman catholic faith shut out from the political privileges of the constitution these formed a party of discontent that was a valuable ally to the modern whigs too long excluded from that periodical share of power which is the lifeblood of a parliamentary government and the safeguard of a constitutional monarchy the misgovernment of ireland became therefore a stock topic of the earlier opposition of the present century and advocating the cause of their clients who wished to become mayors and magistrates and members of the legislature they argued that in the concession of those powers and dignities and perhaps in the discreet confiscation of the property of the church the only cures could be found for threatening notices robbery of arms administering of unlawful oaths burglary murder and arson  yet if these acts of violence were attributable to defective political institutions why as was usually the case were they partial in their occurrence why were they limited to particular districts if political grievances were the cause the injustice would be as sharp in tranquil wexford as in turbulent tipperary yet out of the thirtytwo counties of ireland the outrages prevailed usually in less than a third these outrages were never insurrectionary they were not directed against existing authorities they were stimulated by no public cause or clamour it was the private individual who was attacked and for a private reason this was their characteristic  but as time elapsed two considerable events occurred the roman catholic restrictions were repealed and the whigs became ministers notwithstanding these great changes the condition of the irish peasantry remained the same the tenure of land was unchanged the modes of its occupation were unaltered its possession was equally necessary and equally perilous the same circumstances produced the same consequences notwithstanding even that the irish church had been remodelled and its revenues not only commuted but curtailed notwithstanding that roman catholics had not only become members of parliament but even parliament had been reformed irish outrage became more flagrant and more extensive than at any previous epochand the whigs were ministers  placed in this responsible position forced to repress the evil the causes of which they had so often explained and which with their cooperation had apparently been so effectually removed the whig government were obliged to have recourse to the very means which they had so frequently denounced when recommended by their rivals and that too on a scale of unusual magnitude and severity they proposed for the adoption of parliament one of those measures which would suspend the constitution of ireland and which are generally known by the name of coercion acts  the main and customary provisions of these coercion acts were of severe restraint and scarcely less violent than the conduct they were constructed to repress they invested the lord lieutenant with power to proclaim a district as disturbed and then to place its inhabitants without the pale of the established law persons out of their dwellings between sunset and sunrise were liable to transportation and to secure the due execution of the law prisoners were tried before military tribunals and not by their peers whose verdicts from sympathy or terror were usually found to baffle justice  these coercion acts were effectual they invariably obtained their end and the proclaimed districts became tranquil but they were an affair of police not of government essentially temporary their effect was almost as transient as their sway and as they were never accompanied with any deep and sincere attempt to cope with the social circumstances which produced disorder the recurrence of the chronic anarchy was merely an affair of time whether it were that they did not sufficiently apprehend the causes or that they shrank from a solution which must bring them in contact with the millions of a surplus population there seems always to have been an understanding between the public men of both parties that the irish difficulty should be deemed a purely political or at the utmost a religious one and even so late as 1846 no less a personage than the present chief secretary put forward by his party to oppose an irish coercion bill which themselves had loudly called for declared that he could not sanction its penal enactments unless they were accompanied by the remedial measures that were necessary to wit an irish franchise bill and a bill for the amendment of municipal corporations  when sir robert peel in 1841 after a memorable opposition of ten years acceded to office sustained by all the sympathies of the country his irish policy not sufficiently noticed amid the vast and urgent questions with which he had immediately to deal was however to the political observer significant and interesting as a mere matter of party tactics it was not for him too much to impute irish disturbances to political and religious causes even if the accumulated experience of the last ten years were not developing a conviction in his mind that the methods hitherto adopted to ensure the tranquillity of that country were superficial and fallacious his cabinet immediately recognized a distinction between political and predial sources of disorder the first they resolved into a mere system of agitation no longer justifiable by the circumstances and this they determined to put down the second they sought in the conditions under which land was occupied and these they determined to investigate hence on the one hand the oconnell prosecution on the other the devon commission  this was the bold and prudent policy of a minister who felt he had the confidence of the country and was sustained by great parliamentary majorities and when the summoner of monster meetings was convicted and the efficient though impartial manner in which the labours of the land commission were simultaneously conducted came to be bruited about there seemed at last some prospect of the system of political quackery of which ireland had been so long the victim being at last subverted but there is nothing in which the power of circumstances is more evident than in politics they baffle the forethought of statesmen and control even the apparently inflexible laws of national development and decay  had the government of 1841 succeeded in its justifiable expectation of terminating the trade of political agitation in ireland armed with all the authority and all the information with which the labours of the land commission would have furnished them they would in all probability have successfully grappled with the real causes of irish misery and misrule they might have thoroughly reformed the modes by which land is holden and occupied have anticipated the spontaneous emigration that now rages by an administrative enterprise scarcely more costly than the barren loan of 47 and which would have wafted native energies to imperial shores have limited under these circumstances the evil of the potato famine even if the improved culture of the interval might not have altogether prevented that visitation while the laws which regulated the competition between home and foreign industry in agricultural produce might have been modified with so much prudence or if necessary ultimately repealed with so much precaution that those rapid and startling vicissitudes that have so shattered the social fabric of ireland might altogether have been avoided  but it was decreed that it should be otherwise having achieved the incredible conviction of oconnell by an irish jury the great culprit baffled the vengeance of the law by a quirk which a lawyer only could have devised as regards his irish policy sir robert peel never recovered this blow the severity of which was proportionably increased by its occurrence at a moment of unprecedented success resolute not to recur to his ancient orangeism yet desperate after his discomfiture of rallying a moderate party around his ministry his practical mind more clearsighted than foreseeing was alarmed at the absence of all influences for the government of ireland the tranquillity which might result from a reformed tenure of the soil must if attainable be a distant blessing and at present he saw only the obstacles to its fulfilmentprejudiced landlords and the claims and necessities of pauper millions he shrank from a theory which might be an illusion he required a policy for the next post and the next division there was in his view only one course to take to outbid his predecessors as successfully in irish politics as he was doing in taxes and tariffs he resolved to appropriate the liberal party of ireland and merge it into the great conservative confederation which was destined to destroy so many things he acted with promptitude and energy for sir robert peel never hesitated when he had made up his mind his real character was very different from his public reputation far from being timid and wary he was audacious and even headstrong it was his cold and constrained demeanour that misled the public there never was a man who did such rash things in so circumspect a manner he had been fortunate in early disembarrassing himself of the orange counsellors who had conducted his irish questions when in opposition vacant judgeships had opportunely satisfied the recognized and respectable claims of mr serjeant jackson and mr lefroy and so sir robert peel without a qualm suddenly began to govern ireland by sending it messages of peace  they took various forms sometimes a charitable bequests act virtually placed the roman catholic hierarchy in friendly equality with the prelates of the established church sometimes a godless college called forth a moan from alarmed and irritated oxford the endowment of maynooth struck wider and deeper and the middleclasses of england roused from their religious lethargy called in vain to the rescue of a protestantism betrayed but the minister was unshaken successful and selfsufficient impressed with a conviction that his government in duration would rival that of a walpole or a pitt and exceed both in lustre he treated every remonstrance with imperious disdain he had even accustomed his mind to contemplate an ecclesiastical adjustment of ireland which would have allied in that country the papacy with the state and have terminated the constitutional supremacy of the anglican church when suddenly in the very heat of all this arrogant fortune the mighty fabric of delusion shivered and fell to the ground  an abused and indignant soil repudiated the ungrateful race that had exhausted and degraded its once exuberant bosom the land refused to hold those who would not hold the land on terms of justice and of science all the economical palliatives and political pretences of long years seemed only to aggravate the suffering and confusion the poorrate was levied upon a community of paupers and the godless colleges were denounced by rome as well as oxford  after a wild dream of famine and fever imperial loans rates in aid jobbing public works confiscated estates constituencies selfdisfranchised and st peters bearding st jamess in a spirit becoming christendom rather than europe time topped the climax of irish misgovernment and by the publication of the census of 1851 proved that the millions with whose evils no statesmen would sincerely deal but whose condition had been the pretext for so much empiricism had disappeared and nature more powerful than politicians had settled the great difficulty  ere the publication of that document the mortal career of sir robert peel had closed and indeed several of the circumstances to which we have just alluded did not occur in his administration but the contrast between his policy and its results was nevertheless scarcely less striking it was in 45 that he transmitted his most important message of peace to ireland to be followed by an autumnal visit of her majesty to that kingdom painted in complacent and prophetic colours by her prime minister the visit was not made in the course of that autumn ten counties of ireland were in a state of anarchy and mainly in that period there were 136 homicides committed 138 houses burned 483 houses attacked and 138 fired into there were 544 cases of aggravated assault and 551 of robbery of arms there were 89 cases of bands appearing in arms there were more than 200 cases of administering unlawful oaths and there were 1944 cases of sending threatening letters by the end of the year the general crime of ireland had doubled in amount and enormity compared with the preceding year     chapter iv       the cure for irish ills  lord george bentinck had large but defined views as to the policy which should be pursued with respect to ireland he was a firm supporter of the constitutional preponderance allotted to the land in our scheme of government not from any jealousy or depreciation of the other great sources of public wealth for his sympathy with the trading classes was genuine but because he believed that constitutional preponderance while not inconsistent with great commercial prosperity to be the best security for public liberty and the surest foundation of enduring power but as reality was the characteristic of his vigorous and sagacious nature he felt that a merely formal preponderance one not sustained and authorized by an equivalent material superiority was a position not calculated to endure in the present age and one especially difficult to maintain with our rapidly increasing population for this reason he was always very anxious to identify the policy of great britain with that of ireland the latter being a country essentially agricultural and he always shrank from any proposition which admitted a difference in the interests of the two kingdoms  liberal politicians who some years ago were very loud for justice to ireland and would maintain at all hazards the identity of the interests of the two countries have of late frequently found it convenient to omit that kingdom from their statistical bulletins of national prosperity lord george bentinck on the contrary would impress on his friends that if they wished to maintain the territorial constitution of their country they must allow no sectarian considerations to narrow the basis of sympathy on which it should rest and in the acres and millions of ireland in its soil and its people equally neglected he would have sought the natural auxiliaries of our institutions to secure for our irish fellowsubjects a regular market for their produce to develop the resources of their country by public works on a great scale and to obtain a decent provision for the roman catholic priesthood from the land and not from the consolidated fund were three measures which he looked upon as in the highest degree conservative  when the project of the cabinet of 1846 had transpired lord george at once declared and was in the habit of reiterating his opinion that it would ruin the 500000 small farmers of ireland and he watched with great interest and anxiety the conduct of their representatives in the house of commons it was with great difficulty that he could bring himself to believe that political liberalism would induce the members for the south and west of ireland to support a policy in his opinion so fatal to their countrymen as the unconditional repeal of the corn laws and indeed before they took that step which almost all of them have since publicly regretted and attempted to compensate for by their subsequent votes in the house of commons the prospect of their conduct frequently and considerably varied  the earl of st germans the chief secretary of the lord lieutenant introduced the coercion bill to the house of lords on the 24th of february and considering the exigency and the important reference to it in the speech from the throne this step on the part of the government was certainly not precipitate it was observed that the strongest supporters of the measure in the house of lords on this occasion were the leaders of the whig party lord lansdowne so far from complaining of the government for bringing forward the measure at so early a period of the session was ready to admit that after the declaration of her majesty a declaration unhappily warranted by facts known to many of their lordships every day was lost in which an effectual remedy was not at least attempted to put an end to a state of society so horrible lord clanricarde gave his ready assent to the bill and even lord grey though he regretted the necessity for this measure was of opinion that the chief secretary had established a sufficient case for arming the executive government with some additional powers when therefore at the end of the month of march lord george bentinck was invited to attend a meeting of his friends held at the house of mr bankes to consider the course which should be adopted by the protectionist party with respect to the coercion bill it was assumed as a matter of course that the coalition of the government and the whigs must secure the passing of the measure even if the protectionists were disposed for the chance of embarrassing the ministry to resist it and of course there was no great tendency in that direction men are apt to believe that crime and coercion are inevitably associated there was abundance of precedent for the course which seemed also a natural one  in less than a century there had been seventeen coercive acts for ireland a circumstance which might make some ponder whether such legislation were as efficacious as it was violent however assassination rife captain rock and molly mguire out at night whigs and tories all agreed it was easy to catch at a glance the foregone conclusion of the meeting one advantage of having a recognized organ of a political party is that its members do not decide too precipitately they listen before they determine and if they have a doubt they will grant the benefit of it to him whose general ability they have acknowledged and to whom they willingly give credit for having viewed the question at issue in a more laborious and painful manner than themselves without a leader they commit themselves to opinions carelessly and hastily adopted this is fatal to a party in debate but it often entails very serious consequences when the mistakes have been committed in a less public and responsible scene than the house of commons  in the present case there was only one individual who took any considerable lead in the management of the party who ventured to suggest the expediency of pausing before they pledged themselves to support an unconstitutional measure proposed by a government against which they were arrayed under circumstances of urgent and unusual opposition the support of an unconstitutional measure may be expedient but it cannot be denied that it is the most indubitable evidence of confidence this suggestion though received with kindness elicited little sympathy and lord george bentinck who had not yet spoken and who always refrained at these meetings from taking that directing part which he never wished to assume marking the general feeling of those present and wishing to guide it to a practical result advantageous to their policy observed that the support of the coercion bill by the protectionists ought to be made conditional on the government proving the sincerity of their policy by immediately proceeding with their measure that if life were in such danger in ireland as was officially stated and as he was bound to believe no corn or customs bill could compete in urgency with the necessity of pressing forward a bill the object of which was to arrest wholesale assassination he was therefore for giving the government a hearty support provided they proved they were in earnest in their determination to put down murder and outrage in ireland by giving a priority in the conduct of public business to the measure in question  this view of the situation which was certainly adroit for it combined the vindication of order with an indefinite delay of the measures for the repeal of the protective system seemed to please every one there was a murmur of approbation and when one of the most considerable of the country gentlemen expressed the prevalent feeling and added that all that was now to be desired was that lord george bentinck would kindly consent to be the organ of the party on the occasion and state their view to the house the cheering was very hearty it came from the hearts of more than two hundred gentlemen scarcely one of whom had a personal object in this almost hopeless struggle beyond the maintenance of a system which he deemed advantageous to his country but they wished to show their generous admiration of the man who in the dark hour of difficulty and desertion had proved his courage and resource had saved them from public contempt and taught them to have confidence in themselves and after all there are few rewards in life which equal such sympathy from such men the favour of courts and the applause of senates may have their moments of excitement and delight but the incident of deepest and most enduring gratification in public life is to possess the cordial confidence of a highspirited party for it touches the heart as well as the intellect and combines all the softer feelings of private life with the ennobling consciousness of public duty  lord george bentinck deeply moved consented to become the organ of the protectionists in this matter but he repeated in a marked manner his previous declaration that his duty must be limited to the occasion he would serve with them but he could not pretend to be the leader of a party in that capacity however the government chose to recognize him and there occurred in consequence very shortly after this meeting a scene in the house of commons which occasioned at the time a great deal of surprise and scandal the secretary of the treasury in pursuance of one of his principal duties which is to facilitate by mutual understanding the conduct of public business in the house of commons applied to lord george bentinck confessedly at the request of sir robert peel to enter into some arrangement as to the conduct of public business before easter the arrangement suggested was that if the protectionists supported the coercion bill which it was the wish of sir robert peel should be read a first time before easter the third reading of the bill for the repeal of the corn laws should be postponed until after easter the interview by appointment took place in the vote office where the secretary of the treasury called lord george aside and made this proposition lord george stated in reply what he believed to be the views of the party with whom he served and they were those we have already intimated the arrangement was concluded and it was at the same time agreed that certain questions of which notice had been given by lord john russell relative to the progress of these very measures should be allowed by the protectionists to pass sub silentio this pledge made by the noble lord for himself and his friends was scrupulously observed nevertheless after all this a letter arrived from the secretary of the treasury addressed to the noble lord stating that the secretary had not been authorized in saying as much as he had said and requesting that the conversation which had taken place might be considered private upon this lord george bentinck drew up a statement setting forth all that had passed and forwarded it to the secretary as his reply subsequently he met that gentleman who admitted that every word in that statement as respected the conversation which had passed was perfectly correct  this being the state of the case on the second night of the debate on mr eliot yorkes amendment which we have noticed and after the adjournment had been moved and carried the government proceeded with some motions of form which indicated their intention to secure if possible the third reading of the corn bill before easter upon this lord george bentinck after a hurried and apparently agitated conversation with the secretary of the treasury and others connected with the government rose to move the adjournment of the house he then gave as his reason the circumstances which we have briefly conveyed a scene of considerable confusion occurred the secretary of the treasury admitted the correctness of the statement the first lord of the treasury rejected the alleged authority of the secretary mr tuffnell on the part of the whigs intimated that public business could not be carried on if the recognized organs were repudiated by their chief the feeling of all parties coincided with mr tuffnell finally an irish repealer rose and announced that the government were bartering their corn bill to secure coercion to ireland lord george bentinck said the coercion bill was a second curfew act that nothing but necessity could justify it and if it were necessary it must be immediate sir robert remained irritated and obstinate he would not give up a stage either of the corn bill or the coercion bill he wanted to advance both before easter the mere division of the house between freetraders and protectionists had already ceased there were breakers ahead and it was not difficult from this night to perceive that the course of the government would not be so summary as they had once expected  this strange interlude occurred after midnight on the 26th of march on friday the 27th the house divided on the amendment of mr eliot yorke and the corn bill was read for the second time on the reassembling of the house on monday the 30th an extraordinary scene took place  it appears that the cabinet after painful deliberation had arrived at the conclusion that notwithstanding the importance of sending up the corn bill to the house of lords before easter it was absolutely necessary to proceed at once with the coercion bill and it was resolved that the secretary of state should on this evening lay before the house the facts and reasons which induce the government to believe in the necessity of the measure mr oconnell and his followers had already announced their intention of opposing the first reading of the bill an allowable but very unusual course it is competent to the house of commons to refuse a first reading to any bill sent down to it but the journals afford few examples of the exercise of such a privilege a member of the house of lords may lay on the table as a matter of pure right any bill which he thinks proper to introduce and it is read a first time as a matter of course the orders of the house of commons are different and a member must obtain permission before he introduces a bill this permission is occasionally refused but when a bill comes from the house of lords the almost invariable custom is to read it for the first time without discussion there are however as we have observed instances to the contrary and the irish coercion bill of 33 was one of them so pregnant a precedent could not be forgotten on the present occasion the government therefore were prepared for an opposition to the first reading of their bill but trusting to the strength of their case and the assumed support of the whig party they believed that this opposition would not be stubborn more especially as there were numerous stages of the measure on which the views of its opponents might be subsequently expressed and as they themselves were prepared to engage that they would not proceed further than this first reading until the corn bill had passed the house of commons the consternation therefore of the government could scarcely be concealed when they found on monday night that they had to encounter a wellorganized party opposition headed by sir william somerville and sanctioned and supported in debate by lord john russell and sir george grey  it would seem indeed a difficult and somewhat graceless office for the whigs to oppose the first reading of a government bill concerning too the highest duties of administration which had received such unqualified approval from all the leading members of their party in the house of lords who had competed in declarations of its necessity and acknowledgments of its moderation while they only regretted the too tardy progress of a measure so indispensable to the safety of the country and the security of her majestys subjects a curious circumstance however saved them from this dilemma which yet in the strange history of faction they had nevertheless in due time to encounter  as the coercion bill coming from the lords appeared on the paper of the day in the form of a notice of motion the secretary of state this being a day on which orders have precedence had to move that such orders of the day should be postponed so that he might proceed with the motion on the state of ireland of which notice had been given the strict rule of the house is that on mondays and fridays orders of the day should have precedence of notices of motion so that it was impossible for the secretary of state to make his motion that a certain bill the protection of lifeirelandbill should be read a first time without permission of the house a permission always granted as a matter of course on such nights to the government since the business which can be brought forward whether in the shape of orders or motions is purely government business and thus the interests and privilege of no independent member of parliament can be affected by a relaxation of the rules which the convenience of a ministry and the conduct of public business occasionally require however on this night no sooner had the secretary of state made in a few formal words this formal request than up sprang sir william somerville to move an amendment that the orders of the day should not be postponed which he supported in a spirited address mainly on the ground of the great inconvenience that must be suffered from the postponement of the corn bill the motion of the secretary of state would produce a long exciting and exasperating debate time would be lostfor what to advance one stage of a measure which it was avowedly not the intention of the government to press at the present moment sir william concluded with a very earnest appeal to lord george bentinck and his friends who might at no very distant period have the government of ireland entrusted to them not for the sake of a momentary postponement of the corn bill to place themselves by voting for this measure of coercion in collision with the irish nation he called upon lord george bentinck to weigh the position in which he was placed  this amendment was seconded by mr smith obrien the member for the county of limerick who warned the government that they were entering on a contest which would continue for months he taunted the minister with governing the country without a party what chance was there of reconciliation with his estranged friends after the treatment of that disavowed plenipotentiary the secretary of the treasury who would be again found willing to undertake the mission of patching up a truce he was not present when the terms of the treaty were exposed but he understood that if the government introduced this coercion bill before easter then that lord george bentinck would deem it wise proper and expedient but if after easter then the complexion and character of the bill were in the noble lords judgment utterly transformed and it was declared to be quite untenable and unconstitutional was that the kind of support on which the government calculated for passing this measure  the secretary of state made a dexterous conciliatory almost humble address in reply to the taunts of mr smith obrien he said that he was well aware of the fact of which he had been just reminded that in the present state of parties the declared adherents of the government were a small minority he even while excusing the delay in the progress of the irish measure reminded the house of the curious fact that since the meeting of parliament two successive irish secretaries had lost their seats in the house of commons in consequence of supporting the administration of which they were members  the case of the government was really so good and clear that for a moment it seemed the opposition could hardly persist in their unusual proceeding but this was a night of misfortunes  there had been for some time a smouldering feud between the secretary and the recorder of dublin the learned gentleman had seized the occasion which the present state of parties afforded and in the course of the recent debate on the second reading of the corn bill had declared that the asserted famine in ireland was on the part of the government a great exaggeration the secretary had addressed himself particularly to this observation in his speech on the 27th the night of the division and had noticed it in a tone of acerbity he had even intimated that it might have been used by one who was a disappointed solicitor for high office and whom the government had declined to assist in an unwarrantable arrangement of the duties and salary of the judicial post he at present occupied the learned recorder justly indignant at this depreciating innuendo resolved to make an opportunity on the following monday for his vindication and retort he rose therefore immediately after the skilful and winning appeal of the secretary and pronounced an invective against the right honourable gentleman which was neither illconceived nor illdelivered it revived the passions that for a moment seemed inclined to lull and the protectionists who on this occasion were going to support the government forgot the common point of union while the secretary was described as the evil genius of the cabinet  after this it was impossible to arrest the course of debate mr oconnell who appeared to be in a state of great debility made one of those acute points for which he was distinguished he said the government complained of the threat held out by those who opposed the bill that they would avail themselves of the forms of the house to give it every opposition in their power but what did the government do themselves why they were trying to trample upon one of the sessional orders and to abrogate the forms of the house in order to coerce the irish people lord george bentinck said that the chief minister had told them that this was a bill to put down murder and assassination in that case if this bill were delayed the blood of every man murdered in ireland was on the head of her majestys ministers sir george grey followed and avoiding any discussion of the state of ireland in which lord george had entered supported the amendment of sir william somerville on the broad ground that the bill for the repeal of the corn laws ought not to be for a moment delayed the debates on that measure had continued several weeks and all who had any lengthened parliamentary experience must be convinced that if the further progress of the corn bill was postponed until after easter they would have much longer and protracted debates in its future stages than if the bill were pushed de die in diem as he had understood the government had intended that this bill should have gone up to the house of lords before easter when it would have been printed and the second reading could have taken place at an early day after the holidays but if it were put off until after easter he would defy any man to show any reasonable expectation of its getting to a second reading in the other house before june or july or even august this was encouraging and the plot seemed to thicken the secretary at war was put up by the government to neutralize the effect of the speech of sir george grey and he said i speak not only as a cabinet minister but also as a considerable irish proprietor he said that anything so horrible as the state of demoralization and crime in which many parts of ireland were plunged anything so perfect as the suspension of the law in those parts of the country anything in short so complete as the abrogation of liberty that obtained there was perhaps never known he thought that no man and no minister could under these circumstances decline to admit that every and any measure ought to be postponed until a division had been taken at least upon the principle of a measure which had for its object the suppression of these horrors after such a declaration it was clear the government were in a false position when by the same organ it had to state that in asking to read this bill tonight they only intended to postpone the corn bill for one night  lord john russell following admitted that in voting for the motion of sir william somerville it was not to be supposed that if the secretary of state made out a case he would not support the government bill yet how the secretary was ever to find an opportunity of making out his case if the amendment of sir william somerville was carried was not very apparent sir robert peel who was disquieted by the whole proceedings connected with the coercion bill irritated by the episode of the disavowed plenipotentiary from which he did not for some time recover and really alarmed at the indefinite prospect of delay in passing his allimportant measures which now began to open could not conceal his vexation in the remarks which he offered and speaking of the amendment as one of a frivolous character indignant cries of no no from his usual admirers obliged him to withdraw the expression his feelings were not soothed when later in the evening even mr cobden rose to deplore the conduct of that minister whom he otherwise so much admired he certainly regarded it as a great calamity something had actuated the government which he could not understand he had a perfect belief in the sincerity of the prime minister but in all human probability the corn bill would not now enter the house of lords before the beginning or middle of may and when it would come out again heaven only knew  the house now divided and being supported by all the protectionists present the government had a majority of thirtynine so the standing order was for that night rescinded and although the hour was late for such a statement the secretary proceeded with the official exposition notwithstanding the depressing circumstances of the previous debate the speech of sir james graham was distinguished by all that lucid arrangement of details and that comprehensive management of his subject which distinguished him the statement made a great impression upon the house and the country but unfortunately for the government the more necessary they made the measure appear the more unjustifiable was their conduct in not immediately and vehemently pursuing it they had indeed in the speech from the throne at the commencement of this memorable session taken up a false position for their campaign and we shall see as we pursue this narrative of these interesting events that the fall of sir robert peel was perhaps occasioned not so much by his repeal of the corn laws as by the mistake in tactics which this adroit and experienced parliamentary commander so strangely committed  on this night of the 30th the government made no advance immediately after the secretary had finished the followers of mr oconnell moved the adjournment of the house and persisted in this line notwithstanding the almost querulous appeal of the first minister     chapter v       the passing of oconnell  lord george wrote the next morning tuesday march 31st to a friend who had not been able to attend the debate i look upon last night as the most awkward night the government have had yet i believe they would have given their ears to have been beaten we have now fairly set them and the tail at loggerheads and i cannot see how they are to get another stage of either the tariff or corn bill before next tuesday at any rate i doubt if they will do anything before easter  it was understood that the house would adjourn for the easter recess on the 8th instant there were therefore only two nights remaining for government business before the holidays on the first of these friday april the 3rd mr oconnell had announced that he should state his views at length on the condition of ireland and the causes of these agrarian outrages accordingly when the order of the day for resuming the adjourned debate was read he rose at once to propose an amendment to the motion he sat in an unusual placein that generally occupied by the leader of the oppositionand spoke from the red box convenient to him from the number of documents to which he had to refer his appearance was of great debility and the tones of his voice were very still his words indeed only reached those who were immediately around him and the ministers sitting on the other side of the green table who listened with that interest and respectful attention which became the occasion  it was a strange and touching spectacle to those who remembered the form of colossal energy and the clear and thrilling tones that had once startled disturbed and controlled senates mr oconnell was on his legs for nearly two hours assisted occasionally in the management of his documents by some devoted aidedecamp to the house generally it was a performance in dumb show a feeble old man muttering before a table but respect for the great parliamentary personage kept all as orderly as if the fortunes of a party hung upon his rhetoric and though not an accent reached the gallery means were taken that next morning the country should not lose the last and not the least interesting of the speeches of one who had so long occupied and agitated the mind of nations  this remarkable address was an abnegation of the whole policy of mr oconnells career it proved by a mass of authentic evidence ranging over a long term of years that irish outrage was the consequence of physical misery and that the social evils of that country could not be successfully encountered by political remedies to complete the picture it concluded with a panegyric of ulster and a patriotic quotation from lord clare  lord john russell who as an experienced parliamentary leader had already made more than one effort to extricate the whigs from the consequences of the hearty support given to the government measures in the other house by lords lansdowne and clanricarde and even by lord grey ventured tonight even to say that if he should agree that the house would do well to assent to the first reading of this bill he thought he was bound to state also that in the future stages of it he should have objections to offer going to the foundations of some of its principal provisions  his speech was curious as perhaps the last considerable manifesto of whig delusion respecting ireland coercion bills might be occasionally necessary no doubt of it lord grey had once a coercion bill and lord john russell had voted for it but then remedial measures ought to be introduced with coercive ones the evil should be repressed but also cured thus lord althorp when the government introduced their great coercion bill introduced also a measure which besides making a great reform in the protestant church of ireland exempted the whole catholic community of ireland from the payment of church cess which had previously been felt as a very great grievance on another day lord althorp declared his intention of pressing through parliament a jury bill which had been brought into the house the previous session but which was allowed to drop in the house of lords  again there was another declaration which lord althorp had made which somehow or other seemed to have been forgotten it was a declaration with respect to the municipal corporations of ireland lord althorp said it was exceedingly desirable that the institutions of the two countries should be assimilated as much as possible and that as a general rule the corporate bodies of ireland should be the same as england mr oconnell had said on that occasion that there was no greater grievance in ireland than the existence of corporations in their then shape lord john contrasted this language of lord althorp simple plain emphatic and decided with the language of the government of sir robert peel and held up to admiration the whig policy of 1833 certainly coercive but with remedial measuresa measure for the abolition of church cess introduced ten days before the coercion bill and a promise of municipal reform made simultaneously with the proclamation of martial law this was real statesmanship and touching the root of the evil whereas sir robert peel had only consented to passing the municipal bill in a crippled state and only now in 1846 promised that the corporations of ireland should be placed on the same footing as the corporations of england who could be surprised that such a policyshould end in famine and pestilence  the followers of mr oconnell again succeeded in adjourning the debate until monday the 6th on that day sir robert peel made an earnest appeal to extricate himself from the almost perilous position in which he found his administration suddenly involved in case the division on the first reading of the irish bill should not take place that night he endeavoured to prevail on those members who had notices on the paper for the following night tuesday the 7th the last night before the holidays to relinquish their right and to permit the irish debate to proceed and conclude he had no wish to interfere with the due discussion of the measure but he believed that the irish members if they permitted the house to proceed with the corn bill by concluding the discussion on the irish bill would be rendering an essential service to their country  but this earnest appeal only influenced still more the fiery resolves of mr smith obrien and his friends they threw the responsibility for delay of the corn bill on the government the inconvenience which the country suffered was occasioned by the minister not by the irish members he ought on friday last to have adjourned the discussion on the coercion bill until after easter he and other members who were on the paper for tomorrow would willingly relinquish their right of priority in favour of the corn bill or of any measure of a remedial kind but not in favour of a coercion bill he did not wish to have any concealment with the minister as to the course which the irish members would pursue it was their bounden duty to take care that pari passu with the discussion of the coercion bill there should be discussions as to the misgovernment of ireland and that in the absence of any remedial measures of the government they should have an opportunity of suggesting such as they thought advisable for removing those evils which they utterly denied that the measure now before the house would remove  in vain sir robert in his blandest tones and with that remarkable command of a temper not naturally serene which distinguished him acknowledged to a certain degree the propriety of the course intimated by mr smith obrien but suggested at the same time that it was compatible with allowing the irish bill to be now read for a first time since on its subsequent stages mr obrien and his friends would have the full opportunity which they desired of laying before the house the whole condition of the country all was useless no less a personage than mr john oconnell treated the appeal with contempt and lectured the first minister on the great mistake which he had made little traits like these revealed the true parliamentary position of the once omnipotent leader of the great conservative party with the legions of the protectionists watching their prey in grim silence while the liberal sections were united in hostile manouvres against the government it was recognised at once that the great minister had a staff without an army not a reconnoitring could take place without the whole cabinet being under orders and scarcely a sharpshooter sallied from the opposite ranks without the prime minister returning his fire in person  sir robert peel mournfully observed that he did not wish to provoke a recriminatory discussion and he resigned himself to his fate immediately the third night of the adjourned debate on the irish bill commenced and was sustained principally by the irish members until a late hour it had not been the intention of lord george bentinck to have spoken on this occasion though he had never been absent for a moment from his seat and watched all that occurred with that keen relish which was usual with him when he thought things were going right but having been personally and not very courteously appealed to by the late mr dillon browne and deeming also the occasion just before the holidays a not unhappy one he rose and concluded the debate his speech was not long it was not prepared and it was very animated  recapitulating himself the main features of the disturbed district he said it is because of these things sir that i am prepared to support at least the first reading of a bill which i freely admit to be most unconstitutional in itself  noticing a speech made in the course of the evening by lord morpeth who had himself once been chief secretary of the lord lieutenant lord george thought it discreet to remind the house of the unequivocal support given to this bill by the whig leaders in another place sir i think when we see all the great leaders of the whig party supporting the measure elsewhere we cannot be justly impugned for doing as they do lord morpeth had referred to remedial measures which he thinks should be introduced for ireland to measures for the extension of the municipal and also of the parliamentary franchise of that country and he expressed his desire to see those franchises put on the same footing as the franchises of england for the life of me exclaimed lord george i confess i cannot see in what way the extension of political franchises of any description in ireland would afford a remedy for the evils which this measure aims to suppress i think sir it is impossible not to perceive that there is a connection between agrarian outrage and the poverty of the people  after noticing the inadequate poorlaw which then existed in ireland he added there is also another point immediately connected with this subject to which i must refer i allude sir to the system of absenteeism i cannot disguise from myself the conviction that many of the evils of ireland arise from the system of receiving rents by absentee landlords who spend them in other countries i am well aware that in holding this doctrine i am not subscribing to the creed of political economists i am well aware that messrs senior and mculloch hold that it makes no difference whether the irish landlord spends his rents in dublin on his irish estates in london in bath or elsewhere i profess sir i cannot understand that theory i believe that the first ingredient in the happiness of a people is that the gentry should reside on their native soil and spend their rents among those from whom they receive them i cannot help expressing a wish that some arrangement may be made connected with the levying of the poorrate in ireland by which absentee landlords may be made to contribute in something like a fair proportion to the wants of the poor in the district in which they ought to reside there is an arrangement in the hopgrowing districts in england in respect to tithe which might i think afford a very useful suggestion there are two tithes the one the ordinary tithe the other extraordinary which is levied only so long as the land is cultivated in hops i think if there were two poorrates introduced into ireland the one applying to all occupiers of land and the other to all those who did not spend a certain portion of the year on some portion of their estates in ireland it would prove useful i think that by thus appealing to their interests it might induce absentee landlords to reside much more in ireland than is now unfortunately the case  but sir i think there are other remedial measures some days ago the secretary of state told the member for stroud mr poulett scrope when he suggested some such measure that he was treading on dangerous ground and that the doctrines he was advocating might be written in letters of blood in ireland but notwithstanding all this i still say that i think measures might be introduced for improving the relations between landlord and tenant in ireland i do not think that some guarantee might and ought to be given to the tenantry of ireland for the improvements they make upon their farms  sir the secretary of state in introducing this measure maintained a doctrine which i think much more likely to be written in letters of blood for he bound up the question of the corn laws with the present one he said that unless he could have prevailed on his colleagues to accede to his freetrade measures as regards corn he would not have introduced this bill why sir far from giving food to the people of ireland in my opinion the measures of her majestys ministers will take away from the people of ireland their food by destroying the profits of their only manufacturethe manufacture of cornand injuring their agriculture depriving them of employment in fact by taking away from them the very means of procuring subsistence sir i cannot see how the repeal of those laws affecting corn can be in any way connected with the suppression of outrage and the protection of life what is this but to say that unless we have a free trade in corn we must be prepared to concede a free trade in agrarian outragea free trade in maiming and houghing cattlea free trade in incendiarisma free trade in the burning and sacking of housesa free trade in midnight murder and in noonday assassination what is this but telling the people of ireland that assassination murder incendiarism are of such light consideration in the eyes of the secretary of state that their sanction or suppression by the minister of the crown hinges upon the condition of the corn market and the difference in the price of potatoes  sir what has the potato disease to do with the outrages in ireland some think a great deal i have taken the trouble of looking into the matter i have examined into the state of crime in at least five countiestipperary roscommon limerick leitrim and clareand i find that during the three months prior to the first appearance of the potato disease and when in fact food was as cheap in ireland as at almost any former periodwhen plenty abounded in all quarters of the empire that the amount of crime exceeded that in the three months immediately following now those who doubt this statement will have an opportunity of ascertaining the correctness of my figures for i will not deal in general assertions well then sir i find in the three months may june and july last that the number of crimes committed in the five counties i have mentioned amounted to no less than 1180 while in the three months immediately after the potato disease or famine as it is called the amount of crime committed in the same three months was not 1180 but 870 i should like to know therefore what this agrarian outrage has to do with the potato famine and where is the justification for a minister coming down to this house and declaring that unless we pass a freetrade measure we are not to obey her majestys commands by passing a measure for the protection of life in ireland why sir i think when this language reaches the people of irelandcoming too as it does from the treasury above all from the secretary of state for the home departmentthere is indeed danger to be apprehended that such a doctrine may be written in letters of blood in that country why sir if we are to hear such language as this from that minister of the crown charged with the peace of the country we may just as well have captain rock established as lord lieutenant in the castle of dublin a whitefoot for chief secretary and molly mguire installed at whitehall with the seals of the home department  and afterwards he remarked i have been taunted that when i may be entrusted with the government of ireland i should perhaps then learn that tyrone was an orange county sir in answer to that taunt i must take leave to ask what expression of mine either in this house or out of it justifies any such remark when or where can it be said that i have ever permitted myself to know any distinction between an orangeman and a catholic when in the whole course of my parliamentary career have i ever given a vote or uttered a sentiment hostile or unfriendly to the roman catholics either of england or ireland this speech though delivered generally in favour of the irish bill attracted very much the attention and as it appeared afterwards the approbation of those irish members who although sitting on the liberal benches did not acknowledge the infallible authority of mr oconnell and was the origin of a political connection between them and lord george bentinck which on more than one subsequent occasion promised to bring important results  two successive motions were now made for the adjournment of the debate and sir robert peel at length said that he saw it was useless to persist he agreed to the adjournment until the next day with the understanding that if it did come on he would name the time to which it should be postponed after the holidays  upon this sir william somerville made one more appeal to the minister to postpone the further discussion of the irish bill altogether until the corn bill had passed the commons he intimated that unless the government at once adopted this resolution they would find themselves after easter in the same perplexity which now paralyzed them they would not be permitted to bring on this measure except upon government nights and the discussion might then last weeks  the minister exceedingly embarrassed would not however relent on the following day when he moved the adjournment of the house for the holidays he reduced the vacation three days in order to obtain friday a government night which otherwise would have been absorbed in the holidays and he announced the determination of the government again to proceed on that night with the irish bill in preference to the corn bill the irish members glanced defiance and the protectionists could scarcely conceal their satisfaction the reputation of sir robert peel for parliamentary management seemed to be vanishing never was a government in a more tottering state and the whigs especially began to renew their laments that the edinburgh letter and its consequences had prevented the settlement of the corn question from devolving to the natural arbitrator in the great controversy their somewhat rash but still unrivalled leader lord john russell     chapter vi       a third party  the members of the protectionist opposition returned to their constituents with the sanguine feelings which success naturally inspires their efforts had surprised not displeased the country the elections were in their favour the government business halted the delay in the calculated arrival of the famine had taken the edge off the necessity which it was supposed would have already carried the corn bill through the commons while the twin measure which the throes of ireland had engendered had developed elements of opposition which even the calmest observer thought might possibly end in overthrow above all that seemed to have happened which the most experienced in parliamentary life had always deemed to be impracticable namely the formation of a third party in the house of commons  how completely this latter and difficult result was owing to the abilities and energies of one man and how anomalous was the position which he chose to occupy in not taking the formal lead of a party which was entirely guided by his example were convictions and considerations that at this juncture much occupied mens minds and it was resolved among the most considerable of the country gentlemen to make some earnest and wellcombined effort during the recess to induce lord george bentinck to waive the unwillingness he had so often expressed of becoming their avowed and responsible leader  when lord george bentinck first threw himself into the breach he was influenced only by a feeling of indignation at the manner in which he thought the conservative party had been trifled with by the government and lord stanley his personal friend and political leader deserted by a majority of the cabinet as affairs developed and it became evident that the bulk of the conservative party throughout the country had rallied round his standard lord george could not conceal from himself the consequences of such an event or believe that it was possible that the party in the house of commons although lord stanley might eventually think fit to guide it by his counsels and become if necessary personally responsible for its policy could be long held together unless it were conducted by a leader present in the same assembly and competent under all circumstances to represent its opinions in debate lord george although a very proud man had no vanity or selfconceit he took a very humble view of his own powers and he had at the same time a very exalted one of those necessary to a leader of the house of commons his illustrious connection mr canning was his standard he had been the private secretary of that minister in his youth and the dazzling qualities of that eminent personage had influenced the most susceptible time of life of one who was very tenacious of his impressions what lord george bentinck appreciated most in a parliamentary speaker was brilliancy quickness of perception promptness of repartee clear and concise argument a fresh and felicitous quotation wit and picture and if necessary a passionate appeal that should never pass the line of highbred sentiment believing himself not to be distinguished by these rhetorical qualities he would listen with no complacency to those who would urge in private that the present period of parliamentary life was different from the days of mr canning and that accumulated facts and welldigested reasoning on their bearing a command of all the materials of commercial controversy and a mastery of the laws that regulate the production and distribution of public wealth combined with habits of great diligence and application would ensure the attention of a popular assembly especially when united to a high character and great social position this might be urged but he would only shake his head with a ray of humour twinkling in his piercing eyes and say in a halfdrawling tone if mr canning were alive he could do all this better than any of them and be not a whit less brilliant  there was also another reason why lord george bentinck was unwilling to assume the post of leader of the conservative party and this very much influenced him sprung from a great whig house and inheriting all the principles and prejudices of that renowned political connection which had expelled the stuarts he had accepted in an unqualified sense the dogma of religious liberty this principle was first introduced into active politics in order to preserve the possessions of that portion of the aristocracy which had established itself on the plunder of the church it was to form the basis of a party which should prevent reaction and restitution of church lands whether the principle be a true one and whether its unqualified application by any party in the state be possible are questions yet unsettled it is not probable for example that the worship of juggernaut which lord dalhousie permits in orissa would be permitted even by lord john russell at westminster even a papist procession is forbidden and wisely the application of the principle however in lord george bentincks mind was among other things associated with the public recognition of the roman catholic hierarchy by the state and a provision for its maintenance in ireland in accordance with the plan of mr pitt what had happened with respect to the vote on the endowment of maynooth in 1845 had convinced him that his opinions on this subject presented an insuperable barrier to his ever becoming the leader of a party which had contributed threefourths of the memorable minority on that occasion it was in vain that it was impressed upon him by those most renowned for their protestant principles and who were at the same time most anxious to see lord george bentinck in his right position that the question of maynooth was settled and there was now no prospect of future measures of a similar character this was not the opinion of lord george bentinck he nursed in his secret soul a great scheme for the regeneration and settlement of ireland which he thought ought to be one of the mainstays of a conservative party and it was his opinion that the condition of the roman catholic priesthood must be considered  it was in vain in order to assist in removing these scruples that it was represented to him by others that endowment of a priesthood by the state was a notion somewhat oldfashioned and opposed to the spirit of the age which associated true religious freedom with the full development of the voluntary principle he listened to these suggestions with distrust and even with a little contempt mr canning had been in favour of the endowment of the irish priesthoodthat was sufficient for that particular and as for the voluntary principle he looked upon it as priestcraft in disguise his idea of religious liberty being that all religions should be controlled by the state  besides these two prominent objections to accepting the offered post namely his unaffected distrust in his parliamentary abilities and his assumed want of concordance with his followers on a great principle of modern politics we must also remember that his compliance with the request involved no ordinary sacrifice of much which renders life delightful he was to relinquish pursuits of noble excitement to which he was passionately attached and to withdraw in a great degree from a circle of highspirited friends many of them of different political connection from himself by whom he was adored with all his unrivalled powers of application when under the influence of a great impulse he was constitutionally indolent and even lethargic there was nothing therefore in his position or his temperature to prick him on in 46 it was nothing but his strong will acting upon his indignation which sustained him it is not therefore marvellous that he exhibited great reluctance to commit irretrievably his future life at a subsequent period indignation had become ambition and circumstances of various kinds had made him resolve to succeed or die  on the adjournment lord george had gone down to newmarket which he greatly enjoyed after his exhausting campaign here some letters on the subject of the leadership passed but nothing was definitely arranged till some time after the reassembling of parliament for convenience we mention here the result the wish of the party was repeatedly and personally urged by the popular and muchesteemed member for dorsetshire and at last lord george consented to their wishes on these conditions that he should relinquish his post the moment the right man was discovered who according to his theory would ultimately turn up and secondly that his responsible post was not to restrict or embarrass him on any questions in which a religious principle was involved  before however this negotiation was concluded and while yet at newmarket he wrote to a friend the day before the house met april 16th  i think there is no doubt but that the irish will take care of friday tomorrow night i have not much hope of their keeping up the debate beyond friday  it is quite clear from oconnells language at dublin that we have no hope from the irish tail  i still think myself that delay affords a great chance of something turning up in our favour already the rejection of any reciprocity by m guizot has provided us with a grand weapon which i trust you drive well home into    s vitals a very short delay would probably bring over similar intelligence from the united states and their congress i trust we shall have an important deputation over from canada representing that the inevitable results of these freetrade measures in corn and timber will be to alienate the feelings of our canadian colonists and to induce them to follow their sordid interests which will now undoubtedly be best consulted and most promoted by annexation to the united states  lords intended tergiversation has been i believe some time known he admits that all farmers without capital in short all little men must be sacrificed what a barbarous and odious policy that goes upon the principle that none but capitalists are henceforth to be allowed to live as farmers at least we must turn the tables upon lordand all such heartless doctrinaires  i fear the majority in the lords will be greater than was expected i am told that we must endeavour to put ministers in a minority two or three times before the bill gets to its second reading in the lords no matter upon what question i hear there are many peers whose votes depend entirely upon their notions whether or not peel can by hook or by crook carry on     chapter vii       railroads for ireland  if we take a general view of the career of lord george bentinck during the last yearfrom the time indeed when he was trying to find a lawyer to convey his convictions to the house of commons until the moment when her majesty prorogued her parliament the results will be found to be very remarkable so much was never done so unexpectedly by any public man in the same space of time he had rallied a great party which seemed hopelessly routed he had established a parliamentary discipline in their ranks which old political connections led by experienced statesmen have seldom surpassed he had brought forward from those ranks entirely through his discrimination and by his personal encouragement considerable talents in debate he had himself proved a master in detail and in argument of all the great questions arising out of the reconstruction of our commercial system he had made a vindication of the results of the protective principle as applied to agriculture which certainly so far as the materials are concerned is the most efficient plea that ever was urged in the house of commons in favour of the abrogated law he had exhibited similar instances of investigation in considerable statements with respect to the silk trade and other branches of our industry he had asserted the claims of the productive classes in ireland and in our timber and sugar producing colonies with the effect which results from a thorough acquaintance with a subject he had promulgated distinct principles with regard to our financial as well as to our commercial system he had maintained the expediency cf relieving the consumer by the repeal of excise in preference to customs duties and of establishing fiscal reciprocity as a condition of mercantile exchange on subjects of a more occasional but analogous nature he had shown promptitude and knowledge as in the instances of the urgent condition of mexico and of our carrying trade with the spanish colonies both of which he brought forward in the last hours of the session but the importance of which motions was recognized by all parties finally he had attracted the notice and in many instances obtained the confidence of large bodies of men in the country who recognized in him a great capacity of labour combined with firmness of character and honesty of purpose  at the close of the session august 28 cord george visited norfolk where he received an entertainment from his constituents at kings lynn proud of their member and to whom he vindicated the course which he had taken and offered his views generally as to the relations which should subsist between the legislation of the country and its industry from norfolk he repaired to belvoir castle on a visit to the duke of rutland and was present at a banquet given by the agriculturists of leicestershire to his friend and supporter the marquis of granby after this he returned to welbeck where he seems to have enjoyed a little repose thus he writes to a friend from that place on the 22nd september  thanks for your advice which i am following having got lord malmesburys diary but i am relapsing into my natural dawdling lazy and somnolent habits and can with difficulty get through the leaders even of the times      the vehemence of the farmers is personal against peel it is quite clear that the rising price of wheat has cured their alarm the railway expenditure must keep up prices and prosperity both of which would have been far greater without free trade but in face of high prices railway prosperity and potato famine depend upon it we shall have an uphill game to fight  oconnell talks of parliament meeting in november to mend the irish labourrate act do you believe this  the labourrate act passed at the end of the session 46 was one by which the lord lieutenant was enabled to require special barony sessions to meet in order to make presentments for public works for the employment of the people the whole of the money requisite for their construction to be supplied by the imperial treasury though to be afterwards repaid the machinery of this act did not work satisfactorily but the government ultimately made the necessary alterations on their own responsibility and obtained an indemnity from parliament when it met in 47 the early session therefore talked of by mr oconnell became unnecessary as the only object of this labourrate act was to employ the people and as it was supposed there were no public works of a reproductive nature which could be undertaken on a sufficient scale to ensure that employment the irish people were occupied towards the end of the autumn of 46 mainly in making roads which as afterwards described by the first minister were not wanted in the month of september more than thirty thousand persons were thus employed but when the harvest was over and it was ascertained that its terrible deficiency had converted pauperism into famine the numbers on the public works became greatly increased so that at the end of november the amount of persons engaged was four hundred thousand receiving wages at the rate of nearly five millions sterling per annum these immense amounts went on increasing every week and when parliament met in february 1847 five hundred thousand persons were employed on these public works which could bring no possible public advantage at an expense to the country of between £700000 and £800000 per month no board of works could efficiently superintend such a multitude or prevent flagrant imposition though the dimensions of that department appeared almost proportionably to have expanded what with commissioners chief clerks check clerks and pay clerks the establishment of the board of works in ireland at the end of 46 consisted of more than eleven thousand persons  always intent upon ireland this condition of affairs early and earnestly attracted the attention of lord george bentinck so vast an expenditure in unproductive labour dismayed him he would not easily assent to the conclusion that profitable enterprise under the circumstances was impossible such a conclusion seemed to him unnatural and that an occasion where we commenced with despair justified a bold and venturesome course the field is legitimately open to speculation where all agree that all is hopeless the construction of harbours the development of fisheries the redemption of waste lands were resources which had been often canvassed and whatever their recommendations with the exception of the last they were necessarily very limited and the last though it might afford prompt could hardly secure profitable employment prompt and profitable employment was the object which lord george wished to accomplish where millions were to be expended by the state something more advantageous to the community should accrue than the temporary subsistence of the multitude  lord george had always been a great supporter of railway enterprise in england on the ground that irrespective of all the peculiar advantages of those undertakings the money was spent in the country and that if our surplus capital were not directed to such channels it would go as it had gone before to foreign mines and foreign loans from which in a great degree no return would arrive when millions were avowedly to be laid out in useless and unprofitable undertakings it became a question whether it were not wiser even somewhat to anticipate the time when the necessities of ireland would require railways on a considerable scale and whether by embarking in such enterprises we might not only find prompt and profitable employment for the people but by giving a new character to the country and increasing its social relations and the combinations of its industry might not greatly advance the period when such modes of communication would be absolutely requisite  full of these views lord george in the course of the autumn consulted in confidence some gentlemen very competent to assist him in such an inquiry and especially mr robert stephenson mr hudson and mr laing with their advice and at their suggestion two engineers of great ability mr bidder and mr smith were despatched to ireland personally to investigate the whole question of railroads in that country  meditating over the condition of ireland a subject very frequently in his thoughts and of the means to combat its vast and inveterate pauperism lord george was frequently in the habit of reverting to the years 4142 in england when there were fifteen hundred thousand persons on the parish rates eightythree thousand ablebodied men actually confined within the walls of the workhouse and more than four hundred thousand ablebodied men receiving outdoor relief what changed all this and restored england in a very brief space to a condition of affluence hardly before known in her annals not certainly the alterations in the tariff which were made by sir robert peel at the commencement of his government prudent and salutary as they were no one would pretend that the abolition of the slight duty fivesixteenths of a penny on the raw material of the cotton manufacturer or the free introduction of some twentyseven thousand head of foreign cattle or even the admission of foreign timber at reduced duties could have effected this unquestionably it was the railway enterprise which then began to prevail that was the cause of this national renovation suddenly and for several years an additional sum of thirteen millions of pounds sterling a year was spent in the wages of our native industry two hundred thousand ablebodied labourers received each upon an average twentytwo shillings a week stimulating the revenue both in excise and customs by their enormous consumption of malt and spirits tobacco and tea this was the main cause of the contrast between the england of 41 and the england of 45  was there any reason why a proportionate application of the same remedy to ireland should not proportionately produce a similar result was there anything wild or unauthorized in the suggestion on the contrary ten years before 1836 the subject had engaged the attention of her majestys government and a royal commission had been issued to inquire into the expediency of establishing railway communication in ireland the commissioners men of great eminence recommended that a system of railways should be established in ireland and by the pecuniary assistance of government they rested their recommendation mainly on the abundant evidence existing of the vast benefits which easy communication had accomplished in ireland and of the complete success which had attended every parliamentary grant for improving roads in that country  the weakness of the government arising from the balanced state of parties rendered it impossible at that time for them to prosecute the measures recommended by the royal commissioners though they made an ineffectual attempt in that direction could it be suspected that the recommendation of the commissioners had been biassed by any political consideration was it a whig commission attempting to fulfil a whig object another commission more memorable at the head of which was the earl of devon was appointed by a tory government some years afterwards virtually to consider the condition of the people of ireland and the best means for their amelioration the report of the devon commission confirmed all the recommendations of the railway commissioners of 36 and pointed to these new methods of communication by the assistance of loans from the government as the best means of providing employment for the people  when mr smith of deanston was examined by a parliamentary committee and asked what measure of all others would be the one most calculated to improve the agriculture and condition of ireland he did not reply as some might have anticipated that the most efficient measure would be to drain the bogs but his answer was advance the construction of railways and then agricultural improvement will speedily follow  to illustrate the value of railways to an agricultural population mr smith of deanston said that the improvement of the land for one mile only on each side of the railway so constructed would be so great that it would pay the cost of the whole construction he added that there were few districts in ireland in which railway communication could be introduced where the value of the country through which the railway passed would not be raised to an extent equal to the whole cost of the railway  arguing on an area of six hundred and forty acres for every square mile after deducting the land occupied by fences roads and buildings mr smith of deanston entered into a calculation of the gain deliverable from the mere carriage of the produce of the land and the back carriage of manure coals tiles bricks and other materials and estimated the saving through those means on every square mile to more than £300 or something above £600 on 1280 acres abutting each mile of railway this being the difference of the cost of carriage under the old mode of conveyance as compared with the new following up this calculation he showed that fifteen hundred miles of railway would improve the land through which it passed to the extent of nearly two million acres at the rate of a mile on each side and taken at twentyfive years purchase would equal twentyfour millions sterling in the permanent improvement of the land  the ground therefore was sound on which lord george cautiously and after due reflection ventured to place his foot  and now after the reports of these two royal commissions what was the state of railway enterprise in ireland in the autumn of 46 when a vast multitude could only subsist by being employed by the government and when the government had avowedly no reproductive or even useful work whereon to place them but allotted them to operations which were described by colonel douglas the inspector of the government himself as works which would answer no other purpose than that of obstructing the public conveyances  in 46 acts of parliament were in existence authorizing the construction of more than fifteen hundred miles of railway in ireland and some of these acts had passed so long as eleven years previously yet at the end of 46 only one hundred and twentythree miles of railway had been completed and only one hundred and sixtyfour were in the course of completion though arrested in their progress from want of funds almost in the same period two thousand six hundred miles of railway had been completed in england and acts of parliament had passed for constructing five thousand four hundred miles in addition in the whole eight thousand miles  what then was the reason of this debility in ireland in prosecuting these undertakings were they really not required were the elements of success wanting the first element of success in railway enterprise according to the highest authorities is population property is only the second consideration now ireland in 46 was more densely inhabited than england a want of population could not therefore be the cause but a population so impoverished as the irish could not perhaps avail themselves of the means of locomotion and yet it appeared from research that the rate of passengers on the two irish railways that were open greatly exceeded in number that of the passengers upon english and scotch railways the average number of passengers on english and scotch railways was not twelve thousand per mile per annum while on the ulster railway the number was nearly twentytwo thousand and on the dublin and drogheda line the number exceeded eighteen thousand  the cause of the weakness in ireland to prosecute these undertakings was the total want of domestic capital for the purpose and the unwillingness of english capitalists to embark their funds in a country whose social and political condition they viewed with distrust however promising and even profitable the investment might otherwise appear this was remarkably illustrated by the instance of the great southern and western railway of ireland one of the undertakings of which the completion was arrested by want of funds yet partially open compared with a wellknown railway in great britain the irish railway had cost in its construction £15000 per mile and the british upwards of £26000 per mile the weekly traffic on the two railways allowing for some difference in their extent was about the same on both in amount varying from £1000 to £1300 per week yet the unfinished british railway was at £40 premium in the market and the incomplete irish railway at £2 discount it was clear therefore that the commercial principle omnipotent in england was not competent to cope with the peculiar circumstances of ireland  brooding over the suggestions afforded by the details which we have slightly indicated lord george bentinck taking into consideration not merely the advantage that would accrue to the country from the establishment of a system of railroads but also remembering the peculiar circumstances of the times the absolute necessity of employing the people and the inevitable advance of public money for that purpose framed a scheme with reference to all these considerations and which he believed would meet all the conditions of the case he spared no thought or time or labour for his purpose he availed himself of the advice of the most experienced and prosecuted his researches ardently and thoroughly when he had matured his scheme he had it thrown into the form of a parliamentary bill by the ablest hands and then submitted the whole to the judgment and criticism of those who shared his confidence and counsels towards the end of november he was at knowsley from whence he communicated with the writer of these pages i am here hatching secret plans for the next session and now if you have not quite abjured politics as you threatened for the next three months to do devoting yourself to poetry and romance i think i ought to have a quiet day with you in order that we may hold council together and talk over all our policy i shall be at harcourt house on the 30th i shall stay there till the 3rd of december for a meeting on that day of the norfolk estuary company of which i am chairman would that evening suit youor fridayor wednesday i am not well acquainted with the geography of buckinghamshire but presume you are accessible either by rail or road in less than twelve hours  the activity in the dockyard must be in preparation to interfere in portugal to keep king leopold upon the portuguese throne it cannot be for mexico for our friend the times formally abandoned mexico in his leader some days ago      has been entertaining lord     in ireland and writes how peel must chuckle at the whig difficulties i dare say he does but in ireland it seems to me lord besborough is putting the fate irish government to shame whilst the rupture of the entente cordiale the conquest of california and new mexico and the complications in the river plataare complete inheritances from lord aberdeen  eaton has come to life again else there was a prospect of george manners quietly succeeding him in cambridgeshire i fear we shall do no good in lincolnshire notwithstanding the industry of our dear friend the morning post in getting hold of lord ebringtons and lord richs letters to lord yarborough i suppose there is no mistake in lord dalhousie the large trout going out to bombay with the reversion of bengal  the duchy of lancaster is to be put in commission lord     to be one of the commissioners but unpaid he has begun i presume to overcome the false delicacy which prevented his acceptance of office under the whigs in july s     thought g     was to be another of the board but that turns out a mistake but lord h     is to be  the manufacturers are working short time and reducing wages in all directions john bright and sons at rochdale among the rest the zollverein increasing their import duties on cotton and linen yarn and putting export duties of 25 per cent some of the states at least on grain  we must not omit to record that in the autumn of this year at goodwood races the sporting world was astounded by hearing that lord george bentinck had parted with his racing stud at an almost nominal price lord george was present as was his custom at this meeting held in the demesne of one who was among his dearest friends lord george was not only present but apparently absorbed in the sport and his horses were very successful the world has hardly done justice to the great sacrifice which he made on this occasion to a high sense of duty he not only parted with the finest racing stud in england but he parted with it at a moment when its prospects were never so brilliant and he knew this well we may have hereafter to notice on this head an interesting passage in his life  he could scarcely have quitted the turf that day without a pang he had become the lord paramount of that strange world so difficult to sway and which requires for its government both a stern resolve and a courtly breeding he had them both and though the blackleg might quail before the awful scrutiny of his piercing eye there never was a man so scrupulously polite to his inferiors as lord george bentinck the turf too was not merely the scene of the triumphs of his stud and his bettingbook he had purified its practice and had elevated its character and he was prouder of this achievement than of any other connected with his sporting life notwithstanding his mighty stakes and the keenness with which he backed his opinion no one perhaps ever cared less for money his habits were severely simple and he was the most generous of men he valued the acquisition of money on the turf because there it was the test of success he counted his thousands after a great race as a victorious general counts his cannon and his prisoners     chapter viii       the versatility of lord george bentinck  those who throw their eye over the debates of the session of 47 cannot fail to be struck by the variety of important questions in the discussion of which lord george bentinck took a leading or prominent part and it must be borne in mind that he never offered his opinion on any subject which he had not diligently investigated and attempted to comprehend in all its bearings his opponents might object to his principles or challenge his conclusions but no one could deny that his conclusions were drawn from extensive information and that his principles were clear and distinct he spared no pains to acquire by reading correspondence and personal research the most authentic intelligence on every subject in debate he never chattered he never uttered a sentence in the house of commons which did not convey a conviction or a fact he was too profuse indeed with his facts he had not the art of condensation but those who have occasion to refer to his speeches and calmly to examine them will be struck by the amplitude and the freshness of his knowledge the clearness of his views the coherence in all his efforts and oftena point for which he never had sufficient creditby his graphic idiom  the best speech on the affairs of cracow for example the most vigorous and the best informed touching all the points with a thorough acquaintance was that of lord george bentinck the discussion on cracow which lasted several nights and followed very shortly after the defeat of his irish bill appeared to relate to a class of subjects which would not have engaged his attention but on the contrary he had given days and nights to this theme had critically examined all the documents and conferred with those qualified to supply him with any supplementary information requisite he spoke several times this session on questions connected with our foreign affairs and always impressed the house with a conviction that he was addressing it after a due study of his subject as for example his speech against our interference in portugal and the statement in which he brought forward the claims of the holders of spanish bonds on the government of spain before the house of commons in the instance of portugal a motion of censure on the conduct of ministers had been introduced by mr hume and the government were only saved from a minority by the friendly interposition of mr duncombe who proposed an amendment to the motion of mr hume which broke the line of the liberal force lord george bentinck in this case followed mr macaulay whose speech as was his wont had been rich in historical illustration the right honourable and learned member for edinburgh lord george replied had entered into a very interesting history of various interferences which had taken place in the affairs of portugal but in making that statement he forgot to mention one circumstance which had occurred in that history and it was this  that when philip ii of spain sought to conquer portugal the method he had recourse to for that purpose was one which he thought her majestys ministers had successfully practised on the present occasion  he persuaded the leaders in portugal to mix sand with the powder of their troops and so on this occasion her majestys ministers had prevailed on the member for finsbury and those other members who were so ready to profess a love of liberty to mix sand with their powder  in a previous chapter we have treated at some length of the means proposed or adopted by the parliament for the sustenance and relief of the people of ireland the new poor law for that country also much engaged the attention of both houses this session lord george bentinck took a very active part in these transactions and moved the most important of all the amendments to the government measure namely an attempt to assimilate the poor law of ireland as much as possible to that of england and make the entire rates be paid by the occupying tenant his object he said was to prevent lavish expenditure and encourage profitable employment to the people this amendment was only lost by a majority of four  on the 26th of march on the government bringing forward their bill on the rum duties lord george bentinck brought before the house the case of the british and irish distillers not with any preference or partiality towards english scotch or irish distillers over the colonial producer i am no advocate of any monopoly whatever i desire only equal and exact justice between both parties and the only way in which that end can in my opinion be properly attained is in a select committee upstairs consisting of impartial members of this house  he often used to say that no subject ever gave him more trouble thoroughly to master than the spirit duties and he noticed the character of the theme at the beginning of his speech he said he required not only the most especial indulgence but even the toleration of the house for of all the dry and dull subjects which could possibly be introduced the question which it is now my misfortune to bring under the consideration of the house is the driest and the dullest if this question had been one merely of pounds shillings and pence it would have been dull and complicated enough but this is a question in which are concerned not pounds and shillings but pence and halfpence and farthings  the whitsuntide holidays occurred at the end of may it had originally been the intention of lord george bentinck at the request of leading merchants and manufacturers of all parties and opinions to have brought forward the question of the bank act after these holidays and to move a resolution that some discretionary power should be established as to the issue of notes he thus alludes to this point in a letter to mr wright of the 24th of may  i return you no 1019 of the bankers circular with many thanks  this delightful and timely change in the weather will do wonders for the country and by producing an abundant and seasonable harvest will save the country and may save the bank charter act but it is pretty well settled that i am to give notice immediately after the holidays of a resolution very much in the spirit of the memorial contained in the paper i am returning to you  things are better in the city and at liverpool and with this weather will continue to improve but it seems to me any reverse in the weather such as would occasion a late and deficient harvest could not fail to bring the commerce of the country to a dead lock  the opinion is gaining ground that in the present state not only of ireland but of many districts in england the government will not venture upon a general election till after the harvest and not then unless the harvest should prove favourable  i am glad to read your opinion in opposition to lord ashburtons that railways keep the gold in the country and do not send it out glyn gave strong evidence last year to this effect before the railway committee  neither of the prospects in this letter was realised the commercial and manufacturing interest after the whitsun recess thought it advisable for reasons of great weight that lord george bentinck should postpone for a month or six weeks his intended motion on the bank charter and the ministers resolved to dissolve parliament before the harvest thus it happened that the merchants and manufacturers lost their chance of relief from the yoke and experienced the reign of terror in the autumn the terrible events of which ultimately occasioned the assembling of the new parliament in november  anticipating the immediate dissolution of parliament sir robert peel had issued an address to the electors of tamworth justifying his commercial policy in the opinion of lord george bentinck it set forth a statement as to the effect and operation of those financial measures which had taken place in the course of the last six years which if left altogether unrefuted might have a dangerous tendency at the coming elections the general effect of that statement was that by the reduction of duties to a large extent it was possible to relieve the people of this country of burdens amounting to more than seven millions and a half sterling with little or no loss whatever to the revenue but the truth was sir robert peel in his reductions had dealt only with little more than ten millions sterling of the revenue of the country and had left the remaining thirtyseven millions untouched now on that portion of the revenue with which alone he had dealt there was a deficiency through his changes to the amount of five millions sterling which loss was compensated by the increase on those very articles which sir robert had left untouched it was the opinion of lord george bentinck that the conclusion which sir robert peel had drawn from the comparatively barren results of the increased duties on imports carried by the whigs in 1840 viz that indirect taxation had reached its limit and which was indeed the basis of his new system was a fallacy and that the anticipated increase of import duties had not accrued in 1840 in consequence of our having had three successive bad harvests and a bad cotton crop to boot all of which had checked the consuming power of the community sir robert peel had been favoured by three successive good harvests and nearly £100000000 invested in six years in domestic enterprise the interposition of providence said lord george is never a part of our debates  under these circumstances lord george took occasion to review the commercial policy of sir robert peel on the 20th july in the house of commons only three days before the prorogation and in one of his most successful speeches he was much assisted by the fact that the exports of all our staple manufactures had then greatly diminished and of course he urged this point triumphantly if we had been indemnified for the dead loss of £650000 on cotton wool by any great impulse given to our manufacturers it would be a consolation which unfortunately we could not enjoy he traced all the consumption to railway enterprise and showed that it alone had compensated for the fruitless loss of revenue which we had incurred in vainly stimulating the exports of our manufactures which had actually diminished he was so impressed with the importance that on the eve of a dissolution such a statement as that of sir robert peel should not go forth to the country uncontroverted as in that case the necessary result would be that the people would come to the opinion that they might abolish taxes altogether and yet maintain the revenue that he sat up all night writing an address to his constituents the electors of kings lynn which took up nearly two columns of the newspapers in which he presented his refutation to the public of the commercial manifesto of tamworth illustrated by the necessary tables and documents  there is a sentence in this speech which as a distinct expression of policy should perhaps be quoted  sir i am one of those who seek for the repeal of the malt tax and the hop duties i am one of those who think that the excise duties ought to be taken off but sir i do not pretend that you can repeal the malt tax or the hop duties or remove the soap tax without commutation for other taxes i will not delude the people by pretending that i could take off more than seven millions and a half of taxes without replacing them by others and not leave the nation bankrupt but i think these reforms of sir robert peel have been in a mistaken direction i think that revenue duties on all foreign imports ought to be maintained and that a revenue equal to those excise duties which i have mentioned can be levied upon the produce of foreign countries and foreign industry without imposing any greater tax than one which shall fall far short of mr walkers perfect revenue standard of 20 per cent i say that by imposing a tax far less than 20 per cent upon all articles of foreign import a revenue might be derived far less burdensome to this country than that of excise a revenue of which the burden would be largely shared in by foreign countries and in many cases paid altogether by foreign countries  lord george at this time watched with great interest a novel feature in our commercial transactions he wrote on the 29th may 1847 to mr burn the editor of the commercial glance and an individual of whose intelligence accuracy and zeal he had a high and just opinion can you inform me how the raw cotton purchased for exportation stands in the first three weeks of the present month of may as compared with the corresponding periods of 46543  i observe from a cotton circular sent to me the other day that seven thousand five hundred bags of cotton had been purchased for exportation between the 1st and 21st of may if with reduced stocks of raw cotton we are commencing a career of increased exportation it appears to me to involve very serious consequences for our cotton manufactures as growing out of the existing monetary difficulties of the manufacturers  if you could answer me these queries within the next three or four days i should feel greatly obliged to you  again on the 22d of july on the point of going down to his constituents he was still pursuing his inquiries in the same quarter i want particularly to compare he says to mr burn the export of the last ten weeks of raw cotton with the corresponding ten weeks of 46 and 45 and at the same time to compare the importations and deliveries into the hands of the manufacturers during these same periods  pray address me lynn norfolk where i go on saturday and shall remain till after my election on thursday  he writes again from lynn with great thanks for the information which had been accordingly forwarded to him there might i ask you to give me an account of the cotton wool imported weekly into liverpool and also the quantity sold to dealers exporters and speculators in the three corresponding weeks of 4546  this information by return of post would greatly oblige me  on the 23d of july 1847 the last day of the second parliament of queen victoria lord george went down to the house of commons early and took the opportunity of making a statement respecting the condition of our sugarproducing colonies which were now experiencing the consequences of the unjustifiable legislation of the preceding year he said there were appearances in the political horizon which betokened that he should not be able to obtain a select committee in the present session and therefore if he had the honour of a seat in the next parliament he begged to announce that he would take the earliest occasion to move for a committee to inquire into the present power of our colonies to compete with those countries which have still the advantage of the enforced labour of slaves the returns just laid upon the table of the house could leave no doubt he thought on any mans mind on that point since the emancipation the produce of sugar by the colonies from 31 to 46 had been reduced one half and of rum and coffee had been reduced to one fourth when the act of last year which admitted slavegrown sugar was introduced the allegation of the english colonies that they could not compete with the labour of slaves was denied the proof of that allegation was that they were already overwhelmed  when one recalls all to which this speech led the most memorable effort of that ardent energetic life to which it was perhaps fatal one can scarcely observe the origin of such vast exertions without emotion  the under secretary of state replied to lord george making a cry of cheap sugar for the hustings which were before everybodys eyes but making also this remarkable declaration that the island of mauritius was in a state of the greatest prosperity while lord george was speaking the cannon were heard that announced the departure of her majesty from the palace  then followed a motion of mr bankes about the sale of bread which led to some discussion mr bankes threatened a division lord palmerston who on this occasion was leading the house said it would be acting like a set of schoolboys if when black rod appeared they should be in the lobby instead of attending the speaker to the other house but as the members seemed very much inclined to act like schoolboys the secretary of state had to speak against time on the subject of baking he analyzed the petition which he said he would not read through but the last paragraph was of great importance  at these words black rod knocked at the door and duly making his appearance summoned the house to attend the queen in the house of lords and mr speaker followed by a crowd of members duly obeyed the summons  in about a quarter of an hour mr speaker returned without the mace and standing at the table read her majestys speech to the members around after which they retired the parliament being prorogued in the course of the afternoon the parliament was dissolved by proclamation     chapter ix       the great panic  the general election of 1847 did not materially alter the position of parties in the house of commons the high prices of agricultural produce which then prevailed naturally rendered the agricultural interest apathetic and although the rural constituencies from a feeling of esteem again returned those members who had been faithful to the protective principle the farmers did not exert themselves to increase the number of their supporters the necessity of doing so was earnestly impressed upon them by lord george bentinck who warned them then that the pinching hour was inevitable but the caution was disregarded and many of those individuals who are now the loudest in their imprecations on the memory of sir robert peel and who are the least content with the temperate course which is now recommended to them by those who have the extremely difficult office of upholding their interests in the house of commons entirely kept aloof or would smile when they were asked for their support with sarcastic selfcomplacency saying well sir do you think after all that free trade has done us so much harm perhaps they think now that if they had taken the advice of lord george bentinck and exerted themselves to return a majority to the house of commons it would have profited them more than useless execrations and barren discontent but it is observable that no individuals now grumble so much as the farmers who voted for free trader in 1847 unless indeed it be the shipowners every one of whom for years both in and out of parliament supported the repeal of the corn laws  the protectionists maintained their numbers though they did not increase them in the new parliament lord george bentinck however gained an invaluable coadjutor by the reappearance of mr herries in public life a gentleman whose official as well as parliamentary experience fine judgment and fertile resource have been of inestimable service to the protectionist party the political connection which gained most were the whigs they were much more numerous and compact but it was in a great measure at the expense of the general liberal element and partly at the cost of the following of sir robert peel the triumphant conservative majority of 1841 had disappeared but the government with all shades of supporters had not an absolute majority  had the general election been postponed until the autumn the results might have been very different that stormwhich had been long gathering in the commercial atmospherethen burst like a typhoon the annals of our trade afford no parallel for the widespread disaster and the terrible calamities in the month of september fifteen of the most considerable houses in the city of london stopped payment for between five and six millions sterling the governor of the bank of england was himself a partner in one of these firms a gentleman who had lately filled that office was another victim two other bank directors were included in the list the failures were not limited to the metropolis but were accompanied by others of great extent in the provinces at manchester liverpool and glasgow large firms were obliged to suspend payments this shock of credit arrested all the usual accommodation and the pressure in the moneymarket so terrible in the spring was revived the excitement and the alarm in the city of london were so great that when the chancellor of the exchequer hurried up to town on the 1st of october he found that the interest of money was at the rate of 60 per cent per annum the bank charter produced the same injurious effect as it had done in april it aggravated the evil by forcing men to hoard in vain the commercial world deplored the refusal of the government to comply with the suggestion made by lord george bentinck and mr thomas baring in the spring in vain they entreated them at least now to adopt it and to authorize the bank of england to enlarge the amount of their discounts and advances on approved security without reference to the stringent clause of the charter the government acting it is believed with the encouragement and sanction of sir robert peel were obstinate and three weeks then occurred during which the commercial credit of this country was threatened with total destruction nine more considerable mercantile houses stopped payment in the metropolis the disasters in the provinces were still more extensive the royal bank of liverpool failed among several principal establishments in that town one alone stopped payment for upwards of a million sterling the havoc at manchester was also great the newcastle bank and the north and south wales bank stopped consols fell to 79 14 and exchequer bills were at last at 35 per cent discount the ordinary rate of discount at the bank of england was between 8 and 9 per cent but out of doors accommodation was not to be obtained in such a state of affairs the small houses of course gave way from their rising in the morning until their hour of retirement at night the first lord of the treasury and the chancellor of the exchequer were employed in seeing persons of all descriptions who entreated them to interfere and preserve the community from universal bankruptcy perish the world sooner than violate a principle was the philosophical exclamation of her majestys ministers sustained by the sympathy and the sanction of sir robert peel at last the governor and the deputygovernor of the bank of england waited on downing street and said it could go on no more the scotch banks had applied to them for assistance the whole demand for discount was thrown upon the bank of england two billbrokers had stopped two others were paralyzed the bank of england could discount no longer thanks to the bank charter they were safe and their treasury full of bullion but it appeared that everybody else must fall for in fourandtwenty hours the machinery of credit would be entirely stopped the position was frightful and the government gave way they did that on the 25th of october after houses had fallen to the amount of fifteen millions sterling which they had been counselled to do by lord george bentinck on the 25th of april it turned out exactly as mr thomas baring had foretold it was not want of capital or deficiency of circulation which had occasioned these awful consequences it was sheer panic occasioned by an unwisely stringent law no sooner had the government freed the bank of england from that stringency than the panic ceased the very morning the letter of license from the government to the bank of england appeared thousands and tens of thousands of pounds sterling were taken from the hoards some from boxes deposited with bankers although the depositors would not leave the notes in their bankers hands large parcels of notes were returned to the bank of england cut into halves as they had been sent down into the country and so small was the real demand for an additional quantity of currency that the whole amount taken from the bank when the unlimited power of issue was given was under £400000 and the bank consequently never availed itself of the privilege which the government had accorded it the restoration of confidence produced an ample currency and that confidence had solely been withdrawn from the apprehension of the stringent clauses of the bank charter act of 1844  these extraordinary events had not occurred unnoticed by lord george bentinck the two subjects that mostly engaged his attention after the general election were the action of the bank charter and the state of our sugar colonies perhaps it would be best to give some extracts from his correspondence at this period he was a good letterwriter easy and clear his characteristic love of details also rendered this style of communication interesting it is not possible to give more than extracts and it is necessary to omit all those circumstances which generally in letterreading are most acceptable his comments on men and things were naturally free and full and he always endeavoured for the amusement of his correspondents to communicate the social gossip of the hour but although all this must necessarily be omitted his letters may afford some illustrations of his earnestness and energy the constancy of his aim and the untiring vigilance with which he pursued his objectespecially those which are addressed to gentlemen engaged in commercial pursuits who cooperated with him in his investigations   to a friend  harcourt house august 30 1847  an answer is come out to my address to my constituents at kings lynn and to my speech in answer to peels manifesto pray read it at first i thought i could swear to its being     i now think i can swear to its being     the servility to peel and the official redtape style would equally do for either but the nopopery page i think fixes it on      i think it wretchedly weak and have written some notes on the margin showing up the principal points the nine months famine of 184647 as contrasted with peels famine shows a difference of between £6000000 and £7000000 that is to say on the balance in the nine months 184546 ireland exported about three millions worth of breadstuffs and not a soul died of famine in the nine months 184647 she imported three millions sterling worth of breadstuffs which insufficed to prevent one millionor say half a millionof the people from dying of starvation  at present i have seen no notice of the pamphlet in any of the newspapers if it is either    s or    s or    s we shall see it reviewed in times chronicle and spectator  the bank of england has raised the interest on    s mortgage onethird per cent making an additional annual charge of £1500 a year to him i am very sorry for him but i know nothing so likely to rouse the landed aristocracy from their apathy and to weaken their idolatry of peel so much as this warning note of the joint operation of his free trade and restrictive currency laws   to a friend  harcourt house september 2 1847  i think it is     the trickster i observe has carefully reduced the pounds of cotton to cwts in the hopes of concealing a great fraud to which he has condescended taking in the whig year of 1841 the home consumption of cotton whilst in peels year he gives entire importation as the home consumption representing both as home consumption  in peels year 1846 officially we have only the gross importation but in the whig year 1841 the entire importation and the home consumption are given separately the importation exceeding the home consumption by fifty million pounds burns glance however gives the importation and home consumption for both years unfortunately however not in lbs or cwts but in bags    s fraud however is not the less apparent  he selects a whig year when the home consumption was 220000 bags under the importation and a year for peel when the importation exceeded the home consumption by 280000 bags and claps down the figures as alike describing the home consumption  none of the peel papers have taken up the subject if they should the morning post will answer the pamphlet but i should like to have mine back again in order that i may furnish them with the notes      was with me this morning and called my attention to the circumstance that the author starts with we but drops into the singular number     fancies it is peel himself but the page on endowment fixes it on      lord l     means i presume that peels savage hatred is applied to the protectionist portion of his old party not of course to the janissaries and renegade portion   the following letter was in reply to one of a friend who had sent him information several days before they occurred of the great failures that were about to happen in the city of london the list was unfortunately quite accurate with the exception indeed of the particular house respecting which lord george quotes the opinion of baron rothschild   to a friend  welbeck september 17 1847  a thousand thanks for your letter the intelligence in which created a great sensation at doncaster  as yet none of the houses appear to have failed except s     baron rothschild was at doncaster i talked with him on the subject he seemed not to doubt the probable failure of any of the houses you named except     he declared very emphatically that     house was as sound as any house in london  lord fitzwilliam declares it is no free trade without free trade in money  lord clanricarde is herelaughs at the idea of parliament meeting in october but talks much of the difficulties of irelandsays he does not see how the rates are to be paid  messrs drummond are calling in their mortgages i expect to hear that this practice will be general money dear corn cheap incumbrances enhanced and rents depressed what will become of the apathetic country gentlemen i judge from     s language that lord john russell will stand or fall by the bank charter actbut that he feels very apprehensive of being unable to maintain it  i agree with bonham in thinking that the protectionist party is smashed for the present parliament but i must say i think protectionist principles and policy are likely to come into repute again far sooner than was expected and though peels party be a compact body and formidable in the house of commons i cannot think that there appears that in the working of his measures to make it likely that he should be soon again carried into power on the shoulders of the people i think his political reputation must ebb further before it can rise again if it should ever rise again     thought him broken and in low spirits when he met him at longshaw but lord     who was there at the same time came away more peelite than ever and told them at bretby that sir robert said that he was quite surprised at the number of letters he got every day from members returned to parliament saying they meant to vote with him  you may rely upon it the peelites are very sanguine that they will be in power again almost directly we must keep them out   to mr burn editor of the commercial glance  welbeck september 38 1847 to the many courtesies you have already bestowed upon me i will sincerely thank you to add that of informing me what have been the estimated cotton crops in the united states in each of the last four years i would also thank you to inform me the comparative importation home consumption reexportation and stocks on hand of cotton of the first seven months of the current and three preceding years   to mr burn  welbeck october 4 1847  your statistics have reached me in the very nick of time and are invaluable i care nothing about outsides it is insides i look to give me a good heart and i dont care how rough the bark is  anything so good i fear to spoil by suggesting the most trivial addition else i should say it would be an interesting feature to classify the exports of cotton goods etc etc under three heads  1st to the british colonies and british possessions abroad  2nd to the northern states of europe france spain germany italy etc etc the united states of america and other countries having high tariffs  3rd to china turkey africa and the southern states of america and countries with low tariffs  i fear these failures of east and west india houses must entail great distress upon manchester and the manufacturing interests generally you have given an account of the bankruptcies in the cotton trade during a long series of years till last year inclusive are you able to say how the first nine months of the current year stands in comparison with its predecessors  i so highly prize your new work that i must ask for a dozen copies to distribute among my friends  p s i have already parted with the copy you sent me may i therefore beg another without waiting for any other binding   to a friend  welbeck october 5 1847  i shall go up to town on friday evening in my way to newmarket and shall be at harcourt house all saturday and sunday and shall be delighted to see you and have a thorough good talk with you free trade seems working mischief faster than the most fearful of us predicted and manchester houses as i am told failing in rows ashamed to do penance in public are secretly weeping in sackcloth and ashes and heartily praying that peel and cobden had been hanged before they were allowed to ruin the country  money at manchester is quoted one and a quarter per cent for ten days £45 12s 6d per cent per annum   to a friend  harcourt house october 22 1847 i have this moment got a note from stuart telling me that the chancellor has this afternoon sent out his notice of the business to be taken in his own court during michaelmas term that is from the 2nd of november till the 26th and below it there is this noticeexcept those days on which the lord chancellor may sit in the house of lords  surely this must portend a november session   to a friend  harcourt house october 23 1847 the fat bankers gossip is all stuff peel goes to windsor today i believe on an invitation of some standing     who had been dining at palmerstons last night tells me that he does not think that ministers mean calling parliament together and is confident they mean to maintain the bank charter act there have been some firstrate articles and letters in the morning chronicle lately on this subject   to a friend  harcourt house november 6 1847  i will stay over tuesday that i may have the pleasure of a thorough talk with you  i am told things are gradually getting better i expect however a fresh reverse about six weeks or two months hence when the returned lists of the stoppages in the east and west indies consequent upon the late failures here come home the western bank of scotland is whispered about if that were to fail it might bring the canny scots to their senses but they are a headstrong race  a committee on commercial distress having been appointed the principal reason for the summoning of the new parliament in the autumn had been satisfied and an adjournment until a month after christmas was in prospect before however this took place a new and interesting question arose which led to considerable discussion and which ultimately influenced in no immaterial manner the parliamentary position of lord george bentinck  the city of london at the general election had sent to the house of commons as a colleague of the first minister a member who found a difficulty in taking one of the oaths appointed by the house to be sworn preliminarily to any member exercising his right of voting the difficulty arose from this member being not only of the jewish race but unfortunately believing only in the first part of the jewish religion     chapter x       the jews  the relations that subsist between the bedoueen race that under the name of jews is found in every country of europe and the teutonic sclavonian and celtic races which have appropriated that division of the globe will form hereafter one of the most remarkable chapters in a philosophical history of man the saxon the sclav and the celt have adopted most of the laws and many of the customs of these arabian tribes all their literature and all their religion they are therefore indebted to them for much that regulates much that charms and much that solaces existence the toiling multitude rest every seventh day by virtue of a jewish law they are perpetually reading for their example the records of jewish history and singing the odes and elegies of jewish poets and they daily acknowledge on their knees with reverent gratitude that the only medium of communication between the creator and themselves is the jewish race yet they treat that race as the vilest of generations and instead of logically looking upon them as the human family that has contributed most to human happiness they extend to them every term of obloquy and every form of persecution  let us endeavour to penetrate this social anomaly that has harassed and perplexed centuries  it is alleged that the dispersion of the jewish race is a penalty incurred for the commission of a great crime namely the crucifixion of our blessed lord in the form of a jewish prince by the romans at jerusalem and at the instigation of some jews in the reign of tiberius augustus caesar upon this it may be observed that the allegation is neither historically true nor dogmatically sound  i not historically true it is not historically true because at the time of the advent of our lord the jewish race was as much dispersed throughout the world as at this present time and had been so for many centuries europe with the exception of those shores which are bathed by the midland sea was then a primeval forest but in every city of the great eastern monarchies and in every province of the roman empire the jews had been long settled we have not precise authority for saying that at the advent there were more jews established in egypt than in palestine but it may unquestionably be asserted that at that period there were more jews living and that too in great prosperity and honour at alexandria than at jerusalem it is evident from various roman authors that the jewish race formed no inconsiderable portion of the multitude that filled rome itself and that the mosaic religion undisturbed by the state even made proselytes but it is unnecessary to enter into any curious researches on this head though the authorities are neither scant nor uninteresting we are furnished with evidence the most complete and unanswerable of the predispersion by the sacred writings themselves not two months after the crucifixion when the third person of the holy trinity first descended on jerusalem it being the time of the great festivals when the jews according to the custom of the arabian tribes pursued to this day in the pilgrimage to mecca repaired from all quarters to the central sacred place the holy writings inform us that there were gathered together in jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven and that this expression so general but so precise should not be mistaken we are shortly afterwards though incidentally informed that there were parthians medes and persians at jerusalem professing the mosaic faith jews from mesopotamia and syria from the countries of the lesser and the greater asia egyptian libyan greek and arabian jews and especially jews from rome itself some of which latter are particularly mentioned as roman proselytes nor is it indeed historically true that the small section of the jewish race which dwelt in palestine rejected christ the reverse is the truth had it not been for the jews of palestine the good tidings of our lord would have been unknown for ever to the northern and western races the first preachers of the gospel were jews and none else the historians of the gospel were jews and none else no one has ever been permitted to write under the inspiration of the holy spirit except a jew for nearly a century no one believed in the good tidings except jews they nursed the sacred flame of which they were the consecrated and hereditary depositaries and when the time was ripe to diffuse the truth among the ethnics it was not a senator of rome or a philosopher of athens who was personally appointed by our lord for that office but a jew of tarsus who founded the seven churches of asia and that greater church great even amid its terrible corruptions that has avenged the victory of titus by subjugating the capital of the caesars and has changed every one of the olympian temples into altars of the god of sinai and of calvary was founded by another jew a jew of galilee  from all which it appears that the dispersion of the jewish race preceding as it did for countless ages the advent of our lord could not be for conduct which occurred subsequently to the advent and that they are also guiltless of that subsequent conduct which has been imputed to them as a crime since for him and his blessed name they preached and wrote and shed their blood as witnesses  but is it possible that that which is not historically true can be dogmatically sound such a conclusion would impugn the foundations of all faith the followers of jesus of whatever race need not however be alarmed the belief that the present condition of the jewish race is a penal infliction for the part which some jews took at the crucifixion is not dogmatically sound  2 not dogmatically sound there is no passage in the sacred writings that in the slightest degree warrants the penal assumption the imprecation of the mob at the crucifixion is sometimes strangely quoted as a divine decree it is not a principle of jurisprudence human or inspired to permit the criminal to ordain his own punishment why too should they transfer any portion of the infliction to their posterity what evidence have we that the wild suggestion was sanctioned by omnipotence on the contrary amid the expiating agony a divine voice at the same time solicited and secured forgiveness and if unforgiven could the cry of a rabble at such a scene bind a nation  but dogmatically considered the subject of the crucifixion must be viewed in a deeper spirit we must pause with awe to remember what was the principal office to be fulfilled by the advent when the ineffable mystery of the incarnation was consummated a divine person moved on the face of the earth in the shape of a child of israel not to teach but to expiate true it is that no word could fall from such lips whether in the form of profound parable or witty retort or preceptive lore but to guide and enlighten but they who in those somewhat lax effusions which in these days are honoured with the holy name of theology speak of the morality of the gospel as a thing apart and of novel revelation would do well to remember that in promulgating such doctrines they are treading on very perilous ground there cannot be two moralities and to hold that the second person of the holy trinity could teach a different morality from that which had been already revealed by the first person of the holy trinity is a dogma so full of terror that it may perhaps be looked upon as the ineffable sin against the holy spirit when the lawyer tempted our lord and inquired how he was to inherit eternal life the great master of galilee referred him to the writings of moses there he would find recorded the whole duty of man to love god with all his heart and soul and strength and mind and his neighbour as himself these two principles are embalmed in the writings of moses and are the essence of christian morals        thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself i am the lord      leviticus xix  18   it was for something deeper than this higher and holier than even moses could fulfil that angels announced the coming it was to accomplish an event preordained by the creator of the world for countless ages born from the chosen house of the chosen people yet blending in his inexplicable nature the divine essence with the human elements a sacrificial mediator was to appear appointed before all time to purify with his atoning blood the myriads that had preceded and the myriads that will follow him the doctrine embraces all space and timenay chaos and eternity divine persons are the agents and the redemption of the whole family of man the result if the jews had not prevailed upon the romans to crucify our lord what would have become of the atonement but the human mind cannot contemplate the idea that the most important deed of time could depend upon human will the immolators were preordained like the victim and the holy race supplied both could that be a crime which secured for all mankind eternal joywhich vanquished satan and opened the gates of paradise such a tenet would sully and impugn the doctrine that is the cornerstone of our faith and hope men must not presume to sit in judgment on such an act they must bow their heads in awe and astonishment and trembling gratitude  but though the opinion that the dispersion of the jewish race must be deemed a penalty incurred for their connection with the crucifixion has neither historical nor doctrinal sanction it is possible that its degrading influence upon its victims may have been as efficacious as if their present condition were indeed a judicial infliction persecution in a word although unjust may have reduced the modern jews to a state almost justifying malignant vengeance they may have become so odious and so hostile to mankind as to merit for their present conduct no matter how occasioned the obloquy and illtreatment of the communities in which they dwell and with which they are scarcely permitted to mingle  let us examine this branch of the subject which though of more limited interest is not without instruction  in all the great cities of europe and in some of the great cities of asia among the infamous classes therein existing there will always be found jews they are not the only people who are usurers gladiators and followers of mean and scandalous occupations nor are they anywhere a majority of such but considering their general numbers they contribute perhaps more than their proportion to the aggregate of the vile in this they obey the law which regulates the destiny of all persecuted races the infamous is the business of the dishonoured and as infamous pursuits are generally illegal pursuits the persecuted race which has most ability will be most successful in combating the law the jews have never been so degraded as the greeks were throughout the levant before the emancipation and the degradation of the greeks was produced by a period of persecution which both in amount and suffering cannot compare with that which has been endured by the children of israel this peculiarity however attends the jews under the most unfavourable circumstances the other degraded races wear out and disappear the jew remains as determined as expert as persevering as full of resource and resolution as ever viewed in this light the degradation of the jewish race is alone a striking evidence of its excellence for none but one of the great races could have survived the trials which it has endured  but though a material organization of the highest class may account for so strange a consequence the persecuted hebrew is supported by other means he is sustained by a sublime religion obdurate malignant odious and revolting as the lowest jew appears to us he is rarely demoralized beneath his own roof his heart opens to the influence of his beautiful arabian traditions all his ceremonies his customs and his festivals are still to celebrate the bounty of nature and the favour of jehovah the patriarchal feeling lingers about his hearth a man however fallen who loves his home is not wholly lost the trumpet of sinai still sounds in the hebrew ear and a jew is never seen upon the scaffold unless it be at an auto da fè  but having made this full admission of the partial degradation of the jewish race we are not prepared to agree that this limited degeneracy is any justification of the prejudices and persecution which originated in barbarous or mediæval superstitions on the contrary viewing the influence of the jewish race upon the modern communities without any reference to the past history or the future promises of israel dismissing from our minds and memories if indeed that be possible all that the hebrews have done in the olden time for man and all which it may be their destiny yet to fulfil we hold that instead of being an object of aversion they should receive all that honour and favour from the northern and western races which in civilized and refined nations should be the lot of those who charm the public taste and elevate the public feeling we hesitate not to say that there is no race at this present and following in this only the example of a long period that so much delights and fascinates and elevates and ennobles europe as the jewish  we dwell not on the fact that the most admirable artists of the drama have been and still are of the hebrew race or that the most entrancing singers graceful dancers and exquisite musicians are sons and daughters of israel though this were much but these brilliant accessories are forgotten in the sublimer claim  it seems that the only means by which in these modern times we are permitted to develop the beautiful is music it would appear definitively settled that excellence in the plastic arts is the privilege of the earlier ages of the world all that is now produced in this respect is mimetic and at the best the skilful adaptation of traditional methods the creative faculty of modern man seems by an irresistible law at work on the virgin soil of science daily increasing by its inventions our command over nature and multiplying the material happiness of man but the happiness of man is not merely material were it not for music we might in these days say the beautiful is dead music seems to be the only means of creating the beautiful in which we not only equal but in all probability greatly excel the ancients the music of modern europe ranks with the transcendent creations of human genius the poetry the statues the temples of greece it produces and represents as they did whatever is most beautiful in the spirit of man and often expresses what is most profound and who are the great composers who hereafter will rank with homer with sophocles with praxiteles or with phidias they are the descendants of those arabian tribes who conquered canaan and who by favour of the most high have done more with less means even than the athenians  forty years agonot a longer period than the children of israel were wandering in the desertthe two most dishonoured races in europe were the attic and the hebrew and they were the two races that had done most for mankind their fortunes had some similarity their countries were the two smallest in the world equally barren and equally famous they both divided themselves into tribes both built a most famous temple on an acropolis and both produced a literature which all european nations have accepted with reverence and admiration athens has been sacked oftener than jerusalem and oftener razed to the ground but the athenians have escaped expatriation which is purely an oriental custom the sufferings of the jews however have been infinitely more prolonged and varied than those of the athenians the greek nevertheless appears exhausted the creative genius of israel on the contrary never shone so bright and when the russian the frenchman and the anglosaxon amid applauding theatres or the choral voices of solemn temples yield themselves to the full spell of a mozart or a mendelssohn it seems difficult to comprehend how these races can reconcile it to their hearts to persecute a jew  we have shown that the theological prejudice against the jews has no foundation historical or doctrinal we have shown that the social prejudice originating in the theological but sustained by superficial observations irrespective of religious prejudice is still more unjust and that no existing race is so much entitled to the esteem and gratitude of society as the hebrew it remains for us to notice the injurious consequences to european society of the course pursued by the communities to this race and this view of the subject leads us to considerations which it would become existing statesmen to ponder  the world has by this time discovered that it is impossible to destroy the jews the attempt to extirpate them has been made under the most favourable auspices and on the largest scale the most considerable means that man could command have been pertinaciously applied to this object for the longest period of recorded time egyptian pharaohs assyrian kings roman emperors scandinavian crusaders gothic princes and holy inquisitors have alike devoted their energies to the fulfilment of this common purpose expatriation exile captivity confiscation torture on the most ingenious and massacre on the most extensive scale with a curious system of degrading customs and debasing laws which would have broken the heart of any other people have been tried and in vain the jews after all this havoc are probably more numerous at this date than they were during the reign of solomon the wise are found in all lands and unfortunately prospering in most all of which proves that it is in vain for man to attempt to battle the inexorable law of nature which has decreed that a superior race shall never be destroyed or absorbed by an inferior  but the influence of a great race will be felt its greatness does not depend upon its numbers otherwise the english would not have vanquished the chinese nor would the aztecs have been overthrown by cortez and a handful of goths that greatness results from its organization the consequences of which are shown in its energy and enterprise in the strength of its will and the fertility of its brain let us observe what should be the influence of the jews and then ascertain how it is exercised the jewish race connects the modern populations with the early ages of the world when the relations of the creator with the created were more intimate than in these days when angels visited the earth and god himself even spoke with man the jews represent the semitic principle all that is spiritual in our nature they are the trustees of tradition and the conservators of the religious element they are a living and the most striking evidence of the falsity of that pernicious doctrine of modern timesthe natural equality of man the political equality of a particular race is a matter of municipal arrangement and depends entirely on political considerations and circumstances but the natural equality of man now in vogue and taking the form of cosmopolitan fraternity is a principle which were it possible to act on it would deteriorate the great races and destroy all the genius of the world what would be the consequence on the great anglosaxon republic for example were its citizens to secede from their sound principle of reserve and mingle with their negro and coloured populations in the course of time they would become so deteriorated that their states would probably be reconquered and regained by the aborigines whom they have expelled and who would then be their superiors but though nature will never ultimately permit this theory of natural equality to be practised the preaching of this dogma has already caused much mischief and may occasion much more the native tendency of the jewish race who are justly proud of their blood is against the doctrine of the equality of man they have also another characteristic the faculty of acquisition although the european laws have endeavoured to prevent their obtaining property they have nevertheless become remarkable for their accumulated wealth thus it will be seen that all the tendencies of the jewish race are conservative their bias is to religion property and natural aristocracy and it should be the interest of statesmen that this bias of a great race should be encouraged and their energies and creative powers enlisted in the cause of existing society  but existing society has chosen to persecute this race which should furnish its choice allies and what have been the consequences  they may be traced in the last outbreak of the destructive principle in europe an insurrection takes place against tradition and aristocracy against religion and property destruction of the semitic principle extirpation of the jewish religion whether in the mosaic or in the christian form the natural equality of man and the abrogation of property are proclaimed by the secret societies who form provisional governments and men of jewish race are found at the head of every one of them the people of god coöperate with atheists the most skilful accumulators of property ally themselves with communists the peculiar and chosen race touch the hand of all the scum and low castes of europe and all this because they wish to destroy that ungrateful christendom which owes to them even its name and whose tyranny they can no longer endure  when the secret societies in february 1848 surprised europe they were themselves surprised by the unexpected opportunity and so little capable were they of seizing the occasion that had it not been for the jews who of late years unfortunately have been connecting themselves with these unhallowed associations imbecile as were the governments the uncalledfor outbreak would not have ravaged europe but the fiery energy and the teeming resources of the children of israel maintained for a long time the unnecessary and useless struggle if the reader throw his eye over the provisional governments of germany and italy and even of france formed at that period he will recognize everywhere the jewish element even the insurrection and defence and administration of venice which from the resource and statesmanlike moderation displayed commanded almost the respect and sympathy of europe were accomplished by a jewmaniniwho by the bye is a jew who professes the whole of the jewish religion and believes in calvary as well as sinaia converted jew as the lombards styled him quite forgetting in the confusion of their ideas that it is the lombards who are the convertsnot manini  thus it will be seen that the persecution of the jewish race has deprived european society of an important conservative element and added to the destructive party an influential ally prince metternich the most enlightened of modern statesmen not to say the most intellectual of men was though himself a victim of the secret societies fully aware of these premises it was always his custom great as were the difficulties which in so doing he had to encounter to employ as much as possible the hebrew race in the public service he could never forget that napoleon in his noontide hour had been checked by the pen of the greatest of political writers he had found that illustrious author as great in the cabinet as in the study he knew that no one had more contributed to the deliverance of europe it was not as a patron but as an appreciating and devoted friend that the high chancellor of austria appointed frederick gentz secretary to the congress of viennaand frederick gentz was a child of israel  it is no doubt to be deplored that several millions of the jewish race should persist in believing in only a part of their religion but this is a circumstance which does not affect europe and time with different treatment may remove the anomaly which perhaps may be accounted for it should be recollected that the existing jews are perhaps altogether the descendants of those various colonies and emigrations which voluntary or forced long preceded the advent between the vast carnage of the roman wars from titus to hadrian and the profession of christ by his countrymen which must have been very prevalent since the christian religion was solely sustained by the jews of palestine during the greater part of its first century it is improbable that any descendants of the jews of palestine exist who disbelieve in christ after the fall of jerusalem and the failure of barchochebas no doubt some portion of the jews found refuge in the desert returning to their original land after such long and strange vicissitudes this natural movement would account for those arabian tribes of whose resistance to mohammed we have ample and authentic details and who if we are to credit the accounts which perplex modern travellers are to this day governed by the pentateuch instead of the koran  when christianity was presented to the ancestors of the present jews it came from a very suspicious quarter and was offered in a very questionable shape centuries must have passed in many instances before the jewish colonies heard of the advent the crucifixion and the atonement the latter however a doctrine in perfect harmony with jewish ideas when they first heard of christianity it appeared to be a gentile religion accompanied by idolatrous practices from which severe monotheists like the arabians always recoil and holding the jewish race up to public scorn and hatred this is not the way to make converts  there have been two great colonies of the jewish race in europe in spain and in sarmatia the origin of the jews in spain is lost in the night of time that it was of great antiquity we have proof the tradition once derided that the iberian jews were a phoenician colony has been favoured by the researches of modern antiquaries who have traced the hebrew language in the ancient names of the localities it may be observed however that the languages of the jews and the philistines or phoenicians were probably too similar to sanction any positive induction from such phenomena while on the other hand in reply to those who have urged the improbability of the jews who had no seaports colonizing spain it may be remarked that the colony may have been an expatriation by the philistines in the course of the long struggle which occurred between them and the invading tribes previous to the foundation of the hebrew monarchy we know that in the time of cicero the jews had been settled immemorially in spain when the romans converted to christianity and acted on by the priesthood began to trouble the spanish jews it appears by a decree of constantine that they were owners and cultivators of the soil a circumstance which alone proves the antiquity and the nobility of their settlement for the possession of the land is never conceded to a degraded race the conquest of spain by the goths in the fifth and sixth centuries threatened the spanish jews however with more serious adversaries than the romans the gothic tribes very recently converted to their syrian faith were full of barbaric zeal against those whom they looked upon as the enemies of jesus but the spanish jews sought assistance from their kinsmen the saracens on the opposite coast spain was invaded and subdued by the moors and for several centuries the jew and the saracen lived under the same benignant laws and shared the same brilliant prosperity in the history of spain during the saracenic supremacy any distinction of religion or race is no longer traced and so it came to pass that when at the end of the fourteenth century after the fell triumph of the dominicans over the albigenses the holy inquisition was introduced into spain it was reported to torquemada that twothirds of the nobility of arragon that is to say of the proprietors of the land were jews  all that these men knew of christianity was that it was a religion of fire and sword and that one of its first duties was to avenge some mysterious and inexplicable crime which had been committed ages ago by some unheard of ancestors of theirs in an unknown land the inquisitors addressed themselves to the spanish jews in the same abrupt and ferocious manner in which the monks saluted the mexicans and the peruvians all those of the spanish jews who did not conform after the fall of the mohammedan kingdoms were expatriated by the victorious goths and these refugees were the main source of the italian jews and of the most respectable portion of the jews of holland these exiles found refuge in two republics venice and the united provinces the portuguese jews it is well known came from spain and their ultimate expulsion from portugal was attended by the same results as the spanish expatriation  the other great division of jews in europe are the sarmatian jews and they are very numerous they amount to nearly three millions these unquestionably entered europe with the other sarmatian nations descending the borysthenes and ascending the danube and are according to all probability the progeny of the expatriations of the times of tiglathpileser and nebuchadnezzar they are the posterity of those devout men parthians medes and elamites who were attending the festivals at jerusalem at the time of the descent of the holy spirit living among barbarous pagans who never molested them these people went on very well until suddenly the barbarous pagans under the influence of an italian priesthood were converted to the jewish religion and then as a necessary consequence the converts began to harass persecute and massacre the jews  these people had never heard of christ had the romans not destroyed jerusalem these sarmatian jews would have had a fair chance of obtaining from civilized beings some clear and coherent account of the great events which had occurred they and their fathers before them would have gone up in customary pilgrimage to the central sacred place both for purposes of devotion and purposes of trade and they might have heard from semitic lips that there were good tidings for israel what they heard from their savage companions and the italian priesthood which acted on them was that there were good tidings for all the world except israel and that israel for the commission of a great crime of which they had never heard and could not comprehend was to be plundered massacred hewn to pieces and burnt alive in the name of christ and for the sake of christianity  the eastern jews who are very numerous are in general the descendants of those who in the course of repeated captivities settled in the great eastern monarchies and which they never quitted they live in the same cities and follow the same customs as they did in the days of cyrus they are to be found in persia mesopotamia and asia minor at bagdad at hamadan at smyrna we know from the jewish books how very scant was the following which accompanied esdras and nehemiah back to jerusalem a fortress city built on a ravine surrounded by stony mountains and watered by a scanty stream had no temptations after the gardens of babylon and the broad waters of the euphrates but babylon has vanished and jerusalem remains and what are the waters of euphrates to the brook of kedron it is another name than that of jesus of nazareth with which these jews have been placed in collision and the ishmaelites have not forgotten the wrongs of hagar in their conduct to the descendants of sarah  is it therefore wonderful that a great portion of the jewish race should not believe in the most important portion of the jewish religion as however the converted races become more humane in their behaviour to the jews and the latter have opportunity fully to comprehend and deeply to ponder over true christianity it is difficult to suppose that the result will not be very different whether presented by a roman or anglocatholic or genevese divine by pope bishop or presbyter there is nothing one would suppose very repugnant to the feelings of a jew when he learns that the redemption of the human race has been effected by the mediatorial agency of a child of israel if the ineffable mystery of the incarnation be developed to him he will remember that the blood of jacob is a chosen and peculiar blood and if so transcendent a consummation is to occur he will scarcely deny that only one race could be deemed worthy of accomplishing it there may be points of doctrine on which the northern and western races may perhaps never agree the jew like them may follow that path in those respects which reason and feeling alike dictate but nevertheless it can hardly be maintained that there is anything revolting to a jew to learn that a jewess is the queen of heaven or that the flower of the jewish race are even now sitting on the right hand of the lord god of sabaoth  perhaps too in this enlightened age as his mind expands and he takes a comprehensive view of this period of progress the pupil of moses may ask himself whether all the princes of the house of david have done so much for the jews as that prince who was crucified on calvary had it not been for him the jews would have been comparatively unknown or known only as a high oriental caste which had lost its country has not he made their history the most famous in the world has not he hung up their laws in every temple has not he vindicated all their wrongs has not he avenged the victory of titus and conquered the caesars what successes did they anticipate from their messiah the wildest dreams of their rabbis have been far exceeded has not jesus conquered europe and changed its name into christendom all countries that refuse the cross wither while the whole of the new world is devoted to the semitic principle and its most glorious offspring the jewish faith and the time will come when the vast communities and countless myriads of america and australia looking upon europe as europe now looks upon greece and wondering how so small a space could have achieved such great deeds will still find music in the songs of sion and still seek solace in the parables of galilee  these may be dreams but there is one fact which none can contest christians may continue to persecute jews and jews may persist in disbelieving christians but who can deny that jesus of nazareth the incarnate son of the most high god is the eternal glory of the jewish race     chapter xi       jewish disabilities  it would seem to follow from the views expressed in the preceding chaptet that in communities professing a belief in our lord the jewish race ought not to be subject to any legislative dishonour or disqualification these views however were not those which influenced lord george bentinck in forming his opinion that the civil disabilities of those subjects of her majesty who profess that limited belief in divine revelation which is commonly called the jewish religion should be removed he had supported a measure to this effect in the year 1833 guided in that conduct by his devoted attachment to the equivocal principle of religious liberty the unqualified application of which principle seems hardly consistent with that recognition of religious truth by the state to which we yet adhere and without which it is highly probable that the northern and western races after a disturbing and rapidly degrading period of atheistic anarchy may fatally recur to their old national idolatries modified and mythically dressed up according to the spirit of the age it may be observed that the decline and disasters of modern communities have generally been relative to their degree of sedition against the semitic principle since the great revolt of the celts against the first and second testament at the close of the last century france has been alternately in a state of collapse or convulsion throughout the awful trials of the last sixty years england notwithstanding her deficient and meagre theology has always remembered sion the great transatlantic republic is intensely semitic and has prospered accordingly this sacred principle alone has consolidated the mighty empire of all the russias how omnipotent it is cannot be more clearly shown than by the instance of rome where it appears in its most corrupt form an old man on a semitic throne baffles the modern attilas and the recent invasion of the barbarians under the form of red republicans socialists communists all different phases which describe the relapse of the once converted races into their primitive condition of savagery austria would long ago have dissolved but for the semitic principle and if the north of germany has never succeeded in attaining that imperial position which seemed its natural destiny it is that the north of germany has never at any time been thoroughly converted some perhaps may point to spain as a remarkable instance of decline in a country where the semitic principle has exercised great influence but the fall of spain was occasioned by the expulsion of her semitic population a million families of jews and saracens the most distinguished of her citizens for their industry and their intelligence their learning and their wealth  it appears that lord george bentinck had offended some of his followers by an opinion expressed in his address to his constituency in 47 that in accordance with the suggestion of mr pitt some provision should be made for the roman catholic priesthood of ireland out of the land although this opinion might offend the religious sentiments of some and might be justly looked upon by others as a scheme illsuited to the character of an age adverse to any further religious endowments it must be acknowledged that no member of the protectionist party had any just cause of complaint against lord george for the expression of an opinion which he had always upheld and of his constancy to which he had fairly given his friends notice this was so generally felt that the repining died away the jewish question as it was called revived these religious emotions these feelings as springing from the highest sentiment of our nature and founded however mistaken in their application on religious truth are entitled to deep respect and tenderness but no one can indulge them by the compromise of the highest principles or by sanctioning a course which he really believes to be destructive of the very object which their votaries wish to cherish  as there are very few englishmen of what is commonly called the jewish faith and as therefore it was supposed that political considerations could not enter into the question it was hoped by many of the followers of lord george bentinck that he would not separate himself from his party on this subject and very earnest requests and representations were made to him with that view he was not insensible to them he gave them prolonged and painful consideration they greatly disquieted him in his confidential correspondence he often recurs to the distress and anxiety which this question and its consequences as regarded his position with those friends to whom he was much attached occasioned him it must not therefore be supposed that in the line he ultimately took with reference to this question he was influenced as some have unkindly and unwarrantably fancied by a selfwilled inexorable and imperious spirit he was no doubt by nature a proud man inclined even to arrogance and naturally impatient of contradiction but two severe campaigns in the house of commons had already mitigated these characteristics he understood human nature he was fond of his party and irrespective of other considerations it pained his ardent and generous heart to mortify his comrades it was therefore not in any degree from temper but from principlefrom as pure as high and as noble a sense of duty as ever actuated a man in public lifethat lord george bentinck ultimately resolved that it was impossible for him to refuse to vote for the removal of what are commonly called jewish disabilities he had voted in this particular cause shortly after his entrance into public life it was in accordance with that general principle of religious liberty to which he was an uncompromising adherent it was in complete agreement with the understanding which subsisted between himself and the protectionist party when at their urgent request he unwillingly assumed the helm he was entreated not to vote at all to stay away which the severe indisposition under which he was then labouring warranted he did not rudely repulse these latter representations as has been circulated on the contrary he listened to them with kindness and was not uninfluenced by them enfeebled by illness he had nearly brought himself to a compliance with a request urged with affectionate importunity but from which his reason and sense of duty held him aloof after long and deep and painful pondering when the hour arrived he rose from his bed of sickness walked into the house of commons and not only voted but spoke in favour of his convictions his speech remains one of the best ever delivered on the subject not only full of weighty argument but touched with a high and even tender vein of sentiment  this vote and speech of lord george bentinck no doubt mortified at the moment a considerable portion of his followers and occasioned great dissatisfaction among a very respectable though limited section of them this latter body must either have forgotten or they must have been strangely unacquainted with the distinct understanding on which lord george had undertaken the lead of the party or otherwise they could not have felt authorized in conveying to him their keen sense of disapprobation unfortunately he received this when the house had adjourned for the holidays and when mr bankes who had been the organ of communication with him in 46 was in the country and when the party was of course generally dispersed lord george did not take any pains to ascertain whether the representation which was made to him was that of the general feeling of a large party or that only of a sincere highly estimable but limited section he was enfeebled and exhausted by indisposition he often felt even when in health that the toil of his life was beyond both his physical and moral energies and though he was of that ardent and tenacious nature that he never would have complained but have died at his post the opportunity of release coming to him at a moment when he was physically prostrate was rather eagerly seized and the world suddenly learnt at christmas with great astonishment that the renowned leader of the protectionist party had relinquished his trust  the numerous communications which he received must have convinced him that the assumed circumstances under which he acted had not been accurately appreciated by him he was implored to reconsider his course as one very detrimental to the cause to which he was devoted and which would probably tend to the triumph of those whose policy he had attempted to defeat and whose personal conduct he had at least succeeded in punishing  the prophesied time has come he wrote to his friend mr bankes on the 23rd of december 1847 when i have ceased to be able to serve the party the great cause of protection or my country by any longer retaining the commission bestowed on me in the spring of 1846 you will remember however that when unfeignedly and honestly but in vain trying to escape from being raised to a position which i foresaw i must fail to maintain with advantage to you or honour to myself i at last gave my consent i only did so on the express understanding that my advancement should be held to be merely a pro tempore appointment waiting till the country should have the opportunity of sending to parliament other men better fitted to lead the country gentlemen of england i have recalled these circumstances to your mind with no other purpose than that the party may feel how entirely free they are without even the suspicion of doing an injustice to me or of showing me in this any disrespect to remodel their arrangements and to supersede my lieutenancy by the appointment of a superior and permanent commander  and again on christmasday to the same gentleman in reply to an acknowledgment of the preceding he says while thanking mr bankes for his warmhearted letter as very grateful to his feelings confidentially i tell you that far from feeling in the least annoyed i shall feel greatly relieved by a restoration to privacy and freedom i worked upon my spirit in 46 and 47 but i have learnt now that i have shaken my constitution to the foundation and i seriously doubt my being able to work on much longer  he wrote on the 24th of december to one of his most intimate friends and warmest supporters mr christopher the member for lincolnshire who had remonstrated with him as to his decision it is not in my nature to retain a station one moment after i get a hint even that any portion of those who raised me to it are wearied of seeing me there the old members of the party will all recollect how clearly i foresaw and foretold that i should be found a very inconvenient as well as a very inefficient leader so soon as the great protection battle was brought to a close i predicted all that has since occurred and no one more cordially agrees than i do in the wisdom of the present decision the spirit i presume of which is that no great party or large body of men can be successfully or to any good purpose led except by a man who heart and soul sympathizes with them in all their feelings partialities and prejudices cold reason has a poor chance against such influences there can be no esprit de corps and no zeal where there is not a union of prejudices as well as of commercial opinions the election of a leader united with the great body of the party in these respects will tend greatly to reunite its scattered particles even on those questions where i shall be able to give my aid with all my wonted zeal which will not be the less spirited because it will be free and independent  at a later period acknowledging an address signed by the great body of the protectionist party and presented to him by the present earl talbot then a member of the house of commons lord george wrote the considerations which obliged me to surrender a post of honour which every independent and highminded english gentleman has at all times prized above the highest rewards in the gift of the crown the leadership of the country gentlemen of england will never influence me to swerve from any endeavours of which my poor abilities and bodily energies are capable in the promotion of the prosperity of all classes in the british empire at home and in the colonies any more than they can ever make me forget the attachment the friendship and the enthusiastic support of those who stood by me to the end of the death struggle for british interests and for english good faith and political honour and to whose continued friendship and constancy i know i am indebted for this graceful and grateful compliment  if lord george bentinck was inexorable to the entreaties of his friends it must not be supposed that he was influenced in the course which he pursued as was presumed by many at the time not acquainted with the circumstances by any feeling of pique or brooding sullenness no highspirited man under vexatious and distressing circumstances ever behaved with more magnanimity in this he was actuated in a great degree by a sense of duty but still more by that peculiar want of selfishness which was one of the most beautiful traits of his character the moment he had at all recovered from the severe attack by which to use his own language he had been struck down in the first week of the session and from the effects of which it may be doubted whether he ever entirely recovered he laboured zealously to induce some competent person to undertake the office which he had thought it expedient to resign offering in several instances to serve in the ranks and to assist with his utmost energies both in and out of the house the individual who would undertake the responsible direction in the commons  these efforts though indefatigable were not successful for those who were competent to the office cared not to serve under any one except himself about this time a personage of great station and who very much admired lord george bentinck wrote to him and recommended him not to trouble himself about the general discipline of the party but to follow his own course and lead that body of friends who under all circumstances would adhere to him instancing the case of mr canning under circumstances not altogether dissimilar lord george replied as for my rallying a personal party round myself as mr canning did i have no pretension to anything of the kind when mr canning did that the house of commons and england too acknowledged him to be the greatest orator who had survived pitt and fox he had been secretary of state for foreign affairs and had taken a conspicuous part in rousing the country to carry on the war against france  the nature of the subject dealing as it necessarily does with so many personal details renders it impossible to make public the correspondence in which lord george bentinck was engaged at this time in his attempts to place the protectionist party under the guidance of one who would unite all sympathies but were that publication possible it would place lord george bentinck in a very noble and amiable light and prove a gentleness and softness in his nature for which those who were not very intimate with him did not give him credit not that it must be for a moment supposed that he was insensible to what was occurring he was the most sensitive as well as the proudest of men when the writer called at harcourt house to bid him farewell before the christmas holidays and conversing very frankly on the course which he was then pursuing inquired as to his future proceedings lord george said with emotion in this cause i have shaken my constitution and shortened my days and i will succeed or die in the course of the year 1848 walking home talking together from the house of commons he twice recurred to this terrible alternative  but all considerations were merged at this moment in the predominant one which was to keep the party together he wrote to a friend at the end of january who urged him as the hour of work approached and the injurious inconveniences of his abdication would be more felt to confer with his former followers and reconsider his position that no personal feeling prevented his taking that course but that he felt any resumption of responsibility on his part would not be pleasing to a section of those who formerly served with him and that there would be a split in the ranks as far as i am personally concerned he added i could submit to anything short of having my ears cut off and appearing as a croppy to be free again my pride cannot stand leading an unwilling party i would just as soon thrust myself into a dinnerroom where i was at once an uninvited and an unwelcome guest  in the meantime according to his custom the moment that he had sufficiently recovered from his illness he prepared with the utmost zeal for the coming struggle respecting the fate of our sugar colonies in which subject he was soon absorbed  parliament reassembled on the 3rd of february and on that night lord george bentinck brought forward his motion for a select committee to inquire into the present condition and prospects of the interests connected with and dependent on sugar and coffee planting in her majestys east and west indian possessions and the mauritius and to consider whether any and what measures can be adopted by parliament for their relief when he entered the house lord george walked up to the head of the second bench below the gangway on the opposition side and thus significantly announced that he was no longer the responsible leader of the protectionist party it was the wish of the writer of these pages who had resolved to stand or fall by him to have followed his example and to have abdicated the prominent seat in which the writer had been unwillingly and fortuitously placed but by the advice or rather at the earnest request of lord george bentinck this course was relinquished as indicative of schism which he wished to discourage and the circumstance is only mentioned as showing that lord george was not less considerate at this moment of the interests of the protectionist party than when he led them with so much confidence and authority the session however was to commence without a leader without any recognized organ of communication between parties or any responsible representative of opinion in debate all again was chaos there is however something so vital in the conservative party that it seems always to rally under every disadvantage  lord george spoke well to his resolution the house soon recognized he was master of his case and though few foresaw at the moment the important consequences to which this motion would lead the house was interested from the first and though there was no division the debate lasted two days and was sustained on both sides with great animation  the mover vindicated himself very successfully for only proposing a committee of inquiry it has been represented to me he said by the colonies and by persons in this country who are interested in them that the course which i am proposing is not consistent with the necessities of the case that there is something pusillanimous in the motion which i am going to make that in point of fact the interests connected with sugar and coffee planting are in extremis and that while the question of their redress is being discussed in a committee abovestairs these great interests will perish they say to me that a committee of inquiry will be to them of the nature of that comfort which       like cordials after death come late   and that before the committee shall have reported the westindian interest will be altogether past recovery but sir it is for me to consider what my power is to obtain any substantial relief by a direct vote of this house and when i remember that in july 1846 i moved a resolution the purport of which was to maintain the protection for the westindian and the eastindian freelabour colonies which they now seek and that i had but one hundred and thirty gentlemen to support me while two hundred and sixtyfive votes were recorded in favour of the measure of the government admitting slavelabour sugar i feel that it is hopeless for me to endeavour in this house where i have no reason to suppose any addition has been made to the members acquiescing in my views to convert that minority into a majority and more especially when i recollect that on that occasion but five gentlemen connected with the westindian and eastindian interests recorded their votes with me i think the westindian interest has not a good case against me when they blame me for not taking a more resolute step on this occasion  he was not however without hope from the course which he had decided to pursue looking as i have done at the deplorable state of the west indies the east indies and the mauritius and holding as i do in my hand a list of fortyeight great houses in englandtwentysix of the first commercial houses in london sixteen in liverpool and six elsewherewhich have failed and whose liabilities amount in the whole to £6300000 and upwards none of which i believe would have fallen had it not been for the ruin brought upon them by the change in the sugar duties and the consequent reduction in the price of their producei do hope through the intervention of a committee of this house i may be able to prevail upon the house to change its policy with regard to this great question  lord george was supported in this debate by mr thomas baring in one of the best speeches ever made in the house of commons few more combine mastery of the case with parliamentary point than this gentleman it is not impossible to find a man capable of addressing the house of commons who understands the subject it is not impossible to find a man who can convey his impressions on any subject to the house in a lively and captivating manner though both instances are rarer than the world would imagine but a man who at the same time understands a question and can handle it before a popular assembly in a popular style who teaches without being pedantic can convey an argument in an epigram and instruct as the mexicans did by picture possesses a talent for the exercise of which he is responsible to his sovereign and his country  mr baring said that he could not perfectly agree either with lord john russell or lord george bentinck that protection or free trade must be in what they called a circle round which in their legislation they must always move that they must either give protection to everything or free trade to everything he could not say that because sugar claimed protection coals must have protection also neither would he on the other hand apply free trade to every article he acknowledged the advantage of competition as a stimulus he thought that placing things on equal grounds competition was undoubtedly a great advantage he could understand a competition to try the mutual speed of racehorses but there could be no competition between a racehorse and a steamengine for the power of the animal could bear no comparison with that of the machine  mr baring could look back to no legislation more humiliating than the legislation regarding our colonies no great interest was ever so much trifled with so much sacrificed to the cry of the day at one moment to no slavery and another to cheap sugar  the committee was granted and it was generally felt that the question was consequently quieted for the session     chapter xii       leader perforce  during the first six weeks of this famous committee the attendance of its members was not very regular and its labours attracted little attention the evidence on the eastindia part of the question was closed and reported to the house by the end of february after that period the evidence was reported to the house every week or ten days towards the end of march rumours began to circulate of the extraordinary vigour and ability with which this investigation was pursued and of the novel authentic and striking evidence that had been elicited the proceedings were talked of in the house of commons and on the royal exchange the city men who were examined went back to their companions with wondrous tales of the energy and acuteness of harcourt house and the order method and discipline of the committeeroom at westminster as time elapsed the hopes of the colonial interest again revived it was generally felt that lord george had succeeded in establishing an irresistible case it was rumoured that the government could not withstand it those who had originally murmured at the course which he had adopted of moving for a committee of inquiry instead of proposing a specific measure of relief and had treated an investigation as a mere means of securing inaction now recanted their rash criticism and did justice to his prescience and superior judgment as well as to his vast information and indefatigable exertions the week during which the committee sat on their report was a very anxious one the divisions were known every day in the house of commons the alternations of success and discomfiture and the balanced numbers that so often called for the interposition of the chairman were calculated to sustain the excitement and when on the 29th of may it was known that the report was at length agreed to and that a committee of free traders had absolutely recommended a differential duty of 10s in favour of our own produce one might have fancied from the effect visibly produced that a government was changed  a few days beforeit was the day after the derby may 25ththe writer met lord george bentinck in the library of the house of commons he was standing before the bookshelves with a volume in his hand and his countenance was greatly disturbed his resolutions in favour of the colonial interest after all his labours had been negatived by the committee on the 22nd and on the 24th his horse surplice whom he had parted with among the rest of his stud solely that he might pursue without distraction his labours on behalf of the great interests of the country had won that paramount and olympian stake to gain which had been the object of his life he had nothing to console him and nothing to sustain him except his pride even that deserted him before a heart which he knew at least could yield him sympathy he gave a sort of superb groan  all my life i have been trying for this and for what have i sacrificed it he murmured  it was in vain to offer solace  you do not know what the derby is he moaned out  yes i do it is the blue ribbon of the turf  it is the blue ribbon of the turf he slowly repeated to himself and sitting down at the table he buried himself in a folio of statistics  but on monday the 29th when the resolution in favour of a 10s differential duty for the colonies had at the last moment been carried and carried by his casting vote the blue ribbons of the turf were all forgotten not for all the honours and successes of all the meetings spring or autumn newmarket epsom goodwood doncaster would he have exchanged that hour of rapture his eye sparkled with fire his nostril dilated with triumph his brow was elate like a conqueror his sanguine spirit saw a future of continued and illimitable success  we have saved the colonies he saidsaved the colonies i knew it must be so it is the knell of free trade  notwithstanding the formal renunciation of the leadership of the protectionist party by lord george bentinck it was soon evident to the house and the country that that renunciation was merely formal in these days of labour the leader of a party must be the man who does the work and that work cannot now be accomplished without the devotion of a life whenever a great question arose the people out of doors went to lord george bentinck and when the discussion commenced he was always found to be the man armed with the authority of knowledge there was however no organized debate and no party discipline no one was requested to take a part and no attendance was ever summoned the vast majority sitting on the protectionist benches always followed bentinck who whatever might be his numbers in the lobby always made a redoubtable stand in the house the situation however it cannot be denied was a dangerous one for a great party to persevere in but no permanent damage accrued because almost every one hoped that before the session was over the difficulty would find a natural solution in the virtual chief resuming his formal and responsible post notwithstanding his labours on the two great committees of the yearthose on colonial and commercial distresslord george bentinck found time to master the case of the shipping interest when the navigation laws were attacked to impugn in a formal motion the whole of the commercial policy of sir robert peel even while the sugar and coffee planting committee was still sitting and to produce early in march a rival budget it was mainly through the prolonged resistance which he organized against the repeal of the navigation laws that the government in 1848 was forced to abandon their project the resistance was led with great ability by mr herries and the whole party put forward their utmost strength to support him but it is very difficult to convey a complete picture of the laborious life of lord george bentinck during the sitting of parliament at halfpast nine oclock there called upon him the commercial representatives of the question of the day after these conferences came his elaborate and methodical correspondence all of which he carried on himself in a handwriting clear as print and never employing a secretary at twelve or one oclock he was at a committee and he only left the committeeroom to take his seat in the house of commons which he never quitted till the house adjourned always long past midnight and often at two oclock in the morning here he was ready for all comers never omitting an opportunity to vindicate his opinions or watching with lynxlike vigilance the conduct of a public office what was not his least remarkable trait is that although he only breakfasted on dry toast he took no sustenance all this time dining at whites at halfpast two oclock in the morning after his severe attack of the influenza he broke through this habit a little during the last few months of his life moved by the advice of his physician and the instance of his friends the writer of these observations prevailed upon him a little the last year to fall into the easy habit of dining at bellamys which saves much time and permits the transaction of business in conversation with a congenial friend but he grudged it he always thought that something would be said or done in his absence which would not have occurred had he been there some motion whisked through or some return altered his principle was that a member should never be absent from his seat  the session of 48 had been one of unexampled length having lasted ten months and as usual under such circumstances the obstacles to the transaction of public business were sought everywhere except in the real quarter the forms of the house and the propensity to unnecessary discussion among its members were chiefly denounced lord george bentinck did not agree in the justness of these criminations they were eagerly caught by the thoughtless and the superficial but it was his habit to investigate and analyze everything and he found that these charges had no basis the forms of the house of commons are the result of accumulated experience and have rarely been tampered with successfully while on the other hand a parliamentary government is by name and nature essentially a government of discussion it is not at all difficult to conceive a mode of governing a country more expeditious than by a parliament but where truth as well as strength is held to be an essential element of legislation opinion must be secured an unrestricted organ superfluity of debate may often be inconvenient to a minister and sometimes perhaps even distasteful to the community but criticizing such a security for justice and liberty as a freespoken parliament is like quarrelling with the weather because there is too much rain or too much sunshine the casual inconvenience should be forgotten in the permanent blessing acting upon these false imputations a committee was even appointed two years ago of the most eminent members of the house of commons to investigate the subject and suggest remedies and some votaries of the transatlantic type recommended the adoption of the rules of congress where each speaker is limited to an hour but an hour from an uninteresting speaker would be a great infliction the good sense and the good taste of the house of commons will be found on the whole to be the best regulators of the duration of a debate  the truth is that the delay in the conduct of parliamentary business which has been much complained of during the last few years murmurs of which were especially rife in 1848 is attributable to the fact that the ministry though formed of men inferior in point of ability to none who could be reasonably intrusted with administration had not sufficient parliamentary strength after all their deliberations and foresightafter all their observations of the times and study of the public interest their measures when launched from the cabinet into the house were not received by a confiding majority firm in their faith in the statesmanlike qualities of the authors of these measures and in their sympathy with the general political system of which the ministry was the representative on the contrary the success of the measures depended on a variety of sections who in their aggregate exceeded in number and influence the party of the ministers these became critics and took the ministerial measures in hand the measures became the measures not of the cabinet but of the house of commons and a purely legislative assembly became in consequence of the weakness of the government yearly more administrative this was undoubtedly a great evil and occasioned besides great delay many crude enactments as will be the case where all are constructors and none are responsible but the evil was not occasioned by the forms of the house or the length of the speeches sir robert peel was unquestionably a very able administrator but if he had not had a majority of ninety he would have fallen in as ill repute as has been too often the lot of lord john russell  lord george bentinck was very anxious that there should be a parliamentary summary of this enormous and eventful session of 48 that the conduct of business by the ministry should be traced and criticized and the character of the house of commons vindicated and he appealed to the writer of these observations to undertake the task but the writer was unwilling to accede to this suggestion not only because at the end of august he shrank from a laborious effort but principally because he did not hold that his position in the house of commons warranted on his part such an interference since after all he was only the comrade in arms of one who chose to be only an independent member of the house he therefore unaffectedly stated that he thought the office was somewhat above his measure but lord george bentinck would not listen to these representations i dont pretend to know much he said but i can judge of men and horses it is difficult to refuse those who are themselves setting a constant example of selfsacrifice and therefore so far as the labour was concerned the writer would not have shrunk from the exertion even on the last day of the month of august and when the particular wish of lord george was found to be more general than the writer presumed to suppose he accordingly endeavoured to accomplish the intention  three or four days after this the writer about to leave london called at harcourt house to say farewell to his comrade in arms he passed with lord george the whole morning rather indulging in the contemplation of the future than in retrospect lord george was serene cheerful and happy he was content with himself which was rarely the case and remembered nothing of his career but its distinction and the ennobling sense of having done his duty  any misunderstandings that may have for a moment irritated him seemed forgotten he appeared conscious that he possessed the confidence and cordial regard of the great majority of the protectionist party although he chose to occupy a private post and he was proud of the consciousness he was still more sensible of the sympathy which he had created out of doors which he greatly appreciated and to which though with his usual modesty he more than once recurred the thing is to get the people out of doors with you he repeated men like the merchants all the rest follow it was evident that the success of his colonial committee had greatly satisfied his spirit he had received that day the vote of thanks of the westindia body for his exertions he said more than once that with a weak government a parliamentary committee properly worked might do wonders he said he would have a committee on import duties next year and have all the merchants to show what share the foreigners had obtained of the reductions that had been made of late years he maintained that quite irrespective of the general arrangements of the new commercial system sir robert peel had thrown away a great revenue on a number of articles of very inferior importance and he would prove this to the country he said our colonial empire ought to be reconstructed by a total abolition of all duties on produce from her majestys dominions abroad  all his ideas were large clear and coherent he dwelt much on the vicissitudes which most attend all merely foreign trade which though it should be encouraged ought not to be solely relied on as was the fashion of this day looking upon war as occasionally inevitable he thought a commercial system based upon the presumption of perpetual peace to be full of ruin his policy was essentially imperial and not cosmopolitan  about to part probably for many months and listening to him as he spoke according to his custom with so much fervour and sincerity one could not refrain from musing over his singular and sudden career it was not three years since he had in an instant occupied the minds of men no series of parliamentary labours had ever produced so much influence in the country in so short a time never was a reputation so substantial built up in so brief a period ah the questions with which he had dealt were colossal questions the laws that should regulate competition between native and foreign labour the interference of the state in the development of the resources of ireland the social and commercial condition of our tropical colonies the principles upon which our revenue should be raised the laws which should regulate and protect our navigation but it was not that he merely expressed opinions upon these subjects he came forward with details in support of his principles and policy which it had before been believed none but a minister could command instead of experiencing the usual and almost inevitable doom of private members of parliament and having his statements shattered by official information lord george bentinck on the contrary was the assailant and the successful assailant of an administration on these very heads he often did their work more effectually than all their artificial training enabled them to do it his acute research and his peculiar sources of information roused the vigilance of all the public offices of the country since his time there has been more care in preparing official returns and in arranging the public correspondence placed on the table of the house of commons  when one remembered that in this room not three years ago he was trying to find a lawyer who would make a speech for him in parliament it was curious to remember that no one in the period had probably addressed the house of commons oftener though his manner which was daily improving was not felicitous in the house the authority of his intellect his knowledge and his character made him one of the great personages of debate but with the country who only read his speeches he ranked high as an orator it is only those who have had occasion critically to read and examine the long series of his speeches who can be conscious of their considerable merits the information is always full and often fresh the scope large the argument close and the style though simple never bald but vigorous idiomatic and often picturesque he had not credit for this in his day but the passages which have been quoted in this sketch will prove the justness of this criticism as a speaker and writer his principal need was condensation he could not bear that anything should remain untold he was deficient in taste but he had fervour of feeling and was by no means void of imagination  the writer in his frequent communications with him of faithful and unbounded confidence was often reminded of the character by mr burke of my lord keppell  the labours of lord george bentinck had been supernatural and one ought perhaps to have felt then that it was impossible they could be continued on such a scale of exhaustion but no friend could control his eager life in this respect he obeyed the law of his vehement and fiery nature being one of those men who in whatever they undertake know no medium but will succeed or die  but why talk here and now of death he goes to his native county and his fathers proud domain to breathe the air of his boyhood and move amid the parks and meads of his youth every breeze will bear health and the sight of every hallowed haunt will stimulate his pulse he is scarcely older than julius cæsar when he commenced his public career he looks as high and brave and he springs from a longlived race  he stood upon the perron of harcourt house the last of the great hotels of an age of stately dwellings with its wings and courtyard and carriage portal and huge outward walls he put forth his hand to bid farewell and his last words were characteristic of the manof his warm feelings and of his ruling passion god bless you we must work and the country will come round us     chapter xiii       the curtain falls    the heavens darken a new character enters upon the scene  they say that when great men arise they have a mission to accomplish and do not disappear until it is fulfilled yet this is not always true after all his deep study and his daring action mr hampden died on an obscure field almost before the commencement of that mighty struggle which he seemed born to direct in the great contention between the patriotic and the cosmopolitan principle which has hardly begun and on the issue of which the fate of this island as a powerful community depends lord george bentinck appeared to be produced to represent the traditionary influences of our country in their most captivating form born a natural leader of the people he was equal to the post free from prejudices his large mind sympathized with all classes of the realm his courage and his constancy were never surpassed by man he valued life only as a means of fulfilling duty and truly it may be said of him that he feared none but god  a few days after the interview noticed in the last chapter lord george bentinck returned to welbeck some there were who thought him worn by the exertions of the session and that an unusual pallor had settled upon that mantling and animated countenance he himself never felt in better health or was ever in higher spirits and greatly enjoyed the change of life and that change to a scene so dear to him  on the 21 st of september after breakfasting with his family he retired to his room where he employed himself with some papers and then wrote three letters one to lord enfield another to the duke of richmond and the third to the writer of these pages that letter is now at hand it is of considerable length consisting of seven sheets of notepaper full of interesting details of men and things and written not only in a cheerful but even a merry mood then when his letters were sealed about four oclock he took his staff and went forth to walk to thoresby the seat of lord manvers distant between five and six miles from welbeck where lord george was to make a visit of two days in consequence of this his valet drove over to thoresby at the same time to meet his master but the master never came hours passed on and the master never came at length the anxious servant returned to welbeck and called up the groom who had driven him over to thoresby and who was in bed and inquired whether he had seen anything of lord george on the way back as his lord had never reached thoresby the groom got up and accompanied by the valet and two others took lanthorns and followed the footpath which they had seen lord george pursuing as they themselves went to thoresby  about a mile from the abbey on the path which they had observed him following lying close to the gate which separates a water meadow from the deerpark they found the body of lord george bentinck he was lying on his face his arms were under his body and in one hand he grasped his walkingstick his hat was a yard or two before him having evidently been thrown off in falling the body was cold and stiff he had been long dead  a woodman and some peasants passing near the spot about two hundred yards from the gate in question had observed lord george whom at the distance they had mistaken for his brother the marquis of titchfield leaning against this gate it was then about halfpast four oclock or it might be a quarter to five so he could not have left his home much more than half an hour the woodman and his companions thought the gentleman was reading as he held his head down one of them lingered for a minute looking at the gentleman who then turned round and might have seen these passersby but he made no sign to them  thus it seems that the attack which was supposed to be a spasm of the heart was not instantaneous in its effects but with proper remedies might have been baffled terrible to think of him in his deathstruggle without aid and so near a devoted hearth for that hearth too what an impending future  the terrible news reached nottingham on the morning of the 22nd at halfpast nine oclock and immediately telegraphed to london was announced by a second edition of the times to the country consternation and deep grief fell upon all men one week later the remains arrived from welbeck at harcourt house to be entombed in the family vault of the bentincks that is to be found in a small building in a dingy street now a chapel of ease but in old days the parish church among the fields of the pretty village of marylebone  the day of interment was dark and cold and drizzling although the last offices were performed in the most scrupulously private manner the feelings of the community could not be repressed from nine till eleven oclock that day all the british shipping in the docks and the river from london bridge to gravesend hoisted their flags halfmast high and minute guns were fired from appointed stations along the thames the same mournful ceremony was observed in all the ports of england and ireland and not only in these for the flag was halfmast high on every british ship at antwerp at rotterdam and at havre  ere the last minute gun sounded all was over followed to his tomb by those brothers who if not consoled might at this moment be sustained by the remembrance that to him they had ever been brothers not only in name but in spirit the vault at length closed on the mortal remains of george bentinck  one who stood by his side in an arduous and unequal struggle who often shared his councils and sometimes perhaps soothed his cares who knew well the greatness of his nature and esteemed his friendship among the chief of worldly blessings has stepped aside from the strife and passion of public life to draw up this record of his deeds and thoughts that those who come after us may form some conception of his character and career and trace in these faithful though imperfect pages the portraiture of an english worthy
