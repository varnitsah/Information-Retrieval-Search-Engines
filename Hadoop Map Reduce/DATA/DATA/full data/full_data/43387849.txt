known under the general title of the boy hunters series taking the heroes through various adventures while out hunting and fishing in the woods and mountains and on rivers and lakes  the boys are bright lively lads of today with a strong liking for a life in the open air and a keen taste for hunting both big and little game and for fishing in various ways in the former volume entitled four boy hunters they organized their little dun club and obtained permission to go a number of miles from home and establish a camp on the edge of a lake from this spot they were driven by enemies and then settled at another camp where they had various adventures and not a little fun and in the end cleared up a mystery which had bothered them not a little  in the present story we have the same boys and almost the same locality but the time is now winter and in the pages which follow are related the sport the boys had in the snow and on the ice and something about a new mystery which ended in rather a surprising fashion  as i have said before hunting especially in our eastern states is not what it was years ago almost all of the big game has disappeared and the fellow who can get a deer or a moose without going a good many weary miles for the game is lucky yet in some sections small game is still fairly plentiful and a bag full of rabbits or wild ducks is much better than nothing  with best wishes to all who love the woods and waters a gun a dog and a rousing campfire i remain  your sincere friend  captain ralph bonehill     guns and snowshoes     chapter i  introducing four boys   hurrah boys its snowing at last arent you glad  glad you bet im glad snap why ive been watching for this storm for about six months  there you go whopper answered charley dodge with a grin six months indeed why we havent been home six months  well it seems that long anyway said frank dawson who was usually called whopper by his chums because of his exaggerations when speaking ive just been aching to see it snow  so that we can take that trip we proposed put in sheppard reed quickly i guess we are all waiting for that  i am anyway came from will caslette the smallest lad of the four who had gathered at their usual meeting place in the town where they resided our camping out last summer was immense if only we have half as much fun this winter  we will have giant broke in the boy called whopper didnt i tell you i was going to bring down sixteen deer twenty bears two hundred wild turkeys a boatload of wolves and  phew whopper every time you name em over the list gets longer cried charley dodge if you bring down so much game there wont be anything left for other hunters  well ill leave you a bear or two said whopper cheerfully  thanks awfully  leave me one lone wild turkey whopper dear came mournfully from shep reed  say if youre going to talk like that i wont leave anything burst out frank  whopper may bring down all the game but ill wager he cant throw a snowball as straight as i can said charley taking up some snow see that spot on the fence yonder here goes for it  the snowball was launched forth with swiftness and with a thud struck the spot directly in the center  hurrah a bullseye for snap  humph i can do that too cried whopper and forthwith proceeded to make a good hard snowball then he took aim let drive and the ball landed directly on the top of the one charley had thrown  good for you whopper said charley enthusiastically  ah i could do that a thousand times in succession answered the youth given to exaggeration coolly why dont you know that one day there were six tom cats on a fence and i took a snowball and hit em all  what with one snowball queried the little lad called giant  sure thing giant  but how  why i made the snowball bounce from the head of one tom cat to the head of the next answered whopper unabashed  well if that isnt the worst yet roared shep say we ought to roll whopper in the snow for that  right you are cried snap come on  hi hold on yelled whopper in alarm but before he could resist he was landed on his back in the snow and the others proceeded to roll him over good as shep expressed it the rolling process at an end a general snowball fight ensued between all of the boys and also several others who chanced to be passing  the scene was the town of fairview a place containing a main street and also another thoroughfare running to the tidy little railroad depot where eight trains stopped daily the town was made up of fifteen stores and shops three churches a hotel and a livery stable while just outside were a saw mill and several other industries the place was located on the rocky river which ten miles below flowed into a beautiful sheet of water called lake cameron  to those who have read a previous volume of mine entitled four boy hunters the lads skylarking in the snow need no special introduction for the benefit of others let me state that charley dodge was the son of one of the most influential men of that district a gentleman who was a school trustee and also part owner of a big summer hotel and one of the saw mills sheppard reed was the son of the bestknown local physician and he and charleyalways called snap why nobody could tellwere such chums they were often spoken of as the twins  frank dawson had come to fairview a little over two years before and had speedily made himself a prime favorite as we have seen he loved to exaggerate when telling things yet with it all whopper so called was as truthful as anybody as snap said you could always tell whoppers whoppers a mile off which i think was something of a whopper in itself dont you  the youngest lad of the four was will gaslette always called billy or giant he was the son of a french widow lady who thought the world of her offspring although will was small in size he was sturdy and selfreliant and promised to become all that his mother hoped for him  during the previous summer the four boys had organized the fairview gun club and obtained permission to go camping for a few weeks in the vicinity of lake cameron they had started in high spirits and after a number of minor adventures located on the shore of the lake from this spot however they were driven by a saw mill owner named andrew felps who ran a company that was a rival to the concern in which mr dodge had an interest the boys were made to give up their comfortable camp and then they went to firefly lake a mile away here they hunted and fished to their hearts content being joined in some of their sports by jed sanborn an old hunter and trapper who lived in the mountains between the lakes they had some trouble with ham spink a dudish youth from fairview who with some cronies located a rival camp across the lake but this was quickly quelled then during a forest fire they captured a longwanted criminal and came home at last loaded down with game and with the firm determination to go out camping again during the winter  we couldnt spend our time more pleasantly was what snap said just think of a cozy camp in the snow with a roaring campfire and plenty of game on all sides of you um um its enough to make a fellows mouth water  oh well have to go had been sheps answer of course well have to go to school but we are going to have a long vacation around the holidays  and we can ask for our christmas presents in advance giant had interrupted if we go out i know what i want  what giant  a pair of snowshoes  oh well all want those had come from whopper and sleds toofor our traps  thats right  and another shotgun  yes and plenty of blankets its no fun to camp out in winter if you cant keep warm  and so the talk had run on until the winter outing of the gun club became almost a certainty to them but there were certain restrictions one of which placed on all of the boys by their parents was that they should end the term at school with good averages in all their lessons  you must get at least eightyfive per cent out of a possible hundred in all your lessons said doctor reed to shep otherwise you cannot go and the other parents said practically the same thing to snap whopper and giant and then the boys pitched in with a will resolved to come out ahead or know the reason why as snap said     chapter ii  a quarrel in the snow   the snow lay on the ground to the depth of four inches and was still coming down thickly it was the first fall of the season and was lateso late in fact that the boys had been afraid there might come no fall at all fast and furiously flew the snowballs and each lad was hit many times  how is that sang out whopper as he planted a snowball directly in snaps ear  and hows that returned snap quickly and sent a chunk of soft snow down franks collar  wuow spluttered whopper hi that isnt fair oh my poor backbone  here you are giant called out shep and hit the little lad in the back sorry but it cant be helped ioh my and shep bent double as a snowball thrown by giant with much force took him directly in the stomach  just to remember me by sang out giant heres another and the ball struck shep in the elbow small favors thankfully received and big ones granted in return there you are and still another snowball landed on sheps neck  five other boys had come up and now the contestants were lined up on both sides of the street not far from a corner where there was a turn running down to the depot as the snowballing went on a distant locomotive whistle sounded out and the afternoon train from the east rolled into the station several passengers alighted and among the number was andrew felps of the felps lumber company the man who had caused the boy hunters so much trouble the summer previous  mr andrew felps was in a bad humor he had gone to the city on business and matters had not turned out as he had expected now he had gotten back dressed in his best and wearing a new silk hat and he had no umbrella with which to protect himself from the snowstorm more than this his coachman who generally met him when he came in on the train was not in sight  bah ill have to walk i suppose muttered the saw mill owner as he looked around for a carriage and found none just the time you want a rig you cant find one ill discharge johnson as soon as i reach home  with his coat buttoned up around his neck and his head bent low to escape the scudding snow andrew felps hurried away from the depot and up to the main street of fairview then he made another turn presently reaching the spot where our heroes and the other lads were having their sport  hi here comes old felps cried giant we ought to give him something to remember us by  dont you do it returned snap quickly he doesnt know what fun is and hed be sure to make trouble  some other boys were coming up and the snowballs began to fly more furiously than ever snap shep whopper and giant were on one side and a boy named carl dudder and five other town lads on the other side in the midst of the rallies came a yell of alarm followed by several loud cries of rage  hullo look there exclaimed whopper old felps has been knocked into the middle of next month there goes his hat in the snow too who threw at him  i didnt answered giant promptly  neither did i came from snap  nor i added shep  the saw mill owner was flat on his back his silk hat on one side of him and a package of books and papers on the other  maybe he slipped on some ice suggested snap  hi hi who threw that snowball roared andrew felps savagely as he arose to his feet you young villains ill have the law on you for this  he scrambled to his feet and glared around him all of the boys had stopped throwing at once and gazed at him curiously  ha i know you went on andrew felps striding up to snap it was you who hit me in the ear and knocked me down  no sir i did not answered charley  i know better i saw you do it  you are mistaken mr felps i was throwing across the street  dont tell me i know better dodge you hit me and you did it on purpose  at this snap merely shrugged his shoulders  ill have the law on you fumed andrew felps  snap didnt hit you said shep  ha then perhaps you threw the snowball said the saw mill owner suspiciously  i did not  i know you boys and i have not forgotten your work against me last summer growled andrew felps  and we havent forgotten you answered snap coldly you have no right to accuse me of something i didnt do  bah if i find out who hit me ill make it warm for him and having thus delivered himself andrew felps picked up his silk hat and his bundle and went on his way in a worse humor than ever  isnt he a darling observed whopper sarcastically how i would love to own him for a brother  i wonder who did hit him mused snap the snowball couldnt have come from over here  i know who hit him said a little boy named benny grime  who was it benny  ham spink  ham spink cried snap and shep in concert  yes  why he isnt here said whopper  he just came up threw one snowball and ran away i guess he meant to hit somebody else and the snowball hit mr felps instead went on the small boy dont let him know i told you or hell wax me good for it  i shant tell ham said snap but this is strange he continued  thought ham was too much of a dude to throw snowballs was whoppers comment why he wears a new necktie every day now and new patent leather shoes and new gloves and  dont pile it on too thick whopper laughed shep but i admit he is a dude and no mistake  and a sneakto run away as soon as he hit old felps finished giant  there was no time to say more for the snowball battle was again raging more furiously than ever the balls flew on all sides and grown folks coming in that direction kept out of the way as much as possible  here comes old mammy shrader cried snap presently we must be careful not to hit her  the woman he referred to was old and feeble and very short sighted she had a faded shawl over her shoulders and carried a market basket on one arm she went out nursing among the poor people and was well known throughout the entire neighborhood  as the old woman came on a snowball was thrown at her from the other side of the street  say dont do that called out snap angrily leave mammy shrader alone  he has scarcely uttered the words when another snowball was thrown at the aged female this hit her on the cheek and caused her to utter a cry of pain she tried to save herself from falling but could not and went down in a heap  for shame ejaculated shep and ran to help the old woman to arise in the meantime snap with flashing eyes hurried across the street and confronted carl dudder as my old readers know carl dudder was a close crony to ham spink and had done his full share in making our young friends uncomfortable during the summer outing  dudder arent you ashamed of yourself said snap  what are you talking about demanded carl dudder although he trembled a little as he spoke  you threw those snowballs at mammy shrader  i didnt  you didi saw you  thats correcti saw him too put in giant who had followed snap in the meantime whopper had followed shep and both were doing what they could for the old woman  see here snap dodge i dont want you to talk to me blustered carl dudder i know my own business  you ought to be knocked down for throwing at mammy shrader  you cant knock me down growled carl doubling up his fists  a fight a fight cried several boys always ready for an affair of that sort  there was an awkward pause snap did not wish to fight and yet he wanted dudder to understand that he was not afraid  i think i owe you something from last summer said dudder coming closer and sticking his chin in snaps face i havent forgotten that  yes but you seem to have forgotten that we about kept you from starving to death answered snap calmly  and thats no joke came softly from giant  you keep your oar out little one grunted dudder turning to glare at will  you and your crowd acted very meanly last summer and you know it dudder said giant not in the least abashed your treatment of mammy shrader is on a par with your other actions  shut up roared the other boy and made a quick pass at giants head but the small boy dodged and the fist struck snap on the shoulder  the next instant snap hauled off struck out and carl dudder measured his length in the snow     chapter iii  the results of snowballing   carl rudder had not expected this telling blow and he was so dazed it was several seconds before he turned over in the snow and arose to his feet  good for you snap cried will thats the way to serve him  whawhat do you mean by hitting me like that demanded dudder glaring at charley but still keeping a safe distance  what do you mean by hitting me demanded snap  ill punch your head good for you  try itif you dare answered snap defiantly and he took an aggressive step forward at which dudder retreated  ill fight you another timewhen you havent so many friends around said carl dudder lamely and then turning on his heel he started away followed by one of his cronies  if old mammy shrader is hurt youll be to blame called snap after him  hes a coward was giants comment i wish i had got a whack at him he is much larger than i am but i am not afraid of him  while this scene was transpiring shep and whopper had helped old mammy shrader to a seat on the porch of a house not far from where she had gone down the old woman complained of a pain in her side and it was next to impossible for her to take another step  ill have to go home she panted but how am i to get there  here comes mr sell in his grocery wagon cried whopper perhaps hell give you a ride  maybe he willi buy my things from him answered the old woman  the grocer was stopped and the situation explained and he readily volunteered to take mammy shrader to her home located at no great distance he and the boys helped her into the wagon  the boy who struck her ought to be horsewhipped said the grocer fun is one thing but hitting an old woman is quite another  just what i say answered shep  well i knocked him down anyway said snap coming up and giant told the details of the brief encounter  snap volunteered to go with the grocer and between them they soon had mammy shrader at her home and lying on a couch shep hurried home and told his father the particulars of what had occurred  i will drive over and see her said the doctor and as his horse was hitched up he went immediately  she is suffering from a sprain and from the jar said the physician after an examination she must take it easy for a week or so then a neighbor who had dropped in said she would look after the patient during that time  carl dudder ought to be made to pay for this said doctor reed  the dudders wont pay anythingmr dudder is as miserly as they make him even if he is well off said whopper  perhaps he can be forced to pay replied snap  when carl dudder heard that a doctor had been called in to attend mammy shrader he was much frightened he went to consult ham spink about it the two were handinglove in everything  are they sure you threw the snowball asked ham spink pointedly  they say they saw me  who says so  oh snap dodge and that crowd  always that crowd muttered ham spink  they say they know you knocked andrew felps down went on dudder finding some consolation in the fact that ham was in difficulties too  they didnt see a thing roared the dudish youth  well that is what they say  humph carl they are bound to get us into trouble  of course they havent got over last summers trouble yet i suppose they will make it as hot for us as they can  well let us stick together and maybe we can face them down was ham spinks comment and then he lit a cigarette and offered one to his crony and both fell to smoking  that very evening both youths had to face the music and in a manner which did not please them in the least  coming home just before supper mr spink found a note awaiting him it was from andrew felps and ran in part as follows  i have a complaint to make against your son hamilton today while i was on my way through the streets of our town i was assailed in the fashion of a ruffian by your son who threw snowballs at me knocking me down and ruining my silk hat and a rare volume of history i was carrying i demand that your son apologize to me for his actions or i shall make a complaint to the authorities  hamilton what does this mean demanded mr spink after perusing the communication several times  i dont know answered the undutiful offspring brazenly  did you snowball mr felps  no i didnt snowball anybody  he says you did  he must be mistaken  it is mighty queer muttered mr spink i will look into this tomorrow  the old harry take felps anyway muttered ham to himself how did he learn i threw that snowball that dodge crowd must have told him  it was mammy shraders neighbor samuel obrien who called upon mr dudder  sure mr dodder yer son ought to be locked up so he ought said the irishman its him as is wantin to kill old mammy shrader  why what do you mean sir demanded mr dudder in amazement  sure an wasnt it carl as knocked the old lady down today and laid her on a sick bed wid a doctor an me wife to nurse her till she gits betther sure its a bastly shame so it is an carl will go to the lockup onless ye pay all the bills  i do not understand you  thin ill be after explainin answered samuel obrien and gave his story in full to which mr dudder listened in a nervous fashion then carl was called into the room  what do you mean by making trouble in this fashion demanded mr dudder wrathfully  i didnt make trouble said carl sullenly  sure an he did that said the irishman  mr obrien says you knocked mrs shrader down  i didnt  he was seenseveral bys saw him put in samuel obrien  ierit was an accident stammered carl quailing before the stern gaze of his parent theerthe snowball slipped it didnt hit mammy shrader hard and she fell down of her own account not because of the snowball  she says th snowball knocked her down said samuel obrien if ye was my by id be afther givin ye a good walloppin so i would he added pointedly  i will go and see mrs shrader said mr dudder carl you remain at home until i get back  cant i go over and see ham  no  i promised him that i would be over  well you cant go you study your lessons unless you prefer to go with me to mrs shraders  i dont want to go to her house said carl  mr dudder lost no time in paying mammy shrader a visit and then he called on doctor reed when he came home again he was very angry  carl i have a good mind to punish you severely he said i did not think you would treat a woman as mrs shrader has been treated i shall have to pay her doctors bill and also something moreat least fifteen or twenty dollars mr dudder sighed at the thought of parting with so much cash i shall take the amount out of your spending money and out of the money i was going to give you for christmas  cant i have the five dollars you promised me for christmas gasped carl  not a cent of it  oh youre a mean thing burst out carl and ran from the room before his father could stop him     chapter iv  the explosion   on the following afternoon snap was walking down to the river front on an errand for his father when he caught sight of ham spink and carl dudder under a lumber shed the pair were conversing in an earnest fashion but ceased their conversation as snap came closer  snap knew that ham and carl were in far from a friendly humor through one boy he had learned how carl had been treated by his father and through another how andrew felps had discovered that ham had been his aggressor there had been a lively interview when mr felps and mr spink had met and in the end the latter had said he would stand for all damage done then he had gone home and laid down the law good and hard to ham  to punish you i will cut off your spending money said mr spink and thus ham and carl found themselves in the same trouble so far as cash was concerned it galled them exceedingly and as was their habit they laid the blame entirely on others  as snap passed the shed both ham and carl scowled at him then after he had gone a dozen steps ham called out  come back here i want to talk to you  did you address me demanded snap wheeling around  i did come here i want to talk to you  snap did not budge  if you want to talk to me you can come where i am he said  oh you neednt get so mighty high and loftly sneered ham spink  i am not your servant  nice stories you and your crowd have been telling about me and carl went on ham coming closer  trying to get us into trouble put in carl its a jolly shame and you ought to be thrashed for it  see here dudder and you too spink answered charley firmly i want no quarrel with you ever since our outing last summer you have been like bears with sore heads if your camping out was a failure it wasnt our fault when you hadnt any game we let you have some of ours and we did a great deal more for you than you deserved now  oh dont preach cried ham  what do you want of me  i want to give you fair warning that neither i nor carl will stand for the way you are acting either you keep your distance or it will be the worse for you  i am not afraid of you  well you had better be  what do you mean by that demanded snap he fancied there might be some hidden meaning to ham spinks words  oh youll find out one of these days came from carl significantly  if you try any of your underhanded tricks youll get the worst of itjust as you did up to the camp answered snap and went on his way  oh i wish i could mash him muttered ham spink between his set teeth  yes and mash the whole crowd of em added dodder i hate the very sight of em  do you know that they are talking about camping out again  what this winter  yes  where  that i dont know  id like to spoil the trip for them  so would i maybe we can do it too if we watch our chances  the two talked the matter over for some time and when they separated it was with the fixed determination to play some underhanded trick and do the dodge crowd as they called our friends much harm  all of the boys who attended the local school had been waiting impatiently to learn when the present session would come to an end now it was announced that school would close the following friday afternoon and remain shut up for three weeks and a half  hurrah that will give us just time enough for a dandy outing cried whopper  youll have to kill a bear a day to make up the number you said youd bring down answered giant  pooh i never kill bears singly sniffed whopper i always kill them in pairs or by the half dozen  weve got to make sure that we can go first said shep remember the school averages  they did remember and all were very anxious concerning the examinations to come off before the term closed they studied hard and came out with an average of eighteight to ninetyfour per cent  good said snap our folks cant find fault with such records and nobody did find fault on the contrary the boys received not a little praise and permission to go on the winter outing was readily granted  let us start next monday said giant who was impatient to get away  i doubt if we can get ready so quickly answered shep there is a good deal to do you know  then make it tuesday pleaded giant  the ice on the river is perfect so it will be the easiest thing in the world to skate to the lake and drag our sleds after us  it had already been decided that they should go into camp at firefly lake where they had left their summer shelter only a few months before firefly lake was a beautiful sheet of water or ice located a mile from lake cameron and about eleven miles from fairview to get to this spot they had to go to lake cameron first and then along a narrow watercourse which united the two sheets of water  the news quickly spread through the town that the gun club was going away on another outing and many envied our friends their coming pleasures ham spink and carl rudder looked sour over the prospects  where are they going asked carl  to firefly lake to their old camp  after this announcement both boys looked at each other suggestively  it will be moonlight tonight and we can easily skate twenty or twentyfive miles suggested ham  so we can ham let us do it andfix things  we will said ham firmly  as soon as it was settled that our friends were to go away before christmas and remain away over the holidays they received from their parents several gifts in advance all obtained snowshoespicked out for them by their old hunter friend jed sanbornand they also procured an extra gun an extra sled and some warm camp blankets they still possessed their old camp outfit and so it was an easy matter to gather the things together and get everything ready for the start the outfit was packed upon two goodsized sleds and well fastened  i suppose we ought to have skated up to the camp and inspected things observed snap but i have been too busy to do so  oh i reckon everything is as we left it answered whopper  the camp was all right two weeks ago said jed sanborn who chanced to be present of course youll have to fix up some kind of a chimney in the cabin for you cant keep your fire outdoors in this weather  its as much fun to fix up the cabin as it is to camp out said shep and the others agreed with him  on monday afternoon the boys got their things together and stored them in an old boathouse on the river front they had looked to their skates and each pair had been sharpened and put in first class condition  we may use our skates as much as the snowshoes said whopper  with everything stored in the old boathouse the door was carefully locked by shep who put the key in his pocket the old boathouse had two windows but each of these was nailed shut  i dont believe anybody will get in there observed the doctors son  oh i dont think there are any thieves around answered whopper  the evening was devoted to final preparations and it was after ten oclock before any of the boys thought of retiring snap was over to sheps house and the doctors son saw his friend to the front door  now remember seven oclock sharp said shep we want to get away as early as possible so well have plenty of time to fix up the cabin when we get there  oh ill be up early enough said snap with a smile fact of it is i am so worked up i dont expect to do much sleeping  after a few words more the boys separated and snap started to walk home he had almost reached his gate when something prompted him to halt he looked down the roadway in the direction of the old boathouse  i have half a mind to go down and see if everything is o k he murmured to himself  then he thought it would be foolish and started to enter the house but he was undecided and at last hurried down the roadway in the direction of the river  he was still some distance from the old boathouse when he discovered two persons running across an open field which lined the roadway he could not make out anything excepting that they were either men or big boys  thats queer he reasoned and then started forward again  snap was still two hundred feet from the old boathouse when a most extraordinary thing happened there was a rumble as of thunder followed by a fierce flash of fire and then the end of the boathouse arose in the air and came down with a crash completely wrecking what was left of the building     chapter v  off for the camp   the sudden and unexpected shock nearly threw snap from his feet and it was several seconds before he could collect his senses  then in a dim and uncertain way he realized two thingsthat there had been a terrific explosion and that the old boathouse containing their precious camping outfit was in ruins  what in the world can it mean he asked himself as he stared in a bewildered fashion at the ruin in front of him it sounded as if some dynamite went off  the noise and shock of the explosion was heard all over fairview and soon people came flocking to the scene from all directions  what blew up  hullo the cramer boathouse is down  fire fire  such were some of the cries which arose on all sides then the crowd came closer staring at the fallen building as snap had done  in the meanwhile snap ran forward until he was less than a rod away from the wrecked building he saw a small fire start up among some splintered boards and quick to act picked up some chunks of snow and attempted to put it out  thats a good idea said john sell the grocer who had arrived and he too began to throw the snow and so did others  our campingout things are in that place said snap  is that so what blew up some of your powder  ii dont think so faltered snap he had up to that moment not thought of the cartridges they had stored on one of the sleds  must have been pretty powerful said another man that noise was like a regular blast over to the stone quarries  in the crowd was shep who had just been on be point of going to bed and soon whopper and giant arrived in the meanwhile large quantities of snow were hurled on the ruins and soon the fire was completely under control  snap do you think our cartridges went off questioned whopper  no i dont how could they go off unless they were fired from a gun or otherwise  a rat might have gnawed them suggested giant  those cartridges wouldnt cause such a wreckage as this said snap firmly his senses were now coming back to him well i never he exclaimed suddenly  whats up now  i just thought of something  what is it  when i left sheps house i walked in this direction because i was worried for fear somebody might steal our traps as i walked along i saw two persons running across heckers cornfield i couldnt make out who they were but i fancy they came from this direction  then they must have caused the explosion said whopper quickly but why should they do it  maybe it was an accident said giant  id like to know how much our outfit is damaged said shep anxiously i dont care about the old boathouse it wasnt worth much anyway  from a nearby store several lanterns were brought and men and boys proceeded to make an inspection of the ruins some boards and timbers were hauled aside and soon the boys discovered the sleds with the outfit practically as they had left them one load was a bit damaged at the end but that was all  im thankful it is no worse was snaps comment  if the fire hadnt been put out when it was everything would have burnt up said shep seriously  while the boys were taking care of their sleds and the other things the men folks looked around for traces of what had caused the explosion among the men was jerry corwin one of the blasters at the stone quarry  dynamite did this said he dynamite and nothing else  it certainly sounded like dynamite said another man  how would dynamite get here asked mr dodge who had arrived on the scene  at this question jerry corwin shrugged his massive shoulders  once in a while some dynamite is missing from our store at the quarry he answered the laborers steal it for they can sell it to farmers for blasting out stumps and to others during the past six months we have lost at least a dozen sticks  as the boathouse was not worth much why was it blown up asked doctor reed who had been summoned by somebody who thought a man had been hurt  thats the question said mr dodge evidently it contained nothing of value outside of the outfit belonging to our sons  hum murmured the physician and said no more  it was a bitter cold night so after the fire was put out and the ruins examined the majority of the crowd went home the members of the gun club put their outfits in a neighboring barn where a friend promised they should be safe and then after a short talk went to their respective abodes it was a good hour before any of the lads got to sleep  whopper was just dreaming of another terrific explosion when he awoke with a start to hear a loud pounding on the side of the house directly under his bedroom window opening the sash cautiously he caught sight of giant below hitting the clapboards with a snow shovel which happened to be handy  oh what a racket murmured whopper i must pay him for that and scooping up some snow from the window sill he gave a low whistle then as giant looked up he let the snow drop  wuow spluttered the little lad as the loose snow filled his mouth and nose say do you want to smother me  then stop that infernal racket answered whopper do you want the neighborhood to think that there are more explosions taking place  time to be moving said giant and passed on to arouse shep  now my son be very careful and keep out of danger said mr dodge to charley when the latter was ready to leave i shall send old jed sanborn up to see you once or twice and if you need anything from here you let him know and he can bring it to you and then after a warm handshake from his father and a kiss from his mother snap almost ran from the house fearful that he would be late  at the barn where the things had been stored he found giant and shep but nothing was to be seen of whopper  i woke him up said giant something has gone wrong or he would be here by this time  they waited five minutes longer and snap was on the point of going to whoppers home when they saw the missing club member approaching on a run  what in the world kept you so long cried shep  oh i had a little setto with barney hedge answered whopper he said some things i didnt like and i rolled him over in the snow and put some down his back to help him cool off  barney hedge repeated snap he knew the fellow mentioned to be a crony of ham spink and carl dudder what was it about  oh about our outing last summer it seems hedge and the others are starting a report that we didnt shoot the game we brought in but that jed sanborn brought down the most of it for us  how mean cried giant  he said we couldnt shoot but that we were all blowersand if left to ourselves in this cold weather we would starve to death and freeze in the bargain i couldnt stand for that so i pitched into him  good for you shouted giant i hope you gave him something to remember  i wonder if we will have trouble with that crowd during the present outing mused snap after a pause  i dont think they are going camping answered whopper they havent got enough real sporting blood in them  after that the topic of conversation quickly changed as they looked over their things for the last time to make certain that everything was there  the boys carried a good supply of clothing including extra underwear and extra pairs of boots each had a pair of warm blankets and also a rubber sheet to be used in case of sudden rain  the stores were made up of a variety of things including flour bacon beans some canned goods and coffee chocolate sugar salt pepper and condensed milk they had their old nest of pans and kettles tin cups and plates and likewise enough knives forks and spoons to go around in a waterproof case were several boxes of matches and they also had along an acetylene bicycle lamp which they thought they might use in bringing down game at night and an axe and a hatchet  all of the young sportsmen were armed with shotguns and they also took along mr dodges rifle as they had done before and the trusty pistol belonging to doctor reed their snowshoes were placed on the tops of the loads and they put on their wellsharpened skates as soon as the river front was reached  goodbye to fairview cried shep when all was in readiness for the start  goodbye boys and the best of luck for you shouted doctor reed who had driven down in his sleigh to see them off  dont let the bears eat you up called out a riverman who stood on the dock  no danger of that answered snap  and then with a shout and the waving of caps the members of the fairview gun club set off on their winter outing never dreaming of the many surprises and perils which awaited them     chapter vi  chickens and mince pie   it was a perfect winter day with a dull golden glow in the sky and only a faint breeze from the north blowing on the ground the snow lay to the depth of ten inches or a foot but the wind of the week past had almost cleared the ice on the river here and there were long ridges of snow across the glare but that was all  the young hunters had tied long ropes to the sleds and while whopper and shep pulled one turnout snap and giant dragged the other the sleds had polished runners and slid over the river surface so easily that pulling was more sport than work  the course was down the river towards lake cameron and in a very few minutes the town neighborhood was left behind on either side of the frozen stream were trees and bushes with here and there a cleared patch or an orchard some boys accompanied them a short distance but then these dropped back and our four young friends were left to themselves  do you remember how we stopped at pop lundys orchard when we went to the camp in the rowboat observed shep  yes and how he caught us and then got us to go after the negro who stole the watch put in whopper  i shouldnt mind having some of his apples now said giant we ought to have taken apples along  there is the orchard now cried snap but there are no apples to be had this time of year  as if we would dare to take them said whopper with a wink of his eye  as they neared the spot where the orchard ran down to the river shore they heard the sound of an axe and saw simon lundy chopping down an old apple tree for firewood the man was a very closefisted farmer and was rarely known to do a charitable act  how are you mr lundy called out snap as he brought one of the sleds to a halt  how do ye do grunted the farmer and then gave a closer look oh so its you fellers agin hey goin campin once more  we are  how are your apples getting along asked shep also halting  didnt have sech a big crop as i expected  thought you might spare us a few suggested whopper of course well pay for them if you wish  well there haint much profit in givin apples away said simon lundy pursing up his thin lips got some putty good golden russets left how many do ye want  give us all you can spare for a quarter said shep who had been chosen treasurer of the club for the outing  simon lundy led the way to his barn and there the boys picked out some russets and some greenings while this was going on mrs lundy came from the house to see the visitors  why if it aint them same boys as helped to catch that nigger she cried want some apples hey give em all they want simon they deserve em  i was aerasellin them the apples answered the husband lamely and growing a bit red in the face  what simon lundy aint ye ashamed you shant take a cent from em not a cent why the idee  all right all right if you say so said the farmer hastily  i do say so mrs lundy turned to the young hunters where be you agoin  we are going camping answered snap at the same place we were last summer  aint you afraid o being frizz to death  oh i think we can stand it  what have ye took along to eat  snap told her and she shrugged her shoulders  ye ought to have brung more boys now ive jest been amakin some mince pies wouldnt ye like one o them  yes indeed shouted whopper who had a weakness for that dainty i can eat mince pie in the middle of my sleep  then you shall have the biggest pie o the lot said mrs lundy and simon she added to her husband you jest kill a couple o fat chickens fer em maybe they wont find no game the first day they be in camp an they ought to have some kind o meat  its drefful expensive groaned simon lundy  shucks these boys did us a real service an want em to know we appreciate it answered mrs lundy briskly  she told her husband what chickens to catch and kill and helped pull the feathers then she brought forth the still steaming mince pie leaving it in the stone dish in which it had been baked  you can leave the dish when you come backif you think o it she said and if ye dont twont matter much  a little later saw the four boy hunters on their way again the precious mince pie resting on the top of one of the sled loads and the apples and chickens on the other mrs lundy waved them a cheery adieu and simon smiled somewhat grimly  it nearly broke old pop lundys heart to give the things away was giants comment  it wasnt any more than fair after what we did for him answered shep say boys camping out with chicken and mince pie wont be bad will it  yum yum was the only answer the others gave  by noon they found themselves on lake cameron on one shore were the grim evidences of that terrible forest fire which had nearly cost the saw mill robber and the felps crowd their lives a few spots on the lake were clear but at other points the snow lay from a few inches to a foot and a half deep  they skated to the opposite shore and stopped near the shelter of some pines and hemlocks all were willing to rest and a small campfire was built over which they made a pot of coffee they had brought with them some sandwiches and some cake and these made up the brief noonday meal  here goes for a first shot cried snap leaping to his feet with a part of a sandwich still in his mouth he had discovered several rabbits near some bushes up the lake shore catching up his shotgun he took careful aim and blazed away  two of them exclaimed shep good for you snap  snap ran forward and picked up the game they were plump and heavy and he held them up with pride  we shant starve just yet remarked giant we are sure to get rabbits and partridge and wild turkeys and there must be plenty of fish under this ice  all of the party were anxious to reach the former camp to see what it looked like so the noonday rest did not last long skirting one shore of lake cameron they came to the narrow waterway that connected it with firefly lake here the water which usually flowed swiftly between the rocks was frozen up in a lumpy fashion that made skating impossible  well have to walk the rest of the distance announced whopper we couldnt skate on this in a million years  i wish we could try the snowshoes said giant he knew very little about using the articles  cant do it answered snap but just you wait well have more snow before long and then the snowshoes will come in mighty handy  they took off their skates put them on the sleds and started up the rocky and frozen watercourse the walking was treacherous and soon whopper went down with shep on top of him the bag of apples came over both  hi get off of me roared whopper do you want to crush me into a pancake who threw that bag of apples  you want to be careful of the loads admonished snap dont throw off the mince pie as you did the apples  look yelled giant who had been gazing to the north of the watercourse am i mistaken or is that a deer  a deer a deer cried shep and on the instant all of the boys forgot about the tumble and each caught up his shotgun it was indeed a deer standing among some young trees about two hundred yards distance  oh if we can only bring it down said whopper in a whisper  we must bring it down answered shep in an equally low voice  get out of sight warned snap if he sees us hell be of in a jiffy  they dropped behind some convenient bushes and then moved forward with great caution each with his shotgun ready to blaze away instantly  the forward movement lasted for fully five minutes and then all raised up cautiously and looked for the deer  the game had disappeared  where is he whispered giant gazing around in bewilderment  bless me if i know answered snap  the young hunters gazed in all directions and then came out into the open  he is surely gone said shep  there he goes sang out giant and pointed up the lake to a clearing an eighth of a mile away  and streaking it like greased lightning added whopper hell reach the canadian line before he stops  too bad growled shep in disgust i fancied wed get him sure  this puts me in mind of what jed sanborn says said snap with a sickly grin be sure of only what is in your game bag  the young hunters looked around for more deer but none were in that vicinity and so they returned to where they had left the sleds  if it hadnt been that we want to get to camp we might have followed up that deer was giants comment  not much use of that answered snap by the way he was running he must have been pretty well woke up and when that happens you know a deer will run for miles without stopping  all were glad when they came in sight of firefly lake about one half of the surface was a smooth glare of ice the other half being covered with ridges of snow  to reach their old camp they had to go up the shore and around a bend where the bushes and trees were thick once more they donned their skates and went forward rapidly  let us have a race cried whopper and he and giant set off with one sled while snap and shep set off with the other  an extra piece of mince pie to the winning team cried the doctors son merrily as he put on an extra spurt  soon the turn of the shore was gained with the sleds side by side then all of the young hunters gazed ahead  well i never  if this isnt too bad for anything  such were the exclamations uttered and there was good cause for their consternation and dismay instead of the tidy cabin they had expected to see nothing but a heap of blackened logs confronted them  the log cabin had been burnt to the ground     chapter vii  a dismaying discovery   the hearts of the four young hunters went down in their boots as they surveyed the desolate scene before them  they had spent much hard labor over the cabin which had been their home during a large part of the summer outing and they had fully expected to find it in the same condition as when they had locked it up and come away  boys what can this mean said snap at last who has played us this shabby trick  can the cabin have burnt down right after we left it asked giant  why no it has been burnt down since the last snowstorm answered shep otherwise the snow would cover the ruins  this fire isnt over three or four days old came from whopper  do you think it could start up of itself asked the small member of the gun club  no i dont  then somebody must have set it on fire  yes  who  that remains to be found out said snap oh i wish i had the fellow here now and he banged a fist into the palm of his hand to show what he would do in such a case  the boys walked around the ruin several times and lifted up a few of the halfburnt logs it was easy to see that the cabin was a total wreck snap heaved a mountainous sigh and so did the others  well have to clear all this stuff away and build a brand new cabin said shep all these old logs are good for is firewood  that is true shep answered snap what i am thinking of is what are we to do tonight we cant stay out in the open air it is growing colder every minute  well i am not going home came quickly from giant id rather freeze  who said anything about going home demanded whopper why i wouldnt go home in a thousand years cabin or no cabin we can rig up some sort of shelter of pine boughs and then build another cabin  i know a dandy spot for another cabin said snap dont you remember i mentioned it to you shep last summer the spot where the young trees stood so close together in a circle  just the place answered the doctors son  standing around was cold work and the young hunters lost no time in cutting some dry brushwood and building a fire on which they placed several of the halfburnt logs it was now the middle of the afternoon and they knew they must work vigorously if they wanted any sort of a suitable shelter against the cold before nightfall  the spot snap had mentioned was less than two hundred feet up the lake front here behind some bushes which would keep off considerable wind was an almost perfect circle of trees the diameter inside being about fifteen feet the trees were mostly young and not very tall and the lower branches were not over ten feet from the ground on an average  we can cut off the tops of the trees and then bind in some of the branches for a roof said snap over those branches we can bind others with strips of bark between we can cut the trees higher on one side of the circle than on the other so the snow and rain can run off then we can bind in brushwood and bark for the sides between the trees leaving one spot open for a rough sort of chimney which well have to build up of flat rocks it wont make as nice a cabin as the other was but it is the best we can do in this wintry weather and i think with a good fire going we can make it fairly comfortable inside  there were a great many things to take into consideration but in the main snaps idea was voted a good one and the sleds were brought to the spot and the axe and hatchet gotten  giant you bring up that campfire said snap well want it here later bring all those halfburnt logs too so that well have plenty of firewood  aye aye captain answered the little lad in true nautical style and touching his cap  while giant rebuilt the campfire the others set to work on the new cabin first snap and shep went up in the trees and marked off the top of the new shelter then down came one tree top after another and then the limbs that could not be used above in the meantime whopper took a hunting knife and cut some strips of bark  now let us begin to bind in the branches said snap and he and shep set to work with whopper helping them giant passed up some branches which had fallen to the ground and also some long pliable withes to be used as rope fortunately some of the branches left on the trees were long and supple and could be twisted around one another with ease  we are going to have a regular mat of a roof observed whopper why cant we pile a lot of dead leaves on top to make it air tight  because they might possibly shake down and catch fire answered snap we can bind in some more brushwood and some more bark then the next snow will do the rest  at last the roof was finished and the workers dropped to the ground it was now night and all were tremendously hungry  well have to let the sides of the shelter go until morning said snap we can pile up some tree branches on the windy side and put the rubber blankets over them then during the night we can build a fire right in the middle of the hut but well have to take turns at guarding to prevent the place from catching fire and to prevent those sleeping from smothering if the wind should change  while snap and shep continued to work on the shelter whopper and giant started to cook the evening meal which consisted of a broiled chicken a loaf of bread they had brought along and a slice of cake washed down with hot chocolate they spent an hour over the meal and in the meantime discussed their future plans and the burnt cabin  do you know i have an idea that the same person who burnt down our cabin wrecked the old boathouse said snap  i was figuring it that way too answered whopper the question is who would be so mean  perhaps it was carl dudder answered giant  or ham spink came from shep  it was certainly done by an enemy said snap but i shouldnt dare to accuse anybody unless i was certain  you are right there answered the doctors son burning a building is a serious piece of business  yes and blowing up a place with dynamite is serious too added whopper why its a wonder the whole town didnt sail skyward  the floor of the shelter had been cleaned up and on one side were placed several piles of fresh pine boughs which in camping out make the best kind of a couch then the fire was brought in and placed where the smoke could drift out between the trees the blaze soon warmed the place up and the ruddy glare made the boys feel quite at home  to keep out still more of the cold the two sleds were stood up between some of the trees and the canvas coverings and rubber blankets were stretched around as far as they would go by that time all of the boys were worn out with their labors and their journey and glad enough to retire  each member of this club will have to remain on guard two hours said snap well draw lots for turns  this was done and it fell to whopper to take the first turn from nine oclock to eleven giant was to follow him and then snap and sheep  just my luck grumbled whopper and when i am so sleepy i can scarcely keep my eyes open  well dont you go to sleep until your two hours is up said snap sharply keep an eye on the fire and dont wake giant up until his turn comes  i am going to fix up a pot of beans to cook answered whopper that will help to keep me awake  leaving whopper fussing with the bean pot the others turned into their blankets and threw themselves on their pine bough couches inside of five minutes shep was asleep and snap and the small member of the gun club quickly followed  whopper filled the pot half full of bean soaked them a little in ice water and then hung them over the fire to bake putting some bacon with them to give the proper flavor then he brought in some extra sticks and sat down he was indeed sleepy and it was all he could do to keep his eyes open  guess i had better walk around he told himself and not to disturb the sleepers passed through one of the openings between the trees to the outside of the shelter  it was a moonlight night and he could see across the lake with ease all was quiet saving for the distant hoot of an owl and the occasional bark of a fox the wind had gone down and not a tree branch was stirring  what a glorious night for skating mused the boy there must be a good many out at fairview now that the ice is so solid  he walked around the shelter four times and then came to a halt once more in front of the lake  as he did this he saw some object move across the ice of the lake one object was followed by another and then a third and a fourth  animals of some kind he thought but what  he watched the objects for several minutes  they kept coming closer slowly stopping every now and then as if to deliberate then of a sudden a lonely mournful howl rent the air  wolves he muttered they have discovered our camp and are coming towards it i wonder what i had better do     chapter viii  the first night in camp   whopper was not much frightened he had met wolves before and he did not think that the pack on the ice would dare to attack him and his friends nevertheless to be on the safe side he watched the beasts closely and when they came still nearer he rushed into the shelter and grabbed up his shotgun  whats the row asked shep sleepily disturbed by the unusual bustle  four wolves are on the ice in front of the shelter explained whopper reckon ill give them a shot  ill go along and the doctors son sprang up and reached for his own firearm  when whopper got outside again followed by shep he saw the wolves had approached still closer there were now seven of them and they stood in a semicircle sniffing the air suspiciously the mansmell was strong and this they did not like for to them it betokened only danger yet mingled with the mansmell was the smell of chicken and rabbit meat and this pleased them for they were hungry  let us both fire together suggested shep each of us ought to bring down at least one you can fire to the right and ill fire to the left of the line  all right  they took careful aim and at the word from whopper each pulled the trigger of his shotgun  bang bang  the two guns spoke up in rapid succession and as the smoke cleared away it was seen that two of the wolves lay on the ice twisting and turning in their death agonies the others were scuttling away one limping painfully  hullo whats up came from snap as he rushed from the shelter followed by giant what are you firing at  we just brought down a couple of wolves answered whopper with considerable satisfaction in his tone  wolves ejaculated giant i didnt think theyd find us as early as this  taking a brand from the fire whopper led the party out on the ice to where the two wolves lay one was already dead and the other quickly breathed its last they were large and gaunt looking creatures with cruel teeth and shep shivered as he looked them over  i am glad they didnt get into the shelter he observed if they had we should have had the fight of our lives  i doubt if they would have attacked us answered snap they were after those rabbits and that chicken they must have followed the sled trail from lake cameron  as the young hunters did not want the wolves they were left where they had fallen the other beasts did not show themselves again  the remainder of the night passed without anything unusual happening once the wind veered around a little threatening to suffocate them with smoke from the campfire but by the time they prepared to vacate the shelter the wind veered back to where it had first come from and gave them no more trouble  i saw a beautiful owl said giant when they were preparing breakfast id like to get him and have him stuffed  to eat i presume said whopper innocently  eat what do you take me for cried the smaller member of the gun club and picking up a chunk of snow he shied it at whopper taking the latter in the ear  whopper could not stand that and threw some snow in return then ensued a regular snowball fight all around which came to a sudden termination when shep hit the coffee pot and spilled half of the hot beverage in the snow  hi thats going too far cried snap dont waste good coffee like that  i move we fine shep one cent for a bad throw murmured giant  he can make another pot of coffee thats what he can do grumbled whopper  all right i will but no more snowballing for the present answered shep and set to work without delay  for breakfast they had some chicken some bread and butter and hot coffee the bread was pretty dry but nobody minded it for hunger and a clear cold atmosphere are wonderful appetite builders  the first thing to do today is to finish building our shelter said snap  oh gosh cant we go hunting demanded whopper who was itching to get out after big game  he wants to bring in a few of those bears he has been talking about said giant with a wink of his eye  no hunting until the shelter is good enough to use in all kinds of weather answered snap  the bracing air kept the boys moving lively and directly after breakfast they set to work in earnest a large quantity of tree branches were cut down and with these they made the sides and top of the hut or cabin as tight as possible around the bottom of the shelter they heaped up all the snow that was close at hand  the building of the chimney bothered them a great deal fortunately they found some stones which were fairly flat and these they managed to pile up into something of a square with an opening in the center and another at the bottom next to the shelter on the outside they heaped up some dirt and above this plastered the cracks with mud when tried the chimney drew very well and there seemed to be little danger of it setting fire to the shelter proper  we ought to have a name for this camp observed snap every really firstclass camp has a name  this is such a very hightoned camp let us call it hotel millionaire suggested giant  the lakehouse came from whopper  ive got something better than that said shep half of these trees are birch trees and we used birch bark on the roof whats the matter with calling the place birch tree inn  thats all right cried snap hurrah for birch tree inn  good enough assented whopper lets run up a napkin for a flag for here is where we feed  not much came from giant whats the matter with this and from an inner pocket he produced a small silken flag i brought this along for our camp  hurrah for the stars and stripes came from snap well raise the flag by all means  this was an easy matter for directly in front of the camp on the lake front grew a tall and slender sapling from this they cut the extreme top and the branches and then ran up a thin rope to which they attached the flag floating in the breeze it looked very pretty and taking off their caps the members of the gun club saluted the national emblem then whopper and shep began to whistle the star spangled banner and the others joined in  the making ready of the camp had taken longer than they had expected and it was nightfall before they had everything as they wished it in addition to making the shelter weather tight and warm they had cut a good sized pile of wood for the fire all were tired out and shep admitted that his back felt pretty stiff and lame  i dont think wed want to work so hard around home said giant frankly and the others admitted that this was so  they were too tired to do more than prepare an ordinary supper but this included the beans previously put in soak and then baked and these went very well then they brought in some wood and closed up the doorway of the inn  no need to remain on guard said snap the fire and the sides of this shelter will keep away all wild animals  thats true  during the afternoon it had begun to snow again and this made it all the more cozy in the shelter after supper the boys piled wood on the fire and lounged around telling stories and talking over the prospects of getting game all were enthusiastic and determined not to return home until they had brought down something worth while as snap expressed it  when the lads came out in the morning they found that the snowstorm had cleared away completely the air was clear and cold with scarcely any wind  whopper could hardly wait to get his breakfast so anxious was he to go after game giant suggested that they go on their snowshoes but snap demurred  not the right kind of snow yet he said let us skirt the lake this morning and see what we can pick up near camp  before they left the inn they saw to it that every spark of the fire was extinguished for the dreadful conflagration of the summer season had taught them a useful lesson they also placed their matches in a tin can so that they might remain dry and also to keep them from being lit by some prowling wild beast  i once heard of a place being burnt down by a fox said giant the animal knocked the match box from a shelf on which some rabbits were hanging  well ive often heard of rats setting fire to buildings by igniting matches answered snap  millions of times came from whopper rats sometimes do that for a regular business they make a deal with people who want to get a fat insurance you know and thenoh and the remarkable story came to a sudden end as shep shied a snowball at the youth who loved to exaggerate  they were soon on the way snap shep and giant with their shotguns and whopper with the rifle they headed directly along the shore of firefly lake intending to make the complete circuit of that sheet of ice  they had proceeded only a short distance when snap held up his hand  rabbits he whispered we are in luck  humph i wanted to see a bear grunted whopper  now dolt you spoil this for us remonstrated snap  let us fire together whispered giant i see at least a dozen  the bunch of rabbits were close to the lake front nibbling the bark from some young shoots growing in that vicinity without delay snap shep and giant brought their shotguns around in position to fire  ill give the signal said shep shep you fire to the left i can fire to the right and giant can blaze away at the middle of the bunch  there they go screamed whopper just then and he spoke the truth the rabbits had discovered the hunters and were making mighty bounds to gain the thickets beyond lake shore  all the boys with shotguns blazed away and four of the rabbits dropped in their tracks another went limping along painfully and snap caught it with case but there was no time for a second shot  well thats not so bad for a start observed giant as they took up their game  if i hadnt yelled youd have lost the bunch said whopper why i was most tempted to bring one down with the rifle     chapter ix  into a hole and out   inside of an hour the young hunters had passed to the extreme end of the lake and were coning down on the other side  here is where the ham spink crowd stole our boat said snap indicating the spot  phew and what a time we did have on the lake afterwards was whoppers comment say i cant understand yet why some of us werent drowned  dont make so much noise said shep well never get any game if you keep on talking  after that they went on a distance of a hundred yards in perfect silence then giant came to a halt and pointed up two trees in front of him on the branches were half a dozen fat gray squirrels  again those carrying shotguns discharged their fowling pieces and down came three of the largest of the squirrels then snap let whopper have his gun and down came another squirrel just as he was about to enter his hole  squirrels and more shouted giant rushing forward  more queried shep we shot only the squirrels  true but youve forgotten what the squirrels hide away  nuts exclaimed whopper just what we want to eat in front of the campfire at night  it was an easy matter to locate the storehouses of the squirrels and from each they took a quantity of nuts they did not take all for they did not wish the squirrels that were still alive to starve  i guess we have got all the game well find around here observed shep as they went on once more the banging away will make the rest of the game keep under cover  well let us go around the lake anyway answered snap there is no fun in crossing over on the ice without skates  down at the lower end the lake made several turns winding in and out among the rocks and here the boys left the ice and walked under the trees and between the bushes  this isnt so pleasant said whopper as he stumbled on a rock and rolled over on his side  look out that your gun doesnt go off cried snap warningly keep the muzzle pointed at the ground  thats what i always do answered whopper  they had almost reached the end of the lake at the point where it emptied through the rocky gorge into lake cameron when giant came to a sudden halt and uttered a low whistle  what is it questioned snap and whopper in a breath  saw something through yonder treessomething big was the answer of the small member of the gun club  you did said snap what did it look like  looked like a cowbut of course it couldnt be that  maybe its was a moose cried shep lets go after him  the thought that a moose might be so close at hand thrilled all the boys and without a moments hesitation they started off in the direction in which the strange animal had been seen  if it is a moose let me take a rifle shot at him whispered whopper a bullet is what hell want to lay him low  im willing you should have the first shot said snap  the others also agreed that whopper should be the first to fireif the game was really as large as expectedand the boy who loved to exaggerate went to the front  they had to climb a small hill which came to an abrupt end beside another gully here the bushes had been bent low by the wind and were covered with drifted snow  be carefulwalking isnt very good here cautioned whopper the ground seems to be spongy  all ranged up to the edge of the gully and prepared to leap across as they did this some of the bushes and the snow gave way and down they went in a heap a distance of ten or a dozen feet as they fell giants shotgun went off with a bang that scared them greatly  oh dear gasped snap when he could free himself from the snow what a tumble is anybody hurt  he gazed around to find whopper head first in a snow drift he pulled his chum out and in the meantime shep and giant scrambled up  diddid my shot hit anybody questioned the smaller member of the club anxiously  im safe announced snap  so am i came from whopper but say i thought i was going to plow through the snow clear to china  the discharge went pretty close to my ear announced shep and then as he began to realize the escape he had had he grew slightly pale  i tried to keep the gun barrel pointed to a safe place said giant but the fall came so quickly i had hardly time to think i am thankful nobody was struck had i hit anybody i should never have forgiven myself and he shuddered  be careful of the rest of the guns said whopper we dont want to be blown out of this holewe prefer to climb outat least i do  they looked to their firearms and then gazed around the locality in perplexity the gully was long and narrow and both sides were covered with ice and snow the ground above also covered with ice and snow was well out of their reach  getting out is going to be no easy task announced snap maybe well have to walk to the end of the gulch  wait perhaps i can climb outif one of you will give me a boost said the doctors son  the others were willing to have shep make the trial and snap and whopper put down their guns and aided him by putting his feet in their hands shep caught hold of some bushes and began to haul himself up with all his strength  hurrah he is going to make it cried giant when snap went the bushes and down rolled the doctors son and plunged once more into the snow  whow he spluttered as he arose and worked the snow from his collar and his coat sleeves no more of that for me snap dont you want to try it  no i prefer to walk to where the gully is not so deep  they struck out to find the bottom of the gulch filled with bowlders bushes and snow more than once one or another went down into a hollow and had to be hauled out  phew but its cold down here murmured whopper my feet feel like two cakes of ice  one of the delights of hunting in the winter time observed snap want to go home whopper  not for a million dollars and a mince pie thrown in was the prompt answer  say a piece of mince pie wouldnt go bad just now said shep smacking his lips  dont mention it please  it took a quarter of an hours hard journeying to reach a point where the gully was only four or five feet deep and here they left the hollow with ease they were now further away from the lake than ever and in a locality that looked new to them  i dont remember this spot although i thought we were all over this ground last summer observed snap  a place looks different in winter from what it does in summer said shep  then that must be it  i reckon that moose must be steen miles from here by this time said whopper he must have heard giants gun go off  as they could see nothing of the strange game they agreed that whopper must be right in his surmise and so determined to look around for other game they circled the end of firefly lake and then walked a short distance in the direction of lake cameron  wait called out whopper presently snap let me have your shotgun and he reached for the weapon  what do you see  a wild turkey and a big one too  snap was willing that whopper should have a try at the turkey since he seemed so disappointed at losing track of the big game and so passed over his shotgun the wild turkey was roosting near the top of a silver maple tree taking careful aim whopper blazed away  to the astonishment of all the wild turkey gave a flutter sank back on the tree limb and then became quiet  what in the world does that mean gasped whopper hardly believing that he saw aright  maybe you didnt hit him suggested giant  didnt hit himat such a short distance said whopper in disgust of course i hit him  then why didnt he tumble down or fly away came from shep  hed fly quick enoughif he could said snap there is something wrong with him maybe he is caught fast in the crotch of the limb  guns in hand the four boy hunters ran forward until they stood directly under the silver maple here they could see the head and the tail of the wild turkey but that was all the game did not offer to move even when whopper set up a shout  hes dead and caught fast i am sure of it said whopper if it were otherwise he would surely flutter down or fly away  youll have to do some climbing to get your game said the doctors son  well i can do that tooif youll give me a boost answered whopper passing over the shotgun and laying aside his rifle  the others assisted him to reach the lower limbs of the silver maple and up he went from one branch to another until he stood directly beneath the wild turkey he put forth his hand with caution  be careful cried shep if the turkey is still alive he may show fight and try to peck out your eyes  shielding himself as best he could whopper presently caught the turkey by one foot he pulled gently at first and then gave a strong yank down came the game from the crotch of the tree and whopper almost lost his balance to save himself he let the game drop to the ground and clutched at the tree branches nearest to him  dead as a door nail he announced as soon as he felt safe and i knew it from the start he didnt fall because he got caught thats all  now you are up in the tree you had better take a look around and see if any more game is it sight called up snap  i will  while the others stamped around to keep warm whopper mounted to the topmost branches of the silver maple from this position he could overlook a wide expanse of country he gazed first to the northward and then over to the west  hullo he yelled suddenly i see something worth going after  what questioned the others in concert  two deer     chapter x  out after deer   you see two deer queried snap  yes  how far from here questioned the doctors son  a good quarter of a mile  oh thats not so far exclaimed giant come on after them fellows  wait till i get down said whopper coming as quickly as he could dont go ahead yet  how are we going ahead since you are the only one that knows where the game is answered the doctors son  as soon as whopper was on the ground they set off taking the wild turkey with them the shot had entered the heart of the turkey killing it instantly and its single flutter had only served to wedge it fast in the tree crotch  boys it is growing colder announced snap as they proceeded  as if we didnt know it answered giant slapping his hands together  and i think it is going to snow some more went on snap  pooh who cares cried whopper i am going to get one of those deer if i die for it  so say i put in shep remember we ought to get quite some game on hand in case we get snowed in at the camp  the sky had become overcast and this was what made it seem colder the wind too was springing up and they were glad to keep to the sheltered portions of the ground so far as the journey after the deer permitted  inside of fifteen minutes they covered more than a quarter of a mile yet no deer were to be seen  whopper didnt you make some mistake asked snap coming to a halt  i am sure i saw the deer  whopper must have been deceived in the distance said giant things look closer on the water or when the ground is covered with snow  perhaps thats it answered whopper anyway the deer were somewhere out here im sure  again they went on but soon came to a series of rocks where walking was difficult giant slipped on one of the rocks and barked his left shin  oh dear he cried in pain i dont like this much it is a regular rocky road to dublin  i dont feel like going much further said snap i think we ought to go back see it is starting in to snow he added as the flakes began to fall  the four boy hunters held a consultation which almost ended in a quarrel whopper was determined to go ahead after the deer and so was shep while snap and giant insisted upon returning to the camp  ill tell you whats let do said whopper two of us can go on and two go back thats fair  and the two to go back can take the game to camp added shep there is no use of our carrying it with us and besides if we get a deer that will be a big load for us  arent you afraid of a big snow coming on questioned snap  oh this snow wont amount to anything declared the doctors son  perhaps it will  snap and giant took possession of all the game and turned over to shep and whopper the lunch that had been brought along  we can get what we want when we reach camp said snap and you may need this before you get back  if i were you i wouldnt stay out too late cautioned giant if you do you may lose your way in the dark  well be safe enough answered whopper confidantly  it was no light load for snap and giant to carry for the turkey rabbits and squirrels were all big they saw shep and whopper depart and rested fully five minutes before taking to the back trail  i wish they had come with us said the leader of the gun club i doubt if they get a deerthe wind is blowing directly toward the game  well they wanted to go so let them answered giant  the barked shin hurt considerably and he was anxious to get back to camp that he might wash it and bathe it with witch hazel  let us go up the lake and across on the ice suggested snap it will be shorter and well avoid that nasty gully and the rough rocks  they took to the course mentioned and inside of half an hour reached the lake front once more it was now snowing steadily and the wind was gradually rising  i said it was going to snow hard grumbled snap they should have come with us it wont be fit to be out in another hour  well they wanted their own way so let them have it answered his companion  they wished they had their skates to skate across a cove which separated them from the camp the bare spots on the ice were as slippery as wet glass and they had to walk as if on eggs as snap expressed it once his right foot went from under him and he measured his length on his back while his gun slid a dozen feet away  come here and ill pick you up sang out giant merrily as soon as he saw his chum was not hurt  that was a peachy fall grumbled snap as he turned over and got up glad the gun didnt go off  do you know what i am going to doif it doesnt snow too hard said giant as they walked on again try my luck at fishing through a hole in the ice fish will taste good for breakfast  they were directly in the middle of the lake when a distant gunshot reached their ears followed by another they halted and listened  whopper and shep must have found something to shoot at remarked the smaller member of the gun club  or else there are other hunters in this vicinity i shouldnt be surprised if jed sanborn is out  yes and a dozen others for the matter of that  by the time they had crossed the lake the wind was blowing furiously sending the snow whirling over the smooth ice in long white streaks more than half out of breath the two young hunters were glad enough to reach the shelter of the trees and bushes  its going to be a corker was snaps comment just listen to the wind whistling through the trees  i dont think ill try fishing just yet said giant i might get frozen fast to the ice  fishing will have to wait giant come on into the inn  they were glad enough to enter the shelter and rest for a few minutes then when they had regained their breath both set about building a fire luckily they had saved some dry bark and brushwood so starting the blaze was comparatively easy they heaped on several mediumsized sticks and then a good back and a front log and soon the fire was roaring merrily the homemade chimney was wide open at the top so a good deal of heat was lost yet enough remained below to warm the shelter nicely  i tell you a fire makes all the difference in the world declared snap as he pulled off his outer coat and cap and sat down close to the chimney no matter how forlorn or lonely a fellow feels a fire is bound to brighten him up and make him feel on better terms with himself  right you are snap i pity the fellow who gets left in the woods without a match or the wherewith to start a campfire answered giant who was using the witch hazel on his ankle  as soon as they were warm the two boys set to work to cook themselves a substantial meal they prepared sufficient for all hands thinking that shep and whopper would be back in an hour or two at the most  they wont stay out very longwith this snowstorm on remarked snap they know what such a storm means as well as we do  before leaving camp that morning giant had made some bread dough and set it for raising this was now in good shape and he kneaded it over and made some loaves and some muffins the muffins they used for their meal along with more beans and some stewed squirrel and a pot of hot chocolate they ate leisurely at the same time keeping their ears on the alert for the coming of their companions three times during the meal snap went to the doorway to gaze out  they are foolish not to come back before it gets night he said if they dont look out theyll be snowbound  oh snap do you think so cried the smaller member of the club in alarm  it might happen giant just look how it is snowing why i cant see a hundred feet from the inn  giant came to the opening and peered forth snap was right the snow was coming down thickly and the fierce wind sent it swirling in all directions the landscape on all sides was completely blotted out  oh if only they had come back with us murmured giant  both of the boys sighed and returned to the fireside finishing their meal in silence they were much worried more than they cared to admit to each other  the meal over giant warmed some water and washed the few tin dishes and other things which had been dirtied snap put another log on the fire and then got out the acetylene bicycle lamp that had been brought along  what are you going to do with that questioned giant  light it and hang it out for a searchlight answered snap it may aid them in finding the inn  the gas lamp was soon fizzing and then snap applied a match as it flashed up he regulated the light and then the affair was taken outside and hung where its rays might flash forth through the storm and across the cove of the lake  they can see that quite a distance even through the flying snow said the leader of the gun club and theyll want all the light they can get to find their way back  he and giant sat down again in front of the roaring fire they watched the sparks fly upward and the ruddy glare showed a concerned look on the face of each they did not care to read or play any game and talked in low tones each with his ears strained to catch any sound from without  slowly one hour after another went by until the darkness of night lay over the camp the snow came down as thickly as ever and the wind shrieked dismally through the leafless trees time and again the two boys had gone to the doorway to look out and snap had even run down to the very edge of the lake  its no use he said finally they are snowbound and cant get here if only they are safe  yes if only they are safe echoed giant     chapter xi  snowbound   left to themselves shep and whopper started off briskly after the deer that had been seen from the top of the tree  we must get at least one of em by all means said shep it wont do to go back to the camp skunked  we shant be skunked answered whopper confidantly if there are a dozen well bag the lot of them  the trail was by no means as easy as they had anticipated and they had to pick their way around the rocks and through the brushwood with care once whopper slid down one of the rocks and landed on his back with a thump that took the wind out of him completely  cats and carrots he gasped say but that was a hard one right enough  trying to split the rock asked shep helping him up  no i was only testing it to see how soft it was growled whopper  soon the two boys found themselves going up a small hill the climb was rather discouraging until whopper let out a soft cry and then motioned for silence  see em queried his chum in a whisper  no but there are the tracks as plain as day  whopper was right the deer tracks were there although partly covered by the falling snow at the sight of them the spirits of the boy hunters arose wonderfully they forgot how tired they were and pushed forward at a faster gait than ever before  wont we surprise them when we come back with such game said shep  i think so shep they didnt really think wed get anything answered whopper  on and on went the boys the trail of the deer becoming plainer at every step they did not notice how much ground they were covering nor in what direction they were moving they had deer fever and had it hard  presently they came to the top of the rise of ground beyond was a patch of scrub timber where years before a forest fire had wiped out the best of the trees looking ahead they saw four deer walking slowly along near some brushwood  there they are cried shep and brought his gun around for use  at that moment the deer turned partly around and looked squarely at the boys they were evidently taken completely by surprise and their heads went up high as they discovered the enemy then without further hesitation they leaped forward toward the dense timber ahead  bang went sheps shotgun and crack came the sharp report of whoppers rifle before the echoes had died away the last of the deer leaped high in the air made a part turn and then came down heavily then it got up ran several paces and fell again and began to kick  i hit him  so did i  lets try for another  but to try for another was out of the question with the fall of the hind one the others reached the shelter of the dense timber and in a second more were completely out of sight and running as only frightened deer can run when they know it is a case of life or death for them  when the two young hunters reached the side of the fallen deer it was just breathing its last  the bullet from the rifle had entered its side and the buckshot had struck in the neck and shoulder  we both brought him down said shep  pity we didnt get the others grumbled whopper  well one is better than nothing  oh i know that and i am thankful as far as that goes will it be worth while to go after the others do you think  no theyll run too far before they stop  the deer was of fair size and looked as if it would make good eating they inspected the game with much interest turning it over and lifting it up  pretty heavy announced whopper well have all we want to do to carry it to camp  just what i was thinking and say just look how it is snowing  the two young hunters gazed about them and were a good deal startled it was growing dark and the leaden air seemed to be filled with snow they had paid little attention to the wind but now realized that it was rising steadily  the best thing we can do is to make for camp said shep if we dont he did not finish  you think well be snowbound  doesnt it look like it  i must admit it does  alarmed more than they cared to mention both boys prepared to return to the inn without delay they selected a slender sapling and cut it down with a hunting knife shep carried they trimmed off the limbs thus making of it a pole to this they slung the deer tied fast by the front and the hind legs then whopper took the front end of the load and shep the rear end and thus they set off in the direction they had come  for perhaps a quarter of a mile all went well for despite the falling snow they managed to keep to the tracks they had made in following the deer then of a sudden whopper came to a halt and shep of course had to do likewise  whats up asked the latter  i cant see the trail anymore the falling snow has covered it completely  whopper was right as shep realized with much alarm both of the young hunters gazed around in perplexity the whirling snow hid the landscape from view in a moment more turning this way and that they were completely bewildered  well i declare burst out shep hang me if i know where i am  i think the lake is in that direction announced whopper after a painful pause  maybe you are righti dont know there seemed to be no sense in standing still with the snow coming down thicker every minute and the wind whistling dismally all around them on they went for at least a quarter of a mile further the rocks bothered them a great deal and twice both fell dropping their load as they did so this is the finest pleasure stroll i ever took in my life was whoppers rather sarcastic comment such level walking and such nice bright sunshine with birds singing andoh and his speech came to an end as he went down again this time into a hollow of snow and dead leaves up to his knees  are you hurt asked shep  not enough to weep over was the answer but no joking this is fierce i wish i was back to camp  so do i whopper but wishing wont take us thereweve got to walk  isnt it getting dark  yes and just listen to that wind  by this time both of the young hunters were scared although neither mentioned it again they went on but only for a dozen rods then both halted and stared in front of them in amazement  whats this  we arent going toward the lake at all  before them was a slight hollow and beyond a cliff of rocks all of twenty to thirty feet high on the top of the cliff grew a number of large trees and several of these had in times past been blown over their tops resting in the hollow below while the roots still clung fast near the top of the cliff  did you ever see this spot before asked shep  not that i can remember answered his chum but i am sure it is not near the lake  the young hunters were more alarmed than ever they felt that they must be miles from camp night was now upon them and the storm instead of clearing away was growing worse every minute  i dont think we can reach camp tonight said shep as bravely as he could although his voice trembled slightly well have to try and make ourselves as comfortable as possible elsewhere  what right out here in the woods  no we can hunt for some sort of shelter whopper  dont you think we can find the lake if we once found that we could keep on along the shore until we struck our camp  i dont believe we can locate the lake in this darkness and with the snow coming down so thickly why look around you cant see at all  whopper did gaze around and had to admit that shep was right they were shut in by the storm which seemed to grow wilder and wilder  with heavy hearts the boys drew closer to the cliff as that seemed to afford some shelter from the wind which cut like a knife in the darkness they stumbled into the hollow and then between two of the fallen trees  well if we have got to seek shelter this place may prove as good as any observed whopper its warmer under the rocks and we can use some of these tree branches for a fire  yes we must have a fire answered the doctors son who did not relish the darkness he wondered what they would be able to do should wolves attack them but did not mention this to his companion  dropping their load in the snow they felt their way between the trees and then broke off some of the small branches for firewood they got the driest they could find  oh dear oh dear came suddenly from whopper  whats up  i havent a single match have you any  in haste shep felt in his pocket there were two matches there but one felt as if it was no good  ive got two but one feels as if the top was off he announced  for gracious sake dont let the good one go out shep here ive got an old letter in my pocket light that first  the doctors son felt in his other pockets and brought forth part of an old railroad timetable the papers were bunched together and held low while shep tried to strike the match that had lost part of its head it made a faint streak of light but that was all  is that the good one asked whopper hoarsely never before had he been so anxious about a light  no ill try the good one now answered the doctors son  dont let the wind blow it out pleaded his chum here use my cap  the papers were placed beside the cap and shep struck the match several times both of the boys hardly dared to breathe then came a flash and a tiny flame sprang up and the papers were set to blazing they put on the smallest and driest of the twigs and then the small branches and both tended the fire with as much care as an infant receives from its nurse soon it became stronger and stronger and they breathed a deep sigh of relief and put on some big pieces of wood  as snap had said at camp the fire brightened things up wonderfully and both boys felt lighterhearted as the ruddy glare lit up the scene they found something of a circular hollow under the cliff with a big fallen tree just beyond it they brought the fire to one side of this hollow and banked up the snow on the other side and soon the shelter began to grow warm then they brought in the deer and hung the game in a fork of the fallen tree  lucky we brought that lunch along said shep i am as hungry as a bear  so am i returned whopper and i dont think that little lunch is going to satisfy me whats the matter with broiling a venison streak  do you want to cut up the deer before we get back to camp  most likely well have to if this snow keeps on there is no telling how long well be snowbound  that is true too well we neednt cut up the whole deeronly cut out what we want to use     chapter xii  a cry for help   fortunately for the boys they knew how to cut up a deer to advantage and it did not take them long to trim away a portion of the pelt and get out the steak they wanted then they fixed up a rude fork on which to cook the meat and soon the appetizing odor of broiled venison filled the hollow  this is much better than nothing but a cold lunch said whopper as he divided the steak fingers were made before knives and forks and as nobody is looking on we can eat as suits us  let us broil another steak before the fire gets low suggested the doctors son if it goes out on us we wont want to be without something to eat  that fire isnt going outnot if i know it why it would be awful to be left without a light and without warmth we might freeze to deathif it got much colder  another and larger steak was well cooked and then the boys set to work to gather a generous supply of firewood breaking and cutting it as best they could this was hard work but it kept them warm and neither complained  i suppose snap and giant are worrying about our not getting back said whopper i hope they dont come out to look for us  after they had cut all the wood they wanted they sat down again by the fire both boys were very tired yet the strangeness of their situation kept them awake for several hours they watched the snow as it came down as thickly as ever and listened to the shrieking of the wind as it tore through the trees on the top of the cliff  do you think more of the trees will come down questioned whopper  i am sure i dont know was sheps reply  at last both boys began to blink and stretch themselves and then whopper said they had better go to sleep  you turn in first said shep ill watch the fire when i cant keep awake any longer ill call you  whopper laid down and was soon slumbering shep continued to guard the fire and to keep himself awake walked up and down the narrow confines of the temporary shelter he often paused to listen to the roaring of the wind which outside of the crackling of the blaze was the only sound that broke the stillness  well i am glad no wild animal has come to disturb us he thought as he continued to pace up and down  presently he sat down and his eyes closed for a moment he dozed and then started up a low moan had reached his ears  what in the world is that he asked himself and felt his hair standing on end then he heard the moan again and turning half around began to grin to himself the moan had come from whopper who was having a nightmare  hi whopper wake up he called and shook his companion  get outdont chew me up groaned whopper and then sat up and rubbed his eyes whawhats the matter oh ieri guess i was dreaming he said sheepishly  you were and groaning fit to raise the dead answered the doctors son who now felt that he could afford to laugh  i dreampt about a million wolves were after me and one was going to chew my foot off said whopper he stretched himself time for me to stand guard  i think you had better i am so tired i feel like sleeping standing up answered shep  whopper arose and waiting to make certain that his companion was wide awake shep threw himself on the couch which had been formed of some leaves found at the rear of the hollow he soon fell into a troubled sleep which lasted about three hours when he awoke at the sound of whoppers voice calling him  is it time to get up he questioned sleepily  shep i hear wolves  wolves and now the doctors son leaped to his feet and glanced toward his shotgun which rested against the rocky wall are you certain  listen  both boys bent their ears and for a full minute neither made a sound then shep shook his head  i cant hear anything now he said  well i heard them before answered whopper positively must have been a million of em too  whopper youve got a million wolves on the brain  have i well i knowlisten  the young hunter stopped short and both listened a second time from a great distance came the howl of a wolf followed by an answering howl not so far off  now what did i tell you  shep did not answer but picked up his shotgun whopper had already gotten the rifle and with the firearms fully loaded the young hunters stood on guard for at least a quarter of an hour  i dont hear them any more said the doctors son at length  they may be sneaking up on the sly answered whopper and it was hard for him to keep his voice from trembling  neither of the boys cared to go beyond the light of the campfire and again they waited but a good half hour went by and nothing more was seen or heard of the wolves  you may as well take another nap whopper said the doctors son ill give you about two hours and then ill lie down for the same length of time that will about finish out the night  whopper agreed to this but it was some time before he could get to sleep and then he had another nightmare and groaned as before but this time shep let him have it out as he told whopper afterward  daylight found them still under the cliff their fitful naps of the night just passed had only about half rested them and they did a good deal of gaping as they stirred up the fire and prepared a morning meal fortunately shep had a pocket cup with him and in that they had to melt snow to get water to drink  well i am glad the night is over declared whopper i declare i dont want to pass another like it  let us be thankful that it was no worse answered the doctors son supposing we had not found this shelter or supposing that match had gone out or supposing we hadnt shot the deer  stop shep i am blue enough already ill tell you what it is by hook or by crook we must get back to camp before tonight if we dont the others will be worried to death about us i am sure  thats easy enough to say but look at the snow  whopper looked beyond the shelter the snow had stopped coming down but it lay to the depth of several inches in some spots and in drifts three and four feet high in others he gave a sigh  tough traveling and no mistake maybe we cant get through at all  i know what i am going to do first of all said shep i am going to climb a tree on the top of the cliff and locate myself  thats a good idea  breakfast over both boys scrambled up one of the fallen trees to the top of the cliff not far away was a tree with low branches and up this went the doctors son whopper boosting him all he could all the boys could climb well and soon shep was far enough up to look around on all sides  there is the lake about threequarters of a mile off he said pointing with his hand i can see our camp too the smoke is coming up out of the chimney  is it on the other side of the lake  it is across the big cove  do you think we can signal to the others questioned whopper  we might try itwith some wet wood answered shep  he came down again and soon they placed several wet sticks on the fire this created a dense smoke which as the wind had fallen went straight up into the sky  that will tell them somebody is over here with a fire said shep but i reckon we had better start for the camp without delay just past the cliff is a ridge of high ground running almost to the lake and the wind has swept it clear of snow so walking will not be so very difficult  it gave them something of a pang to put out the fire yet they did not dare to leave it burning for fear of setting fire to the forest placing the deer on the pole as before they set off toward the ridge shep had mentioned  with the going down of the wind the air seemed warmer the sky was still dull and heavy and they were afraid it might snow again at any moment where the footing was good they almost ran so eager were they to get back to birch tree inn  they had almost gained the shore of firefly lake when whopper came to a halt at the same time a distant cry reached the ears of both young hunters  what was that asked whopper  somebody calling for help whopper listen  help help came faintly to their ears  dont leave me please help  its some person calling said shep but where is he  both boys gazed around in perplexity then the cry was repeated and following the sound they made their way to some brushwood growing between several trees here they found a man crouched before a tiny fire he was dressed in a tattered suit and an even more tattered overcoat and his shoes were bound up in potato sacking a slouch hat full of holes was drawn down over his forehead and he looked to be exactly what he was a tramp  whats the matter asked shep not unkindly for the fellow was evidently suffering  dont leave me cried the man im sick and im hungry and i nearly froze to death last night please dont leave me  have you had anything to eat asked whopper  not a mouthful since yesterday noon i had some stuff wrapped in a newspaper but i lost it in the snow the man did not add that he had been intoxicated and had not known where he was going or what he was doing  well here is a piece of venison steak and some crackers said shep thats all we can give you just now  aint you got anything to drink asked the man wistfully  no we dont carry liquor  oh  we can get you some water if you want that put in whopper  what  whopper repeated his words  no i dont want any cold waterim cold enough now said the tramp     chapter xiii  in camp once more   the boys imagined the man was not well and they dropped their game and set to work to get breakfast for him they took the venison steak and warmed it up and also warmed the few crackers which still remained from the lunch the man ate greedily and then consented to drink a little water  where are you going he asked while eating the last of the venison they had found out that in spite of being a tramp he was fairly well spoken evidently drink had brought him down in the world  we are bound for our camp answered whopper  oh so youve got a camp around here  we have one on the other side of the coveover yonder where you can see the smoke drifting above the trees  i wish youd take me over to it boys i cant stay herei feel too sick  whats the matter with you  i dont knowonly i get sharp shooting pains now and then across my back  whopper and shep looked at each other they had no desire for the companionship of such a disreputable looking person yet they did not wish to see the tramp suffer  whats your name questioned whopper and where do you belong  my real name is kidlaw leech but most of my friends call me kiddy for short i came fromernew york but i have been up to fairview and other places looking for work yesterday i started to walk to the next town but i reckon i got lost on the road and i fetched up here  you must have tramped a good distance answered the doctors son he was far from being favorably impressed by the tramp  i did answered kiddy leech but say youll help me to your camp wont you  yes i have some medicines over there and one of them may do you good im a doctors son  got any liquor thats the best medicine for my back  no but i can give you some peppermint and some ginger  again the tramps face fell he got up slowly and prepared to accompany the boys there was nothing more to say and kicking out the fire the young hunters told kiddy leech to follow them he came slowly and caught hold off sheps arm to steady himself his breath still smelt of liquor something that disgusted both lads  the ice reached shep and whopper cut a long bush and on it placed the deer  whats that for asked kiddy beech in curiosity  it is easier to drag the deer than to carry it answered whopper the branch will act as a kind of sled  wish i had a sled to ride on my back is pretty lame  both boys looked at the tramp closely wondering whether or not he was speaking the truth or shamming for all they knew he might be as lazy as he was good for nothing then shep whispered to whopper  all right it wont be for far whispered whopper in return  you can sit down on the branch beside the deer said the doctors son to kiddy leech we can easily pull you along  thanks boys thats kind of you answered the tramp and dropped down with a deep sigh of satisfaction  with their double load the two young hunters did not make very rapid progress across the lake cove when they came in sight of the flag which still flew from the sapling they set up a loud and ringing shout  hullo came back from snap as he rushed from the shelter followed by giant back at last eh are you all right  yes answered whopper but weve had quite an adventure i can tell you and weve got a deer he added with pride  snap and giant came to the shore to help pull the load up to the camp and then noticed the tramp  hullo cried giant how is it you are getting a free ride  do you know him questioned shep quickly  not exactly he came to our house beggingthe day before we left home answered the smaller member of the club in a whisper  we found him half frozen in the snow said whopper he says there is something the matter with his back  the shelter gained shep and giant were glad enough to go in and rest and so was kiddy leech the tramp gazed around the cozy place with keen satisfaction  this is a bangup bunk he observed a fellow could stay here a long time and enjoy himself  while the three newcomers rested giant and snap bustled around and prepared them a substantial meal with plenty of hot coffee for the trip across the cove had been a cold one and they wanted something for thawing out purposes as shep said kiddy leech was not backward in eating a big meal washing it down with all the coffee offered him  coffee is the next thing to liquor for warming a fellow he observed  we think it is far better answered snap we carry no liquor of any kind only a little alcohol for special purposes  humph  after the meal shep got out some liniments for the tramp but he said he would try a good sleep first he sought out a comfortable corner of the shelter and in a very few minutes was snoring away lustily  he certainly takes things easy said the doctors son  i believe he is thoroughly lazy and a heavy drinker answered giant and hit the nail squarely on the head  what are we to do with him questioned snap we certainly dont want him to stay at this camp  not much cried whopper as soon as it clears off well fix him up some provisions and start him on his way and this was decided upon unanimously  during the afternoon it cleared off to such an extent that snap and giant determined to go out for a short walk  let us put on our snowshoes said giant it will give all of us a chance to get used to them  snap was willing and soon the boys had fastened on their snowshoes which were long and narrow and firstclass in every particular both had worn snowshoes before but not sufficiently to feel thoroughly at home on them  come on shouted giant who was the first ready and off he started in fine style and soon snap came after them shep and whopper watched them depart and then returned to the shelter feeling still too tired out to do more than sit around and take it easy  snap and giant walked on through the woods until they came to a place that showed quite a cleared spot  come onill race you cried the smaller lad and away he went as fast as he could on his snowshoes and snap came after him  the two boys thought they were going over a level sheet of snow but it was down grade and soon they struck a small hollow over went giant on his face into the snow below and an instant later snap followed  whow spluttered the small youth when he could make a sound his nose and mouth were filled with snow and some was also down his sleeve i say this isnt so pleasant snap  pleasant i should say not giant ugh but this snow is cold  i cant get up  well have to do the best we can  with a great effort snap managed to rise to his feet again and then he went to giants assistance after that the two boys were careful how they stepped out and so got along fairly well  i dont think id care to travel more than a mile or two on snowshoes remarked giant as they turned back towards the inn it is too tiring on the ankles  when the two lads arrived at the shelter they were tired out and glad enough to take off the snowshoes and hang them up shep and whopper wanted to know how it had felt to walk on snowshoes and they related their experience  well all have to go out tomorrow said whopper just wait till you see me walk ill wager ill walk ten miles with ease  make it a hundred while you are at it answered shep i am not saying what i shall do  if we go out what is to be done with that fellow whispered snap pointing to the sleeping form of kiddy leech  i dont know replied whopper i dont like the idea of leaving him alone in camp  when night came on they put some fresh logs on the fire and cooked another meal of venison steak then later on they sat around the blaze talking and eating nuts and apples the tramp slept on soundly and they left him where he was even when they retired     chapter xiv  in which a tramp disappears   i know what i am going to do today said giant on the following morning i am going fishing through a hole in the ice i am just hungry for a bit of fresh fish for breakfast  i want to fish myself answered whopper if you dont mind ill go with you  snap beckoned his chums to the outside of the shelter the tramp still lay on his couch but was awake  let us take turns at fishing said the leader of the gun club in a low tone two can fish and two watch the trampuntil he clears out  let us give him a hint that he is not wanted here suggested shep  will you give him the hint asked giant  certainlyi am not afraid  they prepared breakfast and when they were ready to sit down and eat the tramp arose and stretched himself lazily  that smell good he said reckon youve got some for me eh  yes you can have your share answered shep after breakfast well give you some lunch in a paper bag and then you can be on your way  what going to throw me out in such weather as this cried the man reproachfully  the weather is all right today put in snap  my back hurts a good deal  i guess you are able to walk well give you plenty of lunch so you wont starve  its hard lines on a fellow who hasnt a cent to his name whined the tramp his manhood had evidently deserted him completely  the young hunters looked at each other questioningly they did not want to be hard on anybody who was in distress snap put his hand in his pocket  ill give you a quarter he said and passed over the silver coin  so will i added shep and then giant and whopper also handed over twentyfive cents each making a dollar in all  much obliged said kiddy leech pocketing the silver with satisfaction but if you dont mind i wont start out until about noon time by then i reckon my back will i feel better  very well make it noon then said snap giant and whopper were soon down on the ice they took with them their fishing outfits and an axe  ive got an idea well find pretty good fishing around yonder bend of the shore said giant pointing with his hand  reaching a spot that looked favorable to them they threw down their fishing outfits and began to cut two holes in the ice about fifty feet apart cutting the ice was no light task and they took turns until they had each hole about a foot in diameter  now then to bait up said giant  he had prepared himself for this by cutting out certain portions of the deer meat and small patches of the skin he soon had his line in trim for use and with the aid of a light sinker allowed it to sink close to the bottom of the lake  whopper was using some bait brought from home something jed sanborn had said might be effective in luring the finny tribe the two boys stood by the holes patiently waiting for a bite  fully five minutes passed and giant felt a small nibble he pulled the bait around a bit and then felt a sudden tug up came his line with a rush and out on the ice flopped a pickerel of fair size  hurrah first haul sang out the small member of the gun club proudly who says we cant catch something  after that came another spell of silence and then whopper gave a yank on his line up came a good sized fish but as it fell on the ice it broke loose from the hook and flopped back into the water with a splash that covered whopper with the icy drops  oh hang the luck gasped whopper he got away and gave me a shower bath in the bargain  wish i could get a maskalonge said giant do you remember the big one i caught last summer  indeed i do answered whopper and i remember how the fish pulled you overboard and nearly drowned you  they continued to fish and presently whopper got another bite and brought up a goodsized pickerel of a variety that is known to many as a lake trout then both boys got a second and a third bite and inside of an hour had a fair mess of fish to their credit  in the meantime snap and shep remained near the shelter fixing up a number of things shep made a fresh batch of bread dough and also prepared a pot of beans and baked a plain cake he likewise tried his hand at an apple pie but the crust was not right and later on when the pie was tested whopper said the lid might do for a shingle but not for eating the cake however turned out well and all of the young hunters praised it  as snap and shep moved around in and out of the shelter kiddy leech watched them closely although without letting them see it the tramp had on his ragged overcoat and when he got the chance he put a number of things into the pockets on the sly  suddenly from the lake there came a loud shouting and snap and shep ran out to see what was the matter  maybe giant and whopper are in trouble said the doctors son  they ran out on the ice and then around the bend to find those who had been fishing running toward them  we just saw some big game panted giant get the rifle and the shotguns  what game queried snap  at least a dozen deer big ones answered whopper oh hurry well never get such a chance again  did you really see a dozen asked shep  i saw five or six answered giant  i saw more than thatright across the lake came from whopper hurry up  with such game so close at hand the four boy hunters were in a fever of excitement all rushed to the shelter and got their firearms whopper and giant throwing their fish and lines in a heap on the floor for the time being the tramp was practically forgotten  where are you going he shouted after them  after some deer well soon be back answered snap  at that moment shep sighted one of the deerdirectly on the opposite shore of the lake but as soon as the game was seen it disappeared from view  they are there sure enough exclaimed the doctors son  shall we go back for our skates asked snap  no there isnt time  without further words the four boy hunters started to cross firefly lake stepping as much as possible on the portions that did not look extra slippery yet more than one went down with a thump and this delayed them not a little  where are the deer queried snap when the other side of the lake was gained  all looked around and while one went up the shore another went down and then two hurried into the forest which at this point was extra thick  here are the tracks cried snap and began to run forward with the others close at his heels  but alas the tracks soon came to an end on a series of rocks which the wind had swept clear of snow beyond this point the ground was so uneven that progress was difficult  the boys gazed around in perplexity they had expected some easy shooting now the game was gone and they did not know where to look for it  may as well go back to camp said snap at last remember we left that tramp in full possession  oh let us look around a little longer pleaded giant  to please the small member of the gun club the others remained in that vicinity for quarter of an hour longer looking in every possible direction for the deer but the animals had made themselves scarce and that was the end of it  too bad sighed whopper i thought wed get a full dozen this time  they had stirred up absolutely nothing in the way of game and so retraced their steps without firing a single shot nobody felt in particularly good humor and the walk back to camp was a rather silent one  might better have kept at fishing grumbled whopper  what did you get asked shep who had not taken time to look at the catch  oh weve got enough for several meals  thats good  i hooked one big fish but he got away  the big fish always do remarked snap significantly  oh im not exaggerating growled whopper  when they came in sight of the camp it looked particularly lonely  its a wonder mr kiddy leech didnt come out to welcome us remarked giant  hes too lazy said shep more than likely youll find him snoring in front of the fire  he certainly is a lazy one said whopper we must clear him out right away  they came up to the inn and entered to find the fire smouldering dimly the tramp was nowhere to be seen  hullo called snap but there was no response  maybe he went out to find us suggested giant  not much exclaimed snap i dont like this he went on  what snap  look around you and see what is missing  missing  that is what i said  at these words all made a hasty examination of their belongings some underwear was gone also a storm coat and a number of other things the tramp had taken a game bag full of provisions and the pair of skates belonging to snap  hes a thief cried giant  i wish i had my hands on him muttered snap  so do i put in whopper to whom the storm coat belonged  we must go after him and at once came from shep he must not be allowed to get away with the things he has taken     chapter xv  something of a chase   it is easy enough to say go after the tramp but where are you going to find him said whopper we went after those deer but we didnt get any  if he put on the skates he must have taken to the lake answered snap anyway i dont think it will hurt to look around  somebody ought to stay at camp and watch things said shep whopper will you do that  yes  then you can lend your skates to me while i go after mr kiddy leech said snap  so it was arranged and a few minutes later snap shep and giant set out to look for the tramp who had so unceremoniously disappeared  if he took to skating he most likely went down to lake cameron said snap from there he could get to the river and go wherever he pleased  once on the ice the three boys skated around on the lake until they saw other skate marks these they began to follow and soon saw that they led down towards the neck that connected firefly lake with lake cameron  i believe he did not imagine wed get back so soon said giant he reckoned on getting over lake cameron to the river before we could spot him  wherever there was a ridge of snow on the ice they could see the marks left by the tramp quite plainly they skated with vigor for they felt that kiddy leech would do all in his power to escape  he may be lazy but hell hump himself now declared shep  and to think hed do such a thing as this afar what we did for him said giant he cant have any sense of gratitude  on they went until they entered the rocky passage between the two lakes here they had to walk through several ridges of snow and saw that the tramp had done the same  out on lake cameron the ice was tolerably free from snow so it was not so easy to follow the trail but they watched the ice closely and kept their eyes open for the tiny scratches made by the skate runners at one point in a snow drift they saw where the tramp had taken a tumble and rolled over  served him right grumbled snap i wish he had taken a dozen falls  they were nearing the end of the lake when they swept around a curve of the shore at once snap who was in the lead set up a shout  there he is  and skating for all he is worth added shep  hi you stop yelled giant stop you rascal  at first kiddy leech did not hear but presently as they drew closer he turned in a startled way then he tried to skate harder than ever  stop where you are or ill shoot you called out snap who had brought his shotgun along  dont shoot dont shoot yelled the tramp in wild alarm  then stop went on snap  the tramp skated a few strokes more and then halted soon the three boys swept up to him  dont shoot cried kiddy leech again itserall a mistake ieri didnt mean any harm  you didnt said snap indignantly no harm to steal our things youre a rascal if ever there was one we ought to hand you over to the authorities  no no ieri wasnt stealing anything its all a joke i was coming back i thought id scare you a little thats all  hand over that gamebag said shep  and that stormcoat said giant  and my skates put in snap and all the other things you took and be quick about it too  youll not go near our camp again answered the leader of the gun club  finding himself surrounded kiddy leech gave up the things he had taken including the skates  now hand over the money you got from us continued snap sternly  why cant i keep that  not a cent of it  kiddy leech tried to protest but the young hunters would not listen to what he had to say  we ought to give you a good thrashing said the doctors son if we were near town id have you arrested  dont you ever show your face near our camp again said giant who even though small was bound to have his say  if you do well make it redhot for you added snap  stripped of all he had taken the tramp stood glaring at the boys in a sullen manner  ill fix you for this he began when snap cut him short  say another word and well thrash you good he said now getjust as fast as you can walk and he pointed toward the river  muttering under his breath kiddy leech moved on and the three young hunters watched him until a distant bend hid him from view  doesnt walk as if his back was lame was giants comment  oh i guess that was all put onjust to arouse our sympathy answered snap  the boys turned back in the direction of their camp talking about the affair and glad that they had had no worse trouble in getting back their things in the meantime kiddy leech walked on fast at first and then more slowly until rocky river was reached here he came to a dilapidated building once used as an icehouse and sat down on a bench in the sun to rest  im having bad luck right along lately he muttered to himself thought sure id get away today with those things gee but im glad they didnt shoot me that fellow they call snap looked mad enough to do it and to think they took that money back tooafter giving it to me say id like to fix em for that and he shook his head savagely  kiddy leech had been sitting on the bench less than quarter of an hour when he saw several boys coming along the frozen river on their skates he looked at them indifferently at first but soon became interested in two of the number these boys were ham spink and carl dudder the third youth was barney hedge one of spinks cronies  the same boys muttered the tramp to himself  hullo look at the scarecrow called out ham spink as he swept up on an elegant pair of silverplated hockey skates  wonder what cornfield he came from put in carl dudder  got any old clos to sell cried barney hedge imitating a street merchant  kiddy leech scowled at the trio and said nothing at first then as ham spink threw a snowball at him he arose and beckoned the boys nearer  i want to talk to you two he said motioning to carl and ham  we havent any money for you answered ham  you cant get a drink out of me added carl dudder and by the way he added suddenly youre the tramp my father fired out of our barn one night last week  thats true answered kiddy leech calmly but he wont do it again  i know he wontyou wont dare to come around jeered carl  humph i well see about that sonny maybe ill call on your father tomorrow  the scarecrow is crazy said barney hedge  no i aint crazy but i know a thing or so and i want to talk to you two in private went on the tramp and motioned again to ham and carl  what do you want asked ham curiously he could see that the tramp was not crazy  come hereor send that other boy away  gosh got a state secret eh said barney hedge all rightill keep out of it if you want help call he added as he circled away to a distance  what do you want anyway questioned carl half angrily we are not in the habit of associating with tramps  we are gentlemens sons added ham drawing himself up proudly  say do gentlemens sons blow up boathouses asked kiddy leech in a low but distinct tone  at this question consternation seemed to seize both ham spink and carl dudder and their faces grew pale as they stared at the tramp  whawhats that stammered ham faintly  i asked you if gentlemens sons blew up boathouses  what do you know about blowing up a boathouse asked carl  i dont know much about doing the job but i saw one blown up not long ago and  and what came eagerly from ham and carl  and i know you two boys did the job finished kiddy leech significantly     chapter xvi  an evil compact   for the next moment ham spink and carl dudder stared at the tramp in amazement not unmixed with terror  youeryou saw us faltered ham at length  i did  you were mistaken put in carl you  no i wasnt mistaken for i saw you with the dynamite and i saw you go into the boathouse and then come out and then  hush not so loud interrupted ham looking over to where barney hedge was skating up  then dont say i dont know anything about it insisted kiddy leech i know all about it you two boys did the job and nobody else  where were you asked ham  oh i was just knocking around  you cant prove we did it said carl a little of his courage returning  cant i though just you try me and see i dont know your names but i can soon find them out i know you belong in fairview  oh  hams face grew pale again and if the truth were known he was trembling in his shoes  say ieri dont want you to say anything about this to anybody he added hastily  oh i am not the kind to tell all i know answered the tramp  thank you  but it will cost you a trifle  eh  how much money have you got with you went on kiddy leech calmly  only some changeless than a dollar  how much have you got  what is that to you demanded carl  i want what youve got thats all  ill not give it to you  all right then ill walk to fairview and tell what i know about that explosion  well say you did it cried carl struck by a sudden inspiration  wont do no goodi can prove youre guilty answered kiddy leech  he spoke with such positiveness that both boys believed him and after a few words more both agreed to give him all the money they carried if he would keep silent about the matter  the boathouse wasnt worth anything explained ham we only knocked it down to play a trick on some other boys we dont like  some other boys  yes some fellows who came up this way to go camping they had their traps stored in that boathouse  did those boys come to a camp up here asked the tramp with interest  yes  what were their names  snap dodge shep reed a fellow called whopper dawson and a little chap named caslette  humph the very same crowd muttered kiddy leech so you played the trick on them eh i am glad of it  say what are you chaps gassing about anyway demanded barney hedge who was growing tired of waiting for his cronies  say barney excuse us for awhile will you called out ham skating towards his friend we want to find out something from this tramp he knows something about the dodge crowd i am sure  oh well i want to find out about them too said hedge and came closer  dont say anything about the boathouse whispered ham spink to kiddy leech to which the tramp replied with a knowing wink of his bleery eye  have you been up to the dodge camp questioned carl dudder  yes and those chaps treated me shamefully answered kiddy leech i never touched a thing they had yet they accused me of trying to steal some of their traps  just like em said ham they are a mean set every one of em what kind of a camp did they have a regular log cabin  no a sort of shelter patched up among some trees and at this information ham and carl winked at each other  thought we were to go up there some day and play a trick on them came from barney hedge who during the summer had done his full share of troublemaking for all of our friends  how would you like to go to that camp and make trouble for that crowd said ham to the tramp  me  yes wed like to have their outing spoilt wed pay you for your trouble  say ham can you trust this fellow whispered barney half in alarm  i think so hes only a tramp and he will do anything for a little money if he does the job we wont have to dirty our hands and if he gets into trouble we can deny that we had anything to do with it  this view of the matter suited barney hedge and also carl dudder and all joined in getting kiddy leech to tell them what our friends were doing and how they were situated then it was suggested again to the tramp that he go back to the vicinity of the camp on firefly lake and make matters uncomfortable for the campers  ill do it if youll pay me what it is worth said kiddy leech but i cant go back today its too cold and i aint dressed warm enough and ill want some provisions  i can get you some better clothing said carl dudder i think one of my fathers old suits will fit you maybe i can get you an overcoat too  i can get you some shoes and a hat said barney hedge  ill furnish the provisions and well pay you some money put in ham spink come along to fairview if you want to  so it was agreed and kiddy leech accompanied the young conspirators back to the town here the tramp was given some more money and he put up at bamlings tavern a low resort near the river the boys brought him the clothing and other things promised and he had several talks with them on what was to be done when he went back to the vicinity of the camp on firefly lake he promised to do all they wished but on the following day he was missing  what do you suppose had become of him said ham to carl in considerable alarm  i am sure i dont know and bamling says he doesnt know either was the answer  ham spink made numerous inquiries and soon learned from some rivermen that kiddy leech had yielded to his weakness for strong liquor and gone off on a spree  we are out our money he said to carl rudder in disgust hell never do a thing for us i am certain and we dare not prosecute him  maybe hell do what we want when he gets sober answered carl he will want more money and then we can tell him that he cant have a cent until he goes up to the camp and does what we want him to  when at last they saw the tramp again he looked more battered and disreputable than everso much so in fact that the rather fastidious youths were afraid of him but he would not let them get away from him and insisted on keeping to the bargain that had been made  i am sorry i took to the liquorbut its a weakness i get once a year or so he said blandly but ill keep as sober as a judge now you see if i dontno more drink for kiddy leech until this job is done all i want is what you promised to me and you can rely on me doing the rest  we are not going to trust you said ham putting on as bold a front as he could although he was trembling you go and do the work as promised and well pay you afterwards  this did not suit kiddy leech and a lively discussion followed and the matter was compromised the tramp was given something of another outfit and a third of the money promised to him and he agreed to accept the rest of the money when he had done the job at firefly lake  mind you now said ham i want you to make it just as disagreeable for that crowd as you possibly can you can soak their firewood with water hide their guns and provisions and fix it so the snow will break in their roofand things like that  oh dont you worry declared kiddy leech ill make it so uncomfortable for them that youll see them back home in no time mark my words  and see that they dont bring any game with them either said carl dudder  ill fix that too answered the tramp     chapter xvii  fun in the camp   boys wake up are you going to sleep all day  it was snap who called out he had just crawled out of his cozy sleeping place near the fire and looked at his watch it was eight oclock  it was the morning after the day when they had had their trouble with kiddy leech and as they brought in some wood stirred up the smouldering campfire they talked over what had occurred  i dont think hell bother us any more said shep hes too much of a coward at heart  the boys had planned for a day at home as snap put it they were going to try their hands at cake and candy making and for dinner were going to have baked turkey beans and apple sauce for breakfast giant and whopper had prepared some of the fish caught through the ice and the repast proved a delicious onequite a relief from the monotony of game  all of the boys were in exceptionally good humor that day whistling and singing and cutting up generally right after breakfast they opened up the inn to let in some fresh air and during that period of time had a snowball match using as a target a saucepan lid set up on a tree stump at a distance of a hundred feet each took ten trials and snap knocked the lid down seven times shep six times and giant and whopper each five times then the boys got to snowballing each other running round the shelter for protection and at last giant followed shep inside each carrying a chunk of snow  hi that wont do sang out the leader of the club no snow allowed inside come out or ill fine you each five sticks of wood which meant that each culprit would have to go out into the woods and chop down five fair sized sticks for firewood this was a system of fines snap had instituted and it seemed to work very well  no wood chopping in mine called out giant and threw his snow outside whopper attempted to do the same but the chunk fell and spread all over one of the couches  whopper you are fined five sticks and you must at once clean the couch before the snow melts said snap  just my luck grumbled whopper every time i start out for fun i end up with a funeral yet he set to work willingly whistling as merrily as ever  the sport at an end all of the boys set to work cake and candy making they cracked some of the nuts taken from the squirrels hiding places and then while snap and giant made a big nut cake shep and whopper made nut candy the boys had learned the work at home for camp purposes and the results were decidedly appetizing in the meantime the turkey was roasting and then snap and shep peeled some apples for apple sauce  listen cried whopper am i mistaken or did i hear a whistle  all listened and from a distance heard a clear sharp whistle thrice repeated they knew that signal well and all rushed to the doorway of the shelter getting in a jam in consequence  im the one to get out ahead cried the giant and the small form slipped deftly between the others hullo jed sanborn how are you  hullo yourself came from off the ice of the lake as the wellknown old hunter strode forward thought id find you to humby the look of the smoke from your chimbley  where did you come from fairview  yesgot letters fer all of you  oh letters was the cry and then all the young hunters rushed forward to shake hands and escort the old hunter into the shelter jed sanborn looked around in perplexity  why say this aint the camp i expected he stammered  the other was burnt down when we got here answered snap  burnt down t wasnt burnt down when i was here last lad  so you told us it must have been burnt down after that the work of some enemy put in shep  you dont suspect felps do you  either he or the ham spink crowd answered whopper  humph dog mean wasnt it some fellers is too mean to live say that turkey smells good aint starvin none eh  not a bit of it declared giant weve got more than enough  then kin i get dinner  a dozen of them cried snap  they made jed sanborn make himself at home and then read with pleasure the letters all was going along well at fairview and the boys were cautioned to take good care of themselves  we must send letters in return said shep and this was agreed to instantly and the communications were pencilled that afternoon  jed sanborn had quite some news to tell and he listened with interest to the tale the young hunters had to relate about their various quests of game his brow darkened when they related their experience with kiddy leech  sech rascals ought to be run out o the deestrict he observed an id like the job of runnin em out i hope he doesnt bother you again  it was one oclock when the gun club and their guest sat down to their turkey dinner all took their time over the repast and as a consequence the meal was not finished until some time after two then they took it easy while jed sanborn told them a story about a bear hunt and how he had once gone fishing on the st lawrence and got caught in the rapids  its snowing again called out shep who chanced to go out to bring in some more firewood coming down pretty thick too i can tell you  i allowed it was going to snow before nightfall answered jed sanborn ill take a look at the sky myself  as a man who spent nearly all of his life out of doors he was keenly interested in the weather at all times he studied the sky carefully for several minutes and then shook his head  what do you think was whoppers query going to snow all night i reckonan putty good too  on account of the snow it grew dark rapidly and they had to stir up the fire for light as well as for warmth jed had brought with him a small bag of corn for popping and also a popper something shep had meant to bring but had forgotten while some of the boys cleared away what was left of the meal giant and the old hunter popped a pan full of corn and of this and the cake candy and apples they made later on what they termed supper  my but it is snowing to beat the cars exclaimed whopper as he looked out of the shelter before retiring cant see the end of your nose ill bet the snow will be eight or ten feet high by morning  the evening was spent in playing various games and in singing some of the home songs the boys could sing fairly well and jed sanborn listened with pleasure  wish i could sing myself he said but i aint got no more voice nor a black crow  at last it came time to turn in and they provided the old hunter with a comfortable corner the fire was fixed for the night and presently all went to sleep little thinking of the excitement so close at hand     chapter xviii  an unexpected peril   the snow continued to come down thickly the weather had moderated to a great extent and this made the snow heavy and clinging it came down on the shelter steadily until the top of birch tree inn resembled the top of some large sugarcoated cake  the roof of the shelter was not as strong as it should have been for the young hunters were amateurs in the construction of such an affair it held up bravely until the weight of snow became too heavy and then it began to bend lower and lower and commenced to snap and crack as one tree after another gave way  the boys and the old hunter slept on unconscious of their danger until an extra loud crack awoke whopper the lad sat up looked around him and listened then came another snap  must be a log on the fire said whopper to himself but it didnt seem to come from there perhapsoh  whopper heard a crack directly over his head then down came a heap of snow that all but buried him  hi wake up everybody he yelled in alarm the roof is coming down  whats that called jed sanborn rolling out of his blanket and struggling to his feet only to be hurled flat by the snow that came down on his head  by this time the boys were all awake and trying to get up they heard several cracks and then more snow came down and with it several sticks of good size  we must get out if we dont well be hurt cried whopper come on and he leaped for the doorway which had been well closed to keep out the cold  before whopper could gain the outer air the entire roof of the shelter seemed to come down and snap and shep were buried beneath the ruins giant was caught against the wall not far from the rude chimney jed sanborn reached the doorway and he and whopper managed to push down the barrier and leap outside  some of the snow tumbled into the fire and this created a smoke which all but stifled poor giant who for several minutes could hardly move in the meantime snap and shep were flat on their breasts trying to squirm from under the mass that was pressing them to the earth  the others have been caught exclaimed whopper in horror as he gazed behind him oh what shall we do  tear the stuff apart as fast as we can answered the old hunter and set the example by springing back and pulling on branches poles and chunks of snow whopper set in to do likewise and the pair labored like trojans for several minutes then they caught sight of snap and actually hauled him from the wreckage feet first  whos out and whos caught demanded snap as soon as he could speak and having learned he went on we must get shep and giant out before the fire reaches them  help help came faintly from giant  where are you asked snap  herenext to the chimney i am wedged fast the smoke is choking me  well git him out spoke jed sanborn who had not stopped in his labors and he pitched in harder than ever with whopper and snap doing all they could to aid him snap had his face and one hand badly scratched but paid no attention just then to the blood which was flowing from the wounds  it was not long before the three outside were able to aid shep using all his strength which was considerable jed sanborn held up a portion of the fallen roof and shep crawled forth until whopper and snap could get hold of him and raise him up he had suffered but little although the breath had been forced out of him  get poor giant were the first words dontdont mind me ill be all riright when ii get mmy wind  the others were already laboring to release giant through the tangle of branches the smoke was pouring for more snow had fallen on the fire  giant cant you turn and get some air through the cracks of the side called out whopper  thats what i am trying to do but i am caught fast was the gaspedout answer  ill try to do something around near the chimney said jed sanborn wheres the axe  it was given to him and soon he was at work close to where giant was held a prisoner fortunately a slender tree of the shelter frame was located at this point and a few welldirected blows cut it off then jed shoved the tree upward thus making a hole through which giant fell rather than crawled  are you burnt asked whopper and shep in a breath  no but i am about hahalf smoked declared the smaller member of the gun club and coughed  boys we must put the fire out or all of your things will be ruined said jed sanborn i reckon i know how to do the trick now giant and the rest are out  how asked several  fill up the chimney with snow  this was a good idea and soon by forcing the snow down the chimney they had the fire all but out of course it smoked a great deal but this did little damage  it was three oclock in the morning and the snow was coming down as thickly as ever they scarcely knew what to do until jed sanborn suggested they build a campfire outside  so long as youve got plenty of firewood why not use it said he we want a light too  here is the acetylene gas lamp said snap picking it up from where it had fallen near the doorway  and the can of carbide added shep this will help us to start a fresh fire even if the wood is wet he continued  how questioned jed sanborn who had never used such a newfangled consarn as he called the bicycle lamp  ill show you answered shep just heap up some of the wood with the little sticks on the bottom  the wood was heaped up and then in a hollow in the snow underneath shep dumped out some of the carbide from the can then he lit a match held it to the snow to melt the latter a little and up blazed the gas at first slowly and then more furiously until the fire was roaring  why how is that cried the old hunter never knew snow to set fire to anything in my life  it is very simple jed explained shep as soon as the snow melts it turns to water and the water soaking the carbide generates acetylene gas which burns about the same as gas in a city  well its an easy way to start a campfire was the old hunters comment ive had lots o trouble sometimes when the wood was wet as it is now  the roaring fire made matters a little more cheerful yet the boys felt discouraged with the roof of the shelter broken down jed sanborn did all in his power to cheer them up  when you go camping like this you cant expect everything to go jest right he said you have to take the lean with the fat an the bitter with the sweet now i knowed a crowd o men went camping out in the north woods a few years ago first one of the men took sick an had to go home then the boat they had got to leakin so they couldnt use it then came a forest fire and in running away one of em up an broke his leg thet was an outin fer you  thanks but id rather stay home said snap but i believe youthere is no use of crying over spilt milk as the saying goes what do you advise  cleaning out the place and puttin up a good strong roof we can do it by night  night cried whopper what is it now but night  no its morning lad but rather early i admit  under the old hunters directions they went to work and by seven oclock had the shelter cleaned out this gave them a chance to get at their stores and also use the fireplace once more and they cooked a fish breakfast and made a generous pot of coffee and another of chocolate  well cut all these branches away and then build a regular pole roof said jed sanborn build it right and it will withstand any pile o snow you kin git on it  he told them just what poles to cut and how to place them and showed them the best way to put in strips of bark and bind the whole together by nightfall they had the new roof finished and all of the boys admitted it was much better than the other roof had been     chapter xix  the fight with the buck   jed sanborn had promised to remain long enough in the camp to go out on at least one deer hunt with them and on the following day the whole party started out shutting up the shelter as best they could so that no wild animals might get inside during their absence  the snow had ceased to come down it covered the ground to the depth of a foot and a half on the level and jed said it was just the right kind of weather for deer  if we spot em they wont have much chance to git away he told them they cant run in sech deep snow nohow  of course they went on their snowshoes jed had brought his own alonga pair rather the worse for wear but on which he covered the snow as rapidly as any of them he said he had frequently been out on snowshoes for days at a time and they did not bother him in the least he grinned when shep took a tumble but aided the lad to arise without any comment  the old hunter had seen some deer at a place called doorknob valley a hollow to the southwest of firefly lake and led them in that direction the trail was by no means an even one and often they had to force their way through bushes half buried in the snow  it was noon before they came in sight of doorknob valley with some hills running around one side and a series of cliffs and rough rocks and scrub pines on the other to the boys dismay not a deer was in sight snap looked questioningly at the old hunter  i think well find em somewhere around here said jed come follow me and dont make any noise i havent seen a winter yet when there werent deer in doorknob valley  they pressed on over one of the hills and then towards the cliffs and rough rocks soon jed held up his hand  have you spotted any whispered shep eagerly  the old hunter nodded and then pointed to the edge of one of the cliffs under in something of a shelter they could see several deer and not far away a big sturdy buck all feeding on some tender saplings which they were stripping of bark  oh what a shot whispered giant excitedly  well try to git a bit closer said jed sanborn but dont make any noise or well have to follow em until they get winded  hardly daring to breathe after that the boys followed the old hunter in and out among the cliffs and rough rocks this was the hardest part of the journey and both snap and whopper went down the latter twice much to his disgust  now dont make a sound cautioned jed sanborn and dont show yourselves till i tell you to  they were passing down between the rough rocks and soon came to a spot where there were several thick clumps of bushes here the old hunter went ahead again then he motioned for the boys to drop down low and they did so peering forth through the bushes they could now see the deer close at hand the big buck however was not visible  where is the buck whispered snap in jeds ear the young leader of the gun club wished very much to lay that magnificent beast low  the old hunter pointed to a nearby cliff  there was the buck standing between two saplings eating the bark of one and rubbing himself against the other  can i hit him do you think went on snap  you can try but wait  in a low tone jed sanborn instructed the lads to aim and fire to the best advantage each was to shoot at his own game and sanborn said he would take a shot or two afterwards  ill give the word said the old hunter are you all ready  they were and he ordered them to fire bang bang bang went the three shotguns and crack went the rifle the deer shep had aimed at was killed outright and the two aimed at by giant and whopper were badly wounded the buck upon which snap had tried his skill was hit in the flank and he gave a snort of rage as he swung around breaking one of the saplings as he did so  hurrah ive got one cried shep in exultation  mine is down but it isnt dead said giant  neither is mine but i guess we can get em both answered whopper and then the lads ran forward to secure the two struggling deer that were floundering furiously in the snow  snap had turned toward the buck but now he got a sudden attack of buck fever as it is called and stood stock still with eyes staring from his head  look out there hell horn you yelled jed sanborn and raised his gun to fire but as he did so shep bumped against him and the buckshot intended for the buck only rent the empty air  by this time the buck was less than a hundred feet from where snap was standing that he was wild with rage could be seen from the look out of his wideopen and bloodshot eyes he lowered his antlers as if to pierce poor snap through and through  run run yelled shep run snap  it was then that snap awoke to the peril which confronted him and turning he made a leap to one side and around a clump of the bushes the buck turned too and at that moment jed sanborn discharged the second barrel of his shotgun this time taking the game in one of the rear legs  for the moment the buck was halted and he raised the wounded leg and let out a moan of pain then his fury increased and with a mighty effort he arose in the air intending to leap directly over the clump of bushes and on top of snap  but now shep was ready for another shot and he let drive at the buck hitting him along the left side this served to bring the leap to a halt in midair and doubling up the buck sank down directly in the midst of the bushes  good for you shouted snap and rushing forward he too took a second shot this was too much for the buck and crashing out of the bushes he rolled over and over and then stretched out dead  it was fully five minutes before the excitement was at an end snap was a trifle pale  what a narrow escape he murmured i thought sure he was going to horn me  a buck will fight sometimes and when he does hes as ugly as any critter on four legs said jed sanborn i might have fixed him with my first shot only shep bumped into me but i know he didnt mean to do it added the old hunter hastily  i didnt see youi was looking at the other deer explained the doctors son  can we get any more of em demanded whopper  whopper always wants a dozen or two laughed giant  no more deer today lad said jed sanborn i think we have had remarkable luck why sometimes a crowd like this can tramp all day and not get a sight of a deer as it is were going to have some fun getting our game home  oh we cant carry such a load cried giant  well cut some drags and get em to camp that way said the old hunter  he pointed out two saplings which might do for drags and they cut them down with the axe the old hunter had brought along then they placed the two largest of the deer on one and the buck and the smallest deer on the other thus making the loads about even some of the branches of the saplings had been cut off so that they trailed over the snow rather flatly which was what was desired  they had brought lunch with them and before they started on the return they built a small campfire and made themselves a pot of chocolate something of which jed was exceedingly fond  i dont go much on candy said he but chocolate seemed to hit the spot bettern coffee or tea  i like them all answered snap  the repast over they started on the return jed helping with first one drag and then the other he also pointed out what be thought would be the easiest route to follow this was over two hills  well have to climb but we wont fall down between any o the rocks he said its dangerous walking over rocks with snow on em for if you go down in a hollow youre liable to twist an ankle or break a leg  we certainly dont want any accidents said shep  how the eyes of ham spink and his crowd would stick out if they knew we had bagged so much game exclaimed whopper if they had such luck theyd never get done talking about it  do you think theyll come out this winter questioned giant  i dont know answered snap if they do come out i hope they keep away from us  so do i put in the doctors son     chapter xx  shooting wild ducks   when the boys and jed sanborn reached camp a surprise awaited them seated at a small fire in front of birch tree inn was an elderly man dressed in the outfit of a mountain guide  why its jack dalton cried shep  hullo boys called the man at the fire rising thought as how youd be back some time today how are ye jed he added to the old hunter  jack dalton as my old readers know was a guide of that vicinity well known to all the inhabitants for miles around he had visited the boys camp during the summer and had been friendly in more ways than one  thought i might get a shakedown here for the night said jack dalton been hoofing it sence five oclock this morningover from philbrooks preserveand im too tuckered out to make fairview  certainly you can stay with us answered snap had any luck  a few rabbits and some ducks thats all gee shoo do you mean to say you got them deer an that buck today  we did  gosh all hemlock no wonder a feller like me cant get nuthin thats rare luck eh jed  it was answered the old hunter they dont expect to do it again in a hurry  the shelter was opened up and all went inside and prepared a generous supper jack dalton insisted upon giving the boys one of the ducks he had brought down in return for the accommodations received on their part they gave the guide a generous chunk of venison for which he was exceedingly thankful  id like to go out duck shooting said whopper it would be something different  no ducks around firefly lake answered giant i asked jed  jack dalton was questioned and said that there were plenty of wild ducks below the philbrook preserveat a locality known as the marshesand he told them how to get there  but you want to be careful about walking over the marshes he said in the summer time there are lots of bog holes an it aint none too safe in the winter time  as jack dalton was going on to fairview with jed sanborn it was decided by the boys to send the buck and one of the other deer home which would be easy with two men to draw the load all spent a comfortable night in camp nothing coming to disturb them breakfast was a substantial one and by nine oclock jed and dalton set off with their load the old hunter also carrying various letters for the folks at home the boys went out on the lake to see them off and gave them a rousing cheer on parting  tell everybody we are having the time of our lives shouted snap after the pair  there was more snow in the air and the young hunters spent the remainder of that day in camp cleaning the game they had brought in and also their firearms and mending a couple of snowshoes that had become a little broken a portion of the chimney also needed attention and before they knew it night was once more upon them  ill tell you what said snap out here the time seems to fairly fly  boys do you realize that day after tomorrow is christmas came from whopper  so it is was the cry  gracious i almost forgot about it  we must celebrate  sure thing oh well have a dandy time we can have fish fowl and venison and pudding and cake and nuts and apples and lots of good things finished giant  let us go duck hunting tomorrow and spend christmas here said the doctors son and so it was agreed  everything was prepared for an early start and the four boy hunters were up and doing by seven oclock in the morning  phew but aint it cold ejaculated snap as he slapped his hands together i didnt calculate on such a drop in the thermometer  it certainly was freezing weather and they bundled up well before leaving the shelter as before they shut up tightly to keep out all wild animals the deer and other game had been hung high by ropes from several tree limbs  of course all were on snowshoes and they carried in their gamebags provisions enough for two good meals every day they found walking on snowshoes easier and all got over the ground or rather snow very well  once over the hills back of firefly lake they took to a route that was new to them leading through a heavy belt of spruce timber and then over a sloping stretch running down to the lowlands on the way they stirred up some rabbits and whopper could not resist the temptation to bring one of them low  now i wont have to go back emptyhanded even if i dont see another thing he declared  it was fully noon by the time they reached the edge of the marshes wide stretches of lowlands dotted here and there with clumps of bushes at a great distance they heard gunshots but failed to discover the gunners  they tramped on to a point where jack dalton had said the wild ducks were apt to be found the wind was coming up and out in this wide open plain it cut like a knife  we wont want to stay out here more than an hour or two said shep my backbone feels like an icicle  do you know what i think said giant i think it is going to snow  so do i came from whopper  a few minutes later the first flakes fell and fearful that the snow would interfere with their sight of any wild ducks they hurried forward until they reached a circle of bushes jack dalton had mentioned  wait i see some ducks cried giant see they are rising and coming this way  be quick cried snap and brought around his shotgun the others also aimed their weapons and as the wild ducks sailed almost over them they let drive in a scattering volley two of the ducks were killed outright and came straight down while a third circled around badly wounded the others swept out of range before any harm could be done to them  weve got two anyway said shep  im going after that wounded one cried whopper and went off on his snowshoes behind the fluttering game the duck touched the snow and then arose again and did this several times giant followed whopper bound to get the third duck if it was possible to do so  beware of holes yelled snap after the pair remember what jack dalton said  the others were too interested in pursuing the wounded duck to pay attention to his words thinking he saw a chance whopper discharged his weapon but it did no damage then giant took a shot and this was likewise of no avail  gracious ducks seem to be harder to hit than deer cried the smaller member of the gun club it will get away after all whopper  not if i know it was the reply come on  the pair continued to run until fully a hundred yards more had been covered the wounded duck had now fluttered down into some bushes and both felt sure they would be able to bag it so eager were they that they did not notice the softness of the snow before them until without warning they sank up to their knees  hi whats this sputtered whopper as he floundered around  were in a hole gasped giant say we had better get back  they tried to turn back but it was impossible and soon both young hunters were up to their waists and then to their breasts they forgot all about the wounded duck and began to call lustily for help     chapter xxi  a touch of a blizzard   those boys ought to be more careful said snap as he watched giant and whopper plunge along after the wounded duck  well you told them to beware of holes answered shep  the two ducks that had been killed were picked up and put in the gamebags and then snap and shep started to follow their comrades but at a more moderate rate of speed  hark they are calling for help exclaimed the leader of the gun club a moment later  they are in a hole said the doctors son look i can just see their heads  we must help them out my how the wind is blowing  the increase in wind was rapid and by the time snap and shep drew close to where whopper and giant were still floundering it carried the loose snow around in a perfect whirlwind  cant you crawl out asked snap coming as close as he dared  every time we try we seem to sink deeper gasped giant  then keep still and ill aid you answered the leader of the gun club come shep  what we you going to do  ill show you be quick  walking to the nearest bushes snap cut them down with the hatchet he had insisted upon carrying shep now understood and both lugged the bushes to the edge of the fast sinking snow then more bushes were brought and at last almost exhausted giant and whopper crawled forth on their hands and knees their snowshoes held in the air then they got up on their feet and lost no time in gaining a point of safety  i told you to be careful said snap rather severely and jack dalton warned you too it is a lucky thing you didnt sink into the marsh up to your head  we were after the duck and didnt think answered whopper but you can bet ill be careful next time  so will i be careful came from giant wheres the duck  flew awayi saw it answered shep gracious how the wind is rising he added pulling his coat collar closer to his neck its going to be a hammer of a snowstorm  i think we had better get off the marshes said snap after a look at the sky and the whirling snow this looks to me as if it was going to turn into blizzard  going to leave with only two ducks asked the doctors son it seems a pityafter tramping such a distance too  maybe well strike some more going back said snap cheerfully  all of the young hunters were willing to leave the marshes for the increasing wind made the situation decidedly unpleasant when they turned back they had both the wind and the pelting snow in their faces and could scarcely see where they were going  isnt this fierce gasped shep after they had walked less than fifty yards i never felt the wind blow so strongly  we get the full sweep of it out here answered shep it wont be so bad when we reach the timber again  the mind was fairly whistling around them now they could not tell how much snow was falling for much of it was caught up from where it lay and sent hurtling along now in straight dashes and then in mad circles that blinded and bewildered them more than once they had to turn around to catch their breath and clear their eyes  i wish we wewere to ththe timber gasped giant i feel as if the wind was going to pick me up and carry me away  let us keep close together said whopper there is no telling what will happen with such a wind tearing down upon us  they were all scared and with good reason for to be caught in a blizzard on that wide stretch of marshland was a serious matter sticking as closely together as possible they hurried on as fast as the gale and the flying snow would permit the air was growing darker and heavier every moment  are you sure you are heading for the timber questioned whopper presently i must confess i am completely turned around  so am i added shep  ii think the timber is in that direction but i am not certain answered the leader of the club pointing with his hand  all stared around them in bewilderment they scarcely knew how to turn  well one thing is sure we cant stay here said shep come on and he started off in the direction his chum had pointed out  mind you i dont say i am right called out snap  well go that way anyhowif we can make it said whopper  it was slow traveling and they had to rest frequently for the wind seemed to fairly take the breath out of their bodies once they came up to a clump of bushes and were half tempted to make a prolonged stop there but snap demurred very strongly  it wont do fellows he said the snow is piling up fast and the bushes will be snowed under in another hour or two we have got to reach the timber somehow its our only chance of safety  again they struggled on so out of breath and weak they could scarcely draw one snowshoe after the other giant fell down and had to be raised up  ii am afraid i cacant go another step he blurted out i am as weweak as aa cat  well help you said snap kindly come shep you take one arm and ill take the other whopper can go in front to break the force of the wind for us  at the end of ten minutes more all were ready to drop they were numbed with the cold and their breath came in quick short gasps it looked as if they must give up and perish  oh if only we were back at camp sighed whopper  dont give up urged snap he stopped and gazed over his left shoulder am i mistaken or is that a tree yonder  ill soon see answered shep and turned in that direction yes its a tree and the timber is back of it he cried in delight  this announcement put renewed courage in the young hunters and once again they struggled on against the fierce wind which was now blowing little short of a hurricane the trees came into sight dimly through the swirling whiteness and a minute later they sank down under the overhanging boughs of a big spruce  safe at last murmured shep  oh how glad i am of it added giant ii thought wed be lolost sure  we must have a fire first of all said snap my feet are half frozen already  i brought some carbide along so we can easily start a blaze added whopper but weve got to be careful in such a wind as this just listen  they listened and it made them shiver to hear the shrieking of the wind as it went ploughing through the forest often snapping off a bough here or a tree top there the spruce they were under bent and swayed but it was strong and healthy and it did not give way  leaving his companions for a few minutes snap did his best to look around the vicinity he could see but little but made out three big trees growing somewhat close together on the edge of the marshland at one side of the trees was an irregular rock five or six feet in height  that will have to do he told himself and called for his companions to join him but they did not hear owing to the raging of the storm and he had to go after them  well fix up some sort of shelter among the trees he said and we can build a fire against that rock let us get to work at once before it grows colder and the snow gets worse  the brief respite had rested them and while whopper and giant cut some wood and built a fire snap and shep broke down some spruce branches and piled them up around the clump of trees then they kicked up the snow into something of a wall leading from the side of the rock to the nearest tree  there now we can keep fairly warm if nothing else said the leader of the gun club  it was still very dark and the fire did little to dispel the gloom the wind having a tendency to blow the smoke in several directions at once but the fire kept them fairly warm and for that they were thankful  if this isnt a blizzard it is next door to it remarked the doctors son as he gazed at the display of the elements and the worst of it is there is no telling how long it is going to last  will we be snowed in asked whopper  it looks like it  and with nothing but a rabbit and two ducks cried giant boys it doesnt look as if christmas was going to be such a cheerful day after all  never mind christmas put in snap let us be thankful if we are not snowbound so completely that we starve to death     chapter xxii  a remarkable christmas night   night came on rapidly after that and with the coming of utter darkness the fury of the elements appeared to increase the wind shrieked and whistled through the timber and hummed in the tops of the spruces overhead occasionally they would hear a crash as some mighty tree would be laid low and they trembled for fear the storm would damage their shelter  they were tremendously hungry and ate rather more of the lunch brought along than snap thought right one of the ducks was cleaned and broiled with care and half of the meat divided into four equal shares for drinking water they melted some snow a little at a time in a drinking cup  after the meal there remained nothing to do but to mind the fire and go to sleep they took turns at watching the blaze each boy remaining on guard two hours  all night long the storm raged and the snow came down as thickly as ever as a consequence when it began to grow a little brighter they found that they were completely snowed in on all sides the spruces were nearly broken down with their weights of whiteness and on the opposite side of the rock where the fire was built was a drift of snow eight to ten feet high this gave them a little more shelter but cut off a good share of the outlook  merry christmas cried snap as he got up and stretched himself as well as he could under the low boughs  merry christmas cried all of the others and then whopper added but it isnt very merry is it  i dont see that broiled fish and stuffed turkey and cake and pudding and candy and began giant  hold on giant dont make us any more hungry than we are interrupted the doctors son were here and weve got to make the best of it so dont croak  oh im not croaking answered the smaller member of the gun club i shall be satisfied if we get back to camp alive with such a snow all around us  giant why didnt you hang up your stocking last night asked whopper jokingly and this brought forth a general snicker and then all the lads felt a trifle less blue  breakfast was certainly a slim affair each person getting a small bite of duck two crackers a spoonful of cold beans shep had brought along and a drink of melted snow several gazed wistfully at the rabbit but snap shook his head at them  weve got to save that he said you know that as well as i do  dont you suppose there are some birds or squirrels or rabbits around here asked shep  we can lookif the storm will let us  breakfast over one after another of the young hunters went beyond the clump of spruces to look around but the weather was so wild and the snow so deep all were glad to come back  there was little of the holiday air in the gathering all of the boys were sober for they fully realized the peril of their situation their food would not last long and where were they to get more  at noon they had little more than a rabbit lunchsomething that made whopper sigh as he thought of the big christmas dinner he had thought to feast upon  i think it is clearing a bit said shep about three oclock if we want to move now is our chance to do so  it was voted by all hands to move and they started without delay they could not locate the exact route toward their camp but made it as nearly as possible the snowdrifts were truly terrific and even on snowshoes they made slow progress  wait i see a rabbit cried shep presently and he pointed to a clump of bushes then he unslung his shotgun and pushed his way forward a gray head appeared over the rim of snow and he blazed away the rabbit gave a leap and fell dead  a little more to eat anyway said the young hunter as he put the game in his bag  wait where there is one rabbit there are sometimes more said snap let us stir around a little and see  they did as he suggested and soon sent two rabbits skipping from under a lowhanging tree the rabbits could not run very well in the deep snow and were secured with ease but that was the last of the game in that vicinity  now we wont starve right away said snap and gave a sigh of satisfaction  they were less than half way through the belt of timber when they came to a spot where a big tree had been blown over by the wind as they walked around this giant gave a cry and stepping between the branches brought forth a couple of dead squirrels  killed by the fall i suppose he said  its lucky for us answered shep for it means just so much more food  let us look for nutsthe squirrels must have had some came from snap  they made a search and soon found a hollow half filled with nuts and took them all then they went on as before  by the time they reached the end of the timber belt all were too exhausted to go further and they looked around for another shelter of some kind they found several trees growing close together and in something of a row  that will shelter us from the wind said snap although it is not as good a place as the one we used last night  they cut some tree branches placed them from tree to tree and packed on some snow then they lit another fire and banked up the snow on the other side by this time it was dark again and they were as hungry as bears they broiled two of the rabbits and ate every morsel and then cracked a quantity of the nuts and picked out the meat  this is certainly a christmas to remember said shep as they sat in front of the fire that evening i should like to know what the folks are doing  dont mention it cried giant it makes a fellow feel homesick  they cut plenty of firewood and in honor of the day built a blaze that was to be seen a long distance off this made them a little more cheerful and they even cracked a few jokes but with it all that christmas was far from a bright one they were still miles from their camp on firefly lake and all wondered if they would get back in safety     chapter xxiii  in trouble once more   the next day it snowed again and the four boy hunters were almost in despair for they had calculated to strike out for firefly lake as soon as it grew light  it would be foolish to try it just now said snap looking at the sky just see how fast the snow is falling  the heavy snow kept up all day but cleared away as evening came on looking out about eight oclock shep gave a shout  boys the stars are shining it is as clear as crystal  all rushed forth to verify the glad tidings it was indeed clear and the glittering stars made a scene of royal splendor  well start for camp early tomorrow announced snap now let us get to bed and get a good nights rest it is going to be no picnic walking on this snow  they turned in after fixing the fire leaving giant on guard for the first three hours after giant came whopper and then snap took his turn  snap had scarcely commenced his vigil when he heard the bark of a fox at a great distance  presently the barking of the fox ceased and utter silence reigned for all of half an hour then came another sound which made the leader of the gun club listen with intentness  wolves as sure as fate he murmured i trust they are not coming here  another period of silence and the mournful howls came still closer there were many more of them and snap came to the conclusion that a regular band of wolves were closing in on the little shelter beside the spruces  guess i had better wake up shep he told himself he has got to take the next watch anyway  he aroused his chum and told shep of what he had heard then came more of the howls still closer  they are certainly coming this way said the doctors son picking up his gun and im afraid there must be quite a number of them  after this came another period of silence both boys kept on the alert snap on one side of the camp and shep on the other they felt sure that the wolves were coming closer and they were not mistaken  i see one cried snap as a pair of gleaming eyes showed themselves over a rim of snow  i see three or four responded shep call giant and whopper  the words had scarcely left his lips when snap took aim and fired at one of the wolves wounding it in the shoulder the report of the shotgun brought giant and whopper to their feet without delay  whats up came from both  wolves answered the leader of the club laconically get your guns  the shot had caused the wolves to fall back a little and taking advantage of this snap reloaded the empty barrel of his shotgun and stirred up the fire still more  bang went sheps shotgun and a wolf was taken directly in his throat he turned to run away and then fell dead without hesitation his fellows fell upon him and rent the carcass asunder  what horrible cannibals muttered whopper say how do you like that he went on and fired a bullet from the rifle into the mass of wolves hitting one in the leg and another in the side the first wolf was merely wounded but the second was killed  the death of another of their band made the other wolves retreat and they kept away for fully a quarter of an hour but then their numbers were increased by the arrival of more equally hungry and they came on in a wide semicircle as if to pounce upon the four boy hunters and eat them up  shoot emdont let em come any closer called out whopper and banged away with his shotgun hitting a wolf in the breast then the others fired and another of the ugly beasts went down still another was wounded just sufficiently to make him ugly and with bloodshot eyes he leaped straight into the camp and at snaps very feet  it was a moment of extreme peril and for the instant snaps heart seemed to stop beating then little giant turned swiftly and pulled the trigger of his shotgun and sent the load into the wolfs ear there was one short yelp a leap of agony and the wolf landed in the fire dead scattering the burning embers in all directions  good for you giant cried snap when he could speak he caught the dead wolf and threw the body among the trees  fix that fire up yelled whopper its our best protection  he ran for some sticks and they built the fire into a roaring blaze that illuminated the forest for a considerable distance then shep and whopper fired more shots wounding two more wolves and the pack slowly retreated growling and howling savagely  what an attack said whopper wiping the cold perspiration from his forehead i dont want to experience another  further sleep was out of the question and for the remainder of the night the boys kept a good fire going and watched all around the temporary camp for their enemies but the wolves did not show themselves again  and now for firefly lake and birch tree inn cried shep when they were preparing breakfast my the inn will seem like home after such experiences as we have had  it was clear and mild with hardly any wind blowing as the sun came up it made the great drifts of snow glitter and sparkle in a manner which was dazzling  oh look screamed giant just as they were getting ready to set out theres a shot for somebody and he caught up his gun  over the spruce trees a flock of wild ducks were soaring evidently searching for food they came quite close and all of the young hunters blazed away in rapid succession six of the ducks came down one so straight that it hit whopper directly on the head almost knocking him over  theres luck for you cried snap gleefully weve got a few ducks anyway  they placed the game in their bags and a few minutes later bade farewell to the shelter of the spruces it was so clear they could see the distant hills and mountains with ease and snap regulated the course accordingly  some of the snowdrifts were truly immense one they reckoned measuring twenty feet in height they had to proceed with care for they did not want to break through and sink out of sight once whopper fell over and it was all the others could do to set him straight on his snowshoes again  they had thought to take almost a direct course to firefly lake but after covering a mile found this impossible  well have to take something of a roundabout way said their leader it will be longer but it cant be helped  that will bring us between firefly lake and lake cameron wont it asked giant  yes  they hurried on for another mile it was certainly hard work and made them warm in spite of the lowness of the thermometer then they came to a big drift of snow and found it no mean task to get over the same  hark i what was that said shep  a gunshot answered whopper there goes another  after that they heard several more shots coming from some point ahead  some other hunters must be out said snap wonder who they can be     chapter xxiv  a disagreeable meeting   they had reached a point directly between firefly lake and lake cameron when they came to a little patch of woods surrounding a pond less than a hundred feet across as they entered the woods they heard a slight noise and saw a small deer running swiftly across the snow on the pond at once whopper let drive and so did snap and the deer went down kicked for a moment and then lay still  the game had been struck in the rump and in the neck but there was another wound in one ear and still a fourth near the tail  must have been hit before she came this way said giant  as the young hunters surrounded the game they did not notice the approach of three men on snowshoes all carrying guns and gamebags the three men were andrew felps and two of his particular friends giles faswig and vance lemon  hi what are you doing here demanded andrew felps striding up angrily didnt i warn you off of my land last summer you have no right to hunt here  they have the deer put in giles faswig hang the luck anyhow  never mind the deer belongs to usit was shot on my land muttered andrew felps  certainly it is your deer if it was shot on your land put in vance lemon  the four boy hunters listened to the talk in considerable dismay evidently the three men intended to appropriate the game  is this your land asked whopper  we didnt see any fence put in snap  the fences are there anywayi had them put up last fall after the fire you have no right to even cross my land much less do any shooting  felps aint you going to claim the deer asked giles faswig  certainly i am but i want these young rascals to understand that they cant come on my land answered the lumber dealer  mr felps we are not young rascals said shep with flashing eyes we shot the deer in good faith and if you take it from us i shall consider it stealing  listen to that ejaculated vance lemon and after we wounded the deer first too  i wont talk to you cried andrew felps savagely leave that deer alone and get off of my land as quick as you canand stay off  his manner was so savage and threatening that the young hunters felt compelled to retreat yet they were very angry  mr felps i think youll be sorry for this some day said snap when i get back to fairview i shall tell everybody just how meanly you have acted  hi dont you threaten me roared the irate lumber dealer i know my business you clear outand be quick about it  i suppose you and your friends want our deer because youre not able to shoot one yourselves called out whopper and with this parting shot the young hunters withdrew all of the men shook their fists at the boys  now wouldnt that jar you exclaimed shep as they turned toward firefly lake did you ever hear of such meanness  hes as bad as he was last summer when he drove us away from lake cameron said snap bitterly  for some time after that the young hunters were silent each busy with his own thoughts driven away from the vicinity of lake cameron they had to make another wide detour and it was one oclock before they came in sight of firefly lake nestling so cozily among the hills  it will take at least an hour and a half to get down to the lake and up to camp said snap shall we go on or stop for dinner  i am as hungry as two bears said whopper let us rest up a bit and get something to eat  the others were willing and soon a fire was blazing and over this they broiled one of the wild ducks the meal and the rest occupied an hour and a half but they all felt it was time well spent  their hearts beat rapidly as they walked down the hill to the edge of the lake they had to pass a bend and then came in sight of the camp  the flag is down cried giant in some disappointment  i reckon the blizzard was too much for it answered snap but let that go so long as the shelter itself is all right  they almost broke into a run on the last quarter mile so eager were they to see the condition of things at last they caught sight of birch tree inn it looked to be exactly as they had left it  thank fortune for that began shep when whopper uttered a cry  i really believe the doorway is open  the barrier to the doorway was certainly gone and with hearts that fairly thumped in their breasts they ran for the shelter to learn what this meant all was dark inside and very cold and with trembling fingers snap struck a match and looked around for the acetylene bicycle lamp  its gone he cried  and most of our things are gone too gasped shep  then the match went out and they had to light another a scrap of paper was found and some dry sticks and they kindled a blaze heaping up the fire so as to get as much light as possible  one sled is gone  so are all the cooking utensils  and the extra clothing  and the grub wailed whopper not a bit of coffee chocolate sugar or anything left  boys this is awful wailed giant who could have done it  maybe the ham spink crowd  or the felps crowd  or that tramp who made trouble for us before came from snap  then they made a more careful inspectionto find their skates also missing andmost precious of allall the extra matches and extra ammunition  this is the worst blow of all said the leader of the club referring to the matches and the ammunition we cant stay here without ammunition and the wherewith to make a fire when we want it  whats to do asked giant and whopper in a breath  either catch the fellow who has stolen our things or go home     chapter xxv  at the camp once again   the announcement snap made cast a gloom over all the boys each felt that their leader spoke the truth  well as i dont want to go home i vote we go after the thief said shep who was the first to speak  fortunately not all of their stores had been takenthey had been too plentiful to pile on one sledso they had enough left with which to get a substantial supper but all of the boys did not wait for the meal  if we are going to follow that thief up we ought to do it right away said snap the more time that is wasted the less will be our chance of catching him shep if you say so we can go after him and leave giant and whopper to look after what is left here  why cant i go along asked giant  two ought to stay here said snap and ive got another plan he went on how much money have we got on hand  the amount was counted and found to be nearly five dollars  thats enough said the leader if we cant find the thief we can slip over to riverside and buy the things we actually need i wouldnt go to fairview because that would cause too much talk  snap and shep put some provisions in their game bags readjusted their snowshoes and soon set off  have you any idea when you will be back called whopper after them  nomaybe not till tomorrow was the answer  in the deep snow it was easy to follow the direction the thief with the sled had taken and they soon became convinced that but one person had done the deed  left to themselves whopper and giant did what little they could to restore order to the camp they saw that the thief must have remained in the shelter one or two daysprobably during the blizzard on leaving he had attempted to break down one wall of the place and ruin the chimney but had not succeeded  theyll last as long as we want to stay said giant but how mean it was to try such things  in coming to the shelter whopper had twisted his ankle and this hurt him not a little and he was perfectly willing to rest the member all he could giant prepared supper and they ate it leisurely in the meanwhile talking over the outlook from every point of view  morning found the two young hunters stirring early there was little however to do and they took their time over breakfast giant had found where a bag of beans had been spilled on the ground and he picked them up with care one by one  i think ill make some bean soup for a change he said ill throw in some meat to give it a flavor  that rascalwhoever he wastook all the flour otherwise we might make some pancakes grumbled whopper  i might try my hand at fishing through the ice again said giant baked fish will go fine for a change  hadnt i better stay here giant somebody ought to mind the camp until snap and shep get back and my ankle is quite swollen  yes stay by all means and if you want me yell or fire your gun  so it was arranged and after dinner giant sallied forth with the axe which had not been confiscated and his fishing lines and such bait as he could scrape together  as giant had found his former fishing place a good one he went to the same spot again the snow was deep and he had to sweep it away with a spruce branch he cut for that purpose then he chopped a round hole in the ice as before and sat down on some snow and the tree branch to wait for a bite  fishing proved slow and it was a good quarter of an hour before he got a bite and then the fish slipped the hook just as he was hauling the catch to the surface but he kept on and in an hour had a catch of three all of fair size  after that however try his best he could not get another bite then he determined to go further down the lake where there was another cove  there ought to be fish at the bottom of that cove he told himself and if there are i am bound to have some  finding a spot that suited his fancy he again swept off the snow and began to cut a hole in the ice this proved quite a task and by the time he had finished he was pretty well winded he baited up and sat down on a bank of snow he had swept together  just then some noise reached his ears and he looked around and listened but the noise was not repeated  what could that have been he mused some bird  he strained his ears but the stillness of the forest lay all around the lake of a sudden giant began to feel lonely and he gave a little shiver then he braced up  pshaw im getting as nervous as a cat he murmured and all on account of nothing id better go to fishing and forget it  he dropped in his line properly baited and waited for a bite he was lucky for soon up came a nice maskalonge then a few minutes later came a rock basssomething for which he had not been looking he grew interested and forgot all about the noise he had heard until the cracking of some bushes caught his ears  theres that noise again he muttered what in the world can it be  for the first time since leaving the shelter giant wished he had brought along his shotgun what if some game should suddenly appear  if a deer should come along and i couldnt shoot it it would make me sick he told himself and game is always sure to come along when you havent a gun  giant had now seven fish four of good size he decided to wait for just one more then wind up and go back to the shelter it was rather cold sitting at the fishing hole and his feet were beginning to feel very much like the ice under them  he had baited up with care and allowed the line to sink almost to the bottom of the lake when a fresh noise startled him this was another crackling sound there followed a low suppressed growl and turning in the direction of the shore giant was horrified to see a big black bear come lumbering into view  a bear ill have to get out of here he ejaculated and snatching up his fish and line and the axe he started on a run for the shelter  the bear came out on the ice and toward the hole then it smelt the fish and a moment later started on a clumsy run after the fleeing youth     chapter xxvi  the trail through the snow   snap and shep followed the trail of the stolen sled to the end of firefly lake with ease the track was clearly to be distinguished and it pursued its course in almost a straight line  i hope we can follow it thus easily to the end said the leader of the gun club id hate to lose it  let us hurry as much as possible returned the doctors son we want to overtake the thief before night  they did hurry and at length came to the outlet of the lake before them was rocky river a hundred and more feet wide at this point and frozen over solidly  hullo he didnt go towards fairview cried snap pointing to the track the sled had left he went the other way  he must have gone to riverview or else beyond returned the doctors son  they passed the old icehouse where kiddy leech had met ham spink and his cronies and kept on steadily in the direction of riverview then of a sudden snap set up a shout  i see a man aheadwith a sled  so do i it must be the thief snap  perhaps although i cant make out at this distance ill tell you what ill do shepput on the skates and skate on the clear ice ill soon catch him that way you can follow on your snowshoes or take them off if youd rather  shep decided to run without the snowshoes and both lads took off the articles then snap donned the skates and hurried off at his best rate of speed  if he wont stopshoot at him called shep after his chum  i certainly will responded snap who was worked up more than he cared to admit  snap had quite a stretch of clear ice but further on was a long drift of snow over which he made but slow progress but then came another clear stretch and he spun along his skates skirring merrily at every sturdy stroke  snap was within a hundred yards of the man with the sled when the latter chanced to look around at once the youth yelled at him  stop you thief stop  the man was startled and slackened his pace then when he saw the youth raise his shotgun he let up a cry of fear  dont shoot please dont shoot  kiddy leech ejaculated snap recognizing the tramp stop you rascal or it will be the worse for you  to this the tramp did not reply instead he ran to one side of the river and plunged into some bushes beyond was a thick growth of trees and he lost no time in hiding himself among these  at first snap was on the point of shooting but he hesitated as he was afraid he might kill the thief then it was too late to fire and he dropped his gun on its strap he took possession of the sled turned it around and skated slowly toward where his chum was coming up on a decidedly lively run  did you catch him snap  no but i know who it wasthat tramp kiddy leech  is that so are all the things here  i dont know  where did he go  ran for that woods like a frightened deer i would have fired only i was afraid of killing him  do you think we ought to go after him we might be able to trail him in the snow  we might try it he was pretty well scared when he saw me with my shotgun  leaving the sled by the river side both young hunters made their way through the bushes and into the forest for a short distance they followed the trail with ease but then they reached a pond containing some clear ice and here the footprints were lost  might as well give it up said shep looking around it is growing dark and he will know enough to keep hidden besides if we corner him he may play some tricktumble a rock on us or something like that  slowly the two young hunters retraced their way to the river they were now so tired they could scarcely drag one foot after the other the excitement over reaction set in  i dont think i want to walk all the way to camp tonight remarked shep its too far  well put up somewhere over night answered snap  they examined the things on the sled with interest and were glad to ascertain that nearly every article stolen was there the few things missing were of scant importance  ill wager that scamp intended to take the things somewhere and sell them said snap we were lucky to catch him as we did  having looked the load over they repacked it with care and then looked around them to find out their exact location  there is a farmer named masterson who lives just beyond this woods said snap my father sold him the lumber for his new barn perhaps hell take us in for the night if we offer to pay him  well we can try him anyway answered the doctors son  they skated along the river until the field leading up to the farmhouse was reached it was now quite dark a dog came out to greet them barking furiously  hope he isnt of the biting kind said shep drawing back  down rover down came in a mans voice and a moment later aaron masterson appeared he was a man of sixty bent from age and hard work  good evening mr masterson said snap i dont know if you remember me or not i am charley dodge my father sold you the lumber for your new barn  oh yes i remember you said the old farmer with a smile you came to the raising didnt you who is this with you  my friend shep reed he is dr reeds son  oh yes i know the doctor too he attended my wife when she had pneumoniabrought her around too well lads what brings you in such a snow  in a few words snap and shep explained the situation when they mentioned the tramp aaron masterson shook his grizzled head and his fist vigorously  the pesky critters i wish you had shot him theyre a terribul nuisance tramps is one day my wife give two on em a dinner an they up afterwards an stole my new sickle an whetstone tramps ought all to be hung come in the house  can you keep us until tomorrow morning  i think soill have to ask my wife first though  mrs masterson proved to be a motherly lady of fifty and she readily consented to keep the boys and give them their supper and breakfast  you wont have to pay a cent she declared i am glad to do doctor reeds son a favor and your friend a favor too the doctor is a wonderfully fine man  an mr dodge treated me right on that lumber fer the barn put in aaron masterson  the boys were invited to sit down to a well filled table and did so after washing their hands in the kitchen at the sink they had a real homecooked supper and enjoyed it immensely  they were just finishing up when there came a loud knock on the dining room door of the farmhouse aaron masterson answered it  whats wanted he asked of a man who stood on the porch  please sir i am a poor man looking for work would you mind giving me a bit to eat came from somebody outside  its kiddy leech whispered snap now what do you think of that     chapter xxvii  the capture of the tramp   it was indeed kiddy leech who had applied for assistance at the home of aaron masterson the tramp had taken it for granted that snap and shep had started for the camp on firefly lake and would make no further effort to bring him to justice  what nerve whispered shep what shall we do  lets capture him ill go outside and you can remain in here  so speaking snap caught up his shotgun which stood near the kitchen door and slipped out of the entrance to the woodshed from there he ran around the corner of the house coming up behind kiddy leech  out o work eh aaron masterson was saying wots your trade  im an electrical worker answered the tramp the factory i worked in shut down and i cant get a thing to do anywhere  humph well i reckon we can give you a meal answered the farmer come in  thank you very much said the tramp and followed through the doorway then aaron masterson noticed snap with the shotgun  hullo how did you git out there he cried  kiddy leech turned swiftly and he started on beholding the young hunter  whawhat do you want he stammered  go on in leech answered the leader of the gun club firmly if you try to run away ill surely shoot you  what does this mean demanded aaron masterson  this is the rascal who ran off with our outfit mr masterson answered snap  and we mean to make him a prisoner added shep kiddy leech dont you dare to resist or it will be that much worse for you  the tramp was caught between two fires as it were and did not know what to do as we know he was a good deal of a coward at heart and the sight of the shotgun in snaps hands made him quake  dont shoot me he whined please dont shoot me and he held up his hands in token of submission  so you are the pesky rascal the lads was atellin me about said aaron masterson sternly nice doins i must say  the door was closed and locked so that kiddy leech might not make his exit in a hurry the tramp was in a decidedly perplexed frame of mind and blamed himself roundly for not having been more careful  what are you going to do with me he asked as he stood in a corner  we are going to hand you over to the police answered snap it is no more than you deserve  i didnt mean no harmindeed i didnt  i suppose you think it no harm to steal said shep sarcastically  i wasnt stealing your things  you were  no i wasnt i waseronly going to hide em on you  you went a mighty long way to do it said snap coldly where were you going to hide them at the secondhand shop or the pawnbrokers  im telling the plain truth why i never stole a thing in my life exclaimed kiddy leech  not even when you ran away from our camp that first time said the doctors son how can you expect us to believe you it is a waste of breath on your part  if i can prove that it wasnt my doingsthat isthat i am not the responsible party will you let me go demanded kiddy leech eagerly  we want to hear your story first said the doctors son  if this here feller stole them things as you say he did the best thing to do is to tote him off to the lockup interposed aaron masterson hes evidently tryin to make up a slick yarn so as to git off  aaron you cant take him to the town jail tonight its too late said the farmers wife remember the travelin is powerful bad too  then i reckon we can tie him up in the barn till mornin answered her husband with an inquiring look at the two young hunters  we can do that said snap but first we might listen to what he has to say  you wont let me goif i tell you something very important asked kiddy leech  not yet  all right then i wont say a word answered the tramp and a set look came over his somewhat besotted face  he realized that he was in a serious situation and made up his mind that ham spink and carl dudder must help him out of it he knew the two boys were welltodo and reasoned that their parents would do almost anything to keep their sons out of jail  going to tie me up in the barn and starve me to death eh he said sourly i wouldnt treat a dog that way  if we keep him all night i suppose we can give him a little something to eat said mrs masterson relenting  sit down there and eat commanded her husband and pointed to a chair kiddy leech dropped into it and was given a fair supper for which it must be confessed he had little relish several times he acted as if he wanted to talk but as often changed his mind  ill make them young dudes get me out of this the tramp told himself maybe their folks will pay me handsomely to keep mum and take whats coming to me thats their way of doing  the supper over aaron masterson lit his lantern and led the way to the barn here the tramp had to submit to having his hands bound behind him and then he was placed in a large harness closet the closet was fairly warm so there was little danger of his taking cold  now you keep quiet until morning said aaron masterson as he threw in several blankets  do you think he can break out of the closet asked snap  ill fix it so he wont want to answered the farmer  when snap and shep had come he had tied up his dog now he released the animal and brought him into the barn  watch rover watch he said pointing to the closet and the dog gave a sniff and a short bark and then lay down in front of the locked door  my dog is heredont try to get out called aaron masterson to the tramp if you dowell i wont be responsible thets all  mighty kind growled kiddy leech and that was all he said  after that the farmer and the two young hunters returned to the house and talked the matter over for a full hour it was decided to take kiddy leech to the riverside jail the first thing in the morning then snap was to go home and tell his father of what had occurred and shep was to take the news to the camp on firefly lake  the two boys were given a comfortable room in which to sleep it felt more than good after bunking around in camp and forest and despite the excitement of the tramps capture they slept well  hi boys got up they heard aaron masterson call at about six oclock  oh dear i wish hed let us sleep an hour longer grumbled the doctors son  remember we are to take that tramp to the lockup this morning answered snap  boys are you awake went on the farmer ive got news for you thet tramps got away     chapter xxviii  four boys and a bear   escaped ejaculated shep  how in the world did he manage it queried snap  then both young hunters leaped up and dressed as rapidly as possible  he was a slick one said aaron masterson he got free of the rope around his wrists somehow and then he clum to the top o the harness closet and into the loft from the winder he dropped onto the shed an then to the ground  but what of your dog didnt he go after him questioned the doctors son  no the barn door was shet to keep out the wind so rover couldnt follow him  when do you suppose he got away  some time during the night  cant we follow him asked snap  we can try  all went outside and down to the barn the tracks left by kiddy leech were plainly to be seen from the barn to the highway but there the footprints were hopelessly lost in the multitude of others  aint no use to try to follow him said aaron masterson the road branches off four times between here an town an there aint no tellin wot road he tuk moren likely hes travelin as fast as all gitout too  he certainly will do his level best to get awayafter such experiences as he has had answered snap perhaps he will never show himself in this locality again  they remained out on the road looking up and down for five minutes and then returned to the house  did he steal anything asked shep  by gum i didnt think o that gasped aaron masterson  he took a thorough look around and then came in and gave a sigh of satisfaction  nothin missing so far as i can see he said reckon he was too scart to pick up anything the dog must have barked but i didnt hear him  neither did i answered snap it was so cold i rolled up as tight as i could ears and all in the blankets  with the tramp gone there seemed nothing to do but for snap and shep to return to the camp mrs masterson served them with a fine breakfast of sausage and wheatcakes with molasses and the boys filled up as only growing boys can then the lady of the house gave them a mince pie and some crullers to take with them neither she nor her husband would take any pay for what they had done  its too bad thet tramp got away said aaron masterson but i did wot i thought best to hold him  oh we dont blame you mr masterson said snap but it is a pity such a rascal should be at large  it was pleasant enough when the sun showed itself and by eight oclock the two young hunters were on their journey to firefly lake it must be confessed that they found their load a heavy one and by noon they were still some distance from camp  well have to stop to rest and get a lunch said the doctors son no use of killing ourselves  i suppose giant and whopper are wondering what has become of us said snap  they came to a rest in the shelter of some pine trees and ate a lunch mrs masterson had prepared for them in the meantime keeping warm by a fire they built of tree branches the rest occupied half an hour and then they went on as before  wonder what the boys are doing said snap as they reached firefly lake  giant said something about fishing through the ice answered his companion he appears to love that sport  well it is nicewhen you can catch anythingand giant is always lucky  they had proceeded less than half the distance up the lake to the camp when snap came to a halt  listen shep  it is giant calling answered the doctors son he must be in trouble  whopper whopper came to their ears help me a bear is after me  a bear is after giant gasped snap come on shep we must aid him  there he is said shep as they swept around a bend of the lake and look a big bear is after him  let us shoot the bear cried snap and dropped his hold of the sled rope while the doctors son did the same then both young hunters brought around their shotguns and aimed at the big bear but giant was also in range and they did not dare to fire  giant run to one side sang out snap give us a chance to shoot i think i can hit him  snap gasped the smaller member of the gun club shoot him shoot him he wants to eat me up  hullo hullo came from the camp and now whopper appeared rifle in hand by ginger a bear  by this time the bear was closing in upon poor giant the beast was hungry and the smell of fish was very tempting with nothing else to do giant threw his mess of fish directly in the bears face  the movement was a surprise to bruin and he stopped short then he caught up the string of fish turned swiftly but clumsily and lumbered off in the direction of the forest bordering the lake  it was now that snap and shep as well as whopper got a chance to fire at the beast and all did so hastily but they were excited over giants narrow escape and their shots did no more than to wound the bear slightly in the ear and the side bruin gave a growl made a turn as if to come back and then dove into the forest and was lost to view  hehe wanted my fish gasped giant well he is welcome to them so long as he doesnt chew me up  what a pity that we didnt nail him said shep  shall we go after him demanded whopper the four of us ought to be able to lay him low  i am not going after him just now answered giant who was still as white as a sheet  the others talked it over for a few minutes and it was decided to follow up the bear some other time if it could be done whopper and giant were anxious to hear what snap and shep had to tell and all took themselves to the inn dragging the sled after them  as soon as the excitement was over snap and shep told their tale in full to which giant and whopper listened with close attention the latter were sorry that kiddy leech had escaped but glad that the outing had not been broken up  id rather say here than go to court and testify against that tramp said whopper i dont like to go to court  oh so would i answered shep but it was our duty to bring him to justice if it could be done  giant was sorry he had lost his mess of fish but he had no desire to try his luck again for the time being  that bear may be watching around here he said and i dont want him to make a meal of me  with it all the boys were happy to be together again and equally happy to have their outfit back that evening they cooked themselves what whopper declared was a stunning supper and enjoyed it to the utmost it was nine oclock before they turned in worn out but happy  but they did not sleep long snap had just gotten into a doze when he heard a scratching outside he sat up and listened and soon the scratching was repeated  what can that be he mused and then of a sudden his hair seemed to stand upon end it must be that bear and he is trying to get in     chapter xxix  unexpected visitors   for the moment snap thought to rouse up the others then he checked himself arose with caution and felt for his shotgun the fire had burnt low and only a faint flickering of light told him where the firearm was located  in the meantime the scratching outside had ceased but soon it began again it was at the doorway where the logs set up to close the opening left a crack two inches wide for fresh air  snap waited his heart almost in his throat then he saw a shaggy paw pull one of the logs slightly  he could wait no longer and aiming straight at the crack he pulled the trigger of his shotgun bang went the weapon with a noise inside of the shelter that was almost deafening  hi whats up whos shooting yelled whopper leaping up and then sprawling down in his blanket which was wrapped completely around him  whats attacking us came from giant  did you hit it asked shep  its a bear i think answered snap he was at the doorway trying to get in  a low growl at this juncture reached the ears of all the other young hunters ran for their firearms the growl came from a distance showing the wouldbe intruder was retreating  ive a good mind to go after him said shep  dont you do itits too dark outside warned whopper wait till daylight  they waited several minutes but no further sound came to disturb them then with caution they pulled the logs of the doorway aside and peered out the clouds had drifted over the stars and it was dark so that they could see but little snap took a firebrand and gazed down into the snow  blood he said pointing to the spots i certainly hit him  and it must have been a bear by the big tracks said giant very likely the one that attacked me on the ice  we must get that bear said whopper but not tonight  yes we must get that bear by all means added the doctors son  i vote somebody remain on guard said snap that beast may come back at any time doubtless he is very hungry and a hungry bear is usually pretty desperate  it was decided that they should take turns watching and this settled one after another the young hunters went to rest again but for the balance of the night only an owl came to disturb them and they paid no attention to this  with nothing special to do the young hunters were rather lazy about getting around in the morning and it was after ten oclock when the breakfast dishes were cleared away whopper went outside to bring in some firewood and presently called to the others  whats wanted asked snap  two men are coming this way from over yonder unless i am mistaken they are the two men who were out hunting with andrew felps  so they are exclaimed shop what can they be wanting now  maybe they want to drive us away from this lake suggested giant they are just about mean enough  no they cant do that answered snap i made sure of it before i left home  they are carrying something between them said whopper as the men came closer looks like a deer  it is half of a deerthe very deer we killed cried giant  soon the men were within speaking distance  good morning boys said giles faswig blandly  good morning returned snap briefly instinctively he felt that something unusual was in the air  weve come to the conclusion to let you have half of that deer said vance lemon  better keep it said giant curtly  thats just what i say murmured whopper  no boys we want to do the fair thing said giles faswig smoothly as it was shot on mr felps land he thinks he is justly entitled to it but at the same time  i dont think we want the deernow said snap we have plenty of other game and you acted so hateful about it you can keep it  he looked at his chums and they nodded to show that they agreed with him the two men looked rather dissatisfied  so you wont take the deer meat even after we carried it away over here said vance lemon  no  that isnt a very friendly way to act  well you didnt act very friendly in the first place answered shep  having pretty good luck you say asked giles faswig curiously  the very best of luck answered the leader of the gun flub and mentioned some of the game brought down so you can easily see we dont need this venison at all he added  at this the two men looked at each other and murmured something the boys could not catch  we came over toerto do a little trading said giles faswig got plenty of ammunition on hand i reckon  all we wish answered snap and then he suddenly smelt a mouse as the saying goes and winked at his chums  we thought so and we thought wed help you out by buying some from you what sizes have you got  snap you dont whispered shep  hush shep let me run this whispered the leader of the club in return then he turned to the two men again and mentioned what kinds of ammunition they used and how much they had on hand  thought so said giles lemon well take half of what youve got and pay you double price for it  what came from giant and whopper but snap merely shook his head and winked at them and then they said no more  thats a fair deal isnt it asked giles faswig oilily youll make a clean dollar and a half by the operation  we dont want your money said snap decidedly  eh came from both men  i wouldnt sell you our ammunition at any price and i dont think my friends care to either  thats the talk put in shep  you dont get anything out of us murmured giant  not by a jugful added whopper  then you wont sell us any ammunition asked vance lemon and his face grew as sour as the fruit his name represented  all of the young hunters shook their heads with vigor  well pay you triple price said giles faswig come that will be easy money for you  not if you offer us a hundred times the value of the ammunition said snap firmly you treated us as mean as dirt before now if you want any ammunition you can tramp back to town and get it  at this the men broke into a rage and began to threaten the young hunters in various ways they had brought over the deer meat merely to smooth matters over so that they could get the ammunition which they needed sorely  look here if you threaten us any more ill have you up before the squire said snap at last you clear out and leave us alone and then in high dudgeon giles faswig and vance lemon departed taking the deer meat with them on their way back to their own camp they met the big bear and in fright dropped the meat and ran for their lives when they got to the camp they told andrew felps of the result of the trip  well we cant stay here without ammunition said the lumber merchant in disgust i bought up all riley had and jackson said he wasnt going to get any more of those sizes of cartridges until next week well have to give up hang those boys anyway  and deeply disgusted the lumber dealer had to give up his outing and go home and his friends departed with him they had been more than mean and right or wrong the young hunters had paid them back in their own coin     chapter xxx  a surprisegoodbye   after that two days went by without anything unusual happening the boys enjoyed every minute of the time and with the bear scare at an end they went hunting and fishing to their hearts content giant and whopper caught a mess of sixteen fish large and small and shep and snap laid low half a dozen rabbits some squirrels and also a beautiful brook mink of which they were very proud  it is too bad that our outing must soon come to an end said the leader of the gun club but as we have had a glorious time i suppose we ought not to complain  i saw some silver tail foxes at the ridge today said shep i think we ought to go after them  and after that bear put in whopper we dont want to go home until we lay low his bearship  maybe his bearship will lay us low put in giant that wouldnt be so nice  during their spare time the boys had set several traps and in these they caught some animals of more or less importance they also brought down two wild turkeys and resolved to eat one for their new years dinner and take the other home  happy new year was the cry on a beautiful morning and the young hunters got up to put in a full day as snap expressed it right after breakfast they set the turkey to roasting and made a pie and some other good things they had a bountiful dinner early and by one oclock started out for their last hunt  they had already resolved to cross the lake in the direction shep had seen the silvertailed foxes they went over on their skates and then donned their snowshoes and were soon deep in the forest here they soon struck the trail of the foxes and discovered them in an angle between a cliff and a series of sharp rocks  theres a shot for you cried snap as four of the rather beautiful creatures came to view and without hesitation all took aim and fired as the various reports died away two of the silvertailed foxes gave a whirl upward and came down lifeless the others turned tail and started to rush past the young hunters but snap and shep were too quick and brought them down limping and then the others finished the creatures  one apiece cried whopper just what i hoped for  so did i said giant  they tramped on after this and managed to bring down a big owl which snap said they could stuff and put it in their clubroomproviding they ever got one then they came to a peculiar trail that bothered them not a little  do you know what i think it is said snap at last its the trail of a bear and the beast was carrying something pretty heavy  maybe it is our bear cried giant enthusiastically  gracious i didnt know we owned a bear answered shep  well shep you know well enough what i mean  come on after his bearship cried whopper well blow him into a million pieces and then take him home as a trophy of our skill  whos going to carry the million pieces asked snap innocently and then whopper shied a chunk of soft snow at him  all felt in excellent spirits and willing to go after the savage animal they advanced with caution among the rocks until they came to a narrow defile partly choked with snow and ice on one side was a big shelving rock with a dark hole beneath  be careful that may be the bears den cried snap softly and just then a loud and deep growl came from the hole it rather scared all of the young hunters and they retreated several paces  wonder how we can make him come out of his hole asked shep after an awkward pause   go in and invite him suggested whopper who felt in particularly bright humor that day  all right you go  not on your life and whopper took another step backward  let us get up on yonder rocks suggested snap then ill throw a stone into the den they crawled up the somewhat slippery rocks and then the leader of the gun club did as he had mentioned  the stone struck something soft and a moment later out of the den lumbered the big black bear bristling with rage as he came forth all of the young hunters blazed away and the bear was struck in various places but the shots were far from fatal and with a grunt of rage and pain bruin started to climb up the rocks after them  give him another shot yelled whopper who had the rifle quick or hell chew somebody up  again snap and giant fired and the bear received more buckshot in his anatomy but he was tough as well as big and the wounds seemed to merely increase his rage  hes coming up the rocks sure gasped giant then he started to run lost his footing and began to roll down one of the steep sides of the rock  giant giant yelled snap stop you are rolling right toward the bear  hell be chewed up sure screamed shep shoot him somebody shoot him  in feverish haste whopper had been reloading his rifle now he swung the weapon to his shoulder he was greatly agitated but by sheer force of will power calmed himself sufficiently to take aim then the rifle cracked out and the bullet hit the bear full in the chest it made bruin stagger and he fell back on his side kicking up a shower of snow in all directions  good thats the way to do it sang out snap now run giant  by this time the youngest member of the gun club had reached the bottom of the rocks and was scrambling to his feet he had his gun still in his hands and as the bear lurched toward him he caught the weapon by the barrel swung it around and let the beast have such a crack on the head that the gun stock was completely shattered over went the bear again kicking up another shower of loose snow  by this time the young hunters were sure they had the best of the fight and withdrawing to a safe distance each of those having available weapons let the beast have another shot this was too much for bruin and with a final roar and a gasp he plunged forward on his head gave several convulsive kicks and lay still  hurrah weve got him cried shep thats the best haul yet  you are right said whopper even if it did cost giant his gun  never mind well chip in and buy another for him said snap say that was a sharp fight he added  it was no easy matter to get the big bear on a drag and haul the carcass down to the ice but once on the lake they made good progress towards the camp  hullo boys been looking for you came the call and jed sanborn appeared by christopher peter got a black bear have yet now aint thet prime  whats the news jed asked snap  lots o news said the old hunter first thing is youre to go home tomorrow  oh we know that already said whopper  next thing is do you know that tramp feller with the name o kiddy leech  yes  well hes tukcaught him yesterday aaron masterson spotted him hanging around riverview hes arrested  good cried snap now hell get what he deserves  an that aint all who do you think the tramp sent fer when he was in jail  who asked the four young hunters simultaneously  ham spink and carl dudder it aint leaked out jest why but some folks thinks young spink and young dudder got the tramp to steal your things an theres more news too  what more jed  its come out that ham spink and carl dudder blew up the old boathouse jest to ruin your things there was a lively row but mr spink an mr rudder settled the billto keep ham and carl out o jail i expect  this was indeed news and the boys listened with interest to all of the details the discovery about the boathouse had come through a workman who had let ham spink have the dynamite  if ham spink got that tramp to come here he ought to suffer for itand carl rudder ought to suffer too said snap  they shall suffer for it added shep  that evening they told jed sanborn of their various experiences and showed him the game they were going to take home he declared the bear to be the largest he had ever seen in those parts and said the game would create a stir when exhibited at fairview  dont know as youll ever have so much fun hunting again he said or so many adventures but he was mistaken they did have an equal amount of fun excitement and thrilling adventures the very next summer and how and where will be told in the next volume of this series to be entitled young hunters of the lake or out with rod and gun  the homecoming of the young hunters made quite a stir in the quiet town and when they showed the big bear at one of the stores crowds came to inspect the game the lads were greatly praised and if their parents were proud of what their sons had done who can blame them  the truth about the doings of ham spink and carl dudder soon leaked out so far as our friends were concerned although the matter was kept from the general public both mr spink and mr dudder were anxious that no charge of theft should be made against kiddy leech so the tramp was merely given thirty days in jail for vagrancy and was then given some money by mr spink and told to go elsewhere which he did in the meantime mr spink and mr dudder paid for all damages our friends had sustained including the burning down of the log cabin which the bad boys admitted and promised to take ham and carl vigorously in hand as a result both of the misguided boys were sent to a very strict boarding school where their parents hoped they would see the error of their ways and do better hearing of this snap and the other gun club members said they were satisfied and there the matter rested  boys we had a dandy time said shep one day as they were talking the outing over hope we go again soon  and shoot more bears put in giant  and deer added snap  and a hundred or two other things came from whopper the next time i go camping  well all go with you interrupted snap hurrah for the fairview gun club  and the cheer was given with a will
