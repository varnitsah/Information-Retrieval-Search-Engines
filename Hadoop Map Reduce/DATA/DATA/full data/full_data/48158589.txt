i boarded but we did not like it indeed there was no reason why we should like it euphemia said that she never felt at home except when she was out which feeling indicating such an excessively unphilosophic state of mind was enough to make me desire to have a home of my own where except upon rare and exceptional occasions my wife would never care to go out  if you should want to rent a house there are three ways to find one one way is to advertise another is to read the advertisements of other people this is a comparatively cheap way a third method is to apply to an agent but none of these plans are worth anything the proper way is to know some one who will tell you of a house that will exactly suit you euphemia and i thoroughly investigated this matter and i know that what i say is a fact  we tried all the plans when we advertised we had about a dozen admirable answers but in these although everything seemed to suit the amount of rent was not named none of those in which the rent was named would do at all and when i went to see the owners or agents of these suitable houses they asked much higher rents than those mentioned in the unavailable answersand this notwithstanding the fact that they always asserted that their terms were either very reasonable or else greatly reduced on account of the season being advanced it was now the fifteenth of may  euphemia and i once wrote a bookthis was just before we were marriedin which we told young married people how to go to housekeeping and how much it would cost them we knew all about it for we had asked several people now the prices demanded as yearly rental for small furnished houses by the owners and agents of whom i have been speaking were in many cases more than we had stated a house could be bought and furnished for  the advertisements of other people did not serve any better there was always something wrong about the houses when we made close inquiries and the trouble was generally in regard to the rent with agents we had a little better fortune euphemia sometimes went with me on my expeditions to real estate offices and she remarked that these offices were always in the basement or else you had to go up to them in an elevator there was nothing between these extremes and it was a good deal the same way she said with their houses they were all very low indeed in price and quality or else too high  one trouble was that we wanted a house in a country place not very far from the city and not very far from the railroad station or steamboat landing we also wanted the house to be nicely shaded and fully furnished and not to be in a malarial neighborhood or one infested by mosquitoes  if we do go to housekeeping said euphemia we might as well get a house to suit us while we are about it moving is more expensive than a fire  there was one man who offered us a house that almost suited us it was near the water had rooms enough and somebut not very muchground and was very accessible to the city the rent too was quite reasonable but the house was unfurnished the agent however did not think that this would present any obstacle to our taking it he was sure that the owner would furnish it if we paid him ten per cent on the value of the furniture he put into it we agreed that if the landlord would do this and let us furnish the house according to the plans laid down in our book that we would take the house but unfortunately this arrangement did not suit the landlord although he was in the habit of furnishing houses for tenants and charging them ten per cent on the cost  i saw him myself and talked to him about it  but you see said he when i had shown him our list of articles necessary for the furnishing of a house it would not pay me to buy all these things and rent them out to you if you only wanted heavy furniture which would last for years the plan would answer but you want everything i believe the small conveniences you have on this list come to more money than the furniture and carpets  oh yes said i we are not so very particular about furniture and carpets but these little conveniences are the things that make housekeeping pleasant andspeaking from a commonsense point of viewprofitable  that may be he answered but i cant afford to make matters pleasant and profitable for you in that way now then let us look at one or two particulars here on your list is an icepick twentyfive cents now if i buy that icepick and rent it to you at two and ahalf cents a year i shall not get my money back unless it lasts you ten years and even then as it is not probable that i can sell that icepick after you have used it for ten years i shall have made nothing at all by my bargain and there are other things in that list such as featherdusters and lampchimneys that couldnt possibly last ten years dont you see my position  i saw it we did not get that furnished house euphemia was greatly disappointed  it would have been just splendid she said to have taken our book and have ordered all these things at the stores one after another without even being obliged to ask the price  i had my private doubts in regard to this matter of price i am afraid that euphemia generally set down the lowest price and the best things she did not mean to mislead and her plan certainly made our book attractive but it did not work very well in practice we have a friend who undertook to furnish her house by our book and she never could get the things as cheaply as we had them quoted  but you see said euphemia to her we had to put them down at very low prices because the model house we speak of in the book is to be entirely furnished for just so much  but in spite of this explanation the lady was not satisfied  we found ourselves obliged to give up the idea of a furnished house we would have taken an unfurnished one and furnished it ourselves but we had not money enough we were dreadfully afraid that we should have to continue to board  it was now getting on toward summer at least there was only a part of a month of spring left and whenever i could get off from my business euphemia and i made little excursions into the country round about the city one afternoon we went up the river and there we saw a sight that transfixed us as it were on the bank a mile or so above the city stood a canalboat i say stood because it was so firmly imbedded in the ground by the riverside that it would have been almost as impossible to move it as to have turned the sphinx around this boat we soon found was inhabited by an oysterman and his family they had lived there for many years and were really doing quite well the boat was divided inside into rooms and these were papered and painted and nicely furnished there was a kitchen a livingroom a parlor and bedrooms there were all sorts of conveniencescarpets on the floors pictures and everything at least so it seemed to us to make a home comfortable this was not all done at once the oysterman told me they had lived there for years and had gradually added this and that until the place was as we saw it he had an oysterbed out in the river and he made cider in the winter but where he got the apples i dont know there was really no reason why he should not get rich in time  well we went all over that house and we praised everything so much that the oystermans wife was delighted and when we had some stewed oysters afterwardeating them at a little table under a tree near byi believe that she picked out the very largest oysters she had to stew for us when we had finished our supper and had paid for it and were going down to take our little boat againfor we had rowed up the rivereuphemia stopped and looked around her then she clasped her hands and exclaimed in an ecstatic undertone  we must have a canalboat  and she never swerved from that determination  after i had seriously thought over the matter i could see no good reason against adopting this plan it would certainly be a cheap method of living and it would really be housekeeping i grew more and more in favor of it after what the oysterman had done what might not we do he had never written a book on housekeeping nor in all probability had he considered the matter philosophically for one moment in all his life  but it was not an easy thing to find a canalboat there were none advertised for rentat least not for housekeeping purposes  we made many inquiries and took many a long walk along the watercourses in the vicinity of the city but all in vain of course we talked a great deal about our project and our friends became greatly interested in it and of course too they gave us a great deal of advice but we didnt mind that we were philosophical enough to know that you cant have shad without bones they were good friends and by being careful in regard to the advice it didnt interfere with our comfort  we were beginning to be discouraged at least euphemia was her discouragement is like watercresses it generally comes up in a very short time after she sows her wishes but then it withers away rapidly which is a comfort one evening we were sitting rather disconsolately in our room and i was reading out the advertisements of country board in a newspaper when in rushed dr heareone of our old friends he was so full of something that he had to say that he didnt even ask us how we were in fact he didnt appear to want to know  i tell you what it is said he i have found just the very thing you want  a canalboat i cried  yes said he a canalboat  furnished asked euphemia her eyes glistening  well no answered the doctor i dont think you could expect that  but we cant live on the bare floor said euphemia our house must be furnished  well then i suppose this wont do said the doctor ruefully for there isnt so much as a bootjack in it it has most things that are necessary for a boat but it hasnt anything that you could call housefurniture but dear me i should think you could furnish it very cheaply and comfortably out of your book  very true said euphemia if we could pick out the cheapest things and then get some folks to buy a lot of the books  we could begin with very little said i trying hard to keep calm  certainly said the doctor you need make no more rooms at first than you could furnish  then there are no rooms said euphemia  no there is nothing but one vast apartment extending from stem to stern  wont it be glorious said euphemia to me we can first make a kitchen and then a diningroom and a bedroom and then a parlorjust in the order in which our book says they ought to be furnished  glorious i cried no longer able to contain my enthusiasm i should think so doctor where is this canalboat  the doctor then went into a detailed statement the boat was stranded on the shore of the scoldsbury river not far below ginxs we knew where ginxs was because we had spent a very happy day there during our honeymoon  the boat was a good one but superannuated that however did not interfere with its usefulness as a dwelling we could get itthe doctor had seen the ownerfor a small sum per annum and here was positively no end to its capabilities  we sat up until twenty minutes past two talking about that house we ceased to call it a boat at about a quarter of eleven  the next day i took the boat and paid a months rent in advance three days afterward we moved into it  we had not much to move which was a comfort looking at it from one point of view a carpenter had put up two partitions in it which made three roomsa kitchen a diningroom and a very long bedroom which was to be cut up into a parlor study spareroom etc as soon as circumstances should allow or my salary should be raised originally all the doors and windows were in the roof so to speak but our landlord allowed us to make as many windows to the side of the boat as we pleased provided we gave him the wood we cut out it saved him trouble he said but i did not understand him at the time accordingly the carpenter made several windows for us and put in sashes which opened on hinges like the hasp of a trunk our furniture did not amount to much at first the very thought of living in this independent romantic way was so delightful euphemia said that furniture seemed a mere secondary matter  we were obliged indeed to give up the idea of following the plan detailed in our book because we hadnt the sum upon which the furnishing of a small house was therein based  and if we havent the money remarked euphemia it would be of no earthly use to look at the book it would only make us doubt our own calculations you might as well try to make brick without mortar as the children of israel did  i could do that myself my dear said i but we wont discuss that subject now we will buy just what we absolutely need and then work up from that  acting on this plan we bought first a small stove because euphemia said that we could sleep on the floor if it were necessary but we couldnt make a fire on the floorat least not often then we got a table and two chairs the next thing we purchased was some hanging shelves for our books and euphemia suddenly remembered the kitchen things these which were few with some crockery nearly brought us to the end of our resources but we had enough for a big easychair which euphemia was determined i should have because i really needed it when i came home at night tired with my long days work at the office i had always been used to an easychair and it was one of her most delightful dreams to see me in a real nice one comfortably smoking my pipe in my own house after eating my own delicious little supper in company with my own dear wife we selected the chair and then we were about to order the things sent out to our future home when i happened to think that we had no bed i called euphemias attention to the fact  she was thunderstruck  i never thought of that she said we shall have to give up the stove  not at all said i we cant do that we must give up the easychair  oh that would be too bad said she the house would seem like nothing to me without the chair  but we must do without it my dear said i at least for a while i can sit out on deck and smoke of an evening you know  yes said euphemia you can sit on the bulwarks and i can sit by you that will do very well im sure im glad the boat has bulwarks  so we resigned the easychair and bought a bedstead and some very plain bedding the bedstead was what is sometimes called a scissorsbed we could shut it up when we did not want to sleep in it and stand it against the wall  when we packed up our trunks and left the boardinghouse euphemia fairly skipped with joy  we went down to ginxs in the first boat having arranged that our furniture should be sent to us in the afternoon we wanted to be there to receive it the trip was just wildly delirious the air was charming the sun was bright and i had a whole holiday when we reached ginxs we found that the best way to get our trunks and ourselves to our house was to take a carriage and so we took one i told the driver to drive along the river road and i would tell him where to stop  when we reached our boat and had alighted i said to the driver  you can just put our trunks inside anywhere  the man looked at the trunks and then looked at the boat afterward he looked at me  that boat aint goin anywhere said he  i should think not said euphemia we shouldnt want to live in it if it were  you are going to live in it said the man  yes said euphemia  oh said the man and he took our trunks on board without another word  it was not very easy for him to get the trunks into our new home in fact it was not easy for us to get there ourselves there was a gangplank with a rail on one side of it which inclined from the shore to the deck of the boat at an angle of fortyfive degrees and when the man had staggered up this plank with the trunks euphemia said i ought to have helped him but i really thought that it would be better for one person to fall off the plank than for two to go over together and we had paid him and he had driven away in a speechless condition we scrambled up and stood upon the threshold or rather the afterdeck of our home  it was a proud moment euphemia glanced around her eyes full of happy tears and then she took my arm and we went down stairsat least we tried to go down in that fashion but soon found it necessary to go one at a time we wandered over the whole extent of our mansion and found that our carpenter had done his work better than the woman whom we had engaged to scrub and clean the house something akin to despair must have seized upon her for euphemia declared that the floors looked dirtier than on the occasion of her first visit when we rented the boat  but that didnt discourage us we felt sure that we should get it clean in time  early in the afternoon our furniture arrived together with the other things we had bought and the men who brought them over from the steamboat landing had the brightest merriest faces i ever noticed among that class of people euphemia said it was an excellent omen to have such cheerful fellows come to us on the very first day of our housekeeping  then we went to work i put up the stove which was not much trouble as there was a place all ready in the deck for the stovepipe to be run through euphemia was somewhat surprised at the absence of a chimney but i assured her that boats were very seldom built with chimneys my dear little wife bustled about and arranged the pots and kettles on nails that i drove into the kitchen walls then she made the bed in the bedroom and i hung up a lookingglass and a few little pictures that we had brought in our trunks  before four oclock our house was in order then we began to be very hungry  my dear said euphemia we ought to have thought to bring something to cook  that is very true said i but i think perhaps we had better walk up to ginxs and get our supper tonight you see we are so tired and hungry  what cried euphemia go to a hotel the very first day i think it would be dreadful why i have been looking forward to this first meal with the greatest delight you can go up to the little store by the hotel and buy some things and i will cook them and we will have our first dear little meal here all alone by ourselves at our own table and in our own house  so this was determined upon and after a hasty counting of the fund i had reserved for moving and kindred expenses and which had been sorely depleted during the day i set out and in about an hour returned with my first marketing  i made a fire using a lot of chips and blocks the carpenter had left and euphemia cooked the supper and we ate it from our little table with two large towels for a tablecloth  it was the most delightful meal i ever ate  and when we had finished euphemia washed the dishes the thoughtful creature had put some water on the stove to heat for the purpose while we were at supper and then we went on deck or on the piazza as euphemia thought we had better call it and there we had our smoke i say we for euphemia always helps me to smoke by sitting by me and she seems to enjoy it as much as i do  and when the shades of evening began to gather around us i hauled in the gangplank just like a delightful old drawbridge euphemia said although i hope for the sake of our ancestors that drawbridges were easier to haul in and went to bed  it is lucky we were tired and wanted to go to bed early for we had forgotten all about lamps or candles  for the next week we were two busy and happy people i rose about halfpast five and made the firewe found so much wood on the shore that i thought i should not have to add fuel to my expensesand euphemia cooked the breakfast i then went to a well belonging to a cottage near by where we had arranged for waterprivileges and filled two buckets with delicious water and carried them home for euphemias use through the day then i hurried off to catch the train for as there was a station near ginxs i ceased to patronize the steamboat the hours of which were not convenient after a day of work and pleasurable anticipation at the office i hastened back to my home generally laden with a basket of provisions and various household necessities milk was brought to us daily from the abovementioned cottage by a little toddler who seemed just able to carry the small tin bucket which held a lacteal pint if the urchin had been the child of rich parents as euphemia sometimes observed he would have been in his nurses armsbut being poor he was scarcely weaned before he began to carry milk around to other people  after i reached home came supper and the delightful evening hours when over my pipe i had given up cigars as being too expensive and inappropriate and had taken to a tall pipe and canaster tobacco we talked and planned and told each other our days experience  one of our earliest subjects of discussion was the name of our homestead euphemia insisted that it should have a name i was quite willing but we found it no easy matter to select an appropriate title i proposed a number of appellations intended to suggest the character of our home among these were safe ashore firmly grounded and some other names of that style but euphemia did not fancy any of them she wanted a suitable name of course she said but it must be something that would sound like a house and be like a boat  partitionville she objected to and gangplank terrace did not suit her because it suggested convicts going out to work which naturally was unpleasant  at last after days of talk and cogitation we named our house rudder grange  to be sure it wasnt exactly a grange but then it had such an enormous rudder that the justice of that part of the title seemed to overbalance any little inaccuracy in the other portion  but we did not spend all our spare time in talking an hour or two every evening was occupied in what we called fixing the house and gradually the inside of our abode began to look like a conventional dwelling we put matting on the floors and cheap but very pretty paper on the walls we added now a couple of chairs and now a table or something for the kitchen frequently especially of a sunday we had company and our guests were always charmed with euphemias cunning little meals the dear girl loved good eating so much that she could scarcely fail to be a good cook  we worked hard and were very happy and thus the weeks passed on    chapter ii treating of a novel style of boarder   in this delightful way of living only one thing troubled us we didnt save any money there were so many little things that we wanted and so many little things that were so cheap that i spent pretty much all i made and that was far from the philosophical plan of living that i wished to follow  we talked this matter over a great deal after we had lived in our new home for about a month and we came at last to the conclusion that we would take a boarder  we had no trouble in getting a boarder for we had a friend a young man who was engaged in the flour business who was very anxious to come and live with us he had been to see us two or three times and had expressed himself charmed with our household arrangements  so we made terms with him the carpenter partitioned off another room and our boarder brought his trunk and a large red velvet armchair and took up his abode at rudder grange  we liked our boarder very much but he had some peculiarities i suppose everybody has them among other things he was very fond of telling us what we ought to do he suggested more improvements in the first three days of his sojourn with us than i had thought of since we commenced housekeeping and what made the matter worse his suggestions were generally very good ones had it been otherwise i might have borne his remarks more complacently but to be continually told what you ought to do and to know that you ought to do it is extremely annoying  he was very anxious that i should take off the rudder which was certainly useless to a boat situated as ours was and make an ironingtable of it i persisted that the laws of symmetrical propriety required that the rudder should remain where it wasthat the very name of our home would be interfered with by its removal but he insisted that ironingtable grange would be just as good a name and that symmetrical propriety in such a case did not amount to a row of pins  the result was that we did have the ironingtable and that euphemia was very much pleased with it a great many other improvements were projected and carried out by him and i was very much worried he made a flowergarden for euphemia on the extreme forwarddeck and having borrowed a wheelbarrow he wheeled dozens of loads of arable dirt up our gangplank and dumped them out on the deck when he had covered the garden with a suitable depth of earth he smoothed it off and then planted flowerseeds it was rather late in the season but most of them came up i was pleased with the garden but sorry i had not made it myself  one afternoon i got away from the office considerably earlier than usual and i hurried home to enjoy the short period of daylight that i should have before supper it had been raining the day before and as the bottom of our garden leaked so that earthy water trickled down at one end of our bedroom i intended to devote a short time to stuffing up the cracks in the ceiling or bottom of the deckwhichever seems the most appropriate  but when i reached a bend in the river road whence i always had the earliest view of my establishment i did not have that view i hurried on the nearer i approached the place where i lived the more horrorstricken i became there was no mistaking the fact  the boat was not there  in an instant the truth flashed upon me  the water was very highthe rain had swollen the rivermy house had floated away  it was wednesday on wednesday afternoons our boarder came home early  i clapped my hat tightly on my head and ground my teeth  confound that boarder i thought he has been fooling with the anchor he always said it was of no use and taking advantage of my absence he has hauled it up and has floated away and has gonegone with my wife and my home  euphemia and rudder grange had gone off togetherwhere i knew notand with them that horrible suggester  i ran wildly along the bank i called aloud i shouted and hailed each passing craftof which there were only twobut their crews must have been very inattentive to the woes of landsmen or else they did not hear me for they paid no attention to my cries  i met a fellow with an axe on his shoulder i shouted to him before i reached him  hello did you see a boata house i meanfloating up the river  a boathouse asked the man  no a houseboat i gasped  didnt see nuthin like it said the man and he passed on to his wife and home no doubt but me oh where was my wife and my home  i met several people but none of them had seen a fugitive canalboat  how many thoughts came into my brain as i ran along that river road if that wretched boarder had not taken the rudder for an ironing table he might have steered in shore again and again i confoundedas far as mental ejaculations could do ithis suggestions  i was rapidly becoming frantic when i met a person who hailed me  hello he said are you after a canalboat adrift  yes i panted  i thought you was he said you looked that way well i can tell you where she is shes stuck fast in the reeds at the lower end o peters pint  wheres that said i  oh its about a mile furder up i seed her adriftin up with the tidebig flood tide todayand i thought id see somebody after her afore long anything aboard  anything  i could not answer the man anything indeed i hurried on up the river without a word was the boat a wreck i scarcely dared to think of it i scarcely dared to think at all  the man called after me and i stopped i could but stop no matter what i might hear  hello mister he said got any tobacco  i walked up to him i took hold of him by the lapel of his coat it was a dirty lapel as i remember even now but i didnt mind that  look here said i tell me the truth i can bear it was that vessel wrecked  the man looked at me a little queerly i could not exactly interpret his expression  youre sure you kin bear it said he  yes said i my hand trembling as i held his coat  well then said he its morn i kin and he jerked his coat out of my hand and sprang away when he reached the other side of the road he turned and shouted at me as though i had been deaf  do you know what i think he yelled i think youre a darned lunatic and with that he went his way  i hastened on to peters point long before i reached it i saw the boat  it was apparently deserted but still i pressed on i must know the worst when i reached the point i found that the boat had run aground with her head in among the long reeds and mud and the rest of her hull lying at an angle from the shore  there was consequently no way for me to get on board but to wade through the mud and reeds to her bow and then climb up as well as i could  this i did but it was not easy to do twice i sank above my knees in mud and water and had it not been for reeds masses of which i frequently clutched when i thought i was going over i believe i should have fallen down and come to my death in that horrible marsh when i reached the boat i stood up to my hips in water and saw no way of climbing up the gangplank had undoubtedly floated away and if it had not it would have been of no use to me in my position  but i was desperate i clasped the post that they put in the bow of canalboats i stuck my toes and my fingernails in the cracks between the boardshow glad i was that the boat was an old one and had cracksand so painfully and slowly slipping part way down once or twice and besliming myself from chin to foot i climbed up that post and scrambled upon deck in an instant i reached the top of the stairs and in another instant i rushed below  there sat my wife and our boarder one on each side of the diningroom table complacently playing checkers  my sudden entrance startled them my appearance startled them still more  euphemia sprang to her feet and tottered toward me  mercy she exclaimed has anything happened  happened i gasped  look here cried the boarder clutching me by the arm what a condition youre in did you fall in  fall in said i  euphemia and the boarder looked at each other i looked at them then i opened my mouth in earnest  i suppose you dont know i yelled that you have drifted away  by george cried the boarder and in two bounds he was on deck  dirty as i was euphemia fell into my arms i told her all she hadnt known a bit of it  the boat had so gently drifted off and had so gently grounded among the reeds that the voyage had never so much as disturbed their games of checkers  he plays such a splendid game euphemia sobbed and just as you came i thought i was going to beat him i had two kings and two pieces on the next to last row and you are nearly drowned youll get your death of coldandand he had only one king  she led me away and i undressed and washed myself and put on my sunday clothes  when i reappeared i went out on deck with euphemia the boarder was there standing by the petunia bed his arms were folded and he was thinking profoundly as we approached he turned toward us  you were right about that anchor he said i should not have hauled it in but it was such a little anchor that i thought it would be of more use on board as a garden hoe  a very little anchor will sometimes do very well said i cuttingly when it is hooked around a tree  yes there is something in that said he  it was now growing late and as our agitation subsided we began to be hungry fortunately we had everything necessary on board and as it really didnt make any difference in our household economy where we happened to be located we had supper quite as usual in fact the kettle had been put on to boil during the checkerplaying  after supper we went on deck to smoke as was our custom but there was a certain coolness between me and our boarder  early the next morning i arose and went upstairs to consider what had better be done when i saw the boarder standing on shore near by  hello he cried the tides down and i got ashore without any trouble you stay where you are ive hired a couple of mules to tow the boat back theyll be here when the tide rises and hello ive found the gangplank it floated ashore about a quarter of a mile below here  in the course of the afternoon the mules and two men with a long rope appeared and we were then towed back to where we belonged  and we are there yet our boarder remains with us as the weather is still fine and the coolness between us is gradually diminishing but the boat is moored at both ends and twice a day i look to see if the ropes are all right  the petunias are growing beautifully but the geraniums do not seem to flourish perhaps there is not a sufficient depth of earth for them several times our boarder has appeared to be on the point of suggesting something in regard to them but for some reason or other he says nothing    chapter iii treating of a novel style of girl   one afternoon as i was hurrying down broadway to catch the five oclock train i met waterford he is an old friend of mine and i used to like him pretty well  hello said he where are you going  home i answered  is that so said he i didnt know you had one  i was a little nettled at this and so i said somewhat brusquely perhaps  but you must have known i lived somewhere  oh yes but i thought you boarded said he i had no idea that you had a home  but i have one and a very pleasant home too you must excuse me for not stopping longer as i must catch my train  oh ill walk along with you said waterford and so we went down the street together  where is your little house he asked  why in the world he thought it was a little house i could not at the time imagine unless he supposed that two people would not require a large one but i know now that he lived in a very little house himself  but it was of no use getting angry with waterford especially as i saw he intended walking all the way down to the ferry with me so i told him i didnt live in any house at all  why where do you live he exclaimed stopping short  i live in a boat said i  a boat a sort of rob roy arrangement i suppose well i would not have thought that of you and your wife i suppose has gone home to her people  she has done nothing of the kind i answered she lives with me and she likes it very much we are extremely comfortable and our boat is not a canoe or any such nonsensical affair it is a large commodious canalboat  waterford turned around and looked at me  are you a deckhand he asked  deckgrandmother i exclaimed  well you neednt get mad about it he said i didnt mean to hurt your feelings but i couldnt see what else you could be on a canalboat i dont suppose for instance that youre captain  but i am said i  look here said waterford this is coming it rather strong isnt it  as i saw he was getting angry i told him all about ittold him how we had hired a stranded canalboat and had fitted it up as a house and how we lived so cosily in it and had called it rudder grange and how we had taken a boarder  well said he this is certainly surprising im coming out to see you some day it will be better than going to barnums  i told himit is the way of societythat we would be glad to see him and we parted waterford never did come to see us and i merely mention this incident to show how some of our friends talked about rudder grange when they first heard that we lived there  after dinner that evening when i went up on deck with euphemia to have my smoke we saw the boarder sitting on the bulwarks near the garden with his legs dangling down outside  look here said he  i looked but there was nothing unusual to see  what is it i asked  he turned around and seeing euphemia said  nothing  it would be a very stupid person who could not take such a hint as that and so after a walk around the garden euphemia took occasion to go below to look at the kitchen fire  as soon as she had gone the boarder turned to me and said  ill tell you what it is shes working herself sick  sick said i nonsense  no nonsense about it he replied  the truth was that the boarder was right and i was wrong we had spent several months at rudder grange and during this time euphemia had been working very hard and she really did begin to look pale and thin indeed it would be very wearying for any woman of culture and refinement unused to housework to cook and care for two men and to do all the work of a canalboat besides  but i saw euphemia so constantly and thought so much of her and had her image so continually in my heart that i did not notice this until our boarder now called my attention to it i was sorry that he had to do it  if i were in your place said he i would get her a servant  if you were in my place i replied somewhat cuttingly you would probably suggest a lot of little things which would make everything very easy for her  id try to he answered without getting in the least angry  although i felt annoyed that he had suggested it still i made up my mind that euphemia must have a servant  she agreed quite readily when i proposed the plan and she urged me to go and see the carpenter that very day and get him to come and partition off a little room for the girl  it was some time of course before the room was made for who ever heard of a carpenter coming at the very time he was wanted and when it was finished euphemia occupied all her spare moments in getting it in nice order for the servant when she should come i thought she was taking too much trouble but she had her own ideas about such things  if a girl is lodged like a pig you must expect her to behave like a pig and i dont want that kind  so she put up pretty curtains at the girls window and with a box that she stood on end and some old muslin and a lot of tacks she made a toilettable so neat and convenient that i thought she ought to take it into our room and give the servant our washstand  but all this time we had no girl and as i had made up my mind about the matter i naturally grew impatient and at last i determined to go and get a girl myself  so one day at lunchtime i went to an intelligence office in the city there i found a large room on the second floor and some ladies and one or two men sitting about and a small room back of it crowded with girls from eighteen to sixtyeight years old there were also girls upon the stairs and girls in the hall below besides some girls standing on the sidewalk before the door  when i made known my business and had paid my fee one of the several proprietors who were wandering about the front room went into the back apartment and soon returned with a tall irishwoman with a bony weatherbeaten face and a large weatherbeaten shawl this woman was told to take a chair by my side down sat the huge creature and stared at me i did not feel very easy under her scrutinizing gaze but i bore it as best i could and immediately began to ask her all the appropriate questions that i could think of some she answered satisfactorily and some she didnt answer at all but as soon as i made a pause she began to put questions herself  how many servants do you kape she asked  i answered that we intended to get along with one and if she understood her business i thought she would find her work very easy and the place a good one  she turned sharp upon me and said  have ye stationary washtubs  i hesitated i knew our washtubs were not stationary for i had helped to carry them about but they might be screwed fast and made stationary if that was an important object but before making this answer i thought of the great conveniences for washing presented by our residence surrounded as it was at high tide by water  why we live in a stationary washtub i said smiling  the woman looked at me steadfastly for a minute and then she rose to her feet then she called out as if she were crying fish or strawberries  mrs blaine  the female keeper of the intelligence office and the male keeper and a thin clerk and all the women in the back room and all the patrons in the front room jumped up and gathered around us  astonished and somewhat disconcerted i rose to my feet and confronted the tall irishwoman and stood smiling in an uncertain sort of a way as if it were all very funny but i couldnt see the point i think i must have impressed the people with the idea that i wished i hadnt come  he says exclaimed the woman as if some other huckster were crying fish on the other side of the streethe says he lives in a washtoob  hes crazy ejaculated mrs blaine with an air that indicated policeman as plainly as if she had put her thought into words  a low murmur ran through the crowd of women while the thin clerk edged toward the door  i saw there was no time to lose i stepped back a little from the tall savage who was breathing like a hotair engine in front of me and made my explanations to the company i told the tale of rudder grange and showed them how it was like to a stationary washtubat certain stages of the tide  i was listened to with great attention when i had finished the tall woman turned around and faced the assemblage  an he wants a cook to make soup in a canalboat said she and off she marched into the backroom followed closely by all the other women  i dont think we have any one here who would suit you said mrs blaine  i didnt think so either what on earth would euphemia have done with that volcanic irishwoman in her little kitchen i took up my hat and bade mrs blaine good morning  good morning said she with a distressing smile  she had one of those mouths that look exactly like a gash in the face  i went home without a girl in a day or two euphemia came to town and got one apparently she got her without any trouble but i am not sure  she went to a homesaint somebodys homea place where they keep orphans to let so to speak here euphemia selected a lighthaired mediumsized orphan and brought her home  the girls name was pomona whether or not her parents gave her this name is doubtful at any rate she did not seem quite decided in her mind about it herself for she had not been with us more than two weeks before she expressed a desire to be called clare this longing of her heart however was denied her so euphemia who was always correct called her pomona i did the same whenever i could think not to say bolognawhich seemed to come very pat for some reason or other  as for the boarder he generally called her altoona connecting her in some way with the process of stopping for refreshments in which she was an adept  she was an earnest hearty girl she was always in a good humor and when i asked her to do anything she assented in a bright cheerful way and in a loud tone full of goodfellowship as though she would say  certainly my high old cock to be sure i will dont worry about itgive your mind no more uneasiness on that subject ill bring the hot water  she did not know very much but she was delighted to learn and she was very strong whatever euphemia told her to do she did instantly with a bang what pleased her better than anything else was to run up and down the gangplank carrying buckets of water to water the garden she delighted in outdoor work and sometimes dug so vigorously in our garden that she brought up pieces of the deckplanking with every shovelful  our boarder took the greatest interest in her and sometimes watched her movements so intently that he let his pipe go out  what a whacking girl that would be to tread out grapes in the vineyards of italy shed make wine cheap he once remarked  then im glad she isnt there said euphemia for wine oughtnt to be cheap  euphemia was a thorough little temperance woman  the one thing about pomona that troubled me more than anything else was her taste for literature it was not literature to which i objected but her very peculiar taste she would read in the kitchen every night after she had washed the dishes but if she had not read aloud it would not have made so much difference to me but i am naturally very sensitive to external impressions and i do not like the company of people who like our girl cannot read without pronouncing in a measured and distinct voice every word of what they are reading and when the matter thus read appeals to ones every sentiment of aversion and there is no way of escaping it the case is hard indeed  from the first i felt inclined to order pomona if she could not attain the power of silent perusal to cease from reading altogether but euphemia would not hear to this  poor thing said she it would be cruel to take from her her only recreation and she says she cant read any other way you neednt listen if you dont want to  that was all very well in an abstract point of view but the fact was that in practice the more i didnt want to listen the more i heard  as the evenings were often cool we sat in our diningroom and the partition between this room and the kitchen seemed to have no influence whatever in arresting sound so that when i was trying to read or to reflect it was by no means exhilarating to my mind to hear from the next room that  the la dy ce sel i a now si zed the weep on and all though the boor ly vil ly an re tain ed his vy gor ous hold she drew the blade through his fin gers and hoorl ed it far be hind her dryp ping with jore  this sort of thing kept up for an hour or so at a time used to drive me nearly wild but euphemia did not mind it i believe that she had so delicate a sense of what was proper that she did not hear pomonas private readings  on one occasion even euphemias influence could scarcely restrain me from violent interference  it was our boarders night out when he was detained in town by his business and pomona was sitting up to let him in this was necessary for our frontdoor or mainhatchway had no nightlatch but was fastened by means of a bolt euphemia and i used to sit up for him but that was earlier in the season when it was pleasant to be out on deck until quite a late hour but pomona never objected to sitting or getting up late and so we allowed this weekly duty to devolve on her  on this particular night i was very tired and sleepy and soon after i got into bed i dropped into a delightful slumber but it was not long before i was awakened by the fact that  sa rah did not fl inch but gras ped the heat ed i ron in her un in jur ed hand and when the ra bid an i mal a proach ed she thr ust the lur id po ker in his  my conscience said i to euphemia cant that girl be stopped  you wouldnt have her sit there and do nothing would you said she  no but she neednt read out that way  she cant read any other way said euphemia drowsily  yell af ter yell res oun ded as he wil dly spr rang  i cant stand that and i wont said i why dont she go into the kitchenthe diningrooms no place for her  she must not sit there said euphemia theres a windowpane out cant you cover up your head  i shall not be able to breathe if i do but i suppose thats no matter i replied  the reading continued  ha ha lord mar mont thun der ed thou too shalt suf fer all that this poor  i sprang out of bed  euphemia thought i was going for my pistol and she gave one bound and stuck her head out of the door  pomona fly she cried  yes smaam said pomona and she got up and flewnot very fast i imagine where she flew to i dont know but she took the lamp with her and i could hear distant syllables of agony and blood until the boarder came home and pomona went to bed  i think that this made an impression upon euphemia for although she did not speak to me upon the subject or any other that night the next time i heard pomona reading the words ran somewhat thus  the as ton ish ing che ap ness of land is ac count ed for by the want of home mar kets of good ro ads and che ap me ans of trans por ta ti on in ma ny sec ti ons of the state    chapter iv treating of a novel style of burglar   i have spoken of my pistol during the early part of our residence at rudder grange i never thought of such a thing as owning a pistol  but it was different now i kept a colts revolver loaded in the bureau drawer in our bedroom  the cause of this change was burglars not that any of these unpleasant persons had visited us but we much feared they would several houses in the vicinity had been entered during the past month and we could never tell when our turn would come  to be sure our boarder suggested that if we were to anchor out a little further at night no burglar would risk catching his death of cold by swimming out to us but euphemia having replied that it would be rather difficult to move a canalboat every night without paddlewheels or sails or mules especially if it were aground this plan was considered to be effectually disposed of  so we made up our minds that we must fasten up everything very securely and i bought a pistol and two burglaralarms one of these i affixed to the most exposed window and the other to the door which opened on the deck these alarms were very simple affairs but they were good enough when they were properly attached to a window or door and it was opened a little gong sounded like a violently deranged clock striking all the hours of the day at once  the window did not trouble us much but it was rather irksome to have to make the attachment to the door every night and to take it off every morning however as euphemia said it was better to take a little trouble than to have the house full of burglars which was true enough  we made all the necessary arrangements in case burglars should make an inroad upon us at the first sound of the alarm euphemia and the girl were to lie flat on the floor or get under their beds then the boarder and i were to stand up back to back each with pistol in hand and fire away revolving on a common centre the while in this way by aiming horizontally at about four feet from the floor we could rake the premises and run no risk of shooting each other or the women of the family  to be sure there were some slight objections to this plan the boarders room was at some distance from ours and he would probably not hear the alarm and the burglars might not be willing to wait while i went forward and roused him up and brought him to our part of the house but this was a minor difficulty i had no doubt but that if it should be necessary i could manage to get our boarder into position in plenty of time  it was not very long before there was an opportunity of testing the plan  about twelve oclock one night one of the alarms that on the kitchen window went off with a whirr and a wild succession of clangs for a moment i thought the morning train had arrived and then i woke up euphemia was already under the bed  i hurried on a few clothes and then i tried to find the bureau in the dark this was not easy as i lost my bearings entirely but i found it at last got the top drawer open and took out my pistol then i slipped out of the room hurried up the stairs opened the door setting off the alarm there by the way and ran along the deck there was a cold night wind and hastily descended the steep steps that led into the boarders room the door that was at the bottom of the steps was not fastened and as i opened it a little stray moonlight illumed the room i hastily stepped to the bed and shook the boarder by the shoulder he kept his pistol under his pillow  in an instant he was on his feet his hand grasped my throat and the cold muzzle of his derringer pistol was at my forehead it was an awfully big muzzle like the mouth of a bottle  i dont know when i lived so long as during the first minute that he held me thus  rascal he said do as much as breathe and ill pull the trigger  i didnt breathe  i had an accident insurance on my life would it hold good in a case like this or would euphemia have to go back to her father  he pushed me back into the little patch of moonlight  oh is it you he said relaxing his grasp what do you want a mustard plaster  he had a package of patent plasters in his room you took one and dipped it in hot water and it was all ready  no said i gasping a little burglars  oh he said and he put down his pistol and put on his clothes  come along he said and away we went over the deck  when we reached the stairs all was dark and quiet below  it was a matter of hesitancy as to going down  i started to go down first but the boarder held me back  let me go down he said  no said i my wife is there  thats the very reason you should not go he said she is safe enough yet and they would fire only at a man it would be a bad job for her if you were killed ill go down  so he went down slowly and cautiously his pistol in one hand and his life in the other as it were  when he reached the bottom of the steps i changed my mind i could not remain above while the burglar and euphemia were below so i followed  the boarder was standing in the middle of the diningroom into which the stairs led i could not see him but i put my hand against him as i was feeling my way across the floor  i whispered to him  shall we put our backs together and revolve and fire  no he whispered back not now he may be on a shelf by this time or under a table lets look him up  i confess that i was not very anxious to look him up but i followed the boarder as he slowly made his way toward the kitchen door as we opened the door we instinctively stopped  the window was open and by the light of the moon that shone in we saw the rascal standing on a chair leaning out of the window evidently just ready to escape fortunately we were unheard  lets pull him in whispered the boarder  no i whispered in reply we dont want him in lets hoist him out  all right returned the boarder  we laid our pistols on the floor and softly approached the window being barefooted out steps were noiseless  hoist when i count three breathed the boarder into my ear  we reached the chair each of us took hold of two of its legs  onetwothree said the boarder and together we gave a tremendous lift and shot the wretch out of the window  the tide was high and there was a good deal of water around the boat we heard a rousing splash outside  now there was no need of silence  shall we run on deck and shoot him as he swims i cried  no said the boarder well get the boathook and jab him if he tries to climb up  we rushed on deck i seized the boathook and looked over the side but i saw no one  hes gone to the bottom i exclaimed  he didnt go very far then said the boarder for its not more than two feet deep there  just then our attention was attracted by a voice from the shore  will you please let down the gangplank we looked ashore and there stood pomona dripping from every pore  we spoke no words but lowered the gangplank  she came aboard  good night said the boarder and he went to bed  pomona said i what have you been doing  i was a lookin at the moon sir when pop the chair bounced and out i went  you shouldnt do that i said sternly  some day youll be drowned take off your wet things and go to bed  yes smaamsir i mean said she as she went downstairs  when i reached my room i lighted the lamp and found euphemia still under the bed  is it all right she asked  yes i answered there was no burglar pomona fell out of the window  did you get her a plaster asked euphemia drowsily  no she did not need one shes all right now were you worried about me dear  no i trusted in you entirely and i think i dozed a little under the bed  in one minute she was asleep  the boarder and i did not make this matter a subject of conversation afterward but euphemia gave the girl a lecture on her careless ways and made her take several dovers powders the next day  an important fact in domestic economy was discovered about this time by euphemia and myself perhaps we were not the first to discover it but we certainly did find it outand this fact was that housekeeping costs money at the end of every week we counted up our expendituresit was no trouble at all to count up our receiptsand every week the result was more unsatisfactory  if we could only get rid of the disagreeable balance that has to be taken along all the time and which gets bigger and bigger like a snowball i think we would find the accounts more satisfactory said euphemia  this was on a saturday night we always got our pencils and paper and money at the end of the week  yes said i with an attempt to appear facetious and unconcerned but it would be all well enough if we could take that snowball to the fire and melt it down  but there never is any fire where there are snowballs said euphemia  no said i and thats just the trouble  it was on the following thursday when i came home in the evening that euphemia met me with a glowing face it rather surprised me to see her look so happy for she had been very quiet and preoccupied for the first part of the week so much so indeed that i had thought of ordering smaller roasts for a week or two and taking her to a thomas concert with the money saved but this evening she looked as if she did not need thomass orchestra  what makes you so bright my dear said i when i had greeted her has anything jolly happened  no said she nothing yet but i am going to make a fire to melt snowballs  of course i was very anxious to know how she was going to do it but she would not tell me it was a plan that she intended to keep to herself until she saw how it worked i did not press her because she had so few secrets and i did not hear anything about this plan until it had been carried out  her scheme was as follows after thinking over our financial condition and puzzling her brain to find out some way of bettering it she had come to the conclusion that she would make some money by her own exertions to help defray our household expenses she never had made any money but that was no reason why she should not begin it was too bad that i should have to toil and toil and not make nearly enough money after all so she would go to work and earn something with her own hands  she had heard of an establishment in the city where ladies of limited means or transiently impecunious could in a very quiet and private way get sewing to do they could thus provide for their needs without any one but the officers of the institution knowing anything about it  so euphemia went to this place and she got some work it was not a very large bundle but it was larger than she had been accustomed to carry and what was perfectly dreadful it was wrapped up in a newspaper when euphemia told me the story she said that this was too much for her courage she could not go on the cars and perhaps meet people belonging to our church with a newspaper bundle under her arm  but her genius for expedients saved her from this humiliation she had to purchase some sewingcotton and some other little things and when she had bought them she handed her bundle to the woman behind the counter and asked her if she would not be so good as to have that wrapped up with the other things it was a good deal to ask she knew and the woman smiled for the articles she had bought would not make a package as large as her hand however her request was complied with and she took away a very decent package with the card of the store stamped on the outside i suppose that there are not more than half a dozen people in this country who would refuse euphemia anything that she would be willing to ask for  so she took the work home and she labored faithfully at it for about a week she did not suppose it would take her so long but she was not used to such very plain sewing and was much afraid that she would not do it neatly enough besides this she could only work on it in the daytimewhen i was awayand was of course interrupted a great deal by her ordinary household duties and the necessity of a careful oversight of pomonas somewhat erratic methods of doing her work  but at last she finished the job and took it into the city she did not want to spend any more money on the trip than was absolutely necessary and so was very glad to find that she had a remnant of pocketmoney sufficient to pay her fare both ways  when she reached the city she walked up to the place where her work was to be delivered and found it much farther when she went on foot than it had seemed to her riding in the street cars she handed over her bundle to the proper person and as it was soon examined and approved she received her pay therefor  it amounted to sixty cents she had made no bargain but she was a little astonished however she said nothing but left the place without asking for any more work in fact she forgot all about it she had an idea that everything was all wrong and that idea engrossed her mind entirely there was no mistake about the sum paid for the lady clerk had referred to the printed table of prices when she calculated the amount due but something was wrong and at the moment euphemia could not tell what it was she left the place and started to walk back to the ferry but she was so tired and weak and hungryit was now an hour or two past her regular luncheon timethat she thought she should faint if she did not go somewhere and get some refreshments  so like a sensible little woman as she was she went into a restaurant she sat down at a table and a waiter came to her to see what she would have she was not accustomed to eatinghouses and perhaps this was the first time that she had ever visited one alone what she wanted was something simple so she ordered a cup of tea and some rolls and a piece of chicken the meal was a very good one and euphemia enjoyed it when she had finished she went up to the counter to settle her bill was sixty cents she paid the money that she had just received and walked down to the ferryall in a daze she said when she got home she thought it over and then she cried  after a while she dried her eyes and when i came home she told me all about it  i give it up she said i dont believe i can help you any  poor little thing i took her in my arms and comforted her and before bedtime i had convinced her that she was fully able to help me better than any one else on earth and that without puzzling her brains about business or wearing herself out by sewing for pay  so we went on in our old way and by keeping our attention on our weekly balance we prevented it from growing very rapidly  we fell back on our philosophy it was all the capital we had and became as calm and contented as circumstances allowed    chapter v pomona produces a partial revolution in rudder grange   euphemia began to take a great deal of comfort in her girl every evening she had some new instance to relate of pomonas inventive abilities and aptness in adapting herself to the peculiarities of our method of housekeeping  only to think said she one afternoon pomona has just done another very smart thing you know what a trouble it has always been for us to carry all our waste water upstairs and throw it over the bulwarks well she has remedied all that she has cut a nice little low window in the side of the kitchen and has made a shutter of the piece she cut out with leather hinges to it and now she can just open this window throw the water out shut it again and there it is i tell you shes smart  yes there is no doubt of that i said but i think that there is danger of her taking more interest in such extraordinary and novel duties than in the regular work of the house  now dont discourage the girl my dear she said for she is of the greatest use to me and i dont want you to be throwing cold water about like some people  not even if i throw it out of pomonas little door i suppose  no dont throw it at all encourage people what would the world be if everybody chilled our aspirations and extraordinary efforts like fultons steamboat  all right i said ill not discourage her  it was now getting late in the season it was quite too cool to sit out on deck in the evening and our garden began to look desolate  our boarder had wheeled up a lot of fresh earth and had prepared a large bed in which he had planted turnips they made an excellent fall crop he assured us  from being simply cool it began to be rainy and the weather grew decidedly unpleasant but our boarder bade us take courage this was probably the equinoctial and when it was over there would be a delightful indian summer and the turnips would grow nicely  this sounded very well but the wind blew up cold at night and there was a great deal of unpleasant rain  one night it blew what pomona called a whirlicane and we went to bed very early to keep warm we heard our boarder on deck in the garden after we were in bed and euphemia said she could not imagine what he was about unless he was anchoring his turnips to keep them from blowing away  during the night i had a dream i thought i was a boy again and was trying to stand upon my head a feat for which i had been famous but instead of throwing myself forward on my hands and then raising my heels backward over my head in the orthodox manner i was on my back and trying to get on my head from that position i awoke suddenly and found that the footboard of the bedstead was much higher than our heads we were lying on a very much inclined plane with our heads downward i roused euphemia and we both got out of bed when at almost the same moment we slipped down the floor into ever so much water  euphemia was scarcely awake and she fell down gurgling it was dark but i heard her fall and i jumped over the bedstead to her assistance i had scarcely raised her up when i heard a pounding at the front door or mainhatchway and our boarder shouted  get up come out of that open the door the old boats turning over  my heart fell within me but i clutched euphemia i said no word and she simply screamed i dragged her over the floor sometimes in the water and sometimes out of it i got the diningroom door open and set her on the stairs they were in a topsyturvy condition but they were dry i found a lantern which hung on a nail with a matchbox under it and i struck a light then i scrambled back and brought her some clothes  all this time the boarder was yelling and pounding at the door when euphemia was ready i opened the door and took her out  you go dress yourself said the boarder ill hold her here until you come back  i left her and found my clothes which chair and all had tumbled against the foot of the bed and so had not gone into the water and soon reappeared on deck the wind was blowing strongly but it did not now seem to be very cold the deck reminded me of the gangplank of a harlem steamboat at low tide it was inclined at an angle of more than fortyfive degrees i am sure there was light enough for us to see about us but the scene and all the dreadful circumstances made me feel the most intense desire to wake up and find it all a dream there was no doubt however about the boarder being wide awake  now then said he take hold of her on that side and well help her over here you scramble down on that side its all dry just there the boats turned over toward the water and ill lower her down to you ill let a rope over the sides you can hold on to that as you go down  i got over the bulwarks and let myself down to the ground then the boarder got euphemia up and slipped her over the side holding to her hands and letting her gently down until i could reach her she said never a word but screamed at times i carried her a little way up the shore and set her down i wanted to take her up to a house near by where we bought our milk but she declined to go until we had saved pomona  so i went back to the boat having carefully wrapped up euphemia to endeavor to save the girl i found that the boarder had so arranged the gangplank that it was possible without a very great exercise of agility to pass from the shore to the boat when i first saw him on reaching the shelving deck he was staggering up the stairs with a diningroom chair and a large framed engraving of raphaels dantean ugly picture but full of true feeling at least so euphemia always declared though i am not quite sure that i know what she meant  where is pomona i said endeavoring to stand on the hillside of the deck  i dont know said he but we must get the things out the tides rising and the winds getting up the boat will go over before we know it  but we must find the girl i said she cant be left to drown  i dont think it would matter much said he getting over the side of the boat with his awkward load she would be of about as much use drowned as any other way if it hadnt been for that hole she cut in the side of the boat this would never have happened  you dont think it was that i said holding the picture and the chair while he let himself down to the gangplank  yes it was he replied the tides very high and the water got over that hole and rushed in the water and the wind will finish this old craft before very long  and then he took his load from me and dashed down the gangplank i went below to look for pomona the lantern still hung on the nail and i took it down and went into the kitchen there was pomona dressed and with her hat on quietly packing some things in a basket  come hurry out of this i cried dont you know that this housethis boat i mean is a wreck  yes smaamsir i meani know it and i suppose we shall soon be at the mercy of the waves  well then go as quickly as you can what are you putting in that basket  food she said we may need it  i took her by the shoulder and hurried her on deck over the bulwark down the gangplank and so on to the place where i had left euphemia  i found the dear girl there quiet and collected all up in a little bunch to shield herself from the wind i wasted no time but hurried the two women over to the house of our milkmerchant there with some difficulty i roused the good woman and after seeing euphemia and pomona safely in the house i left them to tell the tale and ran back to the boat  the boarder was working like a trojan he had already a pile of our furniture on the beach  i set about helping him and for an hour we labored at this hasty and toilsome moving it was indeed a toilsome business the floors were shelving the stairs leaned over sideways ever so far and the gangplank was desperately short and steep  still we saved quite a number of household articles some things we broke and some we forgot and some things were too big to move in this way but we did very well considering the circumstances  the wind roared the tide rose and the boat groaned and creaked we were in the kitchen trying to take the stove apart the boarder was sure we could carry it up if we could get the pipe out and the legs and doors off when we heard a crash we rushed on deck and found that the garden had fallen in making our way as well as we could toward the gaping rent in the deck we saw that the turnipbed had gone down bodily into the boarders room he did not hesitate but scrambled down his narrow stairs i followed him he struck a match that he had in his pocket and lighted a little lantern that hung under the stairs his room was a perfect rubbish heap the floor bed chairs pitcher basineverything was covered or filled with garden mold and turnips never did i behold such a scene he stood in the midst of it holding his lantern high above his head at length he spoke  if we had time he said we might come down here and pick out a lot of turnips  but how about your furniture i exclaimed  oh thats ruined he replied  so we did not attempt to save any of it but we got hold of his trunk and carried that on shore  when we returned we found that the water was pouring through his partition making the room a lake of mud and as the water was rising rapidly below and the boat was keeling over more and more we thought it was time to leave and we left  it would not do to go far away from our possessions which were piled up in a sadlooking heap on the shore and so after i had gone over to the milkwomans to assure euphemia of our safety the boarder and i passed the rest of the nightthere was not much of it leftin walking up and down the beach smoking some cigars which he fortunately had in his pocket  in the morning i took euphemia to the hotel about a mile awayand arranged for the storage of our furniture there until we could find another habitation this habitation we determined was to be in a substantial house or part of a house which should not be affected by the tides  during the morning the removal of our effects was successfully accomplished and our boarder went to town to look for a furnished room he had nothing but his trunk to take to it  in the afternoon i left euphemia at the hotel where she was taking a nap she certainly needed it for she had spent the night in a wooden rockingchair at the milkwomans and i strolled down to the river to take a last look at the remains of old rudder grange  i felt sadly enough as i walked along the wellworn path to the canalboat and thought how it had been worn by my feet more than any others and how gladly i had walked that way so often during that delightful summer i forgot all that had been disagreeable and thought only of the happy times we had had  it was a beautiful autumn afternoon and the wind had entirely died away when i came within sight of our old home it presented a doleful appearance the bow had drifted out into the river and was almost entirely under water the stern stuck up in a mournful and ridiculous manner with its keel instead of its broadside presented to the view of persons on the shore as i neared the boat i heard a voice i stopped and listened there was no one in sight could the sounds come from the boat i concluded that it must be so and i walked up closer then i heard distinctly the words  he grasp ed her by the thro at and yell ed swear to me thou nev er wilt re veal my se cret or thy hot hearts blood shall stain this mar bel fib or she gave one gry vy ous gasp and  it was pomona  doubtless she had climbed up the stern of the boat and had descended into the depths of the wreck to rescue her beloved book the reading of which had so long been interrupted by my harsh decrees could i break in on this one hour of rapture i had not the heart to do it and as i slowly moved away there came to me the last words that i ever heard from rudder grange  and with one wild shry ik to heav en her hearts blo od spat ter ed that prynce ly home of woe    chapter vi the new rudder grange   i have before given an account of the difficulties we encountered when we started out househunting and it was this doleful experience which made euphemia declare that before we set out on a second search for a residence we should know exactly what we wanted  to do this we must know how other people live we must examine into the advantages and disadvantages of the various methods of housekeeping and make up our minds on the subject  when we came to this conclusion we were in a city boardinghouse and were entirely satisfied that this style of living did not suit us at all  at this juncture i received a letter from the gentleman who had boarded with us on the canalboat shortly after leaving us the previous fall he had married a widow lady with two children and was now keeping house in a french flat in the upper part of the city we had called upon the happy couple soon after their marriage and the letter now received contained an invitation for us to come and dine and spend the night  well go said euphemia theres nothing i want so much as to see how people keep house in a french flat perhaps well like it and i must see those children so we went  the house as euphemia remarked was anything but flat it was very tall indeedthe tallest house in the neighborhood we entered the vestibule the outer door being open and beheld on one side of us a row of bellhandles above each of these handles was the mouth of a speakingtube and above each of these a little glazed frame containing a visitingcard  isnt this cute said euphemia reading over the cards heres his name and this is his bell and tube which would you do first ring or blow  my dear said i you dont blow up those tubes we must ring the bell just as if it were an ordinary frontdoor bell and instead of coming to the door some one will call down the tube to us  i rang the bell under the boarders name and very soon a voice at the tube said  well  then i told our names and in an instant the front door opened  why their flat must be right here whispered euphemia how quickly the girl came  and she looked for the girl as we entered but there was no one there  their flat is on the fifth story said i he mentioned that in his letter we had better shut the door and go up  up and up the softly carpeted stairs we climbed and not a soul we saw or heard  it is like an enchanted cavern said euphemia you say the magic word the door in the rock opens and you go on and on through the vaulted passages  until you come to the ogre said the boarder who was standing at the top of the stairs he did not behave at all like an ogre for he was very glad to see us and so was his wife after we had settled down in the parlor and the boarders wife had gone to see about something concerning the dinner euphemia asked after the children  i hope they havent gone to bed she said for i do so want to see the dear little things  the exboarder as euphemia called him smiled grimly  theyre not so very little he said my wifes son is nearly grown he is at an academy in connecticut and he expects to go into a civil engineers office in the spring his sister is older than he is my wife marriedin the first instancewhen she was very youngvery young in deed  oh said euphemia and then after a pause and neither of them is at home now  no said the exboarder by the way what do you think of this dado it is a portable one i devised it myself you can take it away with you to another house when you move but there is the dinnerbell ill show you over the establishment after we have had something to eat  after our meal we made a tour of inspection the flat which included the whole floor contained nine or ten rooms of all shapes and sizes the corners in some of the rooms were cut off and shaped up into closets and recesses so that euphemia said the corners of every room were in some other room  near the back of the flat was a dumbwaiter with bells and speakingtubes when the butcher the baker or the kerosenelamp maker came each morning he rang the bell and called up the tube to know what was wanted the order was called down and he brought the things in the afternoon  all this greatly charmed euphemia it was so cute so complete there were no interviews with disagreeable tradespeople none of the ordinary annoyances of housekeeping everything seemed to be done with a bell a speakingtube or a crank  indeed said the exboarder if it were not for people tripping over the wires i could rig up attachments by which i could sit in the parlor and by using pedals and a keyboard i could do all the work of this house without getting out of my easychair  one of the most peculiar features of the establishment was the servants room this was at the rear end of the floor and as there was not much space left after the other rooms had been made it was very small so small indeed that it would accommodate only a very short bedstead this made it necessary for our friends to consider the size of the servant when they engaged her  there were several excellent girls at the intelligence office where i called said the exboarder but i measured them and they were all too tall so we had to take a short one who is only so so there was one big scotch girl who was the very person for us and i would have taken her if my wife had not objected to my plan for her accommodation  what was that i asked  well said he i first thought of cutting a hole in the partition wall at the foot of the bed for her to put her feet through  never said his wife emphatically i would never have allowed that  and then continued he i thought of turning the bed around and cutting a larger hole through which she might have put her head into the little room on this side a low table could have stood under the hole and her head might have rested on a cushion on the table very comfortably  my dear said his wife it would have frightened me to death to go into that room and see that head on a cushion on a table  like john the baptist interrupted euphemia  well said our exboarder the plan would have had its advantages  oh cried euphemia looking out of a back window what a lovely little iron balcony do you sit out there on warm evenings  thats a fireescape said the exboarder we dont go out there unless it is very hot indeed on account of the house being on fire you see there is a little door in the floor of the balcony and an iron ladder leading to the balcony beneath and so on down to the first story  and you have to creep through that hole and go down that dreadful steep ladder every time there is a fire said euphemia  well i guess we would never go down but once he answered  no indeed said euphemia youd fall down and break your neck the first time and she turned away from the window with a very grave expression on her face  soon after this our hostess conducted euphemia to the guestchamber while her husband and i finished a bedtime cigar  when i joined euphemia in her room she met me with a mysterious expression on her face she shut the door and then said in a very earnest tone  do you see that little bedstead in the corner i did not notice it until i came in just now and then being quite astonished i said why heres a childs bed who sleeps here oh says she thats our little adeles bedstead we have it in our room when shes here little adele said i i didnt know she was littlenot small enough for that bed at any rate why yes said she adele is only four years old the bedstead is quite large enough for her and she is not here now i said utterly amazed at all this no she answered she is not here now but we try to have her with us as much as we can and always keep her little bed ready for her i suppose shes with her fathers people i said and she answered oh yes and bade me goodnight what does all this mean our boarder told us that the daughter is grown up and here his wife declares that she is only four years old i dont know what in the world to make of this mystery  i could give euphemia no clue i supposed there was some mistake and that was all i could say except that i was sleepy and that we could find out all about it in the morning but euphemia could not dismiss the subject from her mind she said no morebut i could seeuntil i fell asleepthat she was thinking about it  it must have been about the middle of the night perhaps later when i was suddenly awakened by euphemia starting up in the bed with the exclamation  i have it  what i cried sitting up in a great hurry what is it what have you got whats the matter  i know it she said i know it our boarder is a grandfather little adele is the grownup daughters child he was quite particular to say that his wife married very young just to think of it so short a time ago he was living with usa bachelorand now in four short months he is a grandfather  carefully propounded inquiries in the morning proved euphemias conclusions to be correct  the next evening when we were quietly sitting in our own room euphemia remarked that she did not wish to have anything to do with french flats  they seem to be very convenient i said  oh yes convenient enough but i dont like them i would hate to live where everything let down like a tablelid or else turned with a crank and when i think of those fireescapes and the boarders grandchild it makes me feel very unpleasantly  but the grandchild dont follow as a matter of course said i  no she answered but i shall never like french flats  and we discussed them no more  for some weeks we examined into every style of economic and respectable housekeeping and many methods of living in what euphemia called imitation comfort were set aside as unworthy of consideration  my dear said euphemia one evening what we really ought to do is to build then we would have exactly the house we want  very true i replied but to build a house a man must have money  oh no said she or at least not much for one thing you might join a building association in some of those societies i know that you only have to pay a dollar a week  but do you suppose the association builds houses for all its members i asked  of course i suppose so else why is it called a building association  i had read a good deal about these organizations and i explained to euphemia that a dollar a week was never received by any of them in payment for a new house  then build yourself she said i know how that can be done  oh its easy enough i remarked if you have the money  no you neednt have any money said euphemia rather hastily just let me show you supposing for instance that you want to build a house worthwell say twenty thousand dollars in some pretty town near the city  i would rather figure on a cheaper house than that for a country place i interrupted  well then say two thousand dollars you get masons and carpenters and people to dig the cellar and you engage them to build your house you neednt pay them until its done of course then when its all finished borrow two thousand dollars and give the house as security after that you see you have only to pay the interest on the borrowed money when you save enough money to pay back the loan the house is your own now isnt that a good plan  yes said i if there could be found people who would build your house and wait for their money until some one would lend you its full value on a mortgage  well said euphemia i guess they could be found if you would only look for them  ill look for them when i go to heaven i said  we gave up for the present the idea of building or buying a house and determined to rent a small place in the country and then as euphemia wisely said if we liked it we might buy it after she had dropped her building projects she thought that one ought to know just how a house would suit before having it on ones hands  we could afford something better than a canalboat now and therefore we were not so restricted as in our first search for a house but the one thing which troubled my wifeand indeed caused me much anxious thought was that scourge of almost all rural localitiestramps it would be necessary for me to be away all dayand we could not afford to keep a manso we must be careful to get a house somewhere off the line of ordinary travel or else in a wellsettled neighborhood where there would be some one near at hand in case of unruly visitors  a village i dont like said euphemia there is always so much gossip and people know all about what you have and what you do and yet it would be very lonely and perhaps dangerous for us to live off somewhere all by ourselves and there is another objection to a village we dont want a house with a small yard and a garden at the back we ought to have a dear little farm with some fields for corn and a cow and a barn and things of that sort all that would be lovely ill tell you what we want she cried seized with a sudden inspiration we ought to try to get the endhouse of a village then our house could be near the neighbors and our farm could stretch out a little way into the country beyond us let us fix our minds upon such a house and i believe we can get it  so we fixed our minds but in the course of a week or two we unfixed them several times to allow the consideration of places which otherwise would have been out of range and during one of these intervals of mental disfixment we took a house  it was not the endhouse of a village but it was in the outskirts of a very small rural settlement our nearest neighbor was within vigorous shouting distance and the house suited us so well in other respects that we concluded that this would do the house was small but large enough there were some trees around it and a little lawn in front there was a garden a small barn and stable a pasture field and land enough besides for small patches of corn and potatoes the rent was low the water good and no one can imagine how delighted we were  we did not furnish the whole house at first but what mattered it we had no horse or cow but the pasture and barn were ready for them we did not propose to begin with everything at once  our first evening in that house was made up of hours of unalloyed bliss we walked from room to room we looked out on the garden and the lawn we sat on the little porch while i smoked  we were happy at rudder grange said euphemia but that was only a canalboat and could not in the nature of things have been a permanent home  no said i it could not have been permanent but in many respects it was a delightful home the very name of it brings pleasant thoughts  it was a nice name said euphemia and ill tell you what we might do let us call this place rudder grangethe new rudder grange the name will do just as well for a house as for a boat  i agreed on the spot and the house was christened  our household was small we had a servanta german woman and we had ourselves that was all  i did not do much in the garden it was too late in the season the former occupant had planted some corn and potatoes with a few other vegetables and these i weeded and hoed working early in the morning and when i came home in the afternoon euphemia tied up the rosevines trimmed the bushes and with a little rake and hoe she prepared a flowerbed in front of the parlorwindow this exercise gave us splendid appetites and we loved our new home more and more  our german girl did not suit us exactly at first and day by day she grew to suit us less she was a quiet kindly pleasant creature and delighted in an outofdoor life she was as willing to weed in the garden as she was to cook or wash at first i was very much pleased with this because as i remarked to euphemia you can find very few girls who would be willing to work in the garden and she might be made very useful  but after a time euphemia began to get a little out of patience with her she worked outofdoors entirely too much and what she did there as well as some of her work in the house was very much like certain german literatureyou did not know how it was done or what it was for  one afternoon i found euphemia quite annoyed  look here she said and see what that girl has been at work at nearly all this afternoon i was upstairs sewing and thought she was ironing isnt it too provoking  it was provoking the contemplative german had collected a lot of short hamboneswhere she found them i cannot imagineand had made of them a border around my wifes flowerbed the bones stuck up straight a few inches above the ground all along the edge of the bed and the marrow cavity of each one was filled with earth in which she had planted seeds  these she says will spring up and look beautiful said euphemia they have that style of thing in her country  then let her take them off with her to her country i exclaimed  no no said euphemia hurriedly dont kick them out it would only wound her feelings she did it all for the best and thought it would please me to have such a border around my bed but she is too independent and neglects her proper work i will give her a weeks notice and get another servant when she goes we can take these horrid bones away but i hope nobody will call on us in the meantime  must we keep these things here a whole week i asked  oh i cant turn her away without giving her a fair notice that would be cruel  i saw the truth of the remark and determined to bear with the bones and her rather than be unkind  that night euphemia informed the girl of her decision and the next morning soon after i had left the good german appeared with her bonnet on and her carpetbag in her hand to take leave of her mistress  what cried euphemia you are not going today  if it is goot to go at all it is goot to go now said the girl  and you will go off and leave me without any one in the house after my putting myself out to give you a fair notice its shameful  i think it is very goot for me to go now quietly replied the girl this house is very loneful i will go tomorrow in the city to see your husband for my money goot morning and off she trudged to the station  before i reached the house that afternoon euphemia rushed out to tell this story i would not like to say how far i kicked those hambones  this german girl had several successors and some of them suited as badly and left as abruptly as herself but euphemia never forgot the ungrateful stab given her by this hambone girl as she always called her it was her first wound of the kind and it came in the very beginning of the campaign when she was all unused to this domestic warfare    chapter vii treating of an unsuccessful broker and a dog   it was a couple of weeks or thereabouts after this episode that euphemia came down to the gate to meet me on my return from the city i noticed a very peculiar expression on her face she looked both thoughtful and pleased almost the first words she said to me were these  a tramp came here today  i am sorry to hear that i exclaimed thats the worst news i have had yet i did hope that we were far enough from the line of travel to escape these scourges how did you get rid of him was he impertinent  you must not feel that way about all tramps said she sometimes they are deserving of our charity and ought to be helped there is a great difference in them  that may be i said but what of this one when was he here and when did he go  he did not go at all he is here now  here now i cried where is he  do not call out so loud said euphemia putting her hand on my arm you will waken him he is asleep  asleep said i a tramp here  yes stop let me tell you about him he told me his story and it is a sad one he is a middleaged manfifty perhapsand has been rich he was once a broker in wall street but lost money by the failure of various railroadsthe camden and amboy for one  that hasnt failed i interrupted  well then it was the northern pacific or some other one of themat any rate i know it was either a railroad or a bankand he soon became very poor he has a son in cincinnati who is a successful merchant and lives in a fine house with horses and carriages and all that and this poor man has written to his son but has never had any answer so now he is going to walk to cincinnati to see him he knows he will not be turned away if he can once meet his son face to face he was very tired when he stopped hereand he has ever and ever so far to walk yet you knowand so after i had given him something to eat i let him lie down in the outer kitchen on that roll of ragcarpet that is there i spread it out for him it is a hard bed for one who has known comfort but he seems to sleep soundly  let me see him said i and i walked back to the outer kitchen  there lay the unsuccessful broker fast asleep his face which was turned toward me as i entered showed that it had been many days since he had been shaved and his hair had apparently been uncombed for about the same length of time his clothes were very old and a good deal torn and he wore one boot and one shoe  whew said i have you been giving him whisky  no whispered euphemia of course not i noticed that smell and he said he had been cleaning his clothes with alcohol  they needed it im sure i remarked as i turned away and now said i wheres the girl  this is her afternoon out what is the matter you look frightened  oh im not frightened but i find i must go down to the station again just run up and put on your bonnet it will be a nice little walk for you  i had been rapidly revolving the matter in my mind what was i to do with this wretch who was now asleep in my outer kitchen if i woke him up and drove him offand i might have difficulty in doing itthere was every reason to believe that he would not go far but return at night and commit some revengeful act i never saw a more sinisterlooking fellow and he was certainly drunk he must not be allowed to wander about our neighborhood i would go for the constable and have him arrested  so i locked the door from the kitchen into the house and then the outside door of the kitchen and when my wife came down we hurried off on the way i told her what i intended to do and what i thought of our guest she answered scarcely a word and i hoped that she was frightened i think she was  the constable who was also coroner of our township had gone to a creek three miles away to hold an inquest and there was nobody to arrest the man the nearest policestation was at hackingford six miles away on the railroad i held a consultation with the stationmaster and the gentleman who kept the grocerystore opposite  they could think of nothing to be done except to shoot the man and to that i objected  however said i he cant stay there and a happy thought just then striking me i called to the boy who drove the village expresswagon and engaged him for a job the wagon was standing at the station and to save time i got in and rode to my house euphemia went over to call on the grocerymans wife until i returned  i had determined that the man should be taken away although until i was riding home i had not made up my mind where to have him taken but on the road i settled this matter  on reaching the house we drove into the yard as close to the kitchen as we could go then i unlocked the door and the boywho was a big strapping fellowentered with me we found the exbroker still wrapped in the soundest slumber leaving the boy to watch him i went upstairs and got a baggagetag which i directed to the chief of police at the police station in hackingford i returned to the kitchen and fastened this tag conspicuously on the lapel of the sleepers coat then with a clothesline i tied him up carefully hand and foot to all this he offered not the slightest opposition when he was suitably packed with due regard to the probable tenderness of wrist and ankle in one brought up in luxury the boy and i carried him to the wagon  he was a heavy load and we may have bumped him a little but his sleep was not disturbed then we drove him to the express office this was at the railroad station and the stationmaster was also express agent at first he was not inclined to receive my parcel but when i assured him that all sorts of live things were sent by express and that i could see no reason for making an exception in this case he added my arguments to his own disposition as a householder to see the goods forwarded to their destination and so gave me a receipt and pasted a label on the exbrokers shoulder i set no value on the package which i prepaid  now then said the stationmaster hell go all right if the express agent on the train will take him  this matter was soon settled for in a few minutes the train stopped at the station my package was wheeled to the express car and two porters who entered heartily into the spirit of the thing hoisted it into the car the trainagent who just then noticed the character of the goods began to declare that he would not have the fellow in his car but my friend the stationmaster shouted out that everything was all rightthe man was properly packed invoiced and paid for and the train which was behind time moved away before the irate agent could take measures to get rid of his unwelcome freight  now said i therell be a drunken man at the policestation in hackingford in about halfanhour his offense will be as evident there as here and they can do what they please with him i shall telegraph to explain the matter and prepare them for his arrival  when i had done this euphemia and i went home the tramp had cost me some money but i was well satisfied with my evenings work and felt that the township owed me at least a vote of thanks  but i firmly made up my mind that euphemia should never again be left unprotected i would not even trust to a servant who would agree to have no afternoons out i would get a dog  the next day i advertised for a fierce watchdog and in the course of a week i got one before i procured him i examined into the merits and price of about one hundred dogs my dog was named pete but i determined to make a change in that respect he was a very tall bony powerful beast of a dull black color and with a lower jaw that would crack the hindleg of an ox so i was informed he was of a varied breed and the good irishman of whom i bought him said he had fine blood in him and attempted to refer him back to the different classes of dogs from which he had been derived but after i had had him awhile i made an analysis based on his appearance and character and concluded that he was mainly bloodhound shaded with wolfdog and mastiff and picked out with touches of bulldog  the man brought him home for me and chained him up in an unused woodshed for i had no doghouse as yet  now thin said he all youve got to do is to keep im chained up there for three or four days till he gets used to ye an ill tell ye the best way to make a dog like ye jist give him a good lickin then hell know yer his master and hell like ye iver aftherward theres plenty of people that dont know that and by the way sir that chains none too strong for im i got it when he wasnt morn half grown yed bether git him a new one  when the man had gone i stood and looked at the dog and could not help hoping that he would learn to like me without the intervention of a thrashing such harsh methods were not always necessary i felt sure  after our evening meala combination of dinner and supper of which euphemia used to say that she did not know whether to call it dinper or supnerwe went out together to look at our new guardian  euphemia was charmed with him  how massive she exclaimed what splendid limbs and look at that immense head i know i shall never be afraid now i feel that that is a dog i can rely upon make him stand up please so i can see how tall he is  i think it would be better not to disturb him i answered he may be tired he will get up of his own accord very soon and indeed i hope that he will not get up until i go to the store and get him a new chain  as i said this i made a step forward to look at his chain and at that instant a low growl like the first rumblings of an earthquake ran through the dog  i stepped back again and walked over to the village for the chain the dogchains shown me at the store all seemed too short and too weak and i concluded to buy two chains such as used for hitching horses and to join them so as to make a long as well as a strong one of them i wanted him to be able to come out of the woodshed when it should be necessary to show himself  on my way home with my purchase the thought suddenly struck me how will you put that chain on your dog the memory of the rumbling growl was still vivid  i never put the chain on him as i approached him with it in my hand he rose to his feet his eyes sparkled his black lips drew back from his mighty teeth he gave one savage bark and sprang at me  his chain held and i went into the house that night he broke loose and went home to his master who lived fully ten miles away  when i found in the morning that he was gone i was in doubt whether it would be better to go and look for him or not but i concluded to keep up a brave heart and found him as i expected at the place where i had bought him the irishman took him to my house again and i had to pay for the mans loss of time as well as for his fare on the railroad but the dogs old master chained him up with the new chain and i felt repaid for my outlay  every morning and night i fed that dog and i spoke as kindly and gently to him as i knew how but he seemed to cherish a distaste for me and always greeted me with a growl he was an awful dog  about a week after the arrival of this animal i was astonished and frightened on nearing the house to hear a scream from my wife i rushed into the yard and was greeted with a succession of screams from two voices that seemed to come from the vicinity of the woodshed hurrying thither i perceived euphemia standing on the roof of the shed in perilous proximity to the edge while near the ridge of the roof sat our hired girl with her handkerchief over her head  hurry hurry cried euphemia climb up here the dog is loose be quick be quick oh hes coming hes coming  i asked for no explanation there was a railfence by the side of the shed and i sprang on this and was on the roof just as the dog came bounding and barking from the barn  instantly euphemia had me in her arms and we came very near going off the roof together  i never feared to have you come home before she sobbed i thought he would tear you limb from limb  but how did all this happen said i  och i kin hardly remember said the girl from under her handkerchief  well i didnt ask you i said somewhat too sharply  oh ill tell you said euphemia there was a man at the gate and he looked suspicious and didnt try to come in and mary was at the barn looking for an egg and i thought this was a good time to see whether the dog was a good watchdog or not so i went and unchained him  did you unchain that dog i cried  yes and the minute he was loose he made a rush at the gate but the man was gone before he got there and as he ran down the road i saw that he was mr hendersons man who was coming here on an errand i expect and then i went down to the barn to get mary to come and help me chain up the dog and when she came out he began to chase me and then her and we were so frightened that we climbed up here and i dont know im sure how i ever got up that fence and do you think he can climb up here  oh no my dear i said  an hes just the beast to go afther a stipladder said the girl in muffled tones  and what are we to do asked euphemia we cant eat and sleep up here dont you think that if we were all to shout out together we could make some neighbor hear  oh yes i said there is no doubt of it but then if a neighbor came the dog would fall on him  and tear him limb from limb interrupted euphemia  yes and besides my dear i should hate to have any of the neighbors come and find us all up here it would look so utterly absurd let me try and think of some other plan  well please be as quick as you can its dreadful to bewhos that  i looked up and saw a female figure just entering the yard  oh what shall we do exclaimed euphemia the dog will get her call to her  no no said i dont make a noise it will only bring the dog he seems to have gone to the barn or somewhere keep perfectly quiet and she may go up on the porch and as the front door is not locked she may rush into the house if she sees him coming  i do hope she will do that said euphemia anxiously  and yet said i its not pleasant to have strangers going into the house when theres no one there  but its better than seeing a stranger torn to pieces before your eyes said euphemia  yes i replied it is dont you think we might get down now the dog isnt here  no no cried euphemia there he is now coming this way and look at that woman she is coming right to this shed  sure enough our visitor had passed by the front door and was walking toward us evidently she had heard our voices  dont come here cried euphemia youll be killed run run the dog is coming why mercy on us its pomona    chapter viii pomona once more   sure enough it was pomona there stood our old servantgirl of the canalboat with a crooked straw bonnet on her head a faded yellow parasol in her hand a parcel done up in newspaper under her arm and an expression of astonishment on her face  well truly she ejaculated  into the house quick i said we have a savage dog  and here he is cried euphemia oh she will be torn to atoms  straight at pomona came the great black beast barking furiously but the girl did not move she did not even turn her head to look at the dog who stopped before he reached her and began to rush wildly around her barking terribly  we held our breath i tried to say get out or lie down but my tongue could not form the words  cant you get up here gasped euphemia  i dont want to said the girl  the dog now stopped barking and stood looking at pomona occasionally glancing up at us pomona took not the slightest notice of him  do you know maam said she to euphemia that if i had come here yesterday that dog would have had my lifes blood  and why dont he have it today said euphemia who with myself was utterly amazed at the behavior of the dog  because i know more today than i did yesterday answered pomona it is only this afternoon that i read something as i was coming here on the cars this is it she continued unwrapping her paper parcel and taking from it one of the two books it contained i finished this part just as the cars stopped and i put my scissors in the place ill read it to you  standing there with one book still under her arm the newspaper half unwrapped from it hanging down and flapping in the breeze she opened the other volume at the scissorsplace turned back a page or two and began to read as follows   lord edward slowly santered up the broad ancestral walk when suddenly from out a copse there sprang a furious hound the marshman concealed in a tree expected to see the lifes blood of the young nobleman stain the path but no lord edward did not stop nor turn his head with a smile he strode steadily on well he knew that if by betraying no emotion he could show the dog that he was walking where he had a right the brute would recognize that right and let him pass unscathed thus in this moment of peril his noble courage saved him the hound abashed returned to his covert and lord edward passed on  foiled again muttered the marshman   now then said pomona closing the book you see i remembered that the minute i saw the dog coming and i didnt betray any emotion yesterday now when i didnt know it id a been sure to betray emotion and he would have had my lifes blood did he drive you up there  yes said euphemia and she hastily explained the situation  then i guess id better chain him up remarked pomona and advancing to the dog she took him boldly by the collar and pulled him toward the shed the animal hung back at first but soon followed her and she chained him up securely  now you can come down said pomona  i assisted euphemia to the ground and pomona persuaded the hired girl to descend  will he grab me by the leg asked the girl  no get down gump said pomona and down she scrambled  we took pomona into the house with us and asked her news of herself  well said she there aint much to tell i staid awhile at the institution but i didnt get much good there only i learned to read to myself because if i read out loud they came and took the book away then i left there and went to live out but the woman was awful mean she throwed away one of my books and i was only half through it it was a real good book named the bridal corpse or montregors curse and i had to pay for it at the circulatin library so i left her quick enough and then i went on the stage  on the stage cried euphemia what did you do on the stage  scrub replied pomona you see that i thought if i could get anything to do at the theayter i could work my way up so i was glad to get scrubbin i asked the prompter one morning if he thought there was a chance for me to work up and he said yes i might scrub the galleries and then i told him that i didnt want none of his lip and i pretty soon left that place i heard you was akeepin house out here and so i thought id come along and see you and if you hadnt no girl id like to live with you again and i guess you might as well take me for that other girl said when she got down from the shed that she was goin away tomorrow she wouldnt stay in no house where they kept such a dog though i told her i guessed he was only cuttin round because he was so glad to get loose  cutting around exclaimed euphemia it was nothing of the kind if you had seen him you would have known better but did you come now to stay where are your things  on me replied pomona  when euphemia found that the irish girl really intended to leave we consulted together and concluded to engage pomona and i went so far as to agree to carry her books to and from the circulating library to which she subscribed hoping thereby to be able to exercise some influence on her taste and thus part of the old family of rudder grange had come together again true the boarder was away but as pomona remarked when she heard about him you couldnt always expect to ever regain the ties that had always bound everybody  our delight and interest in our little farm increased day by day in a week or two after pomonas arrival i bought a cow euphemia was very anxious to have an alderneythey were such gentle beautiful creaturesbut i could not afford such a luxury i might possibly compass an alderney calf but we would have to wait a couple of years for our milk and euphemia said it would be better to have a common cow than to do that  great was our inward satisfaction when the cow our own cow walked slowly and solemnly into our yard and began to crop the clover on our little lawn pomona and i gently drove her to the barn while euphemia endeavored to quiet the violent demonstrations of the dog fortunately chained by assuring him that this was our cow and that she was to live here and that he was to take care of her and never bark at her all this and much more delivered in the earnest and confidential tone in which ladies talk to infants and dumb animals made the dog think that he was to be let loose to kill the cow and he bounded and leaped with delight tugging at his chain so violently that euphemia became a little frightened and left him this dog had been named lord edward at the earnest solicitation of pomona and he was becoming somewhat reconciled to his life with us he allowed me to unchain him at night and i could generally chain him up in the morning without trouble if i had a good big plate of food with which to tempt him into the shed  before supper we all went down to the barn to see the milking pomona who knew all about such things having been on a farm in her first youth was to be the milkmaid but when she began operations she did no more than begin milk as industriously as she might she got no milk  this is a queer cow said pomona  are you sure that you know how to milk asked euphemia anxiously  can i milk said pomona why of course maam ive seen em milk hundreds of times  but you never milked yourself i remarked  no sir but i know just how its done  that might be but she couldnt do it and at last we had to give up the matter in despair and leave the poor cow until morning when pomona was to go for a man who occasionally worked on the place and engage him to come and milk for us  that night as we were going to bed i looked out of the window at the barn which contained the cow and was astonished to see that there was a light inside of the building  what i exclaimed cant we be left in peaceful possession of a cow for a single night and taking my revolver i hurried downstairs and outofdoors forgetting my hat in my haste euphemia screamed after me to be careful and keep the pistol pointed away from me  i whistled for the dog as i went out but to my surprise he did not answer  has he been killed i thought and for a moment i wished that i was a large family of brothersall armed  but on my way to the barn i met a person approaching with a lantern and a dog it was pomona and she had a milkpail on her arm  see here sir she said its morn half full i just made up my mind that id learn to milkif it took me all night i didnt go to bed at all and ive been at the barn fur an hour and there aint no need of my goin after no man in the mornin said she hanging up the barn key on its nail  i simply mention this circumstance to show what kind of a girl pomona had grown to be  we were all the time at work in some way improving our little place some day we will buy it said euphemia we intended to have some wheat put in in the fall and next year we would make the place fairly crack with luxuriance we would divide the duties of the farm and among other things euphemia would take charge of the chickens she wished to do this entirely herself so that there might be one thing that should be all her own just as my work in town was all my own as she wished to buy the chickens and defray all the necessary expenses out of her own private funds i could make no objections and indeed i had no desire to do so she bought a chickenbook and made herself mistress of the subject for a week there was a strong chicken flavor in all our conversation  this was while the poultry yard was building there was a chickenhouse on the place but no yard and euphemia intended to have a good big one because she was going into the business to make money  perhaps my chickens may buy the place she said and i very much hoped they would  everything was to be done very systematically she would have leghorns brahmas and common fowls the first because they laid so many eggs the second because they were such fine big fowls and the third because they were such good mothers  we will eat and sell the eggs of the first and third classes she said and set the eggs of the second class under the hens of the third class  there seems to be some injustice in that arrangement i said for the first class will always be childless the second class will have nothing to do with their offspring while the third will be obliged to bring up and care for the children of others  but i really had no voice in this matter as soon as the carpenter had finished the yard and had made some coops and other necessary arrangements euphemia hired a carriage and went about the country to buy chickens it was not easy to find just what she wanted and she was gone all day  however she brought home an enormous brahma cock and ten hens which number was pretty equally divided into her three classes she was very proud of her purchases and indeed they were fine fowls in the evening i made some allusion to the cost of all this carpenter work carriagehire etc besides the price of the chickens  o said she you dont look at the matter in the right light you havent studied it up as i have now just let me show you how this thing will pay if carried on properly producing a piece of paper covered with figures she continued i begin with ten hensi got four common ones because it would make it easier to calculate after a while i set these ten hens on thirteen eggs each three of these eggs will probably spoilthat leaves ten chickens hatched out of these i will say that half die that will make five chickens for each hen you see i leave a large margin for loss this makes fifty chickens and when we add the ten hens we have sixty fowls at the end of the first year next year i set these sixty and they bring up five chickens eachi am sure there will be a larger proportion than this but i want to be safeand that is three hundred chickens add the hens and we have three hundred and sixty at the end of the second year in the third year calculating in the same safe way we shall have twentyone hundred and sixty chickens in the fourth year there will be twelve thousand nine hundred and sixty and at the end of the fifth year which is as far as i need to calculate now we shall have sixtyfour thousand and eight hundred chickens what do you think of that at seventyfive cents apiecea very low pricethat would be fortyeight thousand and six hundred dollars now what is the petty cost of a fence and a few coops by the side of a sum like that  nothing at all i answered it is lost like a drop in the ocean i hate my dear to interfere in any way with such a splendid calculation as that but i would like to ask you one question  oh of course she said i suppose you are going to say something about the cost of feeding all this poultry that is to come out of the chickens supposed to die they wont die it is ridiculous to suppose that each hen will bring up but five chickens the chickens that will live out of those i consider as dead will more than pay for the feed  that is not what i was going to ask you although of course it ought to be considered but you know you are only going to set common hens and you do not intend to raise any now are those four hens to do all the setting and motherwork for five years and eventually bring up over sixtyfour thousand chickens  well i did make a mistake there she said coloring a little ill tell you what ill do ill set every one of my hens every year  but all those chickens may not be hens you have calculated that every one of them would set as soon as it was old enough  she stopped a minute to think this over  two heads are better than one i see she said directly ill allow that onehalf of all the chickens are roosters and that will make the profits twentyfour thousand three hundred dollarsmore than enough to buy this place  ever so much more i cried this rudder grange is ours    chapter ix we camp out   my wife and i were both so fond of country life and country pursuits that month after month passed by at our little farm in a succession of delightful days time flew like a limited express train and it was september before we knew it  i had been working very hard at the office that summer and was glad to think of my two weeks vacation which were to begin on the first monday of the month i had intended spending these two weeks in rural retirement at home but an interview in the city with my family physician caused me to change my mind i told him my plan  now said he if i were you id do nothing of the kind you have been working too hard your face shows it you need rest and change nothing will do you so much good as to camp out that will be fifty times better than going to any summer resort you can take your wife with you i know shell like it i dont care where you go so that its a healthy spot get a good tent and an outfit be off to the woods and forget all about business and domestic matters for a few weeks  this sounded splendid and i propounded the plan to euphemia that evening she thought very well of it and was sure we could do it pomona would not be afraid to remain in the house under the protection of lord edward and she could easily attend to the cow and the chickens it would be a holiday for her too old john the man who occasionally worked for us would come up sometimes and see after things with her customary dexterity euphemia swept away every obstacle to the plan and all was settled before we went to bed  as my wife had presumed pomona made no objections to remaining in charge of the house the scheme pleased her greatly so far so good i called that day on a friend who was in the habit of camping out to talk to him about getting a tent and the necessary traps for a life in the woods he proved perfectly competent to furnish advice and everything else he offered to lend me all i needed he had a complete outfit had done with them for the year and i was perfectly welcome here was rare luck he gave me a tent campstove dishes pots gun fishingtackle a big canvas coat with dozens of pockets riveted on it a canvas hat rods reels boots that came up to my hips and about a wagonload of things in all he was a real good fellow  we laid in a stock of canned and condensed provisions and i bought a book on camping out so as to be well posted on the subject on the saturday before the first monday in september we would have been entirely ready to start had we decided on the place where we were to go  we found it very difficult to make this decision there were thousands of places where people went to camp out but none of them seemed to be the place for us most of them were too far away we figured up the cost of taking ourselves and our camp equipage to the adirondacks the lakes the troutstreams of maine or any of those wellknown resorts and we found that we could not afford such trips especially for a vacation of but fourteen days  on sunday afternoon we took a little walk our minds were still troubled about the spot toward which we ought to journey next day and we needed the soothing influences of nature the country to the north and west of our little farm was very beautiful about half a mile from the house a modest river ran on each side of it were grasscovered fields and hills and in some places there were extensive tracks of woodlands  look here exclaimed euphemia stopping short in the little path that wound along by the river bank do you see this river those woods those beautiful fields with not a soul in them or anywhere near them and those lovely blue mountains over thereas she spoke she waved her parasol in the direction of the objects indicated and i could not mistake them now what could we want better than this she continued here we can fish and do everything that we want to i say let us camp here on our own river i can take you to the very spot for the tent come on and she was so excited about it that she fairly ran  the spot she pointed out was one we had frequently visited in our rural walks it was a grassy peninsula as i termed it formed by a sudden turn of a creek which a short distance below flowed into the river it was a very secluded spot the place was approached through a pasturefieldwe had found it by mere accidentand where the peninsula joined the field we had to climb a fence just there there was a cluster of chestnut and hickory trees while down near the point stood a widespreading oak  here under this oak is the place for the tent said euphemia her face flushed her eyes sparkling and her dress a little torn by getting over the fence in a hurry what do we want with your adirondacks and your dismal swamps this is the spot for us  euphemia said i in as composed a tone as possible although my whole frame was trembling with emotion euphemia i am glad i married you  had it not been sunday we would have set up our tent that night  early the next morning old johns fifteendollar horse drew from our house a wagonload of campfixtures there was some difficulty in getting the wagon over the field and there were fences to be taken down to allow of its passage but we overcame all obstacles and reached the campground without breaking so much as a teacup old john helped me pitch the tent and as neither of us understood the matter very well it took us some time it was indeed nearly noon when old john left us and it may have been possible that he delayed matters a little so as to be able to charge for a full halfday for himself and horse euphemia got into the wagon to ride back with him that she might give some parting injunctions to pomona  ill have to stop a bit to put up the fences maam said old john or misther ball might make a fuss  is this mr balls land i asked  oh yes sir its mr balls land  i wonder how hell like our camping on it i said thoughtfully  id a thought sir youd a asked him that before you came said old john in a tone that seemed to indicate that he had his doubts about mr ball  oh therell be no trouble about that cried euphemia you can drive me past mr ballsits not much out of the wayand ill ask him  in that wagon said i will you stop at mr balls door in that  certainly said she as she arranged herself on the board which served as a seat now that our campaign has really commenced we ought to begin to rough it and should not be too proud to ride even in ain a  she evidently couldnt think of any vehicle mean enough for her purpose  in a greengrocery cart i suggested  yes or in a red one go ahead john  when euphemia returned on foot i had a fire in the campstove and the kettle was on  well said euphemia mr ball says its all right if we keep the fence up he dont want his cows to get into the creek and im sure we dont want em walking over us he couldnt understand though why we wanted to live out here i explained the whole thing to him very carefully but it didnt seem to make much impression on him i believe he thinks pomona has something the matter with her and that we have come to stay out here in the fresh air so as not to take it  what an extremely stupid man mr ball must be i said  the fire did not burn very well and while i was at work at it euphemia spread a cloth upon the grass and set forth bread and butter cheese sardines potted ham preserves biscuits and a lot of other things  we did not wait for the kettle to boil but concluded to do without tea or coffee for this meal and content ourselves with pure water for some reason or other however the creek water did not seem to be very pure and we did not like it a bit  after lunch said i we will go and look for a spring that will be a good way of exploring the country  if we cant find one said euphemia we shall have to go to the house for water for i can never drink that stuff  soon after lunch we started out we searched high and low near and far for a spring but could not find one  at length by merest accident we found ourselves in the vicinity of old johns little house i knew he had a good well and so we went in to get a drink for our ham and biscuits had made us very thirsty  we told old john who was digging potatoes and was also very much surprised to see us so soon about our unexpected trouble in finding a spring  no said he very slowly there is no spring very near to you didnt you tell your gal to bring you water  no i replied we dont want her coming down to the camp she is to attend to the house  oh very well said john i will bring you water morning and nightgood fresh waterfrom my well forwell for ten cents a day  that will be nice said euphemia and cheap too and then it will be well to have john come every day he can carry our letters  i dont expect to write any letters  neither do i said euphemia but it will be pleasant to have some communication with the outer world  so we engaged old john to bring us water twice a day i was a little disappointed at this for i thought that camping on the edge of a stream settled the matter of water but we have many things to learn in this world  early in the afternoon i went out to catch some fish for supper we agreed to dispense with dinner and have breakfast lunch and a good solid supper  for some time i had poor luck there were either very few fish in the creek or they were not hungry  i had been fishing an hour or more when i saw euphemia running toward me  whats the matter said i  oh nothing ive just come to see how you were getting along havent you been gone an awfully long time and are those all the fish youve caught what little bits of things they are i thought people who camped out caught big fish and lots of them  that depends a good deal upon where they go said i  yes i suppose so replied euphemia but i should think a stream as big as this would have plenty of fish in it however if you cant catch any you might go up to the road and watch for mr mulligan he sometimes comes along on mondays  im not going to the road to watch for any fishman i replied a little more testily than i should have spoken what sort of a camping out would that be but we must not be talking here or i shall never get a bite those fish are a little soiled from jumping about in the dust you might wash them off at that shallow place while i go a little further on and try my luck  i went a short distance up the creek and threw my line into a dark shadowy pool under some alders where there certainly should be fish and sure enough in less than a minute i got a splendid bitenot only a bite but a pull i knew that i had certainly hooked a big fish the thing actually tugged at my line so that i was afraid the pole would break i did not fear for the line for that i knew was strong i would have played the fish until he was tired and i could pull him out without risk to the pole but i did not know exactly how the process of playing was conducted i was very much excited sometimes i gave a jerk and a pull and then the fish would give a jerk and a pull  directly i heard some one running toward me and then i heard euphemia cry out  give him the butt give him the butt  give him what i exclaimed without having time even to look up at her  the butt the butt she cried almost breathlessly i know thats right i read how edward everett hale did it in the adirondacks  no it wasnt hale at all said i as i jumped about the bank it was mr murray  well it was one of those fishing ministers and i know that it caught the fish  i know i know i read it but i dont know how to do it  perhaps you ought to punch him with it said she  no no i hurriedly replied i cant do anything like that im going to try to just pull him out lengthwise you take hold of the pole and go in shore as far as you can and ill try and get hold of the line  euphemia did as i bade her and drew the line in so that i could reach it as soon as i had a firm hold of it i pulled in regardless of consequences and hauled ashore an enormous catfish  hurrah i shouted here is a prize  euphemia dropped the pole and ran to me  what a horrid beast she exclaimed throw it in again  not at all said i this is a splendid fish if i can ever get him off the hook dont come near him if he sticks that backfin into you it will poison you  then i should think it would poison us to eat him said she  no its only his fin  ive eaten catfish but i never saw one like that she said look at its horrible mouth and it has whiskers like a cat  oh you never saw one with its head on i said what i want to do is to get this hook out  i had caught catfish before but never one so large as this and i was actually afraid to take hold of it knowing as i did that you must be very careful how you clutch a fish of the kind i finally concluded to carry it home as it was and then i could decapitate it and take out the hook at my leisure so back to camp we went euphemia picking up the little fish as we passed for she did not think it right to catch fish and not eat them they made her hands smell it is true but she did not mind that when we were camping  i prepared the big fish and i had a desperate time getting the skin off while my wife who is one of the daintiest cooks in the world made the fire in the stove and got ready the rest of the supper she fried the fish because i told her that was the way catfish ought to be cooked although she said that it seemed very strange to her to camp out for the sake of ones health and then to eat fried food  but that fish was splendid the very smell of it made us hungry everything was good and when supper was over and the dishes washed i lighted my pipe and we sat down under a tree to enjoy the evening  the sun had set behind the distant ridge a delightful twilight was gently subduing every color of the scene the night insects were beginning to hum and chirp and a fire that i had made under a tree blazed up gayly and threw little flakes of light into the shadows under the shrubbery  now isnt this better than being cooped up in a narrow constricted house said i  ever so much better said euphemia now we know what nature is we are sitting right down in her lap and she is cuddling us up isnt that sky lovely oh i think this is perfectly splendid said she making a little dab at her faceif it wasnt for the mosquitoes  they are bad i said i thought my pipe would keep them off but it dont there must be plenty of them down at that creek  down there exclaimed euphemia why there are thousands of them here i never saw anything like it theyre getting worse every minute  ill tell you what we must do i exclaimed jumping up we must make a smudge  whats that do you rub it on yourself asked euphemia anxiously  no its only a great smoke come let us gather up dry leaves and make a smoldering fire of them  we managed to get up a very fair smudge and we stood to the leeward of it until euphemia began to cough and sneeze as if her head would come off with tears running from her eyes she declared that she would rather go and be eaten alive than stay in that smoke  perhaps we were too near it said i  that may be she answered but i have had enough smoke why didnt i think of it before i brought two veils we can put these over our faces and wear gloves  she was always full of expedients  veiled and gloved we bade defiance to the mosquitoes and we sat and talked for half an hour or more i made a little hole in my veil through which i put the mouthpiece of my pipe  when it became really dark i lighted the lantern and we prepared for a wellearned nights rest the tent was spacious and comfortable and we each had a nice little cotbed  are you going to leave the frontdoor open all night said euphemia as i came in after a final round to see that all was right  i should hardly call this canvasflap a frontdoor i said but i think it would be better to leave it open otherwise we should smother you need not be afraid i shall keep my gun here by my bedside and if any one offers to come in ill bring him to a full stop quick enough  yes if you are awake but i suppose we ought not to be afraid of burglars here people in tents never are so you neednt shut it  it was awfully quiet and dark and lonely out there by that creek when the light had been put out and we had gone to bed for some reason i could not go to sleep after i had been lying awake for an hour or two euphemia spoke  are you awake said she in a low voice as if she were afraid of disturbing the people in the next room  yes said i how long have you been awake  i havent been asleep  neither have i  suppose we light the lantern said she dont you think it would be pleasanter  it might be i replied but it would draw myriads of mosquitoes i wish i had brought a mosquitonet and a clock it seems so lonesome without the ticking goodnight we ought to have a long sleep if we do much tramping about tomorrow  in about half an hour more just as i was beginning to be a little sleepy she said  where is that gun  here by me i answered  well if a man should come in try and be sure to put it up close to him before you fire in a little tent like this the shot might scatter everywhere if youre not careful  all right i said goodnight  theres one thing we never thought of she presently exclaimed  whats that said i  snakes said she  well dont lets think of them we must try and get a little sleep  dear knows ive been trying hard enough she said plaintively and all was quiet again  we succeeded this time in going to sleep and it was broad daylight before we awoke  that morning old john came with our water before breakfast was ready he also brought us some milk as he thought we would want it we considered this a good idea and agreed with him to bring us a quart a day  dont you want some wegetables said he ive got some nice corn and some tomatoes and i could bring you cabbage and peas  we had hardly expected to have fresh vegetables every day but there seemed to be no reason why old john should not bring them as he had to come every day with the water and milk so we arranged that he should furnish us daily with a few of the products of his garden  i could go to the butchers and get you a steak or some chops if youd let me know in the morning said he intent on the profits of further commissions  but this was going too far we remembered we were camping out and declined to have meat from the butcher  john had not been gone more than ten minutes before we saw mr ball approaching  oh i hope he isnt going to say we cant stay exclaimed euphemia  how dye do said mr ball shaking hands with us did you stick it out all night  oh yes indeed i replied and expect to stick it out for a many more nights if you dont object to our occupying your land  no objection in the world said he but it seems a little queer for people who have a good house to be living out here in the fields in a tent now dont it  oh but you see said i and i went on and explained the whole thing to himthe advice of the doctor the discussion about the proper place to go to and the good reasons for fixing on this spot  yees said he thats all very well no doubt but hows the girl  what girl i asked  your girl the hired girl you left at the house  oh shes all right said i shes always well  well said mr ball slowly turning on his heel if you say so i suppose she is but youre going up to the house today to see about her arent you  oh no said euphemia we dont intend to go near the house until our camping is over  just sojust so said mr ball i expected as much but look here dont you think it would be well for me to ask dr ames to stop in and see how she is gettin along i dare say youve fixed everything for her but that would be safer you know hes coming this morning to vaccinate my baby and he might stop there just as well as not after he has left my house  euphemia and i could see no necessity for this proposed visit of the doctor but we could not well object to it and so mr ball said he would be sure and send him  after our visitor had gone the significance of his remarks flashed on me he still thought that pomona was sick with something catching and that we were afraid to stay in the house with her but i said nothing about this to euphemia it would only worry her and our vacation was to be a season of unalloyed delight    chapter x wet blankets   we certainly enjoyed our second day in camp all the morning and a great part of the afternoon we explored we fastened up the tent as well as we could and then i with my gun and euphemia with the fishingpole we started up the creek we did not go very far for it would not do to leave the tent too long i did not shoot anything but euphemia caught two or three nice little fish and we enjoyed the sport exceedingly  soon after we returned in the afternoon and while we were getting things in order for supper we had a call from two of our neighbors captain atkinson and wife the captain greeted us hilariously  hello he cried why this is gay who would ever have thought of a domestic couple like you going on such a lark as this we just heard about it from old john and we came down to see what you are up to youve got everything very nice i think id like this myself why you might have a riflerange out here you could cut down those bushes on the other side of the creek and put up your target over there on that hill then you could lie down here on the grass and bang away all day if youll do that ill come down and practice with you how long are you going to keep it up  i told him that we expected to spend my two weeks vacation here  not if it rains my boy said he i know what it is to camp out in the rain  meanwhile mrs atkinson had been with euphemia examining the tent and our equipage generally  it would be very nice for a days picnic she said but i wouldnt want to stay outofdoors all night  and then addressing me she asked  do you have to breathe the fresh air all the time night as well as day i expect that is a very good prescription but i would not like to have to follow it myself  if the fresh air is what you must have said the captain you might have got all you wanted of that without taking the trouble to come out here you could have sat out on your back porch night and day for the whole two weeks and breathed all the fresh air that any man could need  yes said i and i might have gone down cellar and put my head in the coldair box of the furnace but there wouldnt have been much fun in that  there are a good many things that theres no fun in said the captain do you cook your own meals or have them sent from the house  cook them ourselves of course said euphemia we are going to have supper now wont you wait and take some  thank you said mrs atkinson but we must go  yes we must be going said the captain goodbye if it rains ill come down after you with an umbrella  you need not trouble yourself about that said i we shall rough it out rain or shine  id stay here now said euphemia when they had gone if it rained pitch  you mean pitchforks i suggested  yes anything she answered  well i dont know about the pitchforks i said looking over the creek at the sky but am very much afraid that it is going to rain rainwater tomorrow but that wont drive us home will it  no indeed said she were prepared for it but i wish theyd staid at home  sure enough it commenced to rain that night and we had showers all the next day we staid in camp during the morning and i smoked and we played checkers and had a very cosy time with a wood fire burning under a tree near by we kept up this fire not to dry the air but to make things look comfortable in the afternoon i dressed myself up in waterproof coat boots and hat and went out fishing i went down to the water and fished along the banks for an hour but caught nothing of any consequence this was a great disappointment for we had expected to live on fresh fish for a great part of the time while we were camping with plenty of fish we could do without meat very well  we talked the matter over on my return and we agreed that as it seemed impossible to depend upon a supply of fish from the waters about our camp it would be better to let old john bring fresh meat from the butcher and as neither of us liked crackers we also agreed that he should bring bread  our greatest trouble that evening was to make a fire the wood of which there was a good deal lying about under the trees was now all wet and would not burn however we managed to get up a fire in the stove but i did not know what we were going to do in the morning we should have stored away some wood under shelter  we set our little camptable in the tent and we had scarcely finished our supper when a very heavy rain set in accompanied by a violent wind the canvas at one end of our tent must have been badly fastened for it was blown in and in an instant our beds were deluged i rushed out to fasten up the canvas and got drenched almost to the skin and although euphemia put on her waterproof cloak as soon as she could she was pretty wet for the rain seemed to dash right through the tent  this gust of wind did not last long and the rain soon settled down into a steady drizzle but we were in a sad plight it was after nine oclock before we had put things into tolerable order  we cant sleep in those beds said euphemia  theyre as wet as sop and we shall have to go up to the house and get something to spread over them i dont want to do it but we mustnt catch our deaths of cold  there was nothing to be said against this and we prepared to start out i would have gone by myself but euphemia would not consent to be left alone it was still raining though not very hard and i carried an umbrella and a lantern climbing fences at night with a wife a lantern and an umbrella to take care of is not very agreeable but we managed to reach the house although once or twice we had an argument in regard to the path which seemed to be very different at night from what it was in the daytime  lord edward came bounding to the gate to meet us and i am happy to say that he knew me at once and wagged his tail in a very sociable way  i had the key of a sidedoor in my pocket for we had thought it wise to give ourselves command of this door and so we let ourselves in without ringing or waking pomona  all was quiet within and we went upstairs with the lantern everything seemed clean and in order and it is impossible to convey any idea of the element of comfort which seemed to pervade the house as we quietly made our way upstairs in our wet boots and heavy damp clothes  the articles we wanted were in a closet and while i was making a bundle of them euphemia went to look for pomona she soon returned walking softly  shes sound asleep said she and i didnt think there was any need of waking her well send word by john that weve been here and oh you cant imagine how snug and happy she did look lying there in her comfortable bed in that nice airy room ill tell you what it is if it wasnt for the neighbors and especially the atkinsons i wouldnt go back one step  well said i i dont know that i care so particularly about it myself but i suppose i couldnt stay here and leave all thompsons things out there to take care of themselves  oh no said euphemia and were not going to back down are you ready  on our way downstairs we had to pass the partly open door of our own room i could not help holding up the lantern to look in there was the bed with its fair white covering and its smooth soft pillows there were the easychairs the pretty curtains the neat and cheerful carpet the bureau with euphemias workbasket on it there was the little table with the book that we had been reading together turned face downward upon it there were my slippers there was  come said euphemia i cant bear to look in there its like a dead child  and so we hurried out into the night and the rain we stopped at the woodshed and got an armful of dry kindling which euphemia was obliged to carry as i had the bundle of bedclothing the umbrella and the lantern  lord edward gave a short peculiar bark as we shut the gate behind us but whether it was meant as a fond farewell or a hoot of derision i cannot say  we found everything as we left it at the camp and we made our beds apparently dry but i did not sleep well i could not help thinking that it was not safe to sleep in a bed with a substratum of wet mattress and i worried euphemia a little by asking her several times if she felt the dampness striking through  to our great delight the next day was fine and clear and i thought i would like better than anything else to take euphemia in a boat up the river and spend the day rowing about or resting in shady places on the shore  but what could we do about the tent it would be impossible to go away and leave that with its contents for a whole day  when old john came with our water milk bread and a basket of vegetables we told him of our desired excursion and the difficulty in the way this good man who always had a keen scent for any advantage to himself warmly praised the boating plan and volunteered to send his wife and two of his younger children to stay with the tent while we were away  the old woman he said could do her sewing here as well as anywhere and she would stay all day for fifty cents  this plan pleased us and we sent for mrs old john who came with three of her childrenall too young to leave behind she saidand took charge of the camp  our day proved to be as delightful as we had anticipated and when we returned hungry and tired we were perfectly charmed to find that mrs old john had our supper ready for us  she charged a quarter extra for this service and we did not begrudge it to her though we declined her offer to come every day and cook and keep the place in order  however said euphemia on second thoughts you may come on saturday and clean up generally  the next day which was friday i went out in the morning with the gun as yet i had shot nothing for i had seen no birds about the camp which without breaking the state laws i thought i could kill and so i started off up the riverroad  i saw no game but after i had walked about a mile i met a man in a wagon  hello said he pulling up youd better be careful how you go popping around here on the public roads frightening horses  as i had not yet fired a single shot i thought this was a very impudent speech and i think so still  you had better wait until i begin to pop said i before you make such a fuss about it  no said he id rather make the fuss before you begin my horse is skittish and he drove off  this man annoyed me but as i did not of course wish to frighten horses i left the road and made my way back to the tent over some very rough fields it was a poor day for birds and i did not get a shot  what a foolish man said euphemia when i told her the above incident to talk that way when you stood there with a gun in your hand you might have raked his wagon fore and aft  that afternoon as euphemia and i were sitting under a tree by the tent we were very much surprised to see pomona come walking down the peninsula  i was annoyed and provoked at this we had given pomona positive orders not to leave the place under any pretense while we were gone if necessary to send for anything she could go to the fence back of the barn and scream across a small field to some of the numerous members of old johns family under this arrangement i felt that the house was perfectly safe  before she could reach us i called out  why did you leave the house pomona dont you know you should never come away and leave the house empty i thought i had made you understand that  it isnt empty said pomona in an entirely unruffled tone your old boarder is there with his wife and child  euphemia and i looked at each other in dismay  they came early this afternoon continued pomona by the 114 train and walked up he carrying the child  it cant be cried euphemia their childs married  it must have married very young then said pomona for it isnt over four years old now  oh said euphemia i know its his grandchild  grandchild repeated pomona with her countenance more expressive of emotion than i had ever yet seen it  yes said euphemia but how long are they going to stay where did you tell them we were  they didnt say how long they was goin to stay answered pomona i told them you had gone to be with some friends in the country and that i didnt know whether youd be home tonight or not  how could you tell them such a falsehood cried euphemia  that was no falsehood said pomona it was true as truth if youre not your own friends i dont know who is and i wasnt agoin to tell the boarder where you was till i found out whether you wanted me to do it or not and so i left em and run over to old johns and then down here  it was impossible to find fault with the excellent management of pomona  what were they doing asked euphemia  i opened the parlor and she was in there with the childputting it to sleep on the sofa i think the boarder was out in the yard tryin to teach lord edward some tricks  he had better look out i exclaimed  oh the dogs chained and growlin fearful what am i to do with em  this was a difficult point to decide if we went to see them we might as well break up our camp for we could not tell when we should be able to come back to it  we discussed the matter very anxiously and finally concluded that under the circumstances and considering what pomona had said about our whereabouts it would be well for us to stay where we were and for pomona to take charge of the visitors if they returned to the city that evening she was to give them a good supper before they went sending john to the store for what was needed if they stayed all night she could get breakfast for them  we can write said euphemia and invite them to come and spend some days with us when we are at home and everything is all right i want dreadfully to see that child but i dont see how i can do it now  no said i theyre sure to stay all night if we go up to the house and then i should have to have the tent and things hauled away for i couldnt leave them here  the fact is said euphemia if we were miles away in the woods of maine we couldnt leave our camp to see anybody and this is practically the same  certainly said i and so pomona went away to her new charge    chapter xi the boarders visit   for the rest of the afternoon and indeed far into the night our conversation consisted almost entirely of conjectures regarding the probable condition of things at the house we both thought we had done right but we felt badly about it it was not hospitable to be sure but then i should have no other holiday until next year and our friends could come at any time to see us  the next morning old john brought a note from pomona it was written with pencil on a small piece of paper torn from the margin of a newspaper and contained the words here yit  so youve got company said old john with a smile thats a queer gal of yourn she says i mustnt tell em youre here as if id tell em  we knew well enough that old john was not at all likely to do anything that would cut off the nice little revenue he was making out of our camp and so we felt no concern on that score  but we were very anxious for further news and we told old john to go to the house about ten oclock and ask pomona to send us another note  we waited in a very disturbed condition of mind until nearly eleven oclock when old john came with a verbal message from pomona  she says shes acomin herself as soon as she can get a chance to slip off  this was not pleasant news it filled our minds with a confused mass of probabilities and it made us feel mean how contemptible it seemed to be a party to this concealment and in league with a servantgirl who has to slip off  before long pomona appeared quite out of breath  in all my life said she i never see people like them two i thought i was never goin to get away  are they there yet cried euphemia  how long are they going to stay  dear knows replied pomona their valise came up by express last night  oh well have to go up to the house said euphemia it wont do to stay away any longer  well said pomona fanning herself with her apron if you knowd all i know i dont think youd think so  what do you mean said euphemia  well maam theyve just settled down and taken possession of the whole place he says to me that he knowd youd both want them to make themselves at home just as if you was there and they thought theyd better do it he asked me did i think you would be home by monday and i said i didnt know but i guessed you would so says he to his wife wont that be a jolly lark well just keep house for them here till they come and he says he would go down to the store and order some things if there wasnt enough in the house and he asked her to see what would be needed which she did and hes gone down for em now and she says that as it was saturday shed see that the house was all put to rights and after breakfast she set me to sweepin and its only by way of her dustin the parlor and givin me the little girl to take for a walk that i got off at all  but what have you done with the child exclaimed euphemia  oh i left her at old johnses  and so you think theyre pleased with having the house to themselves i said  pleased sir replied pomona theyre tickled to death  but how do you like having strangers telling you what to do asked euphemia  oh well said pomona hes no stranger and shes real pleasant and if it gives you a good camp out i dont mind  euphemia and i looked at each other here was true allegiance we would remember this  pomona now hurried off and we seriously discussed the matter and soon came to the conclusion that while it might be the truest hospitality to let our friends stay at our house for a day or two and enjoy themselves still it would not do for us to allow ourselves to be governed by a too delicate sentimentality we must go home and act our part of host and hostess  mrs old john had been at the camp ever since breakfasttime giving the place a saturday cleaning what she had found to occupy her for so long a time i could not imagine but in her efforts to put in a full halfdays work i have no doubt she scrubbed some of the trees we had been so fully occupied with our own affairs that we had paid very little attention to her but she had probably heard pretty much all that had been said  at noon we paid her giving her at her suggestion something extra in lieu of the midday meal which she did not stay to take and told her to send her husband with his wagon as soon as possible as we intended to break up our encampment we determined that we would pack everything in johns wagon and let him take the load to his house and keep it there until monday when i would have the tent and accompaniments expressed to their owner we would go home and join our friends it would not be necessary to say where we had been  it was hard for us to break up our camp in many respects we had enjoyed the novel experience and we had fully expected during the next week to make up for all our shortcomings and mistakes it seemed like losing all our labor and expenditure to break up now but there was no help for it our place was at home  we did not wish to invite our friends to the camp they would certainly have come had they known we were there but we had no accommodations for them neither had we any desire for even transient visitors besides we both thought that we would prefer that our exboarder and his wife should not know that we were encamped on that little peninsula  we set to work to pack up and get ready for moving but the afternoon passed away without bringing old john between five and six oclock along came his oldest boy with a bucket of water  im to go back after the milk he said  hold up i cried where is your father and his wagon weve been waiting for him for hours  the horse is si i mean hes gone to ballville for oats  and why didnt he send and tell me i asked  there wasnt nobody to send answered the boy  you are not telling the truth exclaimed euphemia there is always some one to send in a family like yours  to this the boy made no answer but again said that he would go after the milk  we want you to bring no milk i cried now quite angry i want you to go down to the station and tell the driver of the expresswagon to come here immediately do you understand immediately  the boy declared he understood and started off quite willingly we did not prefer to have the expresswagon for it was too public a conveyance and besides old john knew exactly how to do what was required but we need not have troubled ourselves the expresswagon did not come  when it became dark we saw that we could not leave that night even if a wagon did come it would not be safe to drive over the fields in the darkness and we could not go away and leave the campequipage i proposed that euphemia should go up to the house while i remained in camp but she declined we would keep together whatever happened she said  we unpacked our cookingutensils and provisions and had supper there was no milk for our coffee but we did not care the evening did not pass gayly we were annoyed by the conduct of old john and the expressboy though perhaps it was not their fault i had given them no notice that i should need them  and we were greatly troubled at the continuance of the secrecy and subterfuge which now had become really necessary if we did not wish to hurt our friends feelings  the first thing that i thought of when i opened my eyes in the morning was the fact that we would have to stay there all day for we could not move on sunday  but euphemia did not agree with me after breakfast we found that the water and the milk had been brought very early before we were up she stated that she did not intend to be treated in this way she was going up to old johns house herself and away she went  in less than half an hour she returned followed by old john and his wife both looking much as if they had been whipped  these people said she have entered into a conspiracy against us i have questioned them thoroughly and have made them answer me the horse was at home yesterday and the boy did not go after the expresswagon they thought that if they could keep us here until our company had gone we would stay as long as we originally intended and they would continue to make money out of us but they are mistaken we are going home immediately  at this point i could not help thinking that euphemia might have consulted me in regard to her determination but she was very much in earnest and i would not have any discussion before these people  now listen said euphemia addressing the downcast couple we are going home and you two are to stay here all this day and tonight and take care of these things you cant work today and you can shut up your house and bring your whole family here if you choose we will pay you for the servicealthough you do not deserve a centand we will leave enough here for you to eat you must bring your own sheets and pillowcases and stay here until we see you on monday morning  old john and his wife agreed to this plan with the greatest alacrity apparently well pleased to get off so easily and having locked up the smaller articles of campfurniture we filled a valise with our personal baggage and started off home  our house and grounds never looked prettier than they did that morning as we stood at the gate lord edward barked a welcome from his shed and before we reached the door pomona came running out her face radiant  im awful glad to see you back she said though id never have said so while you was in camp  i patted the dog and looked into the garden everything was growing splendidly euphemia rushed to the chickenyard it was in firstrate order and there were two broods of little yellow puffy chicks  down on her knees went my wife to pick up the little creatures one by one press their downy bodies to her cheek and call them tootsywootsies and away went i to the barn followed by pomona and soon afterward by euphemia  the cow was all right  ive been making butter said pomona though it dont look exactly like it ought to yet and the skimmilk i didnt know what to do with so i gave it to old john he came for it every day and was real mad once because i had given a lot of it to the dog and couldnt let him have but a pint  he ought to have been mad said i to euphemia as we walked up to the house he got ten cents a quart for that milk  we laughed and didnt care we were too glad to be at home  but where are our friends i asked pomona we had actually forgotten them  oh theyre gone out for a walk said she they started off right after breakfast  we were not sorry for this it would be so much nicer to see our dear home again when there was nobody there but ourselves indoors we rushed our absence had been like rain on a garden everything now seemed fresher and brighter and more delightful we went from room to room and seemed to appreciate better than ever what a charming home we had  we were so full of the delights of our return that we forgot all about the sunday dinner and our guests but pomona whom my wife was training to be an excellent cook did not forget and euphemia was summoned to a consultation in the kitchen  dinner was late but our guests were later we waited as long as the state of the provisions and our appetites would permit and then we sat down to the table and began to eat slowly but they did not come we finished our meal and they were still absent we now became quite anxious and i proposed to euphemia that we should go and look for them  we started out and our steps naturally turned toward the river an unpleasant thought began to crowd itself into my mind and perhaps the same thing happened to euphemia for without saying anything to each other we both turned toward the path that led to the peninsula we crossed the field climbed the fence and there in front of the tent sat our old boarder splitting sticks with the camphatchet  hurrah he cried springing to his feet when he saw us how glad i am to see you back when did you return isnt this splendid  what i said as we shook hands  why this he cried pointing to the tent dont you see were camping out  you are i exclaimed looking around for his wife while euphemia stood motionless actually unable to make a remark  certainly we are its the rarest bit of luck my wife and adele will be here directly theyve gone to look for watercresses but i must tell you how i came to make this magnificent find we started out for a walk this morning and we happened to hit on this place and here we saw this gorgeous tent with nobody near but a little towheaded boy  only a boy cried euphemia  yes a young shaver of about nine or ten i asked him what he was doing here and he told me that this tent belonged to a gentleman who had gone away and that he was here to watch it until he came back then i asked him how long the owner would probably be away and he said he supposed for a day or two then a splendid idea struck me i offered the boy a dollar to let me take his place i knew that any sensible man would rather have me in charge of his tent than a young codger like that the boy agreed as quick as lightning and i paid him and sent him off you see how little he was to be trusted the owner of this tent will be under the greatest obligations to me just look at it he cried beds table stoveeverything anybody could want ive camped out lots of times but never had such a tent as this i intended coming up this afternoon after my valise and to tell your girl where we are but here is my wife and little adele  in the midst of the salutations and the mutual surprise euphemia cried  but you dont expect to camp out now you are coming back to our house  you see said the exboarder we should never have thought of doing anything so rude had we supposed you would have returned so soon but your girl gave us to understand that you would not be back for days and so we felt free to go at any time and i did not hesitate to make this arrangement and now that i have really taken the responsibility of the tent and fixtures on myself i dont think it would be right to go away and leave the place especially as i dont know where to find that boy the owner will be back in a day or two and i would like to explain matters to him and give up the property in good order into his hands and to tell the truth we both adore campingout and we may never have such a chance again we can live here splendidly i went out to forage this morning and found an old fellow living near by who sold me a lot of provisionseven some coffee and sugarand hes to bring us some milk were going to have supper in about an hour wont you stay and take a campmeal with us it will be a novelty for you at any rate  we declined this invitation as we had so lately dined i looked at euphemia with a question in my eye she understood me and gently shook her head it would be a shame to make any explanations which might put an end to this bit of camplife which evidently was so eagerly enjoyed by our old friend but we insisted that they should come up to the house and see us and they agreed to dine with us the next evening on tuesday they must return to the city  now this is what i call real hospitality said the exboarder warmly grasping my hand i could not help agreeing with him  as we walked home i happened to look back and saw old john going over the fields toward the camp carrying a little tinpail and a water bucket  the next day toward evening a storm set in and at the hour fixed for our dinner the rain was pouring down in such torrents that we did not expect our guests after dinner the rain ceased and as we supposed that they might not have made any preparations for a meal euphemia packed up some dinner for them in a basket and i took it down to the camp  they were glad to see me and said they had a splendid time all day they were up before sunrise and had explored tramped boated and i dont know what else  my basket was very acceptable and i would have stayed awhile with them but as they were obliged to eat in the tent there was no place for me to sit it being too wet outside and so i soon came away  we were in doubt whether or not to tell our friends the true history of the camp i thought that it was not right to keep up the deception while euphemia declared that if they were sensitive people they would feel very badly at having broken up our plans by their visit and then having appropriated our camp to themselves she thought it would be the part of magnanimity to say nothing about it  i could not help seeing a good deal of force in her arguments although i wished very much to set the thing straight and we discussed the matter again as we walked down to the camp after breakfast next morning  there we found old john sitting on a stump he said nothing but handed me a note written in leadpencil on a card it was from our exboarder and informed me that early that morning he had found that there was a tug lying in the river which would soon start for the city he also found that he could get passage on her for his party and as this was such a splendid chance to go home without the bother of getting up to the station he had just bundled his family and his valise on board and was very sorry they did not have time to come up and bid us goodbye the tent he left in charge of a very respectable man from whom he had had supplies  that morning i had the campequipage packed up and expressed to its owner we did not care to camp out any more that season but thought it would be better to spend the rest of my vacation at the seashore  our exboarder wrote to us that he and his wife were anxious that we should return their visit during my holidays but as we did not see exactly how we could return a visit of the kind we did not try to do it    chapter xii lord edward and the treeman   it was winter at rudder grange the season was the same at other places but that fact did not particularly interest euphemia and myself it was winter with us and we were ready for it that was the great point and it made us proud to think that we had not been taken unawares notwithstanding the many things that were to be thought of on a little farm like ours  it is true that we had always been prepared for winter wherever we had lived but this was a different case in other days it did not matter much whether we were ready or not but now our house our cow our poultry and indeed ourselves might have sufferedthere is no way of finding out exactly how muchif we had not made all possible preparations for the coming of cold weather  but there was a great deal yet to be thought of and planned out although we were ready for winter the next thing to think of was spring  we laid out the farm we decided where we would have wheat corn potatoes and oats we would have a man by the day to sow and reap the intermediate processes i thought i could attend to myself  everything was talked over ciphered over and freely discussed by my wife and myself except one matter which i planned and worked out alone doing most of the necessary calculations at the office so as not to excite euphemias curiosity  i had determined to buy a horse this would be one of the most important events of our married life and it demanded a great deal of thought which i gave it  the horse was chosen for me by a friend he was an excellent beast the horse excelling as my friend told me in muscle and wit nothing better than this could be said about a horse he was a sorrel animal quite handsome gentle enough for euphemia to drive and not too highminded to do a little farmwork if necessary he was exactly the animal i needed  the carriage was not quite such a success the horse having cost a good deal more than i expected to pay i found that i could only afford a secondhand carriage i bought a good serviceable vehicle which would hold four persons if necessary and there was room enough to pack all sorts of parcels and baskets it was with great satisfaction that i contemplated this feature of the carriage which was a rather rustylooking affair although sound and strong enough the harness was new and set off the horse admirably  on the afternoon when my purchases were completed i did not come home by the train i drove home in my own carriage drawn by my own horse the ten miles drive was over a smooth road and the sorrel traveled splendidly if i had been a line of kings a mile long all in their chariots of state with gold and silver and outriders and music and banners waving in the wind i could not have been prouder than when i drew up in front of my house  there was a wagongate at one side of the front fence which had never been used except by the men who brought coal and i got out and opened this very quietly so as not to attract the attention of euphemia it was earlier than i usually returned and she would not be expecting me i was then about to lead the horse up a somewhat grassgrown carriageway to the front door but i reflected that euphemia might be looking out of some of the windows and i had better drive up so i got in and drove very slowly to the door  however she heard the unaccustomed noise of wheels and looked out of the parlor window she did not see me but immediately came around to the door i hurried out of the carriage so quickly that not being familiar with the steps i barely escaped tripping  when she opened the front door she was surprised to see me standing by the horse  have you hired a carriage she cried are we going to ride  my dear said i as i took her by the hand we are going to ride but i have not hired a carriage i have bought one do you see this horse he is oursour own horse  if you could have seen the face that was turned up to meall you other men in the worldyou would have torn your hair in despair  afterward she went around and around that horse she patted his smooth sides she looked with admiration at his strong wellformed legs she stroked his head she smoothed his mane she was brimful of joy  when i had brought the horse some water in a bucketand what a pleasure it was to water ones own horseeuphemia rushed into the house and got her hat and cloak and we took a little drive  i doubt if any horse ever drew two happier people euphemia said but little about the carriage that was a necessary adjunct and it was good enough for the present but the horse how nobly and with what vigor he pulled us up the hills and how carefully and strongly he held the carriage back as we went down how easily he trotted over the level road caring nothing for the ten miles he had gone that afternoon what a sensation of power it gave us to think that all that strength and speed and endurance was ours that it would go where we wished that it would wait for us as long as we chose that it was at our service day and night that it was a horse and we owned it  when we returned pomona saw us drive inshe had not known of our rideand when she heard the news she was as wild with proud delight as anybody she wanted to unharness him but this i could not allow we did not wish to be selfish but after she had seen and heard what we thought was enough for her we were obliged to send her back to the kitchen for the sake of the dinner  then we unharnessed him i say we for euphemia stood by and i explained everything for some day she said she might want to do it herself then i led him into the stable how nobly he trod and how finely his hoofs sounded on the stable floor  there was hay in the mow and i had brought a bag of oats under the seat of the carriage  isnt it just delightful said euphemia that we havent any man if we had a man he would take the horse at the door and we should be deprived of all this it wouldnt be half like owning a horse  in the morning i drove down to the station euphemia by my side she drove back and old john came up and attended to the horse this he was to do for the present for a small stipend in the afternoon euphemia came down after me how i enjoyed those rides before this i had thought it ever so much more pleasant and healthful to walk to and from the station than to ride but then i did not own a horse at night i attended to everything euphemia generally following me about the stable with a lantern when the days grew longer we would have delightful rides after dinner and even now we planned to have early breakfasts and go to the station by the longest possible way  one day in the following spring i was riding home from the station with euphemiawe seldom took pleasuredrives now we were so busy on the placeand as we reached the house i heard the dog barking savagely he was loose in the little orchard by the side of the house as i drove in pomona came running to the carriage  man up the tree she shouted  i helped euphemia out left the horse standing by the door and ran to the dog followed by my wife and pomona sure enough there was a man up the tree and lord edward was doing his best to get at him springing wildly at the tree and fairly shaking with rage  i looked up at the man he was a thoroughbred tramp burly dirty generally unkempt but unlike most tramps he looked very much frightened his position on a high crotch of an appletree was not altogether comfortable and although for the present it was safe the fellow seemed to have a wavering faith in the strength of appletree branches and the moment he saw me he earnestly besought me to take that dog away and let him down  i made no answer but turning to pomona i asked her what this all meant  why sir you see said she i was in the kitchen bakin pies and this fellow must have got over the fence at the side of the house for the dog didnt see him and the first thing i knowd he was stickin his head in the window and he asked me to give him somethin to eat and when i said id see in a minute if there was anything for him he says to me gim me a piece of one of them piespies id just baked and was settin to cool on the kitchen table no sir says i im not goin to cut one of them pies for you or any one like you all right says he ill come in and help myself he must have known there was no man about and comin the way he did he hadnt seen the dog so he come round to the kitchen door but i shot out before he got there and unchained lord edward i guess he saw the dog when he got to the door and at any rate he heard the chain clankin and he didnt go in but just put for the gate but lord edward was after him so quick that he hadnt no time to go to no gates it was all he could do to scoot up this tree and if hed been a millionth part of a minute later hed a been in another world by this time  the man who had not attempted to interrupt pomonas speech now began again to implore me to let him down while euphemia looked pitifully at him and was about i think to intercede with me in his favor but my attention was drawn off from her by the strange conduct of the dog believing i suppose that he might leave the tramp for a moment now that i had arrived he had dashed away to another tree where he was barking furiously standing on his hind legs and clawing at the trunk  whats the matter over there i asked  oh thats the other fellow said pomona hes no harm and then as the tramp made a movement as if he would try to come down and make a rush for safety during the absence of the dog she called out here boy here boy and in an instant lord edward was again raging at his post at the foot of the appletree  i was grievously puzzled at all this and walked over to the other tree followed as before by euphemia and pomona  this one said the latter is a treeman  i should think so said i as i caught sight of a person in gray trowsers standing among the branches of a cherrytree not very far from the kitchen door the tree was not a large one and the branches were not strong enough to allow him to sit down on them although they supported him well enough as he stood close to the trunk just out of reach of lord edward  this is a very unpleasant position sir said he when i reached the tree i simply came into your yard on a matter of business and finding that raging beast attacking a person in a tree i had barely time to get up into this tree myself before he dashed at me luckily i was out of his reach but i very much fear i have lost some of my property  no he hasnt said pomona it was a big book he dropped i picked it up and took it into the house its full of pictures of pears and peaches and flowers ive been lookin at it thats how i knew what he was and there was no call for his gittin up a tree lord edward never would have gone after him if he hadnt run as if he had guilt on his soul  i suppose then said i addressing the individual in the cherrytree that you came here to sell me some trees  yes sir said he quickly trees shrubs vines evergreenseverything suitable for a gentlemans country villa i can sell you something quite remarkable sir in the way of cherrytreesfrench ones just imported bear fruit three times the size of anything that could be produced on a tree like this and pearsfruit of the finest flavor and enormous size  yes said pomona i seen them in the book but they must grow on a groundvine no tree couldnt hold such pears as them  here euphemia reproved pomonas forwardness and i invited the treeagent to get down out of the tree  thank you said he but not while that dog is loose if you will kindly chain him up i will get my book and show you specimens of some of the finest small fruit in the world all imported from the first nurseries of europethe redgold amber muscat grapethe  oh please let him down said euphemia her eyes beginning to sparkle  i slowly walked toward the tramptree revolving various matters in my mind we had not spent much money on the place during the winter and we now had a small sum which we intended to use for the advantage of the farm but had not yet decided what to do with it it behooved me to be careful  i told pomona to run and get me the dogchain and i stood under the tree listening as well as i could to the treeagent talking to euphemia and paying no attention to the impassioned entreaties of the tramp in the crotch above me when the chain was brought i hooked one end of it in lord edwards collar and then i took a firm grasp of the other telling pomona to bring the treeagents book from the house i called to that individual to get down from his tree he promptly obeyed and taking the book from pomona began to show the pictures to euphemia  you had better hurry sir i called out i cant hold this dog very long and indeed lord edward had made a run toward the agent which jerked me very forcibly in his direction but a movement by the tramp had quickly brought the dog back to his more desired victim  if you will just tie up that dog sir said the agent and come this way i would like to show you the meltinagua peardissolves in the mouth like snow sir trees will bear next year  oh come look at the royal sparkling ruby grape cried euphemia it glows in the sun like a gem  yes said the agent and fills the air with fragrance during the whole month of september  i tell you i shouted i cant hold this dog another minute the chain is cutting the skin off my hands run sir run im going to let go  run run cried pomona fly for your life  the agent now began to be frightened and shut up his book  if you only could see the plates sir im sure  are you ready i cried as the dog excited by pomonas wild shouts made a bolt in his direction  goodday if i must said the agent as he hurried to the gate but there he stopped  there is nothing sir he said that would so improve your place as a row of the spitzenberg sweetscented balsam fir along this fence ill sell you threeyearold trees  hes loose i shouted as i dropped the chain  in a second the agent was on the other side of the gate lord edward made a dash toward him but stopping suddenly flew back to the tree of the tramp  if you should conclude sir said the treeagent looking over the fence to have a row of those firs along here  my good sir said i there is no row of firs there now and the fence is not very high my dog as you see is very much excited and i cannot answer for the consequences if he takes it into his head to jump over  the treeagent turned and walked slowly away  now lookahere cried the tramp from the tree in the voice of a very illused person aint you goin to fasten up that dog and let me git down  i walked up close to the tree and addressed him  no said i i am not when a man comes to my place bullies a young girl who was about to relieve his hunger and then boldly determines to enter my house and help himself to my property i dont propose to fasten up any dog that may happen to be after him if i had another dog id let him loose and give this faithful beast a rest you can do as you please you can come down and have it out with the dog or you can stay up there until i have had my dinner then i will drive down to the village and bring up the constable and deliver you into his hands we want no such fellows as you about  with that i unhooked the chain from lord edward and walked off to put up the horse the man shouted after me but i paid no attention i did not feel in a good humor with him  euphemia was much disturbed by the various occurrences of the afternoon she was sorry for the man in the tree she was sorry that the agent for the royal ruby grape had been obliged to go away and i had a good deal of trouble during dinner to make her see things in the proper light but i succeeded at last  i did not hurry through dinner and when we had finished i went to my work at the barn tramps are not generally pressed for time and pomona had been told to give our captive something to eat  i was just locking the door of the carriagehouse when pomona came running to me to tell me that the tramp wanted to see me about something very importantjust a minute he said i put the key in my pocket and walked over to the tree it was now almost dark but i could see that the dog the tramp and the tree still kept their respective places  lookahere said the individual in the crotch you dont know how dreadful oneasy these limbs gits after youve been settin up here as long as i have and i dont want to have nuthin to do with no constables ill tell you what ill do if youll chain up that dog and let me go ill fix things so that youll not be troubled no more by no tramps  how will you do that i asked  oh never you mind said he ill give you my word of honor ill do it theres a reglar understandin among us fellers you know  i considered the matter the word of honor of a fellow such as he was could not be worth much but the merest chance of getting rid of tramps should not be neglected i went in to talk to euphemia about it although i knew what she would say i reasoned with myself as much as with her  if we put this one fellow in prison for a few weeks i said the benefit is not very great if we are freed from all tramps for the season the benefit is very great shall we try for the greatest good  certainly said euphemia and his legs must be dreadfully stiff  so i went out and after a struggle of some minutes i chained lord edward to a post at a little distance from the appletree when he was secure the tramp descended nimbly from his perch notwithstanding his stiff legs and hurried out of the gate he stopped to make no remarks over the fence with a wild howl of disappointed ambition lord edward threw himself after him but the chain held  a lane of moderate length led from our house to the main road and the next day as we were riding home i noticed on the trunk of a large tree which stood at the corner of the lane and road a curious mark i drew up to see what it was but we could not make it out it was a very rude device cut deeply into the tree and somewhat resembled a square a circle a triangle and a cross with some smaller marks beneath it i felt sure that our tramp had cut it and that it had some significance which would be understood by the members of his fraternity  and it must have had for no tramps came near us all that summer we were visited by a needy person now and then but by no member of the regular army of tramps  one afternoon that fall i walked home and at the corner of the lane i saw a tramp looking up at the mark on the tree which was still quite distinct  what does that mean i said stepping up to him  how do i know said the man and what do you want to know fur  just out of curiosity i said i have often noticed it i think you can tell me what it means and if you will do so ill give you a dollar  and keep mum about it said the man  yes i replied taking out the dollar  all right said the tramp that sign means that the man that lives up this lane is a mean stingy cuss with a wicked dog and its no good to go there  i handed him the dollar and went away perfectly satisfied with my reputation  i wish here to make some mention of euphemias methods of work in her chickenyard she kept a book which she at first called her fowl record but she afterward changed the name to poultry register i never could thoroughly understand this book although she has often explained every part of it to me she had pages for registering the age description time of purchase or of birth and subsequent performances of every fowl in her yard she had divisions of the book for expenses profits probable losses and positive losses she noted the number of eggs put under each setting hen the number of eggs cracked per day the number spoiled and finally the number hatched each chick on emerging from its shell was registered and an account kept of its subsequent life and adventures there were frequent calculations regarding the advantages of various methods of treatment and there were statements of the results of a great many experimentssomething like this set toppy and her sister pinky april 2nd 187 toppy with twelve eggsthree brahma four common and five leghorn pinky with thirteen eggs as she weighs four ounces more than her sister of which three were leghorn five common and five brahma during the twentysecond and twentythird of april same year toppy hatched out four brahmas two commons and three leghorns while her sister on these days and the morning of the day following hatched two leghorns six commons and only one brahma now could toppy who had only three brahma eggs and hatched out four of that breed have exchanged eggs with her sister thus making it possible for her to hatch out six common chickens when she only had five eggs of that kind or did the eggs get mixed up in some way before going into the possession of the hens look into probabilities  these probabilities must have puzzled euphemia a great deal but they never disturbed her equanimity she was always as tranquil and goodhumored about her poultryyard as if every hen laid an egg every day and a henchick was hatched out of every egg  for it may be remembered that the principle underlying euphemias management of her poultry was what might be designated as the cumulative hatch that is she wished every chicken hatched in her yard to become the mother of a brood of her own during the year and every one of this brood to raise another brood the next year and so on in a kind of geometrical progression this plan called for a great many motherfowls and so euphemia based her highest hopes on a great annual preponderance of hens  we ate a good many young roosters that fall for euphemia would not allow all the products of her yard to go to market and also a great many eggs and fowls were sold she had not contented herself with her original stock of poultry but had bought fowls during the winter and she certainly had extraordinary good luck or else her extraordinary system worked extraordinarily well    chapter xiii pomonas novel   it was in the latter part of august of that year that it became necessary for some one in the office in which i was engaged to go to st louis to attend to important business everything seemed to point to me as the fit person for i understood the particular business better than any one else i felt that i ought to go but i did not altogether like to do it i went home and euphemia and i talked over the matter far into the regulation sleepinghours  there were very good reasons why we should go for of course i would not think of taking such a journey without euphemia in the first place it would be of advantage to me in my business connection to take the trip and then it would be such a charming journey for us we had never been west of the alleghanies and nearly all the country we would see would be new to us we would come home by the great lakes and niagara and the prospect was delightful to both of us but then we would have to leave rudder grange for at least three weeks and how could we do that  this was indeed a difficult question to answer who could take care of our garden our poultry our horse and cow and all their complicated belongings the garden was in admirable condition our vegetables were coming in every day in just that fresh and satisfactory conditionaltogether unknown to people who buy vegetablesfor which i had labored so faithfully and about which i had had so many cheerful anticipations as to euphemias chickenyardwith euphemia awaythe subject was too great for us we did not even discuss it but we would give up all the pleasures of our home for the chance of this most desirable excursion if we could but think of some one who would come and take care of the place while we were gone rudder grange could not run itself for three weeks  we thought of every available person old john would not do we did not feel that we could trust him we thought of several of our friends but there was in both our minds a certain shrinking from the idea of handing over the place to any of them for such a length of time for my part i said i would rather leave pomona in charge than any one else but then pomona was young and a girl euphemia agreed with me that she would rather trust her than any one else but she also agreed in regard to the disqualifications so when i went to the office the next morning we had fully determined to go on the trip if we could find some one to take charge of our place while we were gone when i returned from the office in the afternoon i had agreed to go to st louis by this time i had no choice in the matter unless i wished to interfere very much with my own interests we were to start in two days if in that time we could get any one to stay at the place very well if not pomona must assume the charge we were not able to get any one and pomona did assume the charge it is surprising how greatly relieved we felt when we were obliged to come to this conclusion the arrangement was exactly what we wanted and now that there was no help for it our consciences were easy  we felt sure that there would be no danger to pomona lord edward would be with her and she was a young person who was extraordinarily well able to take care of herself old john would be within call in case she needed him and i borrowed a bulldog to be kept in the house at night pomona herself was more than satisfied with the plan  we made out the night before we left a long and minute series of directions for her guidance in household garden and farm matters and directed her to keep a careful record of everything note worthy that might occur she was fully supplied with all the necessaries of life and it has seldom happened that a young girl has been left in such a responsible and independent position as that in which we left pomona she was very proud of it  our journey was ten times more delightful than we had expected it would be and successful in every way and yet although we enjoyed every hour of the trip we were no sooner fairly on our way home than we became so wildly anxious to get there that we reached rudder grange on wednesday whereas we had written that we would be home on thursday we arrived early in the afternoon and walked up from the station leaving our baggage to be sent in the express wagon as we approached our dear home we wanted to run we were so eager to see it  there it was the same as ever i lifted the gatelatch the gate was locked we ran to the carriagegate that was locked too just then i noticed a placard on the fence it was not printed but the lettering was large apparently made with ink and a brush it read        to be sold        for taxes   we stood and looked at each other euphemia turned pale  what does this mean said i has our landlord  i could say no more the dreadful thought arose that the place might pass away from us we were not yet ready to buy it but i did not put the thought in words there was a field next to our lot and i got over the fence and helped euphemia over then we climbed our sidefence this was more difficult but we accomplished it without thinking much about its difficulties our hearts were too full of painful apprehensions i hurried to the front door it was locked all the lower windows were shut we went around to the kitchen what surprised us more than anything else was the absence of lord edward had he been sold  before we reached the back part of the house euphemia said she felt faint and must sit down i led her to a tree near by under which i had made a rustic chair the chair was gone she sat on the grass and i ran to the pump for some water i looked for the bright tin dipper which always hung by the pump it was not there but i had a travelingcup in my pocket and as i was taking it out i looked around me there was an air of bareness over everything i did not know what it all meant but i know that my hand trembled as i took hold of the pumphandle and began to pump  at the first sound of the pumphandle i heard a deep bark in the direction of the barn and then furiously around the corner came lord edward before i had filled the cup he was bounding about me i believe the glad welcome of the dog did more to revive euphemia than the water he was delighted to see us and in a moment up came pomona running from the barn her face was radiant too we felt relieved here were two friends who looked as if they were neither sold nor ruined  pomona quickly saw that we were ill at ease and before i could put a question to her she divined the cause her countenance fell  you know said she you said you wasnt comin till tomorrow if you only had come theni was goin to have everything just exactly rightan now you had to climb in  and the poor girl looked as if she might cry which would have been a wonderful thing for pomona to do  tell me one thing said i what aboutthose taxes  oh thats all right she cried dont think another minute about that ill tell you all about it soon but come in first and ill get you some lunch in a minute  we were somewhat relieved by pomonas statement that it was all right in regard to the taxposter but we were very anxious to know all about the matter pomona however gave us little chance to ask her any questions as soon as she had made ready our lunch she asked us as a particular favor to give her threequarters of an hour to herself and then said she ill have everything looking just as if it was tomorrow  we respected her feelings for of course it was a great disappointment to her to be taken thus unawares and we remained in the diningroom until she appeared and announced that she was ready for us to go about we availed ourselves quickly of the privilege and euphemia hurried to the chickenyard while i bent my steps toward the garden and barn as i went out i noticed that the rustic chair was in its place and passing the pump i looked for the dipper it was there i asked pomona about the chair but she did not answer as quickly as was her habit  would you rather said she hear it all together when you come in or have it in little bits head and tail all of a jumble  i called to euphemia and asked her what she thought and she was so anxious to get to her chickens that she said she would much rather wait and hear it all together we found everything in perfect orderthe garden was even free from weeds a thing i had not expected if it had not been for that cloud on the front fence i should have been happy enough pomona had said it was all right but she could not have paid the taxeshowever i would wait and i went to the barn  when euphemia came in from the poultryyard she called me and said she was in a hurry to hear pomonas account of things so i went in and we sat on the side porch where it was shady while pomona producing some sheets of foolscap paper took her seat on the upper step  i wrote down the things of any account what happened said she as you told me to and while i was about it i thought id make it like a novel it would be jus as true and praps more amusin i suppose you dont mind  no we didnt mind so she went on  i havent got no name for my novel i intended to think one out tonight i wrote this all of nights and i dont read the first chapters for they tell about my birth and my parentage and my early adventures ill just come down to what happened to me while you was away because youll be more anxious to hear about that all thats written here is true jus the same as if i told it to you but ive put it into novel language because it seems to come easier to me  and then in a voice somewhat different from her ordinary tones as if the novel language demanded it she began to read  chapter five the lonely house and the faithful friend thus was i left alone none but two dogs to keep me company i milked the lowing kine and watered and fed the steed and then after my frugal repast i closed the mansion shutting out all recollections of the past and also foresights into the future that night was a memorable one i slept soundly until the break of morn but had the events transpired which afterward occurred what would have happened to me no tongue can tell early the next day nothing happened soon after breakfast the venerable john came to borrow some kerosene oil and a half a pound of sugar but his attempt was foiled i knew too well the insidious foe in the very outset of his villiany i sent him home with a empty can for two long days i wandered amid the verdant pathways of the garden and to the barn whenever and anon my duty called me nor did i ere neglect the fowlery no cloud oerspread this happy period of my life but the cloud was rising in the horizon although i saw it not  it was about twentyfive minutes after eleven on the morning of a thursday that i sat pondering in my mind the question what to do with the butter and the vegetables here was butter and here was green corn and limabeans and trophy tomats far more than i ere could use and here was a horse idly cropping the foliage in the field for as my employer had advised and ordered i had put the steed to grass and here was a wagon none too new which had it the top taken off or even the curtains rolled up would do for a licenced vender with the truck and butter and mayhap some milk i could load that wagon  o pomona interrupted euphemia you dont mean to say that you were thinking of doing anything like that  well i was just beginning to think of it said pomona but of course i couldnt have gone away and left the house and youll see i didnt do it and then she continued her novel but while my thoughts were thus employed i heard lord edward burst into barkter  at this euphemia and i could not help bursting into laughter pomona did not seem at all confused but went on with her reading  i hurried to the door and looking out i saw a wagon at the gate repairing there i saw a man said he wilt open this gate i had fastened up the gates and removed every stealable article from the yard  euphemia and i looked at each other this explained the absence of the rustic seat and the dipper  thus with my mind at ease i could let my faithful friend the dog for he it was roam with me through the grounds while the fierce bulldog guarded the mansion within then said i quite bold unto him no i let in no man here my employer and employeress are now from home what do you want then says he as bold as brass ive come to put the lightening rods upon the house open the gate what rods says i the rods as was ordered says he open the gate i stood and gazed at him full well i saw through his pinchbeck mask i knew his tricks in the absence of my employer he would put up rods and ever so many more than was wanted and likely too some miserable trash that would attrack the lightening instead of keeping it off then as it would spoil the house to take them down they would be kept and pay demanded no sir says i no lightening rods upon this house whilst i stand here and with that i walked away and let lord edward loose the man he stormed with passion his eyes flashed fire he would een have scaled the gate but when he saw the dog he did forbear as it was then near noon i strode away to feed the fowls but when i did return i saw a sight which froze the blood within my veins  the dog didnt kill him cried euphemia  oh no maam said pomona youll see that that wasnt it at one corner of the lot in front a base boy who had accompanied this man was banging on the fence with a long stick and thus attracking to hisself the rage of lord edward while the vile intriger of a lightening rodder had brought a ladder to the other side of the house up which he had now ascended and was on the roof what horrors filled my soul how my form trembled this continued pomona is the end of the novel and she laid her foolscap pages on the porch  euphemia and i exclaimed with one voice against this we had just reached the most exciting part and i added we had heard nothing yet about that affair of the taxes  you see sir said pomona it took me so long to write out the chapters about my birth my parentage and my early adventures that i hadnt time to finish up the rest but i can tell you what happened after that jus as well as if i had writ it out and so she went on much more glibly than before with the account of the doings of the lightningrod man  there was that wretch on top of the house afixin his old rods and hammerin away for dear life hed brought his ladder over the side fence where the dog abarkin and plungin at the boy outside couldnt see him i stood dumb for a minute an then i knowd i had him i rushed into the house got a piece of wellrope tied it to the bulldogs collar an dragged him out and fastened him to the bottom rung of the ladder then i walks over to the front fence with lord edwards chain for i knew that if he got at that bulldog thered be times for theyd never been allowed to see each other yet so says i to the boy im goin to tie up the dog so you neednt be afraid of his jumpin over the fencewhich he couldnt do or the boy would have been a corpse for twenty minutes or may be half an hour the boy kinder laughed and said i neednt mind which i didnt then i went to the gate and i clicked to the horse which was standin there an off he starts as good as gold an trots down the road the boy he said somethin or other pretty bad an away he goes after him but the horse was atrottin real fast an had a good start  how on earth could you ever think of doing such things said euphemia that horse might have upset the wagon and broken all the lightningrods besides running over i dont know how many people  but you see maam that wasnt my lookout said pomona i was adefendin the house and the enemy must expect to have things happen to him so then i hears an awful row on the roof and there was the man just coming down the ladder hed heard the horse go off and when he got about halfway down an caught a sight of the bulldog he was madder than ever you seed a lightninrodder in all your born days take that dog off of there he yelled at me no i wont says i i never see a girl like you since i was born he screams at me i guess it would a been better fur you if you had says i an then he was so mad he couldnt stand it any longer and he comes down as low as he could and when he saw just how long the rope waswhich was pretty shorthe made a jump and landed clear of the dog then he went on dreadful because he couldnt get at his ladder to take it away and i wouldnt untie the dog because if i had hed a torn the tendons out of that fellows legs in no time i never see a dog in such a boiling passion and yet never making no sound at all but bloodcurdlin grunts an i dont see how the rodder would a got his ladder at all if the dog hadnt made an awful jump at him and jerked the ladder down it just missed your geraniumbed and the rodder he ran to the other end of it and began pullin it away dog an all lookahere says i we can fix him now and so he cooled down enough to help me and i unlocked the front door and we pushed the bottom end of the ladder in dog and all an then i shut the door as tight as it would go an untied the end of the rope an the rodder pulled the ladder out while i held the door to keep the dog from follerin which he came pretty near doin anyway but i locked him in and then the man began stormin again about his wagon but when he looked out an see the boy comin back with itfor somebody must a stopped the horsehe stopped stormin and went to put up his ladder agin no you dont says i ill let the big dog loose next time and if i put him at the foot of your ladder youll never come down but i want to go and take down what i put up he says i aint agoin on with this job no says i you aint and you cant go up there to wrench off them rods and make rainholes in the roof neither he couldnt get no madder than he was then an fur a minute or two he couldnt speak an then he says ill have satisfaction for this an says i how an says he youll see what it is to interfere with a ordered job an says i there wasnt no order about it an says he ill show you better than that an he goes to his wagon an gits a book there says he read that what of it says i theres nobody of the name of ball lives here that took the man kinder aback and he said he was told it was the only house on the lane which i said was right only it was the next lane he oughter a gone to he said no more after that but just put his ladder in his wagon and went off but i was not altogether rid of him he left a trail of his baleful presence behind him  that horrid bulldog wouldnt let me come into the house no matter what door i tried there he was just foamin mad i let him stay till nearly night and then went and spoke kind to him but it was no good hed got an awful spite agin me i found something to eat down cellar and i made a fire outside an roasted some corn and potatoes that night i slep in the barn i wasnt afraid to be away from the house for i knew it was safe enough with that dog in it and lord edward outside for three days sunday an all i was kep out of this here house i got along pretty well with the sleepin and the eatin but the drinkin was the worst i couldnt get no coffee or tea but there was plenty of milk  why didnt you get some man to come and attend to the dog i asked it was dreadful to live that way  well i didnt know no man that could do it said pomona the dog would a been too much for old john and besides he was mad about the kerosene sunday afternoon captain atkinson and mrs atkinson and their little girl in a pushwagon come here and i told em you was gone away but they says they would stop a minute and could i give them a drink an i had nothin to give it to them but an old chickenbowl that i had washed out for even the dipper was in the house an i told em everything was locked up which was true enough though they must a thought you was a queer kind of people but i wasnt agoin to say nothin about the dog fur to tell the truth i was ashamed to do it so as soon as theyd gone i went down into the cellarand its lucky that i had the key for the outside cellar doorand i got a piece of fat cornbeef and the meataxe i unlocked the kitchen door and went in with the axe in one hand and the meat in the other the dog might take his choice i knowd he must be pretty nigh famished for there was nothin that he could get at to eat as soon as i went in he came runnin to me but i could see he was shaky on his legs he looked a sort of wicked at me and then he grabbed the meat he was all right then  oh my said euphemia i am so glad to hear that i was afraid you never got in but we saw the dogis he as savage yet  oh no said pomona nothin like it  look here pomona said i i want to know about those taxes when do they come into your story  pretty soon sir said she and she went on  after that i knowd it wouldnt do to have them two dogs so that theyd have to be tied up if they see each other just as like as not id want them both at once and then theyd go to fightin and leave me to settle with some bloodthirsty lightninrodder so as i knowd if they once had a fair fight and found out which was master theyd be good friends afterwards i thought the best thing to do would be to let em fight it out when there was nothin else for em to do so i fixed up things for the combat  why pomona cried euphemia i didnt think you were capable of such a cruel thing  it looks that way maam but really it aint replied the girl it seemed to me as if it would be a mercy to both of em to have the thing settled so i cleared away a place in front of the woodshed and unchained lord edward and then i opened the kitchen door and called the bull out he came with his teeth ashowin and his bloodshot eyes and his crooked front legs like lightnin from the mountin blast he made one bounce for the big dog and oh what a fight there was they rolled they gnashed they knocked over the woodhorse and sent chips aflyin all ways at wonst i thought lord edward would whip in a minute or two but he didnt for the bull stuck to him like a burr and they was havin it ground and lofty when i hears some one run up behind me and turnin quick there was the piscopalian minister my my my he hollers what a awful spectacle aint there no way of stoppin it no sir says i and i told him how i didnt want to stop it and the reason why then says he wheres your master and i told him how you was away isnt there any man at all about says he no says i then says he if theres nobody else to stop it i must do it myself an he took off his coat no says i you keep back sir if theres anybody to plunge into that erena the blood be mine an i put my hand without thinkin agin his black shirtbosom to hold him back but he didnt notice bein so excited now says i jist wait one minute and youll see that bulls tail go between his legs hes weakenin an sure enough lord edward got a good grab at him and was ashakin the very life out of him when i run up and took lord edward by the collar drop it says i and he dropped it for he knowd hed whipped and he was pretty tired hisself then the bulldog he trotted off with his tail ahangin down now then says i them dogs will be bosom friends forever after this ah me says he im sorry indeed that your employer for who ive always had a great respect should allow you to get into such habits that made me feel real bad and i told him mighty quick that you was the last man in the world to let me do anything like that and that if youd a been here youd a separated them dogs if theyd achawed your arms off that you was very particular about such things and that it would be a pity if he was to think you was a dogfightin gentleman when id often heard you say that now you was fixed an settled the one thing you would like most would be to be made a vestryman  i sat up straight in my chair  pomona i exclaimed you didnt tell him that  thats what i said sir for i wanted him to know what you really was an he says well well i never knew that it might be a very good thing ill speak to some of the members about it theres two vacancies now in our vestry  i was crushed but euphemia tried to put the matter into the brightest light  perhaps it may all turn out for the best she said and you may be elected and that would be splendid but it would be an awfully funny thing for a dogfight to make you a vestryman  i could not talk on this subject go on pomona i said trying to feel resigned to my shame and tell us about that poster on the fence  ill be to that almost right away she said it was two or three days after the dogfight that i was down at the barn and happenin to look over to old johns i saw that treeman there he was ashowin his book to john and him and his wife and all the young ones was astandin there drinkin down them big peaches and pears as if they was all real i knowd hed come here agin for them fellers never gives you up and i didnt know how to keep him away for i didnt want to let the dogs loose on a man what after all didnt want to do no more harm than to talk the life out of you so i just happened to notice as i came to the house how kind of desolate everything looked and i thought perhaps i might make it look worse and he wouldnt care to deal here so i thought of puttin up a poster like that for nobody whose place was agoin to be sold for taxes would be likely to want trees so i run in the house and wrote it quick and put it up and sure enough the man he come along soon and when he looked at that paper and tried the gate an looked over the fence an saw the house all shut up an not a livin soul aboutfor i had both the dogs in the house with mehe shook his head an walked off as much as to say if that man had fixed his place up proper with my trees he wouldnt a come to this an then as i found the poster worked so good i thought it might keep other people from comin abotherin around and so i left it up but i was agoin to be sure and take it down before you came  as it was now pretty late in the afternoon i proposed that pomona should postpone the rest of her narrative until evening she said that there was nothing else to tell that was very particular and i did not feel as if i could stand anything more just now even if it was very particular  when we were alone i said to euphemia  if we ever have to go away from this place again  but we wont go away she interrupted looking up to me with as bright a face as she ever had at least not for a long long long time to come and im so glad youre to be a vestryman    chapter xiv pomona takes a bridal trip   our life at rudder grange seemed to be in no way materially changed by my becoming a vestryman the cow gave about as much milk as before and the hens laid the usual number of eggs euphemia went to church with a little more of an air perhaps but as the wardens were never absent and i was never therefore called upon to assist in taking up the collection her sense of my position was not inordinately manifested  for a year or two indeed there was no radical change in anything about rudder grange except in pomona in her there was a change she grew up  she performed this feat quite suddenly she was a young girl when she first came to us and we had never considered her as anything else when one evening she had a young man to see her then we knew she had grown up  we made no objections to her visitorsshe had several from time to timefor said euphemia suppose my parents had objected to your visits i could not consider the mere possibility of anything like this and we gave pomona all the ordinary opportunities for entertaining her visitors to tell the truth i think we gave her more than the ordinary opportunities i know that euphemia would wait on herself to almost any extent rather than call upon pomona when the latter was entertaining an evening visitor in the kitchen or on the back porch  suppose my mother she once remarked in answer to a mild remonstrance from me in regard to a circumstance of this naturesuppose my mother had rushed into our presence when we were plighting our vows and had told me to go down into the cellar and crack ice  it was of no use to talk to euphemia on such subjects she always had an answer ready  you dont want pomona to go off and be married do you i asked one day as she was putting up some new muslin curtains in the kitchen you seem to be helping her to do this all you can and yet i dont know where on earth you will get another girl who will suit you so well  i dont know either replied euphemia with a tack in her mouth and im sure i dont want her to go but neither do i want winter to come or to have to wear spectacles but i suppose both of these things will happen whether i like it or not  for some time after this pomona had very little company and we began to think that there was no danger of any present matrimonial engagement on her parta thought which was very gratifying to us although we did not wish in any way to interfere with her prospectswhen one afternoon she quietly went up into the village and was married  her husband was a tall young fellow a son of a farmer in the county who had occasionally been to see her but whom she must have frequently met on her afternoons out  when pomona came home and told us this news we were certainly well surprised  what on earth are we to do for a girl cried euphemia  youre to have me till you can get another one said pomona quietly i hope you dont think id go way and leave you without anybody  but a wife ought to go to her husband said euphemia especially so recent a bride why didnt you let me know all about it i would have helped to fit you out we would have given you the nicest kind of a little wedding  i know that said pomona youre jus good enough but i didnt want to put you to all that troubleright in preservingtime too an he wanted it quiet for hes awful backward about shows an as im to go to live with his folksat least in a little house on the farmi might as well stay here as anywhere even if i didnt want to for i cant go there till after frost  why not i asked  the chills and fever said she they have it awful down in that valley why he had a chill while we was bein married right at the bridal altar  you dont say so exclaimed euphemia how dreadful  yes indeed said pomona he must a forgot it was his chillday and he didnt take his quinine and so it come on him jus as he was apromisin to love an pertect but he stuck it out at the ministers house and walked home by hisself to finish his chill  and you didnt go with him cried euphemia indignantly  he said no it was better thus he felt it werent the right thing to mingle the agur with his marriage vows he promised to take sixteen grains tomorrow and so i came away hell be all right in a month or so an then well go an keep house you see it aint likely i could help him any by goin there an gettin it myself  pomona said euphemia this is dreadful you ought to go and take a bridal tour and get him rid of those fearful chills  i never thought of that said pomona her face lighting up wonderfully  now that euphemia had fallen upon this happy idea she never dropped it until she had made all the necessary plans and had put them into execution in the course of a week she had engaged another servant and had started pomona and her husband off on a bridaltour stipulating nothing but that they should take plenty of quinine in their trunk  it was about three weeks after this and euphemia and i were sitting on our front stepsi had come home early and we had been potting some of the tenderest plantswhen pomona walked in at the gate she looked well and had on a very bright new dress euphemia noticed this the moment she came in we welcomed her warmly for we felt a great interest in this girl who had grown up in our family and under our care  have you had your bridal trip asked euphemia  oh yes said pomona its all over an done with an were settled in our house  well sit right down here on the steps and tell us all about it said euphemia in a glow of delightful expectancy and pomona nothing loth sat down and told her tale  you see said she untying her bonnet strings to give an easier movement to her chin we didnt say where we was goin when we started out for the truth was we didnt know we couldnt afford to take no big trip and yet we wanted to do the thing up jus as right as we could seein as you had set your heart on it an as we had too for that matter niagery fall was what i wanted but he said that it cost so much to see the sights there that he hadnt money to spare to take us there an pay for all the sightseein too we might go he said without seein the sights or if there was any way of seein the sights without goin that might do but he couldnt do both so we give that up and after thinkin a good deal we agreed to go to some other falls which might come cheaper an maybe be jus as good to begin on so we thought of passaic falls up to paterson an we went there an took a room at a little hotel an walked over to the falls but they wasnt no good after all for there wasnt no water runnin over em there was rocks and precipicers an direful depths and everything for a good falls except water and that was all bein used at the mills well miguel says i this is about as nice a place for a falls as ever i see but  miguel cried euphemia is that your husbands name  well no said pomona it isnt his given name is jonas but i hated to call him jonas an on a bridal trip too he might jus as well have had a more romanticer name if his parents had a thought of it so i determined id give him a better one while we was on our journey anyhow an i changed his name to miguel which was the name of a spanish count he wanted me to call him jiguel because he said that would have a kind of a floating smell of his old name but i didnt never do it well neither of us didnt care to stay about no dry falls so we went back to the hotel and got our supper and begun to wonder what we should do next day he said wed better put it off and dream about it and make up our minds nex mornin which i agreed to an that evenin as we was sittin in our room i asked miguel to tell me the story of his life he said at first it hadnt none but when i seemed a kinder put out at this he told me i mustnt mind an he would reveal the whole so he told me this story  my grandfather said he was a rich and powerful portugee alivin on the island of jamaica he had heaps o slaves an owned a black brigantine that he sailed in on secret voyages an when he come back the decks an the gunnels was often bloody but nobody knew why or wherefore he was a big man with black hair an very violent he could never have kept no help if he hadnt owned em but he was so rich that people respected him in spite of all his crimes my grandmother was a native o the isle o wight she was a frail an tender woman with yeller hair and deep blue eyes an gentle an soft an good to the poor she used to take baskits of vittles aroun to sick folks an set down on the side o their beds an read the shepherd o salisbury plains to em she hardly ever speaked above her breath an always wore white gowns with a silk kerchief afolded placidly aroun her neck them was awful different kind o people i says to him i wonder how they ever come to be married they never was married says he never married i hollers ajumpin up from my chair and you sit there carmly an look me in the eye yes says he they was never married they never met one was my mothers father and the other one my fathers mother twas well they did not wed i should think so said i an now whats the good of tellin me a thing like that  its about as near the mark as most of the stories of peoples lives i reckon says he an besides id only jus begun it  well i dont want no more says i an i jus tell this story of his to show what kind of stories he told about that time he said they was pleasant fictions but i told him that if he didnt look out hed hear em called by a good deal of a worse kind of a name than that the nex mornin he asked me what was my dream an i told him i didnt have exactly no dream about it but my idea was to have somethin real romantic for the rest of our bridal days  well says he what would you like i had a dream but it wasnt no ways romantic and ill jus fall in with whatever youd like best  all right says i an the most romanticest thing that i can think of is for us to makebelieve for the rest of this trip we can makebelieve were anything we please an if we think so in real earnest it will be pretty much the same thing as if we really was we aint likely to have no chance agin of being jus what weve a mind to an so lets try it now  what would you have a mind to be says he  well says i lets be an earl an a earless  earless says he theres no such a person  why yes there is of course i says to him whats a sheearl if she isnt a earless  well i dont know says he never havin lived with any of em but well let it go at that an how do you want to work the thing out  this way says i you miguel  jiguel says he  the earl says i not mindin his interruption an me your noble earless will go to some good place or otherit dont matter much jus where and whatever house we live in well call our castle an well consider its got drawbridges an portcullises an moats an secrit dungeons an well remember our noble ancesters an behave accordin an the people we meet we can make into counts and dukes and princes without their knowin anything about it an we can think our clothes is silk an satin an velwet all covered with dimuns an precious stones jus as well as not  jus as well says he  an then i went on we can go an have chivalrous adventuresor make believe were havin eman build up a atmosphere of romanticness aroun us thatll carry us back  to ole virginny says he  no says i for thousands of years or at least enough back for the times of tournaments and chivalry  an so your idea is that we make believe all these things an dont pay for none of em is it says he  yes says i an you miguel  jiguel says he  can ask me if you dont know what chivalric or romantic thing you ought to do or to say so as to feel yourself truly an reely a earl for ive read a lot about these people an know jus what ought to be did  well he set himself down an thought a while an then he says all right well do that an well begin tomorrow mornin for ive got a little business to do in the city which wouldnt be exactly the right thing for me to stoop to after im a earl so ill go in an do it while im a common person an come back this afternoon an you can walk about an look at the dry falls an amuse yourself genrally till i come back  all right says i an off he goes  he come back afore dark an the nex mornin we got ready to start off  have you any particular place to go says he  no says i one place is as likely to be as good as another for our style o thing if it dont suit we can imagine it does  thatll do says he an we had our trunk sent to the station and walked ourselves when we got there he says to me  which number will you have five or seven  either one will suit me earl miguel says i  jiguel says he an well make it seven an now ill go an look at the timetable an well buy tickets for the seventh station from here the seventh station says he comin back is pokus well go to pokus  so when the train come we got in an got out at pokus it was a pretty sort of a place out in the country with the houses scattered a long ways apart like stingy chickenfeed  lets walk down this road says he till we come to a good house for a castle an then we can ask em to take us to board an if they wont do it well go to the next an so on  all right says i glad enough to see how pat he entered into the thing  we walked a good ways an passed some little houses that neither of us thought would do without more imaginin than would pay till we came to a pretty big house near the river which struck our fancy in a minute it was a stone house an it had trees aroun it there was a garden with a wall an things seemed to suit firstrate so we made up our minds right off that wed try this place  you wait here under this tree says he an ill go an ask em if theyll take us to board for a while  so i waits an he goes up to the gate an pretty soon he comes out an says all right theyll take us an theyll send a man with a wheelbarrer to the station for our trunk so in we goes the man was a countrylike lookin man an his wife was a very pleasant woman the house wasnt furnished very fine but we didnt care for that an they gave us a big room that had rafters instid of a ceilin an a big fireplace an that i said was jus exacly what we wanted the room was almos like a donjon itself which he said he reckoned had once been a kitchin but i told him that a earl hadnt nothin to do with kitchins an that this was a tapestry chamber an id tell him all about the strange figgers on the embroidered hangins when the shadders begun to fall  it rained a little that afternoon an we stayed in our room an hung our clothes an things about on nails an hooks an made believe they was armor an ancient trophies an portraits of a long line of ancesters i did most of the makebelievin but he agreed to evrything the man who kep the houses wife brought us our supper about dark because she said she thought we might like to have it together cozy an so we did an was glad enough of it an after supper we sat before the fireplace where we madebelieve the flames was aroarin an cracklin an alightin up the bright places on the armor ahangin aroun while the stormwhich we madebelievewas aragin an whirlin outside i told him a long story about a lord an a lady which was two or three stories i had read run together an we had a splendid time it all seemed real real to me    chapter xv in which two new friends disport themselves   the nex mornin was fine an nice continued pomona an after our breakfast had been brought to us we went out in the grounds to take a walk there was lots of trees back of the house with walks among em an altogether it was so oletimey an castleish that i was as happy as a lark  come along earl miguel i says let us tread a measure neath these mantlin trees  all right says he your jiguel attends you an what might our noble second name be what is we earl an earless of  oh anything says i lets take any name at random  all right says he let it be random earl an earless random come along  so we walks about i feelin mighty noble an springy an afore long we sees another couple awalkin about under the trees  whos them says i  dont know says he but i expect theyre some o the other boarders the man said he had other boarders when i spoke to him about takin us  lets makebelieve theyre a count an count says i count an countess of  milwaukee says he  i didnt think much of this for a noble name but still it would do well enough an so we called em the count an countess of milwaukee an we kep on a meanderin pretty soon he gets tired an says he was agoin back to the house to have a smoke because he thought it was time to have a little fun which werent all imaginations an i says to him to go along but it would be the hardest thing in this world for me to imagine any fun in smokin he laughed an went back while i walked on amakinbelieve a page in blue puffed breeches was aholdin up my train which was of lightgreen velvet trimmed with silver lace pretty soon turnin a little corner i meets the count and countess of milwaukee she was a small lady dressed in black an he was a big fat man about fifty years old with a grayish beard they both wore little straw hats exacly alike an had on green carpetslippers  they stops when they sees me an the lady she bows and says goodmornin an then she smiles very pleasant an asks if i was alivin here an when i said i was she says she was too for the present an what was my name i had half a mind to say the earless random but she was so pleasant and sociable that i didnt like to seem to be makin fun an so i said i was mrs de henderson  an i says she am mrs general andrew jackson widow of the expresident of the united states i am staying here on business connected with the united states bank this is my brother says she pointin to the big man  how dye do says he aputtin his hands together turnin his toes out an makin a funny little bow i am general tom thumb he says in a deep gruff voice an ive been before all the crowned heads of europe asia africa america an australiaall as but onean im waitin here for a team of four little milkwhite oxen no bigger than tall cats which is to be hitched to a little haywagon which i am to ride in with a little pitchfork an real farmers clothes only small this will come tomorrow when i will pay for it an ride away to exhibit it may be here now an i will go an see goodbye  goodbye likewise says the lady i hope youll have all youre thinkin youre havin an more too but less if youd like it farewell an away they goes  well you may be sure i stood there amazed enough an mad too when i heard her talk about my bein all i was athinkin i was i was sure my husbandscarce two weeks old a husbandhad told all it was too bad i wished i had jus said i was the earless of random an brassed it out  i rushed back an foun him smokin a pipe on a back porch i charged him with his perfidy but he vowed so earnest that he had not told these people of our fancies or ever had spoke to em that i had to believe him  i expec says he that theyre jus makinbelieveas we are there aint no patent on makebelieves  this didnt satisfy me an as he seemed to be so careless about it i walked away an left him to his pipe i determined to go take a walk along some of the country roads an think this thing over for myself i went aroun to the front gate where the woman of the house was astandin talkin to somebody an i jus bowed to her for i didnt feel like sayin anything an walked past her  hello said she jumpin in front of me an shuttin the gate you cant go out here if you want to walk you can walk about in the grounds theres lots of shady paths  cant go out says i cant go out what do you mean by that  i mean jus what i say said she an she locked the gate  i was so mad that i could have pushed her over an broke the gate but i thought that if there was anything of that kind to do i had a husband whose business it was to attend to it an so i runs aroun to him to tell him he had gone in but i met mrs jackson an her brother  whats the matter said she seein what a hurry i was in  that woman at the gate i said almost chokin as i spoke wont let me out  she wont said mrs jackson well thats a way she has four times the bank of the united states has closed its doors before i was able to get there on account of that womans obstinacy about the gate indeed i have not been to the bank at all yet for of course it is of no use to go after banking hours  an i believe too said her brother in his heavy voice that she has kept out my team of little oxen otherwise it would be here now  i couldnt stand any more of this an ran into our room where my husband was when i told him what had happened he was real sorry  i didnt know you thought of going out he said or i would have told you all about it an now sit down an quiet yourself an ill tell you jus how things is so down we sits an says he jus as carm as a summer cloud my dear this is a lunertic asylum now dont jump he says i didnt bring you here because i thought you was crazy but because i wanted you to see what kind of people they was who imagined themselves earls and earlesses an all that sort o thing an to have an idea how the thing worked after youd been doing it a good while an had got used to it i thought it would be a good thing while i was earl jiguel and you was a noble earless to come to a place where people acted that way i knowed you had read lots o books about knights and princes an bloody towers an that you knowed all about them things but i didnt suppose you did know how them same things looked in these days an a lunertic asylum was the only place where you could see em so i went to a doctor i knowed he says an got a certificate from him to this private institution where we could stay for a while an get posted on romantics  then says i the upshot was that you wanted to teach a lesson  jus that says he  all right says i its teached an now lets get out of this as quick as we kin  thatll suit me he says an well leave by the noon train ill go an see about the trunk bein sent down  so off he went to see the man who kept the house while i falls to packin up the trunk as fast as i could  werent you dreadfully angry at him asked euphemia who having a romantic streak in her own composition did not sympathize altogether with this heroic remedy for pomonas disease  no maam said pomona not long when i thought of mrs general jackson and tom thumb i couldnt help thinkin that i must have looked pretty much the same to my husband who i knowed now had only been makinbelieve to makebelieve an besides i couldnt be angry very long for laughin for when he come back in a minute as mad as a march hare an said they wouldnt let me out nor him nuther i fell to laughin ready to crack my sides  they say said he as soon as he could speak straight that we cant go out without another certificate from the doctor i told em id go myself an see him about it but they said no i couldnt for if they did that way everybody who ever was sent here would be goin out the next day to see about leavin i didnt want to make no fuss so i told them id write a letter to the doctor and tell him to send an order that would soon show them whether we could go out or not they said that would be the best thing to do an so im goin to write it this minutewhich he did  how long will we have to wait says i when the letter was done  well says he the doctor cant get this before tomorrow mornin an even if he answers right away we wont get our order to go out until the next day so well jus have to grin an bear it for a day an a half  this is a lively old bridaltrip said idry falls an a lunertic asylum  well try to make the rest of it better said he  but the next day wasnt no better we staid in our room all day for we didnt care to meet mrs jackson an her crazy brother an im sure we didnt want to see the mean creatures who kept the house we knew well enough that they only wanted us to stay so that they could get more boardmoney out of us  i should have broken out cried euphemia i would never have staid an hour in that place after i found out what it was especially on a bridal trip  if wed done that said pomona theyd have got men after us an then everybody would have thought we was real crazy we made up our minds to wait for the doctors letter but it wasnt much fun an i didnt tell no romantic stories to fill up the time we sat down an behaved like the commonest kind o people you never saw anybody sicker of romantics than i was when i thought of them two loons that called themselves mrs andrew jackson and general tom thumb i dropped miguel altogether an he dropped jiguel which was a relief to me an i took strong to jonas even callin him jone which i consider a good deal uglier an commoner even than jonas he didnt like this much but said that if it would help me out of the miguel he didnt care  well on the mornin of the next day i went into the little front room that they called the office to see if there was a letter for us yet an there wasnt nobody there to ask but i saw a pile of letters under a weight on the table an i jus looked at these to see if one of em was for us an if there wasnt the very letter jone had written to the doctor theyd never sent it i rushes back to jone an tells him an he jus set an looked at me without sayin a word i didnt wonder he couldnt speak  ill go an let them people know what i think of em says i  dont do that said jone catchin me by the sleeve it wont do no good leave the letter there an dont say nothin about it well stay here till afternoon quite quiet an then well go away that garden wall isnt high  an how about the trunk says i  oh well take a few things in our pockets an lock up the trunk an ask the doctor to send for it when we get to the city  all right says i an we went to work to get ready to leave  about five oclock in the afternoon when it was a nice time to take a walk under the trees we meandered quietly down to a corner of the back wall where jone thought it would be rather convenient to get over he hunted up a short piece of board which he leaned up agin the wall an then he put his foot on the top of that an got hold of the top of the wall an climbed up as easy as nuthin then he reached down to help me step onto the board but jus as he was agoin to take me by the hand hello says he look athere an i turned round an looked an if there wasnt mrs andrew jackson an general tom thumb awalkin down the path  what shall we do says i  come along says he we aint agoin to stop for them get up all the same  i tried to get up as he said but it wasnt so easy for me on account of my not bein such a high stepper as jone an i was a good while agettin a good footin on the board  mrs jackson an the general they came right up to us an set down on a bench which was fastened between two trees near the wall an there they set alookin steady at us with their four little eyes like four empty thimbles  you appear to be goin away says mrs jackson  yes says jone from the top of the wall were agoin to take a slight stroll outside this salubrious evenin  do you think says she that the united states bank would be open this time of day  oh no says jone the banks all close at three oclock its a good deal after that now  but if i told the officers who i was wouldnt that make a difference says she wouldnt they go down an open the bank  not much says jone givin a pull which brought me right up to the top o the wall an almost clean down the other side with one jerk i never knowed no officers that would do that but says he a kind o shuttin his eyes so that she shouldnt see he was lyin well talk about that when we come back  if you see that team of little oxen says the big man send em round to the front gate  all right says jone an he let me down the outside of the wall as if i had been a bag o horsefeed  but if the bank isnt open you cant pay for it when it does come we heard the old lady asayin as we hurried off  we didnt lose no time agoin down to that station an its lucky we didnt for a train for the city was comin jus as we got there an we jumped aboard without havin no time to buy tickets there wasnt many people in our car an we got a seat together  now then says jone as the cars went abuzzin along i feel as if i was really on a bridaltrip which i mus say i didnt at that there asylum  an then i said i should think not an we both bust out alaughin as well we might feelin sich a change of surroundins  do you think says somebody behind us when wed got through laughin that if i was to send a boy up to the cashier he would either come down or send me the key of the bank  we both turned aroun as quick as lightnin an if there wasnt them two lunertics in the seat behind us  it nearly took our breaths away to see them settin there staring at us with their thimble eyes an awearin their little straw hats both alike  how on the livin earth did you two got here says i as soon as i could speak  oh we come by the same way you comeby the temperary stairs says mrs jackson we thought if it was too late to draw any money tonight it might be well to be on hand bright an early in the mornin an so we follered you two as close as we could because we knew you could take us right to the very bank doors an we didnt know the way ourselves not never havin had no occasion to attend to nothin of this kind before  jone an i looked at each other but we didnt speak for a minute  then says i heres a pretty kittle o fish  i should kinder say so says jone weve got these here two lunertics on our hands sure enough for there aint no train back to pokus tonight an i wouldnt go back with em if there was we must keep an eye on em till we can see the doctor tomorrow  i suppose we must said i but this dont seem as much like a bridaltrip as it did a while ago  youre right there says jone  when the conductor came along we had to pay the fare of them two lunertics besides our own for neither of em had a cent about em when we got to town we went to a smallish hotel near the ferry where jone knowed the man who kep it who wouldnt bother about none of us havin a scrap of baggage knowin hed get his money all the same out of either jone or his father the general an his sister looked a kind o funny in their little straw hats an green carpetslippers an the clerk didnt know whether he hadnt forgot how to read writin when the big man put down the names of general tom thumb and mrs expresident andrew jackson which he wasnt expresident anyway bein dead but jone he whispered they was travelin under nommys dess plummys i told him to say that an he would fix it all right in the mornin an then we got some supper which it took them two lunertics a long time to eat for they was all the time forgettin what particular kind o business they was about an then we was showed to our rooms they had two rooms right across the hall from ours we hadnt been inside our room five minutes before mrs general jackson come aknockin at the door  look ahere she says to me theres a unforeseen contingency in my room an it smells  so i went right in an sure enough it did smell for she had turned on all the gases besides the one that was lighted  what did you do that for says i aturnin them off as fast as i could  id like to know what theyre made for says she if they isnt to be turned on  when i told jone about this he looked real serious an jus then a waiter came upstairs an went into the big mans room in a minute he come out an says to jone an me agrinnin  we cant suit him no better in this house  what does he want asks jone  why he wants a smaller bed says the waiter he says he cant sleep in a bed as big as that an we havent none smaller in this house which he couldnt get into if we had in my opinion says he  all right says jone jus you go downstairs an ill fix him so the man goes off still agrinnin i tell you what it is says jone it wont do to let them two lunertics have rooms to themselves theyll set this house afire or turn it upside down in the middle of the night if they has theres nuthin to be done but for you to sleep with the woman an for me to sleep with the man an to keep em from cuttin up till mornin  so jone he went into the room where general tom thumb was asettin with his hat on alookin doleful at the bed an says he  whats the matter with the bed  oh its too large entirely says the general it wouldnt do for me to sleep in a bed like that it would ruin my character as a genuine thumb  well says jone its nearly two times too big for you but if you an me was both to sleep in it it would be about right wouldnt it  oh yes says the general an he takes off his hat an jone says goodnight to me an shuts the door our room was better than mrs general jacksons so i takes her in there an the fust thing she does is to turn on all the gases  stop that i hollers if you do that againillill break the united states bank tomorrow  howll you do that says she  ill draw out all my capital says i  i hope really you wont says she till ive been there an she leans out of the open winder to look into the street but while she was alookin out i see her left hand acreepin up to the gas by the winder that wasnt lighted i felt mad enough to take her by the feet an pitch her out as you an the boarder said pomona turning to me histed me out of the canalboat winder  this by the way was the first intimation we had had that pomona knew how she came to fall out of that window  but i didnt do it she continued for there wasnt no soft water underneath for her to fall into after we went to bed i kep awake for a long time bein afraid shed get up in the night an turn on all the gases and smother me alive but i fell asleep at last an when i woke up early in the mornin the first thing i did was to feel for that lunertic but she was gone    chapter xvi in which an old friend appears and the bridal trip takes a fresh start   gone cried euphemia who with myself had been listening most intently to pomonas story  yes continued pomona she was gone i give one jump out of bed and felt the gases but they was all right but she was gone an her clothes was gone i dressed as pale as death i do expect an hurried to jones room an he an me an the big man was all ready in no time to go an look for her general tom thumb didnt seem very anxious but we made him hurry up an come along with us we couldnt afford to leave him nowheres the clerk downstairsa different one from the chap who was there the night beforesaid that a middleaged elderly lady came down about an hour before an asked him to tell her the way to the united states bank an when he told her he didnt know of any such bank she jus stared at him an wanted to know what he was put there for so he didnt have no more to say to her an she went out an he didnt take no notice which way she went we had the same opinion about him that mrs jackson had but we didnt stop to tell him so we hunted up an down the streets for an hour or more we asked every policeman we met if hed seen her we went to a police station we did everything we could think of but no mrs jackson turned up then we was so tired an hungry that we went into some place or other an got our breakfast when we started out agin we kep on up one street an down another an askin everybody who looked as if they had two grains of sensewhich most of em didnt look as if they had morn one an that was in use to get em to where they was goin at last a little ways down a small street we seed a crowd an the minute we see it jone an me both said in our inside hearts there she is an sure enough when we got there who should we see with a ring of streetloafers an boys around her but mrs andrew jackson with her little straw hat an her green carpetslippers adancin some kind of a skippin fandango an aholdin out her skirts with the tips of her fingers i was jus agoin to rush in an grab her when a man walks quick into the ring and touches her on the shoulder the minute i seed him i knowed him it was our old boarder  it was exclaimed euphemia  yes it was truly him an i didnt want him to see me there in such company an he most likely knowin i was on my bridaltrip an so i made a dive at my bonnet to see if i had a vail on an findin one i hauled it down  madam says the boarder very respectful to mrs jackson where do you live cant i take you home no sir says she at least not now if you have a carriage you may come for me after a while i am waiting for the bank of the united states to open an until which time i must support myself on the light fantastic toe an then she tuk up her skirts an begun to dance agin but she didnt make morn two skips before i rushed in an takin her by the arm hauled her out o the ring an then up comes the big man with his face as red as fire look here says he to her as if he was ready to eat her up did you draw every cent of that money not yet not yet says she you did you purseproud cantalope says he you know very well you did an now id like to know where my oxmoney is to come from but jone an me didnt intend to wait for no sich talk as this an he tuk the man by the arm and i tuk the old woman an we jus walked em off the boarder he told the loafers to get out an go home an none of em follered us for they knowd if they did hed a batted em over the head but he comes up alongside o me as i was a walkin behind with mrs jackson an says he how dye do pomona i must say i felt as if i could slip in between two flagstones but as i couldnt get away i said i was pretty well i heared you was on your bridal trip says he agin is this it it was jus like him to know that an as there was no help for it i said it was is that your husband says he pointin to jone yes says i it was very good in him to come along says he is these two your groomsman and bridesmaid no sir says i theyre crazy no wonder says he its enough to drive em so to see you two an then he went ahead an shook hands with jone an told him hed knowd me a long time but he didnt say nuthin about havin histed me out of a winder for which i was obliged to him an then he come back to me an says he goodmornin i must go to the office i hope youll have a good time for the rest of your trip if you happen to run short o lunertics jus let me know and ill furnish you with another pair all right says i but you mustnt bring your little girl along  he kinder laughed at this as we walked away an then he turned around an come back and says he have you been to any theayters or anything since youve been in town no says i not one well says he you ought to go which do you like best the theayter the circus or wildbeasts i did really like the theayter best havin thought of bein a playactor as you know but i considered id better let that kind o thing slide jus now as bein a little too romantic right after the sylum an so i says ive been once to a circus an once to a wildbeast garden an i like em both i hardly know which i like bestthe roarin beasts aprancin about in their cages with the smell of blood an hay an the towerin elephants or the horses an the music an the gauzy figgers at the circus an the splendid knights in armor an flashin pennants all on fiery steeds aplungin agin the sides of the ring with their flags aflyin in the grand entry says i real excited with what i remembered about these shows  well says he i dont wonder at your feelins an now heres two tickets for tonight which you an your husband can have if you like for i cant go theyre to a meetin of the hudson county entermological society over to hoboken at eight oclock  over to hoboken says i thats a long way  oh no it isnt says he an it wont cost you a cent but the ferry they couldnt have them shows in the city for if the creatures was to get loose theres no knowin what might happen so take em an have as much fun as you can for the rest of your trip goodbye an off he went  well we kep straight on to the doctors an glad we was when we got there an mad he was when we lef mrs jackson an the general on his hands for we wouldnt have no more to do with em an he couldnt help undertaking to see that they got back to the asylum i thought at first he wouldnt lift a finger to get us our trunk but he cooled down after a bit an said he hoped wed try some different kind of institution for the rest of our trip which we said we thought we would  that afternoon we gawked around alookin at all the outside shows for jone said hed have to be pretty careful of his money now an he was glad when i told him i had two free tickets in my pocket for a show in the evenin  as we was awalkin down to the ferry after supper says he  suppose you let me have a look at them tickets  so i hands em to him he reads one of em and then he reads the other which he neednt a done for they was both alike an then he turns to me an says he  what kind of a man is your boarderaswas  it wasnt the easiest thing in the world to say jus what he was but i give jone the idea in a general sort of way that he was pretty lively  so i should think says he hes been tryin a trick on us and sendin us to the wrong place its rather late in the season for a show of the kind but the place we ought to go to is a potatofield  what on earth are you talkin about says i dumbfoundered  well says he its a trick hes been playin he thought a bridal trip like ours ought to have some sort of a outlandish windup an so he sent us to this place which is a meetin of chaps who are agoin to talk about insecsprincipally potatobugs i expecan anything stupider than that i spose your boarderaswas couldnt think of without havin a good deal o time to consider  its jus like him says i lets turn round and go back which we did prompt  we gave the tickets to a little boy who was sellin papers but i dont believe he went  now then says jone after hed been thinkin awhile therell be no more foolin on this trip ive blocked out the whole of the rest of it an well wind up a sight better than that boarderaswas has any idea of tomorrow well go to fathers an if the old gentleman has got any money on the crops which i expec he has by this time ill take up a part o my share an well have a trip to washington an see the president an congress an the white house an the lamp always aburnin before the supreme court an  dont say no more says i its splendid  so early the nex day we goes off jus as fast as trains would take us to his fathers an we hadnt been there morn ten minutes before jone found out he had been summoned on a jury  when must you go says i when he come lookin a kind o pale to tell me this  right off says he the court meets this mornin if i dont hurry up ill have some of em after me but i wouldnt cry about it i dont believe the casell last moren a day  the old man harnessed up an took jone to the courthouse an i went too for i might as well keep up the idea of a bridaltrip as not i went up into the gallery and jone he was set among the other men in the jurybox  the case was about a man named brown who married the halfsister of a man named adams who afterward married browns mother and sold brown a house he had got from browns grandfather in trade for half a gristmill which the other half of was owned by adamss halfsisters first husband who left all his property to a soup society in trust till his son should come of age which he never did but left a will which give his half of the mill to brown and the suit was between brown and adams and brown again and adamss halfsister who was divorced from brown and a man named ramsey who had put up a new overshot wheel to the gristmill  oh my exclaimed euphemia how could you remember all that  i heard it so often i couldnt help remembering it replied pomona and she went on with her narrative  that case wasnt a easy one to understand as you may see for yourselves and it didnt get finished that day they argyed over it a full week when there wasnt no more witnesses to carve up one lawyer made a speech an he set that crooked case so straight that you could see through it from the overshot wheel clean back to browns grandfather then another feller made a speech and he set the whole thing up another way it was jus as clear to look through but it was another case altogether no more like the other one than a applepie is like a mug o cider an then they both took it up an they swung it around between them till it was all twisted an knotted an wound up an tangled worse than a skein o yarn in a nest o kittens an then they give it to the jury  well when them jurymen went out there wasnt none of em as jone tole me afterward as knew whether is was brown or adams as was dead or whether the mill was to grind soup or to be run by souppower of course they couldnt agree three of em wanted to give a verdict for the boy that died two of em was for browns grandfather an the rest was scattered some goin in for damages to the witnesses who ought to get somethin for havin their characters ruined jone he jus held back ready to jine the other eleven as soon as theyd agree but they couldnt do it an they was locked up three days and four nights youd better believe i got pretty wild about it but i come to court every day an waited an waited bringin somethin to eat in a baskit  one day at dinnertime i seed the judge astandin at the courtroom door awipin his forrid with a handkerchief an i went up to him an said do you think sir theyll get through this thing soon  i cant say indeed said he are you interested in the case  i should think i was said i an then i told him about jones bein a juryman an how we was on our bridaltrip  youve got my sympathy madam says he but its a difficult case to decide an i dont wonder it takes a good while  nor i nuther says i an my opinion about these things is that if youd jus have them lawyers shut up in another room an make em do their talkin to theirselves the jury could keep their minds clear and settle the cases in no time  theres some sense in that madam says he an then he went into court agin  jone never had no chance to jine in with the other fellers for they couldnt agree an they were all discharged at last so the whole thing went for nuthin  when jone come out he looked like hed been drawn through a pumplog an he says to me tiredlike  has there been a frost  yes says i two of em  all right then says he ive had enough of bridaltrips with their dry falls their lunatic asylums and their juryboxes lets go home and settle down we neednt be afraid now that theres been a frost  oh why will you live in such a dreadful place cried euphemia you ought to go somewhere where you neednt be afraid of chills  thats jus what i thought maam returned pomona but jone an me got a diseasemap of this country an we looked all over it careful an wherever there wasnt chills there was somethin that seemed a good deal wuss to us an says jone if im to have anything the matter with me give me somethin im used to it dont do for a man o my time o life to go changin his diseases  so home we went an there we is now an as this is the end of the bridaltrip story ill go an take a look at the cow an the chickens an the horse if you dont mind  which we didntand we gladly went with her over the estate    chapter xvii in which we take a vacation and look for david dutton   it was about noon of a very fair july day in the next summer when euphemia and myself arrived at the little town where we were to take the stage up into the mountains we were off for a two weeks vacation and our minds were a good deal easier than when we went away before and left pomona at the helm we had enlarged the boundaries of rudder grange having purchased the house with enough adjoining land to make quite a respectable farm of course i could not attend to the manifold duties on such a place and my wife seldom had a happier thought than when she proposed that we should invite pomona and her husband to come and live with us pomona was delighted and jonas was quite willing to run our farm so arrangements were made and the young couple were established in apartments in our back building and went to work as if taking care of us and our possessions was the ultimate object of their lives jonas was such a steady fellow that we feared no trouble from treeman or lightning rodder during this absence  our destination was a country tavern on the stageroad not far from the point where the road crosses the ridge of the mountainrange and about sixteen miles from the town we had heard of this tavern from a friend of ours who had spent a summer there the surrounding country was lovely and the house was kept by a farmer who was a good soul and tried to make his guests happy these were generally passing farmers and wagoners or stagepassengers stopping for a meal but occasionally a person from the cities like our friend came to spend a few weeks in the mountains  so hither we came for an outoftheworld spot like this was just what we wanted when i took our places at the stageoffice i inquired for david dutton the farmer tavernkeeper before mentioned but the agent did not know of him  however said he the driver knows everybody on the road and hell set you down at the house  so off we started having paid for our tickets on the basis that we were to ride about sixteen miles we had seats on top and the trip although slowfor the road wound uphill steadilywas a delightful one our way lay for the greater part of the time through the woods but now and then we came to a farm and a turn in the road often gave us lovely views of the foothills and the valleys behind us  but the driver did not know where duttons tavern was this we found out after we had started some persons might have thought it wiser to settle this matter before starting but i am not at all sure that it would have been so we were going to this tavern and did not wish to go anywhere else if people did not know where it was it would be well for us to go and look for it we knew the road that it was on and the locality in which it was to be found  still it was somewhat strange that a stagedriver passing along the road every weekdayone day one way and the next the other wayshould not know a publichouse like duttons  if i remember rightly i said the stage used to stop there for the passengers to take supper  well then it aint on this side o the ridge said the driver we stop for supper about a quarter of a mile on the other side at pete lowrys perhaps dutton used to keep that place was it called the ridge house  i did not remember the name of the house but i knew very well that it was not on the other side of the ridge  then said the driver im sure i dont know where it is but ive only been on the road about a year and your man may a moved away afore i come but there aint no tavern this side the ridge arter ye leave delhi and thats nowheres nigh the ridge  there were a couple of farmers who were sitting by the driver and who had listened with considerable interest to this conversation presently one of them turned around to me and said  is it dave dutton yere askin about  yes i replied thats his name  well i think hes dead said he  at this i began to feel uneasy and i could see that my wife shared my trouble  then the other farmer spoke up  i dont believe hes dead hiram said he to his companion i heered of him this spring hes got a sheepfarm on the other side o the mountain and hes a livin there thats what i heered at any rate but he dont live on this road any more he continued turning to us he used to keep tavern on this road and the stages did used to stop fur supperor else dinner i dont jist reecollect which but he dont keep tavern on this road no more  of course not said his companion if hes a livin over the mountain but i blieve hes dead  i asked the other farmer if he knew how long it had been since dutton had left this part of the country  i dont know fur certain he said but i know he was keeping tavern here two year ago this fall fur i came along here myself and stopped there to git supperor dinner i dont jist reecollect which  it had been three years since our friend had boarded at duttons house there was no doubt that the man was not living at his old place now my wife and i now agreed that it was very foolish in us to come so far without making more particular inquiries but we had had an idea that a man who had a place like duttons tavern would live there always  what are ye goin to do asked the driver very much interested for it was not every day that he had passengers who had lost their destination ye might go on to lowrys he takes boarders sometimes  but lowrys did not attract us an ordinary countrytavern where stagepassengers took supper was not what we came so far to find  do you know where this house o duttons is said the driver to the man who had once taken either dinner or supper there  oh yes id know the house well enough if i saw it its the fust house this side o lowrys  with a big pole in front of it asked the driver  yes there was a signpole in front of it  an a long porch  yes  oh well said the driver settling himself in his seat i know all about that house thats a empty house i didnt think you meant that house theres nobody lives there an yit now i come to remember i have seen people about too i tell ye what ye better do since yere so set on staying on this side the ridge ye better let me put ye down at dan carsons place thats jist about quarter of a mile from where dutton used to live dans wife can tell ye all about the duttons an about everybody else too in this part o the country and if there aint nobody livin at the old tavern ye can stay all night at carsons and ill stop an take you back tomorrow when i come along  we agreed to this plan for there was nothing better to be done and late in the afternoon we were set down with our small trunkfor we were traveling under light weightat dan carsons door the stage was rather behind time and the driver whipped up and left us to settle our own affairs he called back however that he would keep a good lookout for us tomorrow  mrs carson soon made her appearance and very naturally was somewhat surprised to see visitors with their baggage standing on her little porch she was a plain coarsely dressed woman with an apron full of chips and kindling wood and a fine mind for detail as we soon discovered  jist so said she putting down the chips and inviting us to seats on a bench dave duttons folks is all moved away dave has a good farm on the other side o the mountain an it never did pay him to keep that tavern specially as he didnt sell liquor when he went away his son al come there to live with his wife an the old man left a good deal o furniter and things fur him but als wife aint satisfied here and though theyve been here off an on the house is shet up most o the time its fur sale an to rent both ef anybody wants it im sorry about you too fur it was a nice tavern when dave kept it  we admitted that we were also very sorry and the kindhearted woman showed a great deal of sympathy  you might stay here but we haint got no fit room where you two could sleep  at this euphemia and i looked very blank but you could go up to the house and stay jist as well as not mrs carson continued theres plenty o things there an i keep the key for the matter o that ye might take the house for as long as ye want to stay dave d be glad enough to rent it and if the lady knows how to keep house it wouldnt be no trouble at all jist for you two we could let ye have all the victuals yed want cheap and theres plenty o wood there cut and everything handy  we looked at each other we agreed here was a chance for a rare good time it might be better perhaps than anything we had expected  the bargain was struck mrs carson who seemed vested with all the necessary powers of attorney appeared to be perfectly satisfied with our trustworthiness and when i paid on the spot the small sum she thought proper for two weeks rent she evidently considered she had done a very good thing for dave dutton and herself  ill jist put some bread an eggs an coffee an pork an things in a basket an ill have em took up fur ye with yer trunk an ill go with ye an take some milk here danny she cried and directly her husband a long thin sunburnt sandyheaded man appeared and to him she told in a few words our story and ordered him to hitch up the cart and be ready to take our trunk and the basket up to duttons old house  when all was ready we walked up the hill followed by danny and the cart we found the house a large low oldfashioned farmhouse standing near the road with a long piazza in front and a magnificent view of mountaintops in the rear within the lower rooms were large and low with quite a good deal of furniture in them there was no earthly reason why we should not be perfectly jolly and comfortable here the more we saw the more delighted we were at the odd experience we were about to have mrs carson busied herself in getting things in order for our supper and general accommodation she made danny carry our trunk to a bedroom in the second story and then set him to work building a fire in a great fireplace with a crane for the kettle  when she had done all she could it was nearly dark and after lighting a couple of candles she left us to go home and get supper for her own family  as she and danny were about to depart in the cart she ran back to ask us if we would like to borrow a dog  there aint nuthin to be afeard of she said for nobody hardly ever takes the trouble to lock the doors in these parts but bein city folks i thought ye might feel better if ye had a dog  we made haste to tell her that we were not city folks but declined the dog indeed euphemia remarked that she would be much more afraid of a strange dog than of robbers  after supper which we enjoyed as much as any meal we ever ate in our lives we each took a candle and after arranging our bedroom for the night we explored the old house there were lots of curious things everywherethings that were apparently so old timey as my wife remarked that david dutton did not care to take them with him to his new farm and so left them for his son who probably cared for them even less than his father did there was a garret extending over the whole house and filled with old spinningwheels and strings of onions and all sorts of antiquated bricabrac which was so fascinating to me that i could scarcely tear myself away from it but euphemia who was dreadfully afraid that i would set the whole place on fire at length prevailed on me to come down  we slept soundly that night in what was probably the best bedroom of the house and awoke with a feeling that we were about to enter on a period of some uncommon kind of jollity which we found to be true when we went down to get breakfast i made the fire euphemia made the coffee and mrs carson came with cream and some fresh eggs the good woman was in high spirits she was evidently pleased at the idea of having neighbors temporary though they were and it had probably been a long time since she had had such a chance of selling milk eggs and sundries it was almost the same as opening a country store we bought groceries and everything of her  we had a glorious time that day we were just starting out for a mountain stroll when our stagedriver came along on his down trip  hello he called out want to go back this morning  not a bit of it i cried we wont go back for a couple of weeks weve settled here for the present  the man smiled he didnt seem to understand it exactly but he was evidently glad to see us so well satisfied if he had had time to stop and have the matter explained to him he would probably have been better satisfied but as it was he waved his whip to us and drove on he was a good fellow  we strolled all day having locked up the house and taken our lunch with us and when we came back it seemed really like coming home mrs carson with whom we had left the key had brought the milk and was making the fire this woman was too kind we determined to try and repay her in some way after a splendid supper we went to bed happy  the next day was a repetition of this one but the day after it rained so we determined to enjoy the old tavern and we rummaged about everywhere i visited the garret again and we went to the old barn with its mows half full of hay and had rare times climbing about there we were delighted that it happened to rain in a woodshed near the house i saw a big square board with letters on it i examined the board and found it was a signa hanging signand on it was painted in letters that were yet quite plain       farmers        and     mechanics       hotel   i called to euphemia and told her that i had found the old tavern sign she came to look at it and i pulled it out  soldiers and sailors she exclaimed thats funny  i looked over on her side of the sign and sure enough there was the inscription       soldiers        and      sailors       house   they must have bought this comprehensive sign in some town i said such a name would never have been chosen for a country tavern like this but i wish they hadnt taken it down the house would look more like what it ought to be with its sign hanging before it  well then said euphemia lets put it up i agreed instantly to this proposition and we went to look for a ladder we found one in the wagonhouse and carried it out to the signpost in the front of the house it was raining gently during these performances but we had on our old clothes and were so much interested in our work that we did not care for a little rain i carried the sign to the post and then at the imminent risk of breaking my neck i hung it on its appropriate hooks on the transverse beam of the signpost now our tavern was really what it pretended to be we gazed on the sign with admiration and content  do you think we had better keep it up all the time i asked of my wife  certainly said she its a part of the house the place isnt complete without it  but suppose some one should come along and want to be entertained  but no one will and if people do come ill take care of the soldiers and sailors if you will attend to the farmers and mechanics  i consented to this and we went indoors to prepare dinner    chapter xviii our tavern   the next day was clear again and we rambled in the woods until the sun was nearly down and so were late about supper we were just taking our seats at the table when we heard a footstep on the front porch instantly the same thought came into each of our minds  i do believe said euphemia thats somebody who has mistaken this for a tavern i wonder whether its a soldier or a farmer or a sailor but you had better go and see  i went to see prompted to move quickly by the newcomer pounding his cane on the bare floor of the hall i found him standing just inside of the front door he was a small man with long hair and beard and dressed in a suit of clothes of a remarkable colorsomething of the hue of faded snuff he had a big stick and carried a large flat valise in one hand  he bowed to me very politely  can i stop here tonight he asked taking off his hat as my wife put her head out of the kitchendoor  whyno sir i said this is not a tavern  not a tavern he exclaimed i dont understand that you have a sign out  that is true i said but that is only for fun so to speak we are here temporarily and we put up that sign just to please ourselves  that is pretty poor fun for me said the man i am very tired and more hungry than tired couldnt you let me have a little supper at any rate  euphemia glanced at me i nodded  you are welcome to some supper she said come in we eat in the kitchen because it is more convenient and because it is so much more cheerful than the diningroom there is a pump out there and here is a towel if you would like to wash your hands  as the man went out the back door i complimented my wife she was really an admirable hostess  the individual in faded snuffcolor was certainly hungry and he seemed to enjoy his supper during the meal he gave us some account of himself he was an artist and had traveled mostly on foot it would appear over a great part of the country he had in his valise some very pretty little colored sketches of scenes in mexico and california which he showed us after supper why he carried these pictureswhich were done on stiff paperabout with him i do not know he said he did not care to sell them as he might use them for studies for larger pictures some day his valise which he opened wide on the table seemed to be filled with papers drawings and matters of that kind i suppose he preferred to wear his clothes instead of carrying them about in his valise  after sitting for about half an hour after supper he rose with an uncertain sort of smile and said he supposed he must be moving onasking at the same time how far it was to the tavern over the ridge  just wait one moment if you please said euphemia and she beckoned me out of the room  dont you think said she that we could keep him all night theres no moon and it would be a fearful dark walk i know to the other side of the mountain there is a room upstairs that i can fix for him in ten minutes and i know hes honest  how do you know it i asked  well because he wears such curiouscolored clothes no criminal would ever wear such clothes he could never pass unnoticed anywhere and being probably the only person in the world who dressed that way he could always be detected  you are doubtless correct i replied let us keep him  when we told the good man that he could stay all night he was extremely obliged to us and went to bed quite early after we had fastened the house and had gone to our room my wife said to me  where is your pistol  i produced it  well said she i think you ought to have it where you can get at it  why so i asked you generally want me to keep it out of sight and reach  yes but when there is a strange man in the house we ought to take extra precautions  but this man you say is honest i replied if he committed a crime he could not escapehis appearance is so peculiar  but that wouldnt do us any good if we were both murdered said euphemia pulling a chair up to my side of the bed and laying the pistol carefully thereon with the muzzle toward the bed  we were not murdered and we had a very pleasant breakfast with the artist who told us more anecdotes of his life in mexico and other places when after breakfast he shut up his valise preparatory to starting away we felt really sorry when he was ready to go he asked for his bill  oh there is no bill i exclaimed we have no idea of charging you anything we dont really keep a hotel as i told you  if i had known that said he looking very grave i would not have stayed there is no reason why you should give me food and lodgings and i would not and did not ask it i am able to pay for such things and i wish to do so  we argued with him for some time speaking of the habits of country people and so on but he would not be convinced he had asked for accommodation expecting to pay for it and would not be content until he had done so  well said euphemia we are not keeping this house for profit and you cant force us to make anything out of you if you will be satisfied to pay us just what it cost us to entertain you i suppose we shall have to let you do that take a seat for a minute and i will make out your bill  so the artist and i sat down and talked of various matters while my wife got out her traveling stationerybox and sat down to the diningtable to make out the bill after a long long time as it appeared to me i said  my dear if the amount of that bill is at all proportioned to the length of time it takes to make it out i think our friend here will wish he had never said anything about it  its nearly done said she without raising her head and in about ten or fifteen minutes more she rose and presented the bill to our guest as i noticed that he seemed somewhat surprised at it i asked him to let me look over it with him the bill of which i have a copy read as follows   july 12th 187 artist     to the s and s hotel and f and m house     to 13 one

as above with exception of eggs    instead of bacon and with hominy omitted                                                                                     24 16

                                 amount due       22 1724 cts   the worthy artist burst out laughing when he read this bill and so did i  you neednt laugh said euphemia reddening a little that is exactly what your entertainment cost and we do not intend to take a cent more we get things here in such small quantities that i can tell quite easily what a meal costs us and i have calculated that bill very carefully  so i should think madam said the artist but it is not quite right you have charged nothing for your trouble and services  no said my wife for i took no additional trouble to get your meals what i did i should have done if you had not come to be sure i did spend a few minutes preparing your room i will charge you seven twentyfourths of a cent for that thus making your bill twentythree centseven money  i cannot gainsay reasoning like yours madam he said and he took a quarter from a very fat old pocketbook and handed it to her she gravely gave him two cents change and then taking the bill receipted it and handed it back to him  we were sorry to part with our guest for he was evidently a good fellow i walked with him a little way up the road and got him to let me copy his bill in my memorandumbook the original he said he would always keep  a day or two after the artists departure we were standing on the front piazza we had had a late breakfastconsequent upon a long tramp the day beforeand had come out to see what sort of a day it was likely to be we had hardly made up our minds on the subject when the morning stage came up at full speed and stopped at our gate  hello cried the driver he was not our driver he was a tall man in high boots and had a great reputation as a manager of horsesso danny carson told me afterward there were two drivers on the line and each of them made one trip a day going up one day in the afternoon and down the next day in the morning  i went out to see what this driver wanted  cant you give my passengers breakfast he asked  why no i exclaimed looking at the stage loaded inside and out this isnt a tavern we couldnt get breakfast for a stageload of people  what have you got a sign up fur then roared the driver getting red in the face  thats so cried two or three men from the top of the stage if it aint a tavern whats that sign doin there  i saw i must do something i stepped up close to the stage and looked in and up  are there any sailors in this stage i said there was no response any soldiers any farmers or mechanics  at the latter question i trembled but fortunately no one answered  then said i you have no right to ask to be accommodated for as you may see from the sign our house is only for soldiers sailors farmers and mechanics  and besides cried euphemia from the piazza we havent anything to give you for breakfast  the people in and on the stage grumbled a good deal at this and looked as if they were both disappointed and hungry while the driver ripped out an oath which had he thrown it across a creek would soon have made a goodsized millpond  he gathered up his reins and turned a sinister look on me  ill be even with you yit he cried as he dashed off  in the afternoon mrs carson came up and told us that the stage had stopped there and that she had managed to give the passengers some coffee bread and butter and ham and eggs though they had had to wait their turns for cups and plates it appeared that the driver had quarreled with the lowry people that morning because the breakfast was behindhand and he was kept waiting so he told his passengers that there was another tavern a few miles down the road and that he would take them there to breakfast  hes an awful ugly man that he is said mrs carson an hed better a stayed at lowrys fur he had to wait a good sight longer after all as it turned out but hes dreadful mad at you an says hell bring ye farmers an soldiers and sailors an mechanics if thats what ye want i spect hell do his best to git a load of them particular people an drop em at yer door id take down that sign ef i was you not that me an danny minds fur were glad to git a stage to feed an ef youve any single man that wants lodgin weve fixed up a room and kin keep him overnight  notwithstanding this warning euphemia and i decided not to take in our sign we were not to be frightened by a stagedriver the next day our own driver passed us on the road as he was going down  so yere pertickler about the people ye take in are ye said he smiling thats all right but ye made bill awful mad  it was quite late on a monday afternoon that bill stopped at our house again he did not call out this time he simply drew up and a man with a big black valise clambered down from the top of the stage then bill shouted to me as i walked down to the gate looking rather angry i suppose  i was agoin to git ye a whole stageload to stay all night but that onell do ye i reckon ha ha and off he went probably fearing that i would throw his passenger up on the top of the stage again  the newcomer entered the gate he was a dark man with black hair and black whiskers and mustache and black eyes he wore clothes that had been black but which were now toned down by a good deal of dust and as i have said he carried a black valise  why did you stop here said i rather inhospitably dont you know that we do not accommodate  yes i know he said walking up on the piazza and setting down his valise that you only take soldiers sailors farmers and mechanics at this house i have been told all about it and if i had not thoroughly understood the matter i should not have thought of such a thing as stopping here if you will sit down for a few moments i will explain saying this he took a seat on a bench by the door but euphemia and i continued to stand  i am he continued a soldier a sailor a farmer and a mechanic do not doubt my word i will prove it to you in two minutes when but seventeen years of age circumstances compelled me to take charge of a farm in new hampshire and i kept up that farm until i was twentyfive during this time i built several barns wagonhouses and edifices of the sort on my place and becoming expert in this branch of mechanical art i was much sought after by the neighboring farmers who employed me to do similar work for them in time i found this new business so profitable that i gave up farming altogether but certain unfortunate speculations threw me on my back and finally having gone from bad to worse i found myself in boston where in sheer desperation i went on board a coasting vessel as landsman i remained on this vessel for nearly a year but it did not suit me i was often sick and did not like the work i left the vessel at one of the southern ports and it was not long after she sailed that finding myself utterly without means i enlisted as a soldier i remained in the army for some years and was finally honorably discharged so you see that what i said was true i belong to each and all of these businesses and professions and now that i have satisfied you on this point let me show you a book for which i have the agency in this country he stooped down opened his valise and took out a goodsized volume this book said he is the flora and fauna of carthage county it is written by one of the first scientific men of the country and gives you a description with an authentic woodcut of each of the plants and animals of the countyindigenous or naturalized owing to peculiar advantages enjoyed by our firm we are enabled to put this book at the very low price of three dollars and seventyfive cents it is sold by subscription only and should be on the centertable in every parlor in this county if you will glance over this book sir you will find it as interesting as a novel and as useful as an encyclopaedia  i dont want the book i said and i dont care to look at it  but if you were to look at it you would want it im sure  thats a good reason for not looking at it then i answered if you came to get us to subscribe for that book we need not take up any more of your time for we shall not subscribe  oh i did not come for that alone he said i shall stay here tonight and start out in the morning to work up the neighborhood if you would like this bookand im sure you have only to look at it to do thatyou can deduct the amount of my bill from the subscription price and  what did you say you charged for this book asked euphemia stepping forward and picking up the volume  three seventyfive is the subscription price maam but that book is not for sale that is merely a sample if you put your name down on my list you will be served with your book in two weeks as i told your husband it will come very cheap to you because you can deduct what you charge me for supper lodging and breakfast  indeed said my wife and then she remarked that she must go in the house and get supper  when will supper be ready the man asked as she passed him  at first she did not answer him but then she called back  in about half an hour  good said the man but i wish it was ready now and now sir if you would just glance over this book while we are waiting for supper  i cut him very short and went out into the road i walked up and down in front of the house in a bad humor i could not bear to think of my wife getting supper for this fellow who was striding about on the piazza as if he was very hungry and very impatient just as i returned to the house the bell rang from within  joyful sound said the man and in he marched i followed close behind him on one end of the table in the kitchen supper was set for one person and as the man entered euphemia motioned him to the table the supper looked like a remarkably good one a cup of coffee smoked by the side of the plate there was ham and eggs and a small omelette there were fried potatoes some fresh radishes a plate of hot biscuit and some preserves the mans eyes sparkled  i am sorry said he that i am to eat alone for i hoped to have your good company but if this plan suits you it suits me and he drew up a chair  stop said euphemia advancing between him and the table you are not to eat that this is a sample supper if you order a supper like it one will be served to you in two weeks  at this i burst into a roar of laughter my wife stood pale and determined and the man drew back looking first at one of us and then at the other  am i to understand he said  yes i interrupted you are there is nothing more to be said on this subject you may go now you came here to annoy us knowing that we did not entertain travelers and now you see what you have made by it and i opened the door  the man evidently thought that a reply was not necessary and he walked out without a word taking up his valise which he had put in the hall he asked if there was any publichouse near by  no i said but there is a farmhouse a short distance down the road where they will be glad to have you and down the road he went to mrs carsons i am sorry to say that he sold her a flora and fauna before he went to bed that night  we were much amused at the termination of this affair and i became if possible a still greater admirer of euphemias talents for management but we both agreed that it would not do to keep up the sign any longer we could not tell when the irate driver might not pounce down upon us with a customer  but i hate to take it down said euphemia it looks so much like a surrender  do not trouble yourself said i i have an idea  the next morning i went down to danny carsons little shophe was a wheelwright as well as a farmerand i got from him two pots of paintone black and one whiteand some brushes i took down our sign and painted out the old lettering and instead of it i painted in bold and somewhat regular characters new names for our tavern  on one side of the sign i painted        soapmakers          and      bookbinders         hotel   and on the other side        upholsterers           and        dentists         house   now then i said i dont believe any of those people will be traveling along the road while we are here or at any rate they wont want to stop  we admired this sign very much and sat on the piazza that afternoon to see how it would strike bill as he passed by it seemed to strike him pretty hard for he gazed with all his eyes at one side of it as he approached and then as he passed it he actually pulled up to read the other side  all right he called out as he drove off all right all right  euphemia didnt like the way he said all right it seemed to her she said as if he intended to do something which would be all right for him but not at all so for us i saw she was nervous about it for that evening she began to ask me questions about the traveling propensities of soapmakers upholsterers and dentists  do not think anything more about that my dear i said i will take the sign down in the morning we are here to enjoy ourselves and not to be worried  and yet said she it would worry me to think that that driver frightened us into taking down the sign i tell you what i wish you would do paint out those names and let me make a sign then i promise you i will not be worried  the next day therefore i took down the sign and painted out my inscriptions it was a good deal of trouble for my letters were fresh but it was a rainy day and i had plenty of time and succeeded tolerably well then i gave euphemia the blackpaint pot and the freedom of the sign  i went down to the creek to try a little fishing in wet weather and when i returned the new sign was done on one side it read        flies       and      wasps      hotel   on the other     hundredleggers        and      redants       house   you see said euphemia if any individuals mentioned thereon apply for accommodation we can say we are full  this sign hung triumphantly for several days when one morning just as we had finished breakfast we were surprised to hear the stage stop at the door and before we could go out to see who had arrived into the room came our own stagedriver as we used to call him he had actually left his team to come and see us  i just thought id stop an tell ye said he that ef ye dont look out billll get ye inter trouble hes bound to git the best o ye an i heared this mornin at lowrys that hes agoin to bring the county clerk up here tomorrow to see about yer license fur keepin a hotel he says ye keep changin yer signs but that dont differ to him for he kin prove yeve kept travelers overnight an ef ye havent got no license hell make the county clerk come down on ye heavy im sure o that fur i know bill an so i thought id stop an tell ye  i thanked him and admitted that this was a rather serious view of the case euphemia pondered a moment then said she  i dont see why we should stay here any longer its going to rain again and our vacation is up tomorrow anyway could you wait a little while while we pack up she said to the driver  oh yes he replied i kin wait as well as not ive only got one passenger an hes on top aholdin the horses he aint in any hurry i know an im ahead o time  in less than twenty minutes we had packed our trunk locked up the house and were in the stage and as we drove away we cast a last admiring look at euphemias sign slowly swinging in the wind i would much like to know if it is swinging there yet i feel certain there has been no lack of custom  we stopped at mrs carsons paid her what we owed her and engaged her to go up to the tavern and put things in order she was very sorry we were going but hoped we would come back again some other summer we said that it was quite possible that we might do so but that next time we did not think we would try to have a tavern of our own    chapter xix the baby at rudder grange   for some reason not altogether understood by me there seemed to be a continued series of new developments at our home i had supposed when the events spoken of in the last chapter had settled down to their proper places in our little history that our life would flow on in an even commonplace way with few or no incidents worthy of being recorded but this did not prove to be the case after a time the uniformity and quiet of our existence was considerably disturbed  this disturbance was caused by a baby not a rude imperious baby but a child who was generally of a quiet and orderly turn of mind but it disarranged all our plans all our habits all the ordinary disposition of things  it was in the summertime during my vacation that it began to exert its full influence upon us a more unfortunate season could not have been selected at first i may say that it did not exert its full influence upon me i was away during the day and in the evening its influence was not exerted to any great extent upon anybody as i have said its habits were exceedingly orderly but during my vacation the things came to pass which have made this chapter necessary  i did not intend taking a trip as in a former vacation i proposed staying at home and enjoying those delights of the country which my business in town did not allow me to enjoy in the working weeks and months of the year i had no intention of camping out or of doing anything of that kind but many were the trips rides and excursions i had planned  i found however that if i enjoyed myself in this wise i must do it for the most part alone it was not that euphemia could not go with methere was really nothing to preventit was simply that she had lost for the time her interest in everything except that baby  she wanted me to be happy to amuse myself to take exercise to do whatever i thought was pleasant but she herself was so much engrossed with the child that she was often ignorant of what i intended to do or had done she thought she was listening to what i said to her but in reality she was occupied mind and body with the baby or listening for some sound which should indicate that she ought to go and be occupied with it  i would often say to her why cant you let pomona attend to it you surely need not give up your whole time and your whole mind to the child  but she would always answer that pomona had a great many things to do and that she couldnt at all times attend to the baby suppose for instance that she should be at the barn  i once suggested that a nurse should be procured but at this she laughed  there is very little to do she said and i really like to do it  yes said i but you spend so much of your time in thinking how glad you will be to do that little when it is to be done that you cant give me any attention at all  now you have no cause to say that she exclaimed you know very well there and away she ran it had just begun to cry  naturally i was getting tired of this i could never begin a sentence and feel sure that i would be allowed to finish it nothing was important enough to delay attention to an infantile whimper  jonas too was in a state of unrest he was obliged to wear his good clothes a great part of the time for he was continually going on errands to the village and these errands were so important that they took precedence of everything else it gave me a melancholy sort of pleasure sometimes to do jonass work when he was thus sent away  i asked him one day how he liked it all  well said he reflectively i cant say as i understand it exactly it does seem queer to me that such a little thing should take up pretty nigh all the time of three people i suppose after a while this he said with a grave smile that you may be wanting to turn in and help i did not make any answer to this for jonas was at that moment summoned to the house but it gave me an idea in fact it gave me two ideas  the first was that jonass remark was not entirely respectful he was my hired man but he was a very respectable man and an american man and therefore might sometimes be expected to say things which a foreigner not known to be respectable would not think of saying if he wished to keep his place the fact that jonas had always been very careful to treat me with much civility caused this remark to make more impression on me i felt that he had in a measure reason for it  the other idea was one which grew and developed in my mind until i afterward formed a plan upon it i determined however before i carried out my plan to again try to reason with euphemia  if it was our own baby i said or even the child of one of us by a former marriage it would be a different thing but to give yourself up so entirely to pomonas baby seems to me unreasonable indeed i never heard of any case exactly like it it is reversing all the usages of society for the mistress to take care of the servants baby  the usages of society are not worth much sometimes said euphemia and you must remember that pomona is a very different kind of a person from an ordinary servant she is much more like a member of the familyi cant exactly explain what kind of a member but i understand it myself she has very much improved since she has been married and you know yourself how quiet andand nice she is and as for the baby its just as good and pretty as any baby and it may grow up to be better than any of us some of our presidents have sprung from lowly parents  but this one is a girl i said  well then replied euphemia she may be a presidents wife  another thing i remarked i dont believe jonas and pomona like your keeping their baby so much to yourself  nonsense said euphemia a girl in pomonas position couldnt help being glad to have a lady take an interest in her baby and help bring it up and as for jonas he would be a cruel man if he wasnt pleased and grateful to have his wife relieved of so much trouble pomona is that you you can bring it here now if you want to get at your clearstarching  i dont believe that pomona hankered after clearstarching but she brought the baby and i went away i could not see any hope ahead of course in time it would grow up but then it couldnt grow up during my vacation  then it was that i determined to carry out my plan  i went to the stable and harnessed the horse to the little carriage jonas was not there and i had fallen out of the habit of calling him i drove slowly through the yard and out of the gate no one called to me or asked where i was going how different this was from the old times then some one would not have failed to know where i was going and in all probability she would have gone with me but now i drove away quietly and undisturbed  about three miles from our house was a settlement known as new dublin it was a cluster of poor and doleful houses inhabited entirely by irish people whose dirt and poverty seemed to make them very contented and happy the men were generally away at their work during the day but there was never any difficulty in finding some one at home no matter at what house one called i was acquainted with one of the matrons of this locality a mrs duffy who had occasionally undertaken some odd jobs at our house and to her i made a visit  she was glad to see me and wiped off a chair for me  mrs duffy said i i want to rent a baby  at first the good woman could not understand me but when i made plain to her that i wished for a short time to obtain the exclusive use and control of a baby for which i was willing to pay a liberal rental she burst into long and violent laughter it seemed to her like a person coming into the country to purchase weeds weeds and children were so abundant in new dublin but she gradually began to see that i was in earnest and as she knew i was a trusty person and somewhat noted for the care i took of my live stock she was perfectly willing to accommodate me but feared she had nothing on hand of the age i desired  me childther are all agoin about she said ye kin see a poile uv em out yon in the road an theres more uv em on the fince but ye nade have no fear about gittin wan theres sthacks of em in the place ill jist run over to mrs hogans wid ye shes got sixteen or siventeen mostly small for hogan brought four or five wid him when he married her an shell be glad to rint wan uv em so throwing her apron over her head she accompanied me to mrs hogans  that lady was washing but she cheerfully stopped her work while mrs duffy took her to one side and explained my errand mrs hogan did not appear to be able to understand why i wanted a babyespecially for so limited a periodbut probably concluded that if i would take good care of it and would pay well for it the matter was my own affair for she soon came and said that if i wanted a baby id come to the right place then she began to consider what one she would let me have i insisted on a young onethere was already a little baby at our house and the folks there would know how to manage it  oh ye want it fer coompany for the ither one is that it said mrs hogan a new light breaking in upon her an thats a good plan sure it must be dridful lownly in a house wid ownly wan baby now theres onepollywould she do  why she can run i said i dont want one that can run  oh dear said mrs hogan with a sigh they all begin to run very airly now polly isnt owld at all at all  i can see that said i but i want one that you can put in a cradleone that will have to stay there when you put it in  it was plain that mrs hogans present stock did not contain exactly what i wanted and directly mrs duffy exclaimed theres mary mccannan roight across the way  mrs hogan said yis sure and we all went over to a little house opposite  now thin said mrs duffy entering the house and proudly drawing a small coverlid from a little boxbed in a corner what do you think of that  why there are two of them i exclaimed  to be sure said mrs duffy theyre tweens theres always two uv em when theyre tweens an theyre young enough  yes said i doubtfully but i couldnt take both do you think their mother would rent one of them  the women shook their heads ye see sir said mrs hogan mary mccann isnt here bein gone out to a wash but she ownly has four or foive childther an she aint much used to em yit an i kin spake fer her that shed niver siparate a pair o tweens when she gits a dozen hersilf and marries a widow jintleman wid a lot uv his own shell be glad enough to be lettin ye have yer pick to take wan uv em fer coompany to yer own baby at foive dollars a week moind that  i visited several houses after this still in company with mrs hogan and mrs duffy and finally secured a youngish infant who having been left motherless had become what mrs duffy called a bottlebaby and was in charge of a neighboring aunt it seemed strange that this child so eminently adapted to purposes of rental was not offered to me at first but i suppose the irish ladies who had the matter in charge wanted to benefit themselves or some of their near friends before giving the general public of new dublin a chance  the child suited me very well and i agreed to take it for as many days as i might happen to want it but to pay by the week in advance it was a boy with a suggestion of orangered bloom all over its head and what looked to me like freckles on its cheeks while its little nose turned up even more than those of babies generally turnabove a very long upper lip his eyes were blue and twinkling and he had the very mouth fer a leetle poipe as mrs hogan admiringly remarked  he was hastily prepared for his trip and when i had arranged the necessary business matters with his aunt and had assured her that she could come to see him whenever she liked i got into the carriage and having spread the laprobe over my knees the baby carefully wrapped in a little shawl was laid in my lap then his bottle freshly filled for he might need a drink on the way was tucked between the cushions on the seat beside me and taking the lines in my left hand while i steadied my charge with the other i prepared to drive away  whats his name i asked  its pat said his aunt afther his dad whos away in the moines  but ye kin call him onything ye bike mrs duffy remarked fer he dont ansther to his name yit  pat will do very well i said as i bade the good women farewell and carefully guided the horse through the swarms of youngsters who had gathered around the carriage    chapter xx the other baby at rudder grange   i drove slowly home and little pat lay very quiet looking up steadily at me with his twinkling blue eyes for a time everything went very well but happening to look up i saw in the distance a carriage approaching it was an open barouche and i knew it belonged to a family of our acquaintance in the village and that it usually contained ladies  quick as thought i rolled up pat in his shawl and stuffed him under the seat then rearranging the laprobe over my knees i drove on trembling a little it is true  as i supposed the carriage contained ladies and i knew them all the coachman instinctively drew up as we approached we always stopped and spoke on such occasions  they asked me after my wife apparently surprised to see me alone and made a number of pleasant observations to all of which i replied with as unconcerned and easy an air as i could assume the ladies were in excellent spirits but in spite of this there seemed to be an air of repression about them which i thought of when i drove on but could not account for for little pat never moved or whimpered during the whole of the interview  but when i took him again in my lap and happened to turn as i arranged the robe i saw his bottle sticking up boldly by my side from between the cushions then i did not wonder at the repression  when i reached home i drove directly to the barn fortunately jonas was there when i called him and handed little pat to him i never saw a man more utterly amazed he stood and held the child without a word but when i explained the whole affair to him he comprehended it perfectly and was delighted i think he was just as anxious for my plan to work as i was myself although he did not say so  i was about to take the child into the house when jonas remarked that it was barefooted  that wont do i said it certainly had socks on when i got it i saw them  here they are said jonas fishing them out from the shawl hes kicked them off  well we must put them on i said it wont do to take him in that way you hold him  so jonas sat down on the feedbox and carefully taking little pat he held him horizontally firmly pressed between his hands and knees with his feet stuck out toward me while i knelt down before him and tried to put on the little socks but the socks were knit or worked very loosely and there seemed to be a good many small holes in them so that pats funny little toes which he kept curling up and uncurling were continually making their appearance in unexpected places through the sock but after a great deal of trouble i got them both on with the heels in about the right places  now they ought to be tied on i said where are his garters  i dont believe babies have garters said jonas doubtfully but i could rig him up a pair  no said i we wont take the time for that ill hold his legs apart as i carry him in its rubbing his feet together that gets them off  as i passed the kitchen window i saw pomona at work she looked at me dropped something and i heard a crash i dont know how much that crash cost me jonas rushed in to tell pomona about it and in a moment i heard a scream of laughter at this euphemia appeared at an upper window with her hand raised and saying severely hushh but the moment she saw me she disappeared from the window and came downstairs on the run she met me just as i entered the diningroom  what in the world she breathlessly exclaimed  this said i taking pat into a better position in my arms is my baby  yourbaby said euphemia where did you get it what are you going to do with it  i got it in new dublin i replied and i want it to amuse and occupy me while i am at home i havent anything else to do except things that take me away from you  oh said euphemia  at this moment little pat gave his first whimper perhaps he felt the searching glance that fell upon him from the lady in the middle of the room  i immediately began to walk up and down the floor with him and to sing to him i did not know any infant music but i felt sure that a soothing tune was the great requisite and that the words were of small importance so i started on an old methodist tune which i remembered very well and which was used with the hymn containing the lines        weak and wounded sick and sore   and i sang as soothingly as i could       little patsy watsy satsy      does he feel a litty bad      me will send and get his bottle      he shant have to crywywy   what an idiot said euphemia laughing in spite of her vexation       no we aint no idiotses      what we wants a botty mik   so i sang as i walked to the kitchen door and sent jonas to the barn for the bottle  pomona was in spasms of laughter in the kitchen and euphemia was trying her best not to laugh at all  whos going to take care of it id like to know she said as soon as she could get herself into a state of severe inquiry       sometimes me and sometimes jonas   i sang still walking up and down the room with a long slow step swinging the baby from side to side very much as if it were grassseed in a sieve and i were sowing it over the carpet  when the bottle came i took it and began to feed little pat perhaps the presence of a critical and interested audience embarrassed us for jonas and pomona were at the door with streaming eyes while euphemia stood with her handkerchief to the lower part of her face or it may have been that i did not understand the management of bottles but at any rate i could not make the thing work and the disappointed little pat began to cry just as the whole of our audience burst into a wild roar of laughter  here give me that child cried euphemia forcibly taking pat and the bottle from me youll make it swallow the whole affair and im sure its mouths big enough  you really dont think she said when we were alone and little pat with his upturned blue eyes serenely surveying the features of the good lady who knew how to feed him was placidly pulling away at his indiarubber tube that i will consent to your keeping such a creature as this in the house why hes a regular little paddy if you kept him hed grow up into a hodcarrier  good said i i never thought of that what a novel thing it would be to witness the gradual growth of a hodcarrier ill make him a little hod now to begin with he couldnt have a more suitable toy  i was talking in earnest she said take your baby and please carry him home as quick as you can for i am certainly not going to take care of him  of course not said i now that i see how its done im going to do it myself jonas will mix his feed and i will give it to him he looks sleepy now shall i take him upstairs and lay him on our bed  no indeed cried euphemia you can put him on a quilt on the floor until after luncheon and then you must take him home  i laid the young milesian on the folded quilt which euphemia prepared for him where he turned up his little pug nose to the ceiling and went contentedly to sleep  that afternoon i nailed four legs on a small packingbox and made a bedstead for him this with a pillow in the bottom of it was very comfortable and instead of taking him home i borrowed in the evening some baby nightclothes from pomona and set about preparing pat for the night  this euphemia would not allow but silently taking him from me she put him to bed  tomorrow she said you must positively take him away i wont stand it and in our room too  i didnt talk in that way about the baby you adopted i said  to this she made no answer but went away to attend as usual to pomonas baby while its mother washed the dishes  that night little pat woke up several times and made things unpleasant by his wails on the first two occasions i got up and walked him about singing impromptu lines to the tune of weak and wounded but the third time euphemia herself arose and declaring that that doleful tune was a great deal worse than the babys crying silenced him herself and arranging his couch more comfortably he troubled us no more  in the morning when i beheld the little pad of orange fur in the box my heart almost misgave me but as the day wore on my courage rose again and i gave myself up almost entirely to my new charge composing a vast deal of blank verse while walking him up and down the house  euphemia scolded and scolded and said she would put on her hat and go for the mother but i told her the mother was dead and that seemed to be an obstacle she took a good deal of care of the child for she said she would not see an innocent creature neglected even if it was an incipient hodcarrier but she did not relax in the least in her attention to pomonas baby  the next day was about the same in regard to infantile incident but on the day after i began to tire of my new charge and pat on his side seemed to be tired of me for he turned from me when i went to take him up while he would hold out his hands to euphemia and grin delightedly when she took him  that morning i drove to the village and spent an hour or two there on my return i found euphemia sitting in our room with little pat on her lap i was astonished at the change in the young rascal he was dressed from head to foot in a suit of clothes belonging to pomonas baby the glowing fuzz on his head was brushed and made as smooth as possible while his little muslin sleeves were tied up with blue ribbon  i stood speechless at the sight  dont he look nice said euphemia standing him up on her knees it shows what good clothes will do im glad i helped pomona make up so many hes getting ever so fond of me ze itty patsy watsy see how strong he is he can almost stand on his legs look how he laughs hes just as cunning as he can be and oh i was going to speak about that box i wouldnt have him sleep in that old packingbox there are little wicker cradles at the storei saw them last weekthey dont cost much and you could bring one up in the carriage theres the other baby crying and i dont know where pomona is just you mind him a minute please and out she ran  i looked out of the window the horse still stood harnessed to the carriage as i had left him i saw pats old shawl lying in a corner i seized it and rolling him in it new clothes and all i hurried downstairs climbed into the carriage hastily disposed pat in my lap and turned the horse the demeanor of the youngster was very different from what it was when i first took him in my lap to drive away with him there was no confiding twinkle in his eye no contented munching of his little fists he gazed up at me with wild alarm and as i drove out of the gate he burst forth into such a yell that lord edward came bounding around the house to see what was the matter euphemia suddenly appeared at an upper window and called out to me but i did not hear what she said i whipped up the horse and we sped along to new dublin pat soon stopped crying but he looked at me with a tearstained and reproachful visage  the good women of the settlement were surprised to see little pat return so soon  an wasnt he good said mrs hogan as she took him from my hands  oh yes i said he was as good as he could be but i have no further need of him  i might have been called upon to explain this statement had not the whole party of women who stood around burst into wild expressions of delight at pats beautiful clothes  oh jist look at em cried mrs duffy an see thim leetle pittycoots thrimmed wid lace oh an it was good in ye sir to give him all thim an pay the foive dollars too  an im glad hes back said the fostering aunt for i was a coomin over to till ye that ive been hearin from owle pat his dad an hes a coomin back from the moines and i dont know what hed a said if hed found his leetle pat was rinted but if ye iver want to borry him for a whoile after owle pats gone back ye kin have him rintfree an its much obloiged i am to ye sir fur dressin him so foine  i made no encouraging remarks as to future transactions in this line and drove slowly home  euphemia met me at the door she had pomonas baby in her arms we walked together into the parlor  and so you have given up the little fellow that you were going to do so much for she said  yes i have given him up i answered  it must have been a dreadful trial to you she continued  oh dreadful i replied  i suppose you thought he would take up so much of your time and thoughts that we couldnt be to each other what we used to be didnt you she said  not exactly i replied i only thought that things promised to be twice as bad as they were before  she made no answer to this but going to the back door of the parlor she opened it and called pomona when that young woman appeared euphemia stepped toward her and said here pomona take your baby  they were simple words but they were spoken in such a way that they meant a good deal pomona knew what they meant her eyes sparkled and as she went out i saw her hug her child to her breast and cover it with kisses and then through the window i could see her running to the barn and jonas  now then said euphemia closing the door and coming toward me with one of her old smiles and not a trace of preoccupation about her i suppose you expect me to devote myself to you  i did expect it and i was not mistaken   since these events a third baby has come to rudder grange it is not pomonas nor was it brought from new dublin it is named after a little one who died very young before this story was begun and the strangest thing about it is that never for a moment does it seem to come between euphemia and myself
