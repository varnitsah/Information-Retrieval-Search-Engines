said the lightporter cordially well im well of all the  get off that box said the big policeman who had come back with the boy take your sixpence an go if i catch you down this way again  he finished the sentence by taking the fellow by the scruff of the neck and giving him a violent push as he passed him  watermans fare is threepence he said to the boy as the man in the boat with an utterly expressionless face took the chest from him ill stay here till he has put you aboard  the boy took his seat and the waterman breathing hard pulled out towards the vessels in the tier he looked at the boy and then at the figure on the steps and apparently suppressing a strong inclination to speak spat violently over the side  fine big chap aint he said the boy  the waterman affecting not to hear looked over his shoulder and pulled strongly with his left towards a small schooner from the deck of which a couple of men were watching the small figure in the boat  thats the boy i was going to tell you about said the skipper and remember this ere ships a pirate  its got a lot o pirates aboard of it said the mate fiercely as he turned and regarded the crew a set o lazy loafing idle worthless  its for the boys sake interrupted the skipper  whered you pick him up inquired the other  hes the son of a friend o mine what ive brought aboard to oblige replied the skipper hes got a fancy for being a pirate so just to oblige his father i told him we was a pirate he wouldnt have come if i hadnt  ill pirate him said the mate rubbing his hands  hes a dreadful andful by all accounts continued the other got his ed stuffed full o these ere penny dreadfuls till theyve turned his brain almost he started by being an indian and goin off on is own with two other kids when he wanted to turn cannibal the other two objected and gave im in charge after that he did a bit o burgling and it cost is old man no end o money to hush it up  well what did you want him for grumbled the mate  im goin to knock the nonsense out of him said the skipper softly as the boat grazed the side just step forard and let the hands know whats expected of em when we get to sea it wont matter  the mate moved off grumbling as the small fare stood on the thwarts and scrambled up over the side the waterman passed up the chest and dropping the coppers into his pocket pushed off again without a word  well youve got here all right ralph said the skipper what do you think of her  shes a rakishlooking craft said the boy looking round the dingy old tub with much satisfaction but wheres your arms  hush said the skipper and laid his finger on his nose  oh all right said the youth testily but you might tell me  you shall know all in good time said the skipper patiently turning to the crew who came shuffling up masking broad grins with dirty palms  heres a new shipmate for you my lads hes small but hes the right stuff the newcomer drew himself up and regarded the crew with some dissatisfaction for desperadoes they looked far too goodtempered and prone to levity  whats the matter with you jem smithers inquired the skipper scowling at a huge fairhaired man who was laughing discordantly  i was thinkin o the last party i killed sir said jem with sudden gravity i allers laugh when i think ow he squealed  you laugh too much said the other sternly as he laid a hand on ralphs shoulder take a lesson from this fine fellow he dont laugh he acts take im down below an show him is bunk  will you please to follow me sir said smithers leading the way below i dessay youll find it a bit stuffy but thats owing to bill dobbs a regler old seadog is bill always sleeps in is clothes and never washes  i dont think the worse of him for that said ralph regarding the fermenting dobbs kindly  youd best keep a civil tongue in your ed my lad said dobbs shortly  never mind im said smithers cheerfully nobody takes any notice o old dobbs you can it im if you like i wont let him hurt you  i dont want to start by quarreling said ralph seriously  youre afraid said jem tauntingly youll never make one of us it im i wont let him hurt you  thus aroused the boy first directing dobbs attention to his stomach by a curious duck of his head much admired as a feint in his neighborhood struck him in the face the next moment the forecastle was in an uproar and ralph prostrate on dobbs knees frantically reminding jem of his promise  all right i wont let him urt you said jem consolingly  but he is hurting me yelled the boy hes hurting me now  well wait till i get im ashore said jem his old woman wont know him when ive done with him  the boys reply to this was a torrent of shrill abuse principally directed to jems facial shortcomings  now dont get rude said the seaman grinning  squint eyes cried ralph fiercely  when youve done with that ere young gentleman dobbs said jem with exquisite politeness i should like to ave im for a little bit to teach im manners  e dont want to go said dobbs grinning as ralph clung to him he knows whos kind to him  wait till i get a chance at you sobbed ralph as jem took him away from dobbs  lord lumme said jem regarding him in astonishment why hes actooaly cryin ive seen a good many pirates in my time bill but this is a new sort  leave the boy alone said the cook a fat goodnatured man here come ere old man they dont mean no arm  glad to escape ralph made his way over to the cook grinding his teeth with shame as that worthy took him between his knees and mopped his eyes with something which he called a handkerchief  youll be all right he said kindly youll be as good a pirate as any of us before youve finished  wait till the first engagement thats all sobbed the boy if somebody dont get shot in the back it wont be my fault  the two seamen looked at each other thats wot hurt my and then said dobbs slowly i thought it was a jackknife  he reached over and unceremoniously grabbing the boy by the collar pulled him towards him and drew a small cheap revolver from his pocket look at that jem  take your fingers orf the blessed trigger and then i will said the other somewhat sourly  ill pitch it overboard said dobbs  dont be a fool bill said smithers pocketing it thats worth a few pints o anybodys money stand out o the way bill the pirit king wants to go on deck  bill moved aside as the boy went to the ladder and allowing him to get up four or five steps did the rest for him with his shoulder the boy reached the deck on all fours and regaining a more dignified position as soon as possible went and leaned over the side regarding with lofty contempt the busy drudges on wharf and river  they sailed at midnight and brought up in the early dawn in longreach where a lighter loaded with barrels came alongside and the boy smelt romance and mystery when he learnt that they contained powder they took in ten tons the lighter drifted away the hatches were put on and they started once more  it was his first voyage and he regarded with eager interest the craft passing up and down he had made his peace with the seamen and they regaled him with bloodcurdling stories of their adventures in the vain hope of horrifying him  es a beastly little rascal thats wot e is said the indignant bill who had surprised himself by his powers of narration fancy larfin when i told im of pitchin the baby to the sharks  es all right bill said the cook softly wait till youve got seven of em  what are you doing here boy demanded the skipper as ralph finding the seamens yarns somewhat lacking in interest strolled aft with his hands in his pockets  nothing said the boy staring  keep the other end o the ship said the skipper sharply an go an elp the cook with the taters  ralph hesitated but a grin on the mates face decided him  i didnt come here to peel potatoes he said loftily  oh indeed said the skipper politely an wot might you ave come for if it aint being too inquisitive  to fight the enemy said ralph shortly  come ere said the skipper  the boy came slowly towards him  now look ere said the skipper im going to try and knock a little sense into that stupid ed o yours ive eard all about your silly little games ashore your father said he couldnt manage you so im goin to have a try and youll find im a very different sort o man to deal with to wot e is the idea o thinking this ship was a pirate why a boy your age ought to know there aint such things nowadays  you told me you was said the boy hotly else i wouldnt have come  thats just why i told you said the skipper  but i didnt think youd be such a fool as to believe it pirates indeed do we look like pirates  you dont said the boy with a sneer you look more like  like wot asked the skipper edging closer to him eh like wot  i forget the word said ralph with strong good sense  dont tell any lies now said the skipper flushing as he heard a chuckle from the mate go on out with it ill give you just two minutes  i forget it persisted ralph  dustman suggested the mate coming to his assistance coster chimbleysweep mudlark pickpocket convict washerwom  if youll look after your dooty george instead o interferin in matters that dont concern you said the skipper in a choking voice i shall be obliged now then you boy what were you going to say i was like  like the mate said ralph slowly  dont tell lies said the skipper furiously you couldnt ave forgot that word  i didnt forget it said ralph but i didnt know how youd like it  the skipper looked at him dubiously and pushing his cap from his brow scratched his head  and i didnt know how the mate ud like it either continued the boy  he relieved the skipper from an awkward dilemma by walking off to the galley and starting on a bowl of potatoes the master of the susan jane watched him blankly for some time and then looked round at the mate  you wont get much change out of im said the latter with a nod insultin little devil  the other made no reply but as soon as the potatoes were finished set his young friend to clean brass work and after that to tidy the cabin up and help the cook clean his pots and pans meantime the mate went below and overhauled his chest  this is where he gets all them ideas from he said coming aft with a big bundle of penny papers look at the titles of emthe lion of the pacific the onearmed buccaneer captain kidds last voyage  he sat down on the cabin skylight and began turning them over and picking out certain gems of phraseology read them aloud to the skipper the latter listened at first with scorn and then with impatience  i cant make head or tail out of what youre reading george he said snappishly who was rudolph read straight ahead  thus urged the mate leaning forward so that his listener might hear better read steadily through a serial in the first three numbers the third instalment left rudolph swimming in a race with three sharks and a boatload of cannibals and the joint efforts of both men failed to discover the other numbers  just wot i should ave expected of im said the skipper as the mate returned from a fruitless search in the boys chest ill make him a bit more orderly on this ship go an lock them other things up in your drawer george hes not to ave em again  the schooner was getting into open water now and began to feel it in front of them was the blue sea dotted with white sails and funnels belching smoke speeding from england to worlds of romance and adventure something of the kind the cook said to ralph and urged him to get up and look for himself he also with the best intentions discussed the restorative properties of fat pork from a medical point of view  the next few days the boy divided between seasickness and work the latter being the skippers great remedy for piratical yearnings three or four times he received a mild drubbing and what was worse than the drubbing had to give an answer in the affirmative to the skippers inquiry as to whether he felt in a more wholesome frame of mind on the fifth morning they stood in towards fairhaven and to his great joy he saw treess and houses again  they stayed at fairhaven just long enough to put out a small portion of their cargo ralph stripped to his shirt and trousers having to work in the hold with the rest and proceeded to lowport a little place some thirty miles distant to put out their powder  it was evening before they arrived and the tide being out anchored in the mouth of the river on which the town stands  git in about four oclock said the skipper to the mate as he looked over the side towards the little cluster of houses on the shore do you feel better now ive knocked some o that nonsense out o you boy  much better sir said ralph respectfully  be a good boy said the skipper pausing on the companionladder and you can stay with us if you like better turn in now as youll have to make yourself useful again in the morning working out the cargo  he went below leaving the boy on deck the crew were in the forecastle smoking with the exception of the cook who was in the galley over a little private business of his own  an hour later the cook went below to prepare for sleep the other two men were already in bed and he was about to get into his when he noticed that ralphs bunk which was under his own was empty he went upon deck and looked round and returning below scratched his nose in thought  wheres the boy he demanded taking jem by the arm and shaking him  eh said jem rousing whose boy  our boy ralph said the cook i cant see im nowhere i ope e aint gone overboard poor little chap  jem refusing to discuss the matter the cook awoke dobbs dobbs swore at him peacefully and resumed his slumbers the cook went up again and prowled round the deck looking in all sorts of unlikely places for the boy he even climbed a little way into the rigging and finding no traces of him was reluctantly forced to the conclusion that he had gone overboard  pore little chap he said solemnly looking over the ships side at the still waters  he walked slowly aft shaking his head and looking over the stern brought up suddenly with a cry of dismay and rubbed his eyes the ships boat had also disappeared  wot said the two seamen as he ran below and communicated the news well if its gorn its gorn  hadnt i better go an tell the skipper said the cook  let im find it out isself said jem purring contentedly in the blankets its is boat gonight  time we ad a noo un too said dobbs yawning dont you worry your ed cook about what dont consarn you  the cook took the advice and having made his few simple preparations for the night blew out the lamp and sprang into his bunk then he uttered a sharp exclamation and getting out again fumbled for the matches and relit the lamp a minute later he awoke his exasperated friends for the third time  selp me cook began jem fiercely  if you dont i will said dobbs sitting up and trying to reach the cook with his clenched fist  its a letter pinned to my pillow said the cook in trembling tones as he held it to the lamp  well we dont want to ear it said jem shut up dye hear  but there was that in the cooks manner which awed him  dear cook he read feverishly i have made an infernal machine with clockwork and hid it in the hold near the gunpowder when we were at fairhaven i think it will go off between ten and eleven tonight but i am not quite sure about the time dont tell those other beasts but jump overboard and swim ashore i have taken the boat i would have taken you too but you told me you swam seven miles once so you can eas  the reading came to an abrupt termination as his listeners sprang out of their bunks and bolting on deck burst wildly into the cabin and breathlessly reeled off the heads of the letter to its astonished occupants  stuck a wot in the hold gasped the skipper  infernal machine said the mate one of them things wot you blow up the ouses of parliament with  wots the time now interrogated jem anxiously  bout hapast ten said the cook trembling lets give em a hail ashore  they leaned over the side and sent a mighty shout across the water most of lowport had gone to bed but the windows in the inn were bright and lights showed in the upper windows of two or three of the cottages  again they shouted in deafening chorus casting fearful looks behind them and in the silence a faint answering hail came from the shore they shouted again like madmen and then listening intently heard a boats keel grate on the beach and then the welcome click of oars in the rowlocks  make haste bawled dobbs vociferously as the boat came creeping out of the darkness wy dont you make aste  wots the row cried a voice from the boat  gunpowder yelled the cook frantically theres ten tons of it aboard just going to explode hurry up  the sound of the oars ceased and a startled murmur was heard from the boat then an oar was pulled jerkily  theyre putting back said jem suddenly im going to swim for it stand by to pick me up mates he shouted and lowering himself with a splash into the water struck out strongly towards them dobbs a poor swimmer after a moments hesitation followed his example  i cant swim a stroke cried the cook his teeth chattering  the others who were in the same predicament leaned over the side listening the swimmers were invisible in the darkness but their progress was easily followed by the noise they made jem was the first to be hauled on board and a minute or two later the listeners on the schooner heard him assisting dobbs then the sounds of strife of thumps and wicked words broke on their delighted ears  theyre coming back for us said the mate taking a deep breath well done jem  the boat came towards them impelled by powerful strokes and was soon alongside the three men tumbled in hurriedly their fall being modified by the original crew who were lying crouched up in the bottom of the boat jem and dobbs gave way with hearty goodwill and the doomed ship receded into the darkness a little knot of people had gathered on the shore and receiving the tidings became anxious for the safety of their town it was felt that the windows at least were in imminent peril and messengers were hastily sent round to have them opened  still the deserted susan jane made no sign twelve oclock struck from the little church at the back of the town and she was still intact  somethings gone wrong said an old fisherman with a bad way of putting things nows the time for somebody to go and tow her out to sea  there was no response  to save lowport said the speaker feelingly if i was only twenty years younger  its old mens work said a voice  the skipper straining his eyes through the gloom in the direction of his craft said nothing he began to think that she had escaped after all  two oclock struck and the crowd began to disperse some of the bolder inhabitants who were fidgety about draughts closed their windows and children who had been routed out of their beds to take a nocturnal walk inland were led slowly back by three oclock the danger was felt to be over and day broke and revealed the forlorn susan jane still riding at anchor  im going aboard said the skipper suddenly whos coming with me  jem and the mate and the townpoliceman volunteered and borrowing the boat which had served them before pulled swiftly out to their vessel and taking the hatches off with unusual gentleness commenced their search it was nervous work at first but they became inured to it and moreover a certain suspicion slight at first but increasing in intensity as the search proceeded gave them some sense of security later still they began to eye each other shamefacedly  i dont believe theres anything there said the policeman sitting down and laughing boisterously that boys been making a fool of you  thats about the size of it groaned the mate well be the laughingstock o the town  the skipper who was standing with his back towards him said nothing but peering about stooped suddenly and with a sharp exclamation picked up something from behind a damaged case  ive got it he yelled suddenly stand clear  he scrambled hastily on deck and holding his find at arms length with his head averted flung it far into the water a loud cheer from a couple of boats which were watching greeted his action and a distant response came from the shore  was that a infernal machine whispered the bewildered jem to the mate why it looked to me just like one o them tins o corned beef  the mate shook his head at him and glanced at the constable who was gazing longingly over the side well ive eard of people being killed by them sometimes he said with a grin     a safety match  mr boom late of the mercantile marine had the last word but only by the cowardly expedient of getting out of earshot of his daughter first and then hurling it at her with a voice trained to compete with hurricanes miss boom avoided a complete defeat by leaning forward with her head on one side in the attitude of an eager but unsuccessful listener a pose which she abandoned for one of innocent joy when her sire having been deluded into twice repeating his remarks was fain to relieve his overstrained muscles by a fit of violent coughing  i blieve she heard it all along said mr boom sourly as he continued his way down the winding lane to the little harbour below the only way to live at peace with wimmen is to always be at sea then they make a fuss of you when you come homeif you dont stay too long that is  he reached the quay with its few tiny cottages and brown nets spread about to dry in the sun and walking up and down grumbling regarded with a jaundiced eye a few small smacks which lay in the harbour and two or three crusted amphibians lounging aimlessly about  mornin mr boom said a stalwart youth in seaboots appearing suddenly over the edge of the quay from his boat  mornin dick said mr boom affably just goin off  bout an hours time said the other miss boom well sir  shes a right said mr boom me an her ve just had a few words she picked up something off the floor what she said was a cake o mud off my heel said she wouldnt have it continued mr boom his voice rising my own floor too swep it up off the floor with a dustpan and brush and held it in front of me to look at  dick tarrell gave a grunt which might mean anythingmr boom took it for sympathy  i called her old maid he said with gusto youre a fidgety old maid i said you should ha seen her look do you know what i think dick  not exactly said tarrell cautiously  i bleeve shes that savage that shed take the first man that asked her said the other triumphantly shes sitting up there at the door of the cottage all by herself  tarrell sighed  with not a soul to speak to said mr boom pointedly  the other kicked at a small crab which was passing and returned it to its native element in sections  ill walk up there with you if youre going that way he said at length  no im just having a look round said mr boom but theres nothing to hinder you going dick if youve a mind to  theres no little thing you want as im going there i spose suggested tarrell its awkward when you go there and say good morning and the girl says good morning and then you dont say any more and she dont say any more if there was anything you wanted that i could help her look for it ud make talk easier  wellgo for my baccy pouch said mr boom after a minutes thought itll take you a long time to find that  why inquired the other  cos ive got it here said the unscrupulous mr boom producing it and placidly filling his pipe you might spendahthe best part of an hour looking for that  he turned away with a nod and tarrell after looking about him in a hesitating fashion to make sure that his movements were not attracting the attention his conscience told him they deserved set off in the hangdog fashion peculiar to nervous lovers up the road to the cottage kate boom was sitting at the door as her father had described and in apparent unconsciousness of his approach did not raise her eyes from her book  good morning said tarrell in a husky voice  miss boom returned the salutation and marking the place in her book with her forefinger looked over the hedge on the other side of the road to the sea beyond  your father has left his pouch behind and being as i was coming this way asked me to call for it faltered the young man  miss boom turned her head and regarding him steadily noted the rising colour and the shuffling feet  did he say where he had left it she inquired  no said the other  well my times too valuable to waste looking for pouches said kate bending down to her book again but if you like to go in and look for it you may  she moved aside to let him pass and sat listening with a slight smile as she heard him moving about the room  i cant find it he said after a pretended search  better try the kitchen now then said miss boom without looking up and then the scullery it might be in the woodshed or even down the garden you havent half looked  she heard the kitchen door close behind him and then taking her book with her went upstairs to her room the conscientious tarrell having duly searched all the abovementioned places returned to the parlour and waited he waited a quarter of an hour and then going out by the front door stood irresolute  i cant find it he said at length addressing himself to the bedroom window  no i was coming down to tell you said miss boom glancing sedately at him from over the geraniums i remember seeing father take it out with him this morning  tarrell affected a clumsy surprise it doesnt matter he said how nice your geraniums are  yes theyre all right said miss boom briefly  i cant think how you keep em so nice said tarrell  well dont try said miss boom kindly youd better go back and tell father about the pouch perhaps hes waiting for a smoke all this time  theres no hurry said the young man perhaps hes found it  well i cant stop to talk said the girl im busy reading  with these heartless words she withdrew into the room and the discomfited swain only too conscious of the sorry figure he cut went slowly back to the harbour to be met by mr boom with a wink of aggravating and portentous dimensions  youve took a long time he said slyly theres nothing like a little scheming in these things  it didnt lead to much said the discomfited tarrell  dont be in a hurry my lad said the elder man after listening to his experiences ive been thinking over this little affair for some time now an i think ive got a plan  if its anything about baccy pouches began the young man ungratefully  it aint interrupted mr boom its quite diffrent now youd best get aboard your craft and do your duty theres more young men won girls arts while doing of their duty thanthanif they warnt doing their duty do you understand me  it is inadvisable to quarrel with a prospective fatherinlaw so that tarrell said he did and with a moody nod tumbled into his boat and put off to the smack mr boom having walked up and down a bit and exchanged a few greetings bent his steps in the direction of the jolly sailor and ordering two mugs of ale set them down on a small bench opposite his old friend raggett  i see young tarrell go off grumpylike said raggett drawing a mug towards him and gazing at the fastreceding boats  aye well have to do what we talked about said boom slowly its opposition what that gal wants she simply sits and mopes for the want of somebody to contradict her  well why dont you do it said raggett that aint much for a father to do surely  i hev said the other slowly more than once o course when i insist upon a thing its done but a womans a delikit creetur raggett and the last row we had she got that ill that she couldnt get up to get my breakfast ready no nor my dinner either it made us both ill that did  are you going to tell tarrell inquired raggett  no said his friend like as not hed tell her just to curry favour with her im going to tell him hes not to come to the house no more thatll make her want him to come if anything will now theres no use wasting time you begin today  i dont know what to say murmured raggett nodding to him as he raised the beer to his lips  just go now and call inyou might take her a nosegay  i wont do nothing so darned silly said raggett shortly  well go without em said boom impatiently just go and get yourselves talked about thats allhave everybody making game of both of you talking about a goodlooking young girl being sweethearted by an old chap with one foot in the grave and a face like a dried herring thats what i want  mr raggett who was just about to drink put his mug down again and regarded his friend fixedly  might i ask who youre alloodin too he inquired somewhat shortly  mr boom brought up in midcareer shuffled a little and laughed uneasily them aint my words old chap he said it was the way she was speaking of you the other day  well i wont have nothin to do with it said raggett rising  well nobody neednt know anything about it said boom pulling him down to his seat again she wont tell im sureshe wouldnt like the disgrace of it  look here said raggett getting up again  i mean from her point of view said mr boom querulously youre very asty raggett  well i dont care about it said raggett slowly it seemed all right when we was talking about it but spose i have all my trouble for nothing and she dont take dick after all what then  well then theres no harm done said his friend and itll be a bit o sport for both of us you go up and start an ill have another pint of beer and a clean pipe waiting for you against you come back  sorely against his better sense mr raggett rose and went off grumbling it was fatiguing work on a hot day climbing the road up the cliff but he took it quietly and having gained the top moved slowly towards the cottage  morning mr raggett said kate cheerily as he entered the cottage dear dear the idea of an old man like you climbing about its wonderful  im sixtyseven said mr raggett viciously and i feel as young as ever i did  to be sure said kate soothingly and look as young as ever you did come in and sit down a bit  mr raggett with some trepidation complied and sitting in a very upright position wondered how he should begin i am just sixtyseven he said slowly im not old and im not young but im just old enough to begin to want somebody to look after me a bit  i shouldnt while i could get about if i were you said the innocent kate why not wait until youre bedridden  i dont mean that at all said mr raggett snappishly i mean im thinking of getting married  goodgracious said kate openmouthed  i may have one foot in the grave and resemble a dried herring in the face pursued mr raggett with bitter sarcasm but  you cant help that said kate gently  but im going to get married said raggett savagely  well dont get in a way about it said the girl of course if you want to andandyou can find somebody else who wants to theres no reason why you shouldnt have you told father about it  i have said mr raggett and he has given his consent  he put such meaning into this remark and so much more in the contortion of visage which accompanied it that the girl stood regarding him in blank astonishment  his consent she said in a strange voice  mr raggett nodded  i went to him first he said trying to speak confidently now ive come to youi want you to marry me  dont you be a silly old man mr raggett said kate recovering her composure and as for my father you go back and tell him i want to see him  she drew aside and pointed to the door and mr raggett thinking that he had done quite enough for one day passed out and retraced his steps to the jolly sailor mr boom met him halfway and having received his message spent the rest of the morning in fortifying himself for the reception which awaited him  it would be difficult to say which of the two young people was the more astonished at this sudden change of affairs miss boom affecting to think that her parents reason was affected treated him accordingly a state of affairs not without its drawbacks as mr boom found out tarrell on the other hand attributed it to greed and being forbidden the house spent all his time ashore on a stile nearly opposite and sullenly watched events  for three weeks mr raggett called daily and after staying to tea usually wound up the evening by formally proposing for kates hand both conspirators were surprised and disappointed at the quietness with which miss boom received these attacks mr raggett meeting with a politeness which was a source of much wonder to both of them  his courting came to an end suddenly he paused one evening with his hand on the door and having proposed in the usual manner was going out when miss boom called him back  sit down mr raggett she said calmly mr raggett wondering inwardly resumed his seat  you have asked me a good many times to marry you said kate  i have said mr raggett nodding  and im sure its very kind of you continued the girl and if ive hurt your feelings by refusing you it is only because i have thought perhaps i was not good enough for you  in the silence which followed this unexpected and undeserved tribute to mr raggetts worth the two old men eyed each other in silent consternation  still if youve made up your mind continued the girl i dont know that its for me to object youre not much to look at but youve got the loveliest chest of drawers and the best furniture all round in mastleigh and i suppose youve got a little money  mr raggett shook his head and in a broken voice was understood to say a very little  i dont want any fuss or anything of that kind said miss boom calmly no bridesmaids or anything of that sort it wouldnt be suitable at your age  mr raggett withdrew his pipe and holding it an inch or two from his mouth listened like one in a dream  just a few old friends and a bit of cake continued miss boom musingly and instead of spending a lot of money in foolish waste well have three weeks in london  mr raggett made a gurgling noise in his throat and suddenly remembering himself pretended to think that it was something wrong with his pipe and removing it blew noisily through the mouthpiece  perhaps he said in a trembling voiceperhaps youd better take a little longer to consider my dear  kate shook her head ive quite made up my mind she said quite and now i want to marry you just as much as you want to marry me goodnight father goodnightgeorge  mr raggett started violently and collapsed in his chair  raggett said mr boom huskily  dont talk to me said the other i cant bear it  mr boom respecting his friends trouble relapsed into silence again and for a long time not a word was spoken  my eds in a whirl said mr raggett at length  it ud be a wonder if it wasnt said mr boom sympathetically  to think continued the other miserably how ive been let in for this the plots an the plans and the artfulness whats been goin on round me an ive never seen it  what dye mean demanded mr boom with sudden violence  i know what i mean said mr raggett darkly  praps youll tell me then said the other  who thought of it first demanded mr raggett ferociously who came to me and asked me to court his slip of a girl  dont you be a old fool said mr boom heatedly its done now and whats done cant be undone i never thought to have a soninlaw seven or eight years older than what i am and whats more i dont want it  said i wasnt much to look at but she liked my chest o drawers repeated raggett mechanically  dont ask me where she gets her natur from cos i couldnt tell you said the unhappy parent she dont get it from me  mr raggett allowed this reflection upon the late mrs boom to pass unnoticed and taking his hat from the table fixed it firmly upon his head and gazing with scornful indignation upon his host stepped slowly out of the door without going through the formality of bidding him goodnight  george said a voice from above him  mr raggett started and glanced up at somebody leaning from the window  come in to tea tomorrow early said the voice pressingly goodnight dear  mr raggett turned and fled into the night dimly conscious that a dark figure had detached itself from the stile opposite and was walking beside him  that you dick he inquired nervously after an oppressive silence  thats me said dick i heard her call you dear mr raggett his face suffused with blushes hung his head  called you dear repeated dick i heard her say it im going to pitch you into the harbour ill learn you to go courting a young girl what are you stopping for  mr raggett delicately intimated that he was stopping because he preferred all things considered to be alone finding the young man however bent upon accompanying him he divulged the plot of which he had been the victim and bitterly lamented his share in it  you dont want to marry her then said the astonished dick  course i dont snarled mr raggett i cant afford it im too old besides which shell turn my little place topsyturvy look here dick i done this all for you now its evident she only wants my furniture if i give all the best of it to you shell take you instead  no she wont said dick grimly i wouldnt have her now not if she asked me on her bended knee  why not said raggett  i dont want to marry that sort o girl said the other scornfully its cured me  what about me then said the unfortunate raggett  well so far as i can see it serves you right for mixing in other peoples business said dick shortly well goodnight and good luck to you  to mr raggetts sore disappointment he kept to his resolution and being approached by mr boom on his elderly friends behalf was rudely frank to him  im a free man again he said blithely and i feel better than ive felt for ever so long more manly  you ought to think of other people said mr boom severely think of poor old raggett  well hes got a young wife out of it said dick i dare say hell be happy enough he wants somebody to help him spend his money  in this happy frame of mind he resumed his ordinary life and when he encountered his former idol met her with a heartiness and unconcern which the lady regarded with secret disapproval he was now so sure of himself that despite a suspicion of ulterior design on the part of miss boom he even accepted an invitation to tea  the presence of mr raggett made it a slow and solemn function nobody with any feelings could eat with any appetite with that afflicted man at the table and the meal passed almost in silence kate cleared the meal away and the men sat at the open door with their pipes while she washed up in the kitchen  me an raggett thought o stepping down to the sailors said mr boom after a third application of his friends elbow  ill come with you said dick  well weve got a little business to talk about said boom confidentially but we shant be long if you wait here dick well see you when we come back  all right said tarrell  he watched the two old men down the road and then moving his chair back into the room silently regarded the busy kate  make yourself useful said she brightly shake the tablecloth  tarrell took it to the door and having shaken it folded it with much gravity and handed it back  not so bad for a beginner said kate taking it and putting it in a drawer she took some needlework from another drawer and sitting down began busily stitching  weddingdress inquired tarrell with an assumption of great ease  no tablecloth said the girl with a laugh youll want to know a little more before you get married  plenty o time for me said tarrell im in no hurry  the girl put her work down and looked up at him  thats right she said steadily i suppose you were rather surprised to hear i was going to get married  a little said tarrell theres been so many after old raggett i didnt think hed ever be caught  oh said kate  i daresay hell make a very good husband said tarrell patronisingly i think youll make a nice couple hes got a nice home  thats why im going to marry him said kate do you think its wrong to marry a man for that  thats your business said tarrell coldly speaking for myself and not wishing to hurt your feelings i shouldnt like to marry a girl like that  you mean you wouldnt like to marry me said kate softly  she leaned forward as she spoke until her breath fanned his face  thats what i do mean said tarrell with a suspicion of doggedness in his voice  not even if i asked you on my bended knees said kate arent you glad youre cured  yes said tarrell manfully  so am i said the girl and now that you are happy just go down to the jolly sailors and make poor old raggett happy too  how ask tarrell  tell him that i have only been having a joke with him said kate surveying him with a steady smile tell him that i overheard him and father talking one night and that i resolved to give them both a lesson and tell them that i didnt think anybody could have been so stupid as they have been to believe in it  she leaned back in her chair and regarding the dumfounded tarrell with a smile of wicked triumph waited for him to speak raggett indeed she said disdainfully  i suppose said tarrell at length speaking very slowly my being stupid was no surprise to you  not a bit said the girl cheerfully  ill ask you to tell raggett yourself said tarrell rising and moving towards the door i shant see him goodnight  goodnight said she where are you going then  there was no reply  where are you going she repeated then a suspicion of his purpose flashed across her youre not foolish enough to be going away she cried in dismay  why not said tarrell slowly  because said kate looking downoh becausewell its ridiculous id sooner have you stay here and feel what a stupid youve been making of yourself i want to remind you of it sometimes  i dont want reminding said tarrell taking raggetts chair i know it now     a rash experiment  the hands on the wharf had been working all saturday night and well into the sunday morning to finish the foam and now at ten oclock with hatches down and freshlyscrubbed decks the skipper and mate stood watching the tide as it rose slowly over the smooth thames mud  what times she coming inquired the skipper turning a lazy eye up at the wharf  about hapast ten she said replied the mate its very good o you to turn out and let her have your stateroom  dont say another word about that said the skipper impressively ive met your wife once or twice george an i must say that a nicer spoken woman an a more wellbeaved one ive seldom seen  same to you said the mate your wife i mean  any man continued the skipper s would lay in a comfortable stateroom george and leave a lady atrying to turn and to dress and ondress herself in a pokey little locker ought to be ashamed of himself  you see its the luggage they bring said the mate slowly refilling his pipe what they want with it all i cant think as soon as my old woman makes up her mind to come for a trip tomorrow being bank holiday an she being in the mind for a outing what does she do goes down commercial road and buys a bonnet far beyond her station  theyre all like it said the skipper mines just as bad what does that boy want  the boy approached the edge of the jetty and peering down at them answered for himself  whos captain bunnett he demanded shrilly  thats me my lad said the skipper looking up  ive got a letter for yer said the boy holding it out  the skipper held out his hands and caught it and after reading the contents felt his beard and looked at the mate  it never rains but it pours he said figuratively  whats up inquired the other  eres my old woman coming now said the skipper sent a note to say shes getting ready as fast as she can an im not to sail on any account till she comes  thats awkward said the mate who felt that he was expected to say something  it never struck me to tell her your wife was coming said the skipper where were to put em both i dont know i spose its quite certain your wifell come  certain said the mate  no chance of er changing er mind suggested the skipper looking away from him  not now shes got that bonnet replied the mate i spose theres no chance of your wife changing hers  the skipper shook his head theres one thing he said hopefully theyll be nice company for each other theyll have to ave the stateroom between em its a good job my wife aint as big as yours  well be able to play four anded wist sometimes said the mate as he followed the skipper below to see what further room could be made  crowded but jolly said the other  the two cabs drove up almost at the same moment while they were below and mrs bunnetts cabman had no sooner staggered on to the jetty with her luggage than mrs fillsons arrived with hers the two ladies who were entire strangers stood regarding each other curiously as they looked down at the bare deck of the foam  george cried mrs fillson who was a fine woman raising her voice almost to a scream in the effort to make herself heard above the winch of a neighbouring steamer  it was unfortunate perhaps that both officers of the schooner bore the same highlyrespectable christian name  george cried mrs bunnett glancing indignantly at the other lady  george cried mrs fillson returning her looks with interest  hussey said mrs bunnett under her breath but not very much under  george  there was no response  george cried both ladies together  still no response and they made a louder effort  there was yet another george on board in the focsle and in response to pushes from curious friends below he came up and regarded the fair duettists openmouthed  what dyer want he said at length sheepishly  will you tell captain bunnett that his wife mrs bunnett is here said that lady a thin little woman with bright black eyes  yes mum said the seaman and was hurrying off when mrs fillson called him back  will you tell mr fillson that his wife mrs fillson is up here she said politely  all right mum said the other and went below to communicate the pleasing tidings both husbands came up on deck hastily and a glance served to show them how their wives stood  how do you do capn bunnett said mrs fillson with a fascinating smile  goodmorning marm said the skipper trying to avoid his wifes eyes thats my wife mrs bunnett  goodmorning maam said mrs fillson adjusting the new bonnet with the tips of her fingers  goodmorning to you said mrs bunnett in a cold voice but patronising you have come to bring your husband some of his things i suppose  shes coming with us said the skipper in a hurry to have it over wait half a moment and ill help you down  he got up on to the side and helped them both to the deck and with a great attempt at cheery conversation led the way below where in the midst of an impressive silence he explained that the ladies would have to share the stateroom between them  thats the only way out of it said the mate after waiting in vain for them to say something  its a fairish size when you come to look at it said the skipper putting his head on one side to see whether the bunk looked larger that way  pack three in there at a pinch said the mate hardily  still the ladies said nothing but there was a stormsignal hoisted in mrs bunnetts cheek which boded no good to her husband there was room only for one trunk in the stateroom and by prompt generalship mrs fillson got hers in first having seen it safe she went up on deck for a look round  george said mrs bunnett fiercely as soon as they were alone  yes my dear said her husband  pack that woman off home said mrs bunnett sharply  i couldnt do that said the skipper firmly its your own fault you should have said you was coming  oh i know you didnt want me to come said mrs bunnett the roses on her bonnet trembling the mate can think of a little pleasure for his wife but i can stay at home and do your mending and keep the house clean oh i know dont tell me  well its too late to alter it said her husband i must get up above now youd better come too  mrs bunnett followed him on deck and getting as far from the mates wife as possible watched with a superior air of part ownership the movements of the seamen as they got under way a favorable westerly breeze was blowing and the canvas once set she stood by her husband as he pointed out the various objects of interest on the banks of the river  they were still in the thick of the traffic at dinner time so that the skipper was able to his secret relief to send the mate below to do the honours of the table he came up from it pale and scared and catching the skippers eye hunched his shoulders significantly  no words inquired the latter anxiously in a halfwhisper  not exactly words replied the mate what you might call snacks  i know said the other with a groan  if you dont now said the mate you will at tea time im not going to sit down there with them again alone you neednt think it if you was to ask me what ive been eating i couldnt tell you  he moved off a bit as his table companions came up on deck and the master of the foam deciding to take the bull by the horns called both of them to him and pointed out the beauties of the various passing craft in the midst of his discourse his wife moved off leaving the unhappy man conversing alone with mrs fillson her face containing an expression such as is seen in the prints of the very best of martyrs as she watched them  at tea time the men sat in misery mrs bunnett passed mrs fillson her tea without looking at her an example which mrs fillson followed in handing her the cut bread and butter when she took the plate back it was empty and mrs bunnett convulsed with rage was picking the slices out of her lap  oh i am sorry said mrs fillson  youre not maam said mrs bunnett fiercely you did it a purpose  there there said both men feebly  of course my husbandll sit quite calm and see me insulted said mrs bunnett rising angrily from her seat  and my husbandll sit still drinking tea while im given the lie said mrs fillson bending an indignant look upon the mate  if you think im going to share the stateroom with that woman george youre mistaken said mrs bunnett in a terrible voice id sooner sleep on a doorstep  and id sooner sleep on the scraper said mrs fillson regarding her foes scanty proportions  very well me an the matell sleep there said the skipper wearily you can have the mates bunk and mrs fillson can have the locker you dont mind george  oh george dont mind said mrs bunnett mimickingly anythingll do for george if youd got the spirit of a man you wouldnt let me be insulted like this  and if youd got the spirit of a man said mrs fillson turning on her husband you wouldnt let them talk to me like this you never stick up for me  she flounced up on deck where mrs bunnett after a vain attempt to finish her tea shortly followed her the two men continued their meal for some time in silence  well have to ave a quarrel just to oblige them george said the skipper at length as he put down his cup nothing elsell satisfy em  it couldnt be done said the mate reaching over and clapping him on the back  just pretend i mean said the other  it couldnt be done proper said the mate theyd see through it weve sailed together five years now an never ad what i could call a really nasty word  well if you can think o anything said the skipper say so this sort o thing is worrying  see how we get on at breakfast said the mate as he lit his pipe if thats as bad as this well have a bit of a row to please em  breakfast next morning was if anything worse each lady directly inciting her lord to acts of open hostility in this they were unsuccessful but in the course of the morning the husbands arranged matters to their own satisfaction and at the next meal the storm broke with violence  i dont wish to complain or hurt anybodys feelings said the skipper after a sidewink at the mate but if you could eat your wittles with a little less noise george id take it as a favour  would you said the mate as his wife stiffened suddenly in her seat oh  both belligerents eyeing each other ferociously tried hard to think of further insults  like a pig continued the skipper grumblingly  the mate hesitated so long for a crushing rejoinder that his wife lost all patience and rose to her feet crimson with wrath  how dare you talk to my husband like that she demanded fiercely george come up on deck this instant  i dont mind what he says said the mate who had only just begun his dinner  you come away at once said his wife pushing his plate from him  the mate got up with a sigh and meeting the look of horrorstricken commiseration in his captains eye returned it with one of impotent rage  use a larger knife capn he said savagely youll swallow that little un one of these days  the skipper with the weapon in question gripped in his fist turned round and stared at him in petrified amazement  if i wasnt the capn o this ship george he said huskily an bound to set a good example to the men id whop you for them words  its all for your good captain bunnett said mrs fillson mincingly there was a poor old workhouse man i used to give a penny to some times who would eat with his knife and he choked himself with it  ay he did that and he hadnt got a mouth half the size o yours said the mate warningly  capn or no capn crew or no crew said the skipper in a suffocating voice i cant stand this come up on deck george and repeat them words  before the mate could accept the invitation he was dragged back by his wife while at the same time mrs bunnett with a frantic scream threw her arms round her husbands neck and dared him to move  you wait till i get you ashore my lad said the skipper threateningly  ill have to bring the ship home after ive done with you retorted the mate as he passed up on deck with his wife  during the afternoon the couples exchanged not a word though the two husbands exchanged glances of fiery import and later on their spouses being below gradually drew near to each other the mate however had been thinking and as they came together met his foe with a pleasant smile  bravo old man he said heartily  what dyer mean demanded the skipper in gruff astonishment  i mean the way you pretended to row me said the mate splendid you did it i tried to back you up but lor i wasnt in it with you  what dyer mean to say you didnt mean what you said inquired the other  why o course said the mate with an appearance of great surprise you didnt did you  no said the skipper swallowing something in his throat no o course not but you did it well too george uncommon well you did  not half so well as you did said the mate well i spose weve got to keep it up now  i spose so said the skipper but we mustnt keep it up on the same things george swallerin knives an that sort o thing i mean  no no said the mate hastily  an if you could get your missus to go home by train from summercove george we might have a little peace and quietness added the other  shed never forgive me if i asked her said the mate youll have to order it capn  i wont do that george said the skipper firmly id never treat a lady like that aboard my ship i ope i know ow to behave myself if i do eat with my knife  stow that said the mate reddening well wait an see what turns up he added hopefully  for the next three days nothing fresh transpired and the bickering between the couples assumed on the part of the men and virulent on the part of their wives went from bad to worse  it was evident that the ladies preferred it to any other amusement life on shipboard could offer and after a combined burst of hysterics on their part in which the whole ships company took a strong interest the husbands met to discuss heroic remedies  its getting worse and worse said the skipper ruefully well be the laughing stock o the crew even afore theyre done with us theres another day afore we reach summercove theres five or six days there an at least five back again  therell be murder afore then said the mate shaking his head  if we could only pack em both ome by train continued the skipper  thats an expense said the mate  it ud be worth it said the other  an they wouldnt do it said the mate neither of em  ive seen women having rows afore said the skipper but then they could get away from each other its being boxed up in this little craft as does the mischief  spose we pretend the ships not seaworthy said the mate  then theyd stand by us said the skipper closer than ever  i bleeve they would said the mate theyd go fast enough if wed got a case o smallpox or anything like that aboard though  the skipper grunted assent  it ud be worth trying said the mate weve pretended to have a quarrel now just as were going into port let one of the hands the boy if you like pretend hes sickening for smallpox  hows he going to do it inquired the skipper derisively  you leave it to me replied the other ive got an idea how its to be done  against his better judgment the skipper after some demur consented and the following day when the passengers were on deck gazing at the small port of summercove as they slowly approached it the cook came up excitedly and made a communication to the skipper  what cried the latter nonsense  whats the matter demanded mrs bunnett turning round  cook here has got it into his head that the boys got the smallpox said the skipper  both women gave a faint scream  nonsense said mrs bunnett with a pale face  rubbish said mrs fillson clasping her hands nervously  very good mum said the cook calmly you know best o course but i was on a barque once what got it aboard bad and i think i ought to know it when i see it  yes and now you think everythings the smallpox said mrs bunnett uneasily  very well mum said the cook spreading out his hands will you come down an ave a look atim  no snapped mrs bunnett retreating a pace or two  will you come down an ave a look at im sir inquired the cook  you stay where you are george said mrs bunnett shrilly as her husband moved forward go farther off cook  and keep your tongue still when we get to port said the mate dont go blabbing it all over the place mind or we shant get nobody to work us out  ay ay said the cook moving off i aint afraid of itive given it to people but ive never took it myself yet  im sure i wish i was off this dreadful ship said mrs fillson nervously nothing but unpleasantness how long before we get to summercove capn bunnett  bout a our an a arf ought to do it said the skipper  both ladies sighed anxiously and going as far aft as possible gazed eagerly at the harbour as it opened out slowly before them  i shall go back by train said mrs bunnett its a shame having my holiday spoilt like this  its one o them things what cant be helped said her husband piously  youd had better give me a little money continued his wife i shall get lodgings in the town for a day or two till i see how things are going  it ud be better for you to get straight back home said the skipper  nonsense said his wife sharply suppose you take it yourself i should have to be here to see you were looked after im sure mrs fillson isnt going home  mrs fillson holding out her hand to mr fillson said she was sure she wasnt  itd be a load of our minds if you did go said the mate speaking for both  well were not going for a day or two at any rate said mrs bunnett glancing almost amiably at mrs fillson  in face of this declaration and in view of the the persistent demands of the ladies both men with a very ill grace furnished them with some money  dont say a word about it ashore mind said the mate avoiding his chiefs indignant gaze  but you must have a doctor said mrs bunnett  i know of a doctor here said the mate thats all arranged for  he moved away for a little private talk with the skipper but that gentleman was not in a conversational mood and a sombre silence fell upon all until they were snugly berthed at summercove and the ladies preceded by their luggage on a trolly went off to look for lodgings they sent down an hour later to say that they had found them and that they were very clean and comfortable but a little more than they had intended to give they implored their husbands not to run any unnecessary risks and sent some disinfectant soap for them to wash with  for three days they kept their lodgings and became fast friends going despite their anxiety for various trips in the neighbourhood twice a day at least they sent down beeftea and other delicacies for the invalid which never got farther than the cabin communication being kept up by a small boy who had strict injunctions not to go aboard on the fourth day in the early morning they came down as close to the ship as they dared to bid farewell  write if theres any change for the worse cried mrs bunnett  or if you get it george cried mrs fillson anxiously  its all right hes going on beautiful said the mate  the two wives appeared to be satisfied and with a final adieu went off to the railway station turning at every few yards to wave farewells until they were out of sight  if ever i have another woman aboard my ship george said the skipper ill run into something whos the old gentleman  he nodded in the direction of an elderly man with white side whiskers who with a black bag in his hand was making straight for the schooner  captain bunnett he inquired sharply  thats me sir said the skipper  your wife sent me said the tall man briskly my names thompsondr thompson she says youve got a case of smallpox on board which she wants me to see  weve got a doctor said the skipper and mate together  so your wife said but she wished me particularly to see the case said dr thompson its also my duty as the medical officer of the port  youve done it george youve done it moaned the panicstricken skipper reproachfully  well anybody can make a mistake whispered the mate back an he cant touch us as it aint smallpox let him come and well lay it on to the cook say he made a mistake  thats the ticket said the skipper and turned to assist the doctor to the deck as the mate hurried below to persuade the indignant boy to strip and go bed  in the midst of a breathless silence the doctor examined the patient then to the surprise of all he turned to the crew and examined them one after the other  how long has this boy been ill he demanded  about four days said the puzzled skipper  you see what comes of trying to hush this kind of thing up said the doctor sternly you keep the patient down here instead of having him taken away and the ship disinfected and now all these other poor fellows have got it  what screamed the skipper as the crew broke into profane expressions of astonishment and selfpity got what  why the smallpox said the doctor got it in its worst form too suppressed theres not one of them got a mark on him its all inside  well im damned said the skipper as the crew groaned despairingly  what else did you expect inquired the doctor wrathfully well they cant be moved now they must all go to bed and you and the mate must nurse them  and spose we catch it said the mate feelingly  you must take your chance said the doctor then he relented a little ill try and send a couple of nurses down this afternoon he added in the mean time you must do what you can for them  very good sir said the skipper brokenly  all you can do at present said the doctor as he slowly mounted the steps is to sponge them all over with cold water do it every halfhour till the rash comes out  very good said the skipper again but youll hurry up with the nurses sir  he stood in a state of bewilderment until the doctor was out of sight and then with a heavy sigh took his coat off and set to work  he and the mate after warning off the men who had come down to work spent all the morning in sponging their crew waiting with an impatience born of fatigue for the rash to come out this impatience was shared by the crew the state of mind of the cook after the fifth sponging calling for severe rebuke on the part of the skipper  i wish the nurses ud come george he said as they sat on the deck panting after their exertions this is a pretty mess if you like  seems like a judgment said the mate wearily  hulloa there came a voice from the quay  both men turned and looked up at the speaker  hulloa said the skipper dully  whats all this about smallpox demanded the newcomer abruptly  the skipper waved his hand languidly towards the focsle  five of em down with it he said quietly are you another doctor sir  without troubling to reply their visitor jumped on board and went nimbly below followed by the other two  stand out of the light he said brusquely now my lads lets have a look at you  he examined them in a state of bewilderment grunting strangely as the washedout men submitted to his scrutiny  theyve had the best of cold sponging said the skipper not without a little pride  best of what demanded the other  the skipper told him drawing back indignantly as the doctor suddenly sat down and burst into a hoarse roar of laughter the unfeeling noise grated harshly on the sensitive ears of the sick men and joe burrows raising himself in his bunk made a feeble attempt to hit him  youve been sold said the doctor wiping his eyes  i dont take your meaning said the skipper with dignity  somebodys been having a joke with you said the doctor get up you fools youve got about as much smallpox as i have  do you mean to tell me began the skipper  somebodys been having a joke with you i tell you repeated the doctor as the men with sundry oaths half of relief half of dudgeon got out of bed and began groping for their clothes who is it do you think  the skipper shook his head and the mate following his lead in duty bound shook his but a little while after as they sat by the wheel smoking and waiting for the men to return to work the cargo out they were more confidential the skipper removed his pipe from his mouth and having eyed the mate for some time in silence jerked his thumb in the direction of the railway station the mate with a woebegone nod assented     the cabin passenger  the captain of the fearless came on to the wharf in a manner more suggestive of deerstalking than that of a prosaic shipmaster returning to his craft he dodged round an empty van lurked behind an empty barrel flitted from that to a post and finally from the interior of a steam crane peeped melodramatically on to the deck of his craft  to the ordinary observer there was no cause for alarm the decks were a bit slippery but not dangerous except to a novice the hatches were on and in the lighted galley the cook might be discovered moving about in a manner indicative of quiet security and an untroubled conscience  with a last glance behind him the skipper descended from the crane and stepped lightly aboard  hist said the cook coming out quietly ive been watching for you to come  damned fine idea of watching youve got said the skipper irritably what is it  the cook jerked his thumb towards the cabin  hes down there he said in a hoarse whisper  the mate said when you came aboard you was just to go and stand near the companion and whistle god save the queen and hell come up to you to see whats to be done  whistle said the skipper trying to moisten his parched lips with his tongue i couldnt whistle just now to save my life  the mate dont know what to do and that was to be the signal said the cook hes down there with him givin im drink and amoosin im  well you go and whistle it said the skipper  the cook wiped his mouth on the back of his hand ow does it go he inquired anxiously i never could remember toones  oh go and tell bill to do it said the skipper impatiently  summoned noiselessly by the cook bill came up from the forecastle and on learning what was required of him pursed up his lips and started our noble anthem with a whistle of such richness and volume that the horrified skipper was almost deafened with it it acted on the mate like a charm and he came from below and closed bills mouth none too gently with a hand which shook with excitement then as quietly as possible he closed the companion and secured the fastenings  hes all right he said to the skipper breathlessly hes a prisoner hes ad four goes o whisky an he seems inclined to sleep  who let him go down the cabin demanded the skipper angrily its a fine thing i cant leave the ship for an hour or so but what i come back and find people sitting all round my cabin  he let hisself darn said the cook who saw a slight opening advantageous to himself in connection with a dish smashed the day before an i was that surprised not to say alarmed that i dropped the large dish and smashed it  what did he say inquired the skipper  the blue one i mean said the cook who wanted that matter settled for good the one with the place at the end for the gravy to run into  what did he say vociferated the skipper  e ses ullo he ses youve done it now old man replied the truthful cook  the skipper turned a furious face to the mate  when the cook come up and told me said the mate in answer i see at once what was up so i went down and just talked to him clever like  i should like to know what you said muttered the skipper  well if you think you can do better than i did youd better go down and see him retorted the mate hotly after all its you what e come to see hes your visitor  no offence bob said the skipper i didnt mean nothing  i dont know nothin o horse racin continued the mate with an insufferable air and i never ad no money troubles in my life bein always brought up proper at ome and warned of what would appen but i know a sheriffs officer when i see im  what am i to do groaned the skipper too depressed even to resent his subordinates manner its a judgment summons its ruin if he gets me  well so far as i can see the only thing for you to do is to miss the ship this trip said the mate without looking at him i can take her out all right  i wont said the skipper interrupting fiercely  very well youll be nabbed said the mate  youve been wanting to handle this craft a long time said the skipper fiercely you could ha got rid of him if youd wanted to hes no business down my cabin  i tried everything i could think of asseverated the mate  well hes come down on my ship without being asked said the skipper fiercely and damme he can stay there cast off  but said the mate spose  cast off repeated the skipper hes come on my ship and ill give him a trip free  and where are you and the mate to sleep inquired the cook who was a man of pessimistic turn of mind and given to forebodings  in your bunks said the skipper brutally cast off there  the men obeyed grinning and the schooner was soon threading her way in the darkness down the river the skipper listening somewhat nervously for the first intimation of his captives awakening  he listened in vain that night for the prisoner made no sign but at six oclock in the morning when the fearless coming within sight of the nore began to dance like a cork upon the waters the mate reported hollow groans from the cabin  let him groan said the skipper briefly as holler as he likes  well ill just go down and see how he is said the mate  you stay where you are said the skipper sharply  well but you aint going to starve the man  nothing to do with me said the skipper ferociously if a man likes to come down and stay in my cabin thats his business im not supposed to know hes there and if i like to lock my cabin up and sleep in a foscle whats got more fleas in than ten other focsles put together and what smells worse than ten focsles rolled into one thats my business  yes but i dont want to berth forard too grumbled the other he cant touch me i can go and sleep in my berth  youll do what i wish my lad said the skipper  im the mate said the other darkly  and im the master said the other if the master of a ship can stay down the focsle im sure a tuppenyhapenny mate can  the men dont like it objected the mate  damn the men said the skipper politely and as to starving the chap theres a waterbottle full o water in my stateroom to say nothing of a jug and a bag o biscuits under the table  the mate walked off whistling and the skipper by no means so easy in his mind as he pretended to be began to consider ways and means out of the difficulty which he foresaw must occur when they reached port  what sort o looking chap is he he inquired of the cook  big stronglooking chap was the reply  look as though hed make a fuss if i sent you and bill down below to gag him when we get to the other end suggested the skipper  the cook said that judging by appearances fuss would be no word for it  i cant understand him keeping so quiet said the skipper thats what gets over me  hes biding is time i expect said the cook comfortingly hes a ard looking customer sides which hes likely seasick  the day passed slowly and as night approached a sense of mystery and discomfort overhung the vessel the man at the wheel got nervous and flattered bill into keeping him company by asking him to spin him a yarn he had good reason for believing that he knew his comrades stock of stories by heart but in the sequel it transpired that there was one of a prisoner turning into a cat and getting out of the porthole and running up helmsmens backs which he hadnt heard before and he told bill in the most effective language he could command that he never wanted to hear it again  the night passed and day broke and still the mysterious passenger made no sign the crew got in the habit of listening at the companion and peeping through the skylight but the door of the stateroom was closed and the cabin itself as silent as the grave the skipper went about with a troubled face and that afternoon unable to endure the suspense any longer civilly asked the mate to go below and investigate  id rather not said the mate shrugging his shoulders  id sooner he served me and have done with it said the skipper i get thinking all sorts of awful things  well why dont you go down yourself said the mate hed serve you fast enough ive no doubt  well it may be just his artfulness said the skipper an i dont want to humour him if hes all right im askin it as a favour bob  ill go if the cookll come said the mate after a pause  the cook hesitated  go on cook said the skipper sharply dont keep the mate waiting and whatever you do dont let him come up on deck  the mate led the way to the companion and opening it quietly led the way below followed by the cook there was a minutes awful suspense and then a wild cry rang out below and the couple came dashing madly up on deck again  what is it inquired the pallid skipper  the mate leaning for support against the wheel opened his mouth but no words came the cook his hands straight by his side and his eyes glassy made a picture from which the crew drew back in awe  whatsthematter said the skipper again  then the mate regaining his composure by an effort spoke  you neednt trouble to fasten the companion again he said slowly  the skippers face changed from white to grey why not he asked in a trembling voice  hes dead was the solemn reply  nonsense said the other with quivering lips  hes shamming or else fainting did you try to bring him round  i did not said the mate i dont deceive you i didnt stay down there to do no restoring and i dont think you would either  go down and see whether you can wake him cook said the skipper  not me said the cook with a mighty shudder  two of the hands went and peeped furtively down through the skylight the empty cabin looked strangely quiet and drear and the door of the stateroom stood ajar there was nothing to satisfy their curiosity but they came back looking as though they had seen a ghost  whats to be done said the skipper helplessly  nothing can be done said the mate hes beyond our aid  i wasnt thinking about him said the skipper  well the best thing you can do when we get to plymouth is to bolt said the mate well hide it up as long as we can to give you a start its a hanging matter  the hapless master of the fearless wiped his clammy brow i cant think hes dead he said slowly wholl come down with me to see  youd better leave it alone said the mate kindly it aint pleasant and besides that we can all swear up to the present that you havent touched him or been near him  wholl come down with me repeated the skipper i believe its a trick and that hell start up and serve me but i feel i must go  he caught bills eye and that worthy seaman after a short tussle with his nerves shuffled after him the skipper brushing aside the mate who sought to detain him descended first and entering the cabin stood hesitating with bill close behind him  just open the door bill he said slowly  arter you sir said the wellbred bill  the skipper stepped slowly towards it and flung it suddenly open then he drew back with a sharp cry and looked nervously about him the bed was empty  wheres he gone whispered the trembling bill  the other made no reply but in a dazed fashion began to grope about the cabin it was a small place and soon searched and the two men sat down and eyed each other in blank amazement  where is he said bill at length  the skipper shook his head helplessly and was about to ascribe the mystery to supernatural agencies when the truth in all its naked simplicity flashed upon him and he spoke its the mate he said slowly the mate and the cook i see it all now theres never been anybody here it was a little job on the mates part to get the ship if you want to hear a couple o rascals sized up bill come on deck  and bill grinning in anticipation went     choice spirits  the day was fine and the breeze so light that the old patched sails were taking the schooner along at a gentle three knots per hour a sail or two shone like snow in the offing and a gull hovered in the air astern from the cabin to the galley and from the galley to the untidy tangle in the bows there was no sign of life to benefit by the conversation of the skipper and mate as they discussed a wicked and mutinous spirit which had become observable in the crew  its sheer rank wickedness thats what it is said the skipper a small elderly man with grizzled beard and light blue eyes  rank agreed the mate whose temperament was laconic  why when i was a boy you wouldnt believe what i had to eat said the skipper not if i took my bible oath on it you wouldnt  theyre dainty said the mate  dainty said the other indignantly what right have hungry sailormen to be dainty dont i give them enough to eat look look there  he drew back choking and pointed with his forefinger as bill smith ab came on deck with a plate held at arms length and a nose disdainfully elevated he affected not to see the skipper and walking in a mincing fashion to the side raked the food from the plate into the sea with his fingers he was followed by george simpson ab who in the same objectionable fashion wasted food which the skipper had intended should nourish his frame  ill pay em for this murmured the skipper  theres some more said the mate  two more men came on deck grinning consciously and disposed of their dinners then there was an intervalan interval in which everybody fore and aft appeared to be waiting for something the something being at that precise moment standing at the foot of the focsle ladder trying to screw its courage up  if the boy comes said the skipper in a strained unnatural voice ill flay him alive  youd better get your knife out then said the mate  the boy appeared on deck very white about the gills and looking piteously at the crew for support he became conscious from their scowls that he had forgotten something and remembering himself stretched out his skinny arms to their full extent and crinkling his nose walked with great trepidation to the side  boy vociferated the skipper suddenly  yessir said the urchin hastily  commere said the skipper sternly  shove your dinner over first said four low menacing voices  the boy hesitated then walked slowly towards the skipper  what are you going to do with that dinner demanded the latter grimly  eat it said the youth modestly  what dyer bring it on deck for then inquired the other bending his brows on him  i thought it would taste better on deck sir said the boy  taste better growled the skipper ferociously aint it good  yessir said the boy  speak louder said the skipper sternly is it very good  beautiful said the boy in a shrill falsetto  did you ever taste better wittles than you get aboard this ship demanded the skipper setting him a fine example in loud speaking  never yelled the boy following it  everything as it should be roared the skipper  better than it should be shrilled the craven  sit down and eat it commanded the other  the boy sat on the cabin skylight and taking out his pocketknife began his meal with every appearance of enjoyment the skipper with his elbows on the side and his legs crossed regarding him serenely  i suppose he said loudly after watching the boy for some time i spose the men threw theirs overboard becos they hadnt been used to such good food  yessir said the boy  did they say so bawled the other  the boy hesitated and glanced nervously forward yessir he said at length and shuddered as a low ominous growl came from the crew despite his slowness the meal came to an end at last and in obedience to orders he rose and took his plate forward looking entreatingly at the crew as he passed them  come down below said bill we want to have a talk with you  cant said the boy ive got my work to do i havent got time to talk  he stayed up on deck until evening and then the mens anger having evaporated somewhat crept softly below and climbed into his bunk simpson leaned over and made a clutch at him but bill pushed him aside  leave him alone said he quietly well take it out of him tomorrow  for some time tommy lay worrying over the fate in store for him and then yielding to fatigue turned over and slept soundly until he was awakened some three hours later by the mens voices and looking out saw that the lamp was alight and the crew at supper listening quietly to bill who was speaking  ive a good mind to strike thats what ive a good mind to do he said savagely as after an attempt at the butter he put it aside and ate dry biscuit  an get six months said old ned that wont do bill  are we to go a matter of six or seven days on dry biscuit and rotten taters demanded the other fiercely why its slow sooicide  i wish one of you would commit sooicide said ned looking wistfully round at the faces that ud frighten the old man and bring him round a bit  well youre the eldest said bill pointedly  brownings a easy death too said simpson persuasively you cant have much enjoyment in life at your age ned  and you might leave a letter behind to the skipper saying as ow you was drove to it by bad food said the cook who was getting excited  talk sense said the old man very shortly  look here said bill suddenly i tell you what we can do let one of us pretend to commit suicide and write a letter as slushey here ses saying as ow were gone overboard sooner than be starved to death it ud scare the old man proper and praps hed let us start on the other meat without eating up this rotten stuff first  hows it to be done asked simpson staring  go an ide down the fore old said bill theres not much stuff down there well take off the hatch when one of us is on watch tonight andwhoever wants tocan go and hide down there till the old mans come to his senses what do you think of it mates  its all right as an idea said ned slowly but whos going  tommy replied bill simply  blest if i ever thought of him said ned admiringly did you cookie  never crossed my mind said the cook  you see the best o tommys going said bill is that the old man ud only give him a flogging if he found it out we wouldnt split as to who put the hatch on over him he can be there as comfortable as you please do nothing and sleep all day if he likes o course we dont know anything about it we miss tommy and find the letter wrote on this table  the cook leaned forward and regarded his colleague favourably then he pursed his lips and nodded significantly at an upper bunk from which the face of tommy pale and scared looked anxiously down  halloa said bill have you heard what weve been saying  i heard you say something about going to drown old ned said tommy guardedly  hes heard all about it said the cook severely do you know where little boys who tell lies go to tommy  id sooner go there than down the fore old said tommy beginning to knuckle his eyes i wont go ill tell the skipper  no you wont said bill sternly this is your punishment for them lies you told about us today an very cheap youve got off too now get out o that bunk come on afore i pull you out  with a miserable whimper the youth dived beneath his blankets and clinging frantically to the edge of his berth kicked convulsively as he was lifted down blankets and all and accommodated with a seat at the table  pen and ink and paper ned said bill  the old man produced them and bill first wiping off with his coatsleeve a piece of butter which the paper had obtained from the table spread it before the victim  i cant write said tommy sullenly  the men looked at each other in dismay  its a lie said the cook  i tell you i cant said the urchin becoming hopeful thats why they sent me to sea becos i couldnt read or write  pull his ear bill said ned annoyed at these aspersions upon an honourable profession  it dont matter said bill calmly ill write it for im the old man dont know my fist  he sat down at the table and squaring his shoulders took a noisy dip of ink and scratching his head looked pensively at the paper  better spell it bad bill suggested ned  ay ay said the other ow do you think a boy would spell sooicide ned  the old man pondered sooeyside he said slowly  why thats the right way aint it inquired the cook looking from one to the other  we mustnt spell it right said bill with his pen hovering over the paper be careful ned  well say killed myself instead said the old man a boy wouldnt use such a big word as that praps  bill bent over his work and apparently paying great attention to his friends entreaties not to write it too well slowly wrote the letter  hows this he inquired sitting back in his seat  deer captin i take my pen in hand for the larst time to innform you that i am no more suner than heat the orrible stuff what you kall meet i have drownded miself it is a moor easy death than starvin i ave left my clasp nife to bill an my silver wotch to it is ard too dee so young tommie brown  splendid said ned as the reader finished and looked inquiringly round  i put in that bit about the knife and the watch to make it seem real said bill with modest pride but if you like ill leave em to you instead ned  i dont want em said the old man generously  put your cloes on said bill turning to the whimpering tommy  im not going down that fore old said tommy desperately you may as well know now as later oni wont go  cookie said bill calmly just and me them cloes will you now tommy  i tell you im not going to said tommy  an that little bit o rope cookie said bill its just down by your and now tommy  the youngest member of the crew looked from his clothes to the rope and from the rope back to his clothes again  howm i goin to be fed he demanded sullenly as he began to dress  youll have a stone bottle o water to take down with you an some biskits replied bill an of a night time well hand you down some o that meat youre so fond of hide em behind the cargo an if you hear anybody take the hatch off in the day time nip behind it yourself  an what about fresh air demanded the sacrifice  youll ave fresh air of a night when the hatch is took off said bill dont you worry ive thought of everything  the arrangements being concluded they waited until simpson relieved the mate at the helm and then trooped up on deck halfpushing and halfleading their reluctant victim  its just as if he was going on a picnic said old ned as the boy stood unwillingly on the deck with a stone bottle in one hand and some biscuits wrapped up in an old newspaper in the other  lend a and bill easy does it  noiselessly the two seamen took off the hatch and as tommy declined to help in the proceedings at all ned clambered down first to receive him bill took him by the scruff of the neck and lowered him down kicking strongly into the hold  have you got him inquired bill  yes said ned in a smothered voice and depositing the boy in the hold hastily clambered up again wiping his mouth  been having a swig at the bottle inquired bill  boys heel said ned very shortly get the hatch on  the hatch was replaced and bill and his fellow conspirator treading quietly and not without some apprehension for the morrow went below and turned in tommy who had been at sea long enough to take things as he found them curled up in the corner of the hold and with his bottle as a pillow fell asleep  it was not until eight oclock next morning that the master of the sunbeam discovered that he was a boy short he questioned the cook as he sat at breakfast the cook who was a very nervous man turned pale set the coffeepot down with a thump which upset some of the liquor and bolted up on deck the skipper after shouting for him in some of the most alluring swear words known on the high seas went raging up on deck where he found the men standing in a little knot looking very ill at ease  bill said the skipper uneasily whats the matter with that damned cook  es ad a shock sir said bill shaking his head weve all ad a shock  youll have another in a minute said the skipper emotionally wheres the boy  for a moment bills hardihood forsook him and he looked helplessly at his mates in their anxiety to avoid his gaze they looked over the side and a horrible fear came over the skipper he looked at bill mutely and bill held out a dirty piece of paper  the skipper read it through in a state of stupefaction then he handed it to the mate who had followed him on deck the mate read it and handed it back  its yours he said shortly  i dont understand it said the skipper shaking his head why only yesterday he was up on deck here eating his dinner and saying it was the best meat he ever tasted you heard him bob  i heard him pore little devil said the mate  you all heard him said the skipper  well theres five witnesses ive got he must have been mad didnt nobody hear him go overboard  i eard a splash sir in my watch said bill  why didnt you run and see what it was demanded the other  i thought it was one of the chaps come up to throw his supper overboard said bill simply  ah said the skipper biting his lip did you youre always going on about the grub whats the matter with it  its pizon sir said ned shaking his head the meats awful  its as sweet as nuts said the skipper well you can have it out of the other tank if you like will that satisfy you  the men brightened up a little and nudged each other  the butters bad too sir said bill  butter bad said the skipper frowning hows that cook  i aint done nothing to it sir said the cook helplessly  give em butter out o the firkin in the cabin growled the skipper its my firm belief youd been illusing that boy the food was delicious  he walked off taking the letter with him and propping it up against the sugarbasin made but a poor breakfast  for that day the men lived as ned put it on the fat of the land in addition to the other luxuries figgy duff a luxury hitherto reserved for sundays being also served out to them bill was regarded as a bigbrained benefactor of the human race joy reigned in the focsle and at night the hatch was taken off and the prisoner regaled with a portion which had been saved for him he ate it ungratefully and put churlish and inconvenient questions as to what was to happen at the end of the voyage  well smuggle you ashore all right said bill none of us are going to sign back in this old tub ill take you aboard some ship with meeh  i didnt say anything said tommy untruthfully  to the wrath and confusion of the crew next day their commanding officer put them back on the old diet again the old meat was again served out and the grassfed luxury from the cabin stopped bill shared the fate of all leaders when things go wrong and from being the idol of his fellows became a butt for their gibes  what about your little idea now grunted old ned scornfully that evening as he broke his biscuit roughly with his teeth and dropped it into his basin of tea  you aint as clever as you thought you was bill said the cook with the air of a discoverer  and theres that pore dear boy shut up in the dark for nothing said simpson with somewhat belated thoughtfulness an cookie doing his work  im not going to be beat said bill blackly the old man was badly scared yesterday we must have another sooicide thats all  let tommy do it again suggested the cook flippantly and they all laughed  two on one tripll about do the old man up said bill regarding the interruption unfavourably now whos going to be the next  weve had enough o this game said simpson shrugging his shoulders youve gone cranky bill  no i aint said bill im not going to be beat thats all whoever goes down they ll have a nice easy lazy time sleep all day if he likes and nothing to do you aint been looking very well lately ned  oh said the old man coldly  well settle it between you said bill carelessly its all one to me which of you goes  ho an what about you demanded simpson  me inquired bill in astonishment why ive got to stay up here and manage it  well well stay up and help you said simpson derisively  ned and the cook laughed simpson joined in bill rose and going to his bunk fished out a pack of greasy cards from beneath his bedding  larst cut sooicide he said briefly im in it  he held the pack before the cook the cook hesitated and looked at the other two  dont be a fool bill said simpson  why do you funk it sneered bill  its a fools game i tell you said simpson  well you elped me start it said the other youre afraid thats what you are afraid you can let the boy go down there but when it comes to yourselves you turn chickenarted  all right said simpson recklessly let bill ave is way out cookie  sorely against his better sense the cook complied and drew a ten ned after much argument cut and drew seven simpson with a king in his fist leaned back on the locker and fingered his beard nonchalantly go on bill he said see what you can do  bill took the pack and shuffled it i orter be able to beat seven he said slowly he handed the pack to ned drew a card and the other three sat back and laughed boisterously  three said simpson bravo bill ill write your letter for you hed know your writing what shall i say  say what you like retorted bill breathing hard as he thought of the hold  he sat back sneering disdainfully as the other three merrily sat down to compose his letter replying only by a contemptuous silence when simpson asked him whether he wanted any kisses put in when the letter was handed over for his inspection he only made one remark  i thought you could write better than that george he said haughtily  im writing it for you said simpson  bills hauteur vanished and he became his old self again if you want a plug in the eye george he said feelingly youve only got to say so you know  his temper was so unpleasant that half the pleasure of the evening was spoiled and instead of being conducted to his hidingplace with quips and light laughter the proceedings were more like a funeral than anything else the crowning touch to his illnature was furnished by tommy who upon coming up and learning that bill was to be his roommate gave way to a fit of the most unfeigned horror  theres another letter for you this morning said the mate as the skipper came out of his stateroom buttoning up his waistcoat  another what demanded the other turning pale  the mate jerked his thumb upwards old ned has got it he continued i cant think whats come over the men  the skipper dashed up on deck and mechanically took the letter from ned and read it through he stood for some time like a man in a dream and then stumbled down the focsle and looked in all the bunks and even under the table then he came up and stood by the hold with his head on one side the men held their breath  whats the meaning of all this he demanded at length sitting limply on the hatch with his eyes down  bad grub sir said simpson gaining courage from his manner thats what well have to say when we get ashore  youre not to say a word about it said the other firing up  its our dooty sir said ned impressively  look here now said the skipper and he looked at the remaining members of the crew entreatingly dont lets have no more suicides the old meats gone now and you can start the other and when we get to port ill ship in some fresh butter and vegetables but i dont want you to say anything about the food being bad or about these letters when we get to port i shall simply say the two of em disappeared an i want you to say the same  it cant be done sir said simpson firmly  the skipper rose and walked to the side would a fipun note make any difference he asked in a low voice  it ud make a little difference said ned cautiously  the skipper looked up at simpson on the face of simpson was an expression of virtuous arithmetical determination  the skipper looked down again or a fipun note each he said in a low voice i cant go beyond that  call it twenty pun and its a bargain aint it mates said simpson  ned said it was and even the cook forgot his nervousness and said it was evident the skipper must do the generous thing and theyd stand by him  wheres the money coming from inquired the mate as the skipper went down to breakfast and discussed the matter with him they wouldnt get nothing out of me  the skylight was open the skipper with a glance at it bent forward and whispered in his ear  wot said the mate he endeavoured to suppress his laughter with hot coffee and bacon with the result that he had to rise from his seat and stand patiently while the skipper dealt him some hearty thumps on the back  with the prospect of riches before them the men cheerfully faced the extra work the cook did the boys while ned and simpson did bills between them when night came they removed the hatch again and with a little curiosity waited to hear how their victims were progressing  wheres my dinner growled bill hungrily as he drew himself up on deck  dinner said ned in surprise why you aint got none  wot said bill ferociously  you see the skipper only serves out for three now said the cook  well why didnt you save us some demanded the other  there aint enough of it bill there aint indeed said ned we have to do more work now and there aint enough even for us youve got biscuit and water havent you  bill swore at him  i ve ad enough o this he said fiercely im coming up let the old man do what he likes i dont care  dont do that bill said the old man persuasively everythings going beautiful you was quite right what you said about the old man we was wrong hes skeered fearful and hes going to give us twenty pun to say nothing about it when we get ashore  im going to have ten out o that said bill brightening a little and its worth it too i get the orrors shut up down there all day  ay ay said ned with a side kick at the cook who was about to question bills method of division  the old man sucked it all in beautiful said the cook hes in a dreadful way hes got all your clothes and things and the boys and hes going to and em over to your friends its the best joke i ever heard  youre a fool said bill shortly and lighting his pipe went and squatted in the bows to wrestle grimly with a naturally bad temper  for the ensuing four days things went on smoothly enough the weather being fair the watch at night was kept by the men and regularly they had to go through the unpleasant jackinthebox experience of taking the lid off bill the sudden way he used to pop out and rate them about his sufferings and their callousness was extremely trying and it was only by much persuasion and reminder of his share of the hushmoney that they could persuade him to return again to his lair at daybreak  still undisturbed they rounded the lands end the day had been close and muggy but towards night the wind freshened and the schooner began to slip at a good pace through the water the two prisoners glad to escape from the stifling atmosphere of the hold sat in the bows with an appetite which the air made only too keen for the preparations made to satisfy it  ned was steering and the other two men having gone below and turned in there were no listeners to their low complaints about the food  its a fools game tommy said bill shaking his head  game said tommy sniffing ow are we going to get away when we get to northsea  you leave that to me said bill old ned seems to ha got a bad cough he added  hes choking i should think said tommy leaning forward look hes waving his hand at us  both sprang up hastily but ere they could make any attempt to escape the skipper and mate emerged from the companion and walked towards them  look here said the skipper turning to the mate and indicating the culprits with his hand perhaps youll disbelieve in dreams now  strordinary said the mate rubbing his eyes as bill stood sullenly waiting events while the miserable tommy skulked behind him  ive heard o such things continued the skipper in impressive tones but i never expected to see it you cant say you havent seen a ghost now bob  strordinary said the mate shaking his head again lifelike  the ships haunted ned cried the skipper in hollow tones heres the sperrits o bill and the boy standing agin the windlass  the bewildered old seaman made no reply the smaller spirit sniffed and wiped his nose on his cuff and the larger one began to whistle softly  poor things said the skipper after they had discussed these extraordinary apparitions for some time can you see the windlass through the boy bob  i can see through both of em said the mate slyly  they stayed on deck a little longer and then coming to the conclusion that their presence on deck could do no good and indeed seemed only to embarrass their visitors went below again leaving all hands a prey to the wildest astonishment  wots is little game asked simpson coming cautiously up on deck  damned if i know said bill savagely  he dont really think youre ghosts suggested the cook feebly  o course not said bill scornfully hes got some little game on well im going to my bunk youd better come too tommy well find out what it all means tomorrer ive no doubt  on the morrow they received a little enlightenment for after breakfast the cook came forward nervously to break the news that meat and vegetables had only been served out for three consternation fell upon all  ill go an see im said bill ravenously  he found the skipper laughing heartily over something with the mate at the seamans approach he stepped back and eyed him coolly  mornin sir said bill shuffling up wed like to know sir me an tommy whether we can have our rations for dinner served out now same as before  dinner said the skipper in surprise what do you want dinner for  eat said bill eyeing him reproachfully  eat said the skipper whats the good o giving dinner to a ghost why youve got nowhere to put it  by dint of great selfcontrol bill smiled in a ghastly fashion and patted his stomach  all air said the skipper turning away  can we have our clothes and things then said bill grinding his teeth ned says as how youve got em  certainly not said the skipper i take em home and give em to your next o kin thats the law aint it bob  it is said the mate  theyll ave your effects and your pay up to the night you committed suicide said the skipper  we didnt commit sooicide said bill how could we when were standing here  oh yes you did said the other ive got your letters in my pocket to prove it besides if you didnt i should give you in charge for desertion directly we get to port  he exchanged glances with the mate and bill after standing first on one leg and then on the other walked slowly away for the rest of the morning he stayed below setting the smaller ghost a bad example in the way of language and threatening his fellows with all sorts of fearful punishments  until dinner time the skipper heard no more of them but he had just finished that meal and lit his pipe when he heard footsteps on the deck and the next moment old ned hot and angry burst into the cabin  bills stole our dinner sir he panted unceremoniously  who inquired the skipper coldly  bill sir bill smith replied ned  who inquired the skipper more coldly than before  the ghost o bill smith growled ned correcting himself savagely has took our dinner away an him an the ghost o tommy brown is a sitting down and boltin of it as fast as they can bolt  well i dont see what i can do said the skipper lazily whatd you let em for  you know what bill is sir said ned im an old man cooks no good and unless simpson has a bit o raw beef for his eyes he wont be able to see for a week  rubbish said the skipper jocularly dont tell me three men all afraid o one ghost i shant interfere dont you know what to do  no sir said ned eagerly  go up and read the prayerbook to him and hell vanish in a cloud of smoke said the skipper  ned gazed at him for a moment speechlessly and then going up on deck leaned over the side and swore himself faint the cook and simpson came up and listened respectfully contenting themselves with an occasional suggestion when the old mans memory momentarily failed him  for the rest of the voyage the two culprits suffered all the inconvenience peculiar to a loss of citizenship the skipper blandly ignored them and on two or three occasions gave great offence by attempting to walk through bill as he stood on the deck speculation was rife in the focsle as to what would happen when they got ashore and it was not until northsea was sighted that the skipper showed his hand then he appeared on deck with their effects done up neatly in two bundles and pitched them on the hatches the crew stood and eyed him expectantly  ned said the skipper sharply  sir said the old man  as soon as were made fast said the other i want you to go ashore for me and fetch an undertaker and a policeman i cant quite make up my mind which i want  ay ay sir murmured the old man  the skipper turned away and seizing the helm from the mate took the ship in he was so intent upon his business that he appeared not to notice the movements of bill and tommy as they edged nervously towards their bundles and waited impatiently for the schooner to get alongside the quay then he turned to the mate and burst into a loud laugh as the couple bending suddenly snatched up their bundles and clambering up the side sprang ashore and took to their heels the mate laughed too and a faint but mirthless echo came from the other end of the schooner     a disciplinarian  theres no doubt about it said the night watchman but what dissiplines a very good thing but it dont always act well for instance i aint allowed to smoke on this wharf so when i want a pipe i either ave to go over to the queens ed or sit in a lighter if im in the queens ed i can look arter the wharf an once when i was sitting in a lighter smoking the chap come aboard an cast off afore i knew what he was doing and took me all the way to greenwich he said hed often played that trick on watchmen  the worst man for dissipline i ever shipped with was capn tasker of the lapwing hed got it on the brain bad he was a prim cleanshaved man except for a little side whisker an always used to try an look as much like a naval officer as possible  i never ad no sort of idea what he was like when i jined the ship an he was quite quiet and peaceable until we was out on the open water then the cloven hoof showed itself an he kicked one o the men for coming on deck with a dirty face an though the man told him he never did wash becos his skin was so delikit he sent the bosen to turn the hose on him  the bosen seemed to take a hand in everything we used to do everything by his whistle it was never out of his mouth scarcely and ive known that man to dream of it o nights and sit up in his sleep an try an blow his thumb he whistled us to swab decks whistled us to grub whistled us to every blessed thing  though we didnt belong to any regler line wed got a lot o passengers aboard going to the cape an they thought a deal o the skipper there was one young leftenant aboard who said he reminded him o nelson an him an the skipper was as thick as two thieves nice larky young chap he was an more than one o the crew tried to drop things on him from aloft when he wasnt looking  every morning at ten we was inspected by the skipper but that wasnt enough for the leftenant and he persuaded the old man to drill us he said it would do us good an amuse the passengers an we ad to do all sorts o silly things with our arms an legs an twice he walked the skipper to the other end of the ship leaving twentythree sailormen bending over touching their toes an wondering whether theyd ever stand straight again  the very worst thing o the lot was the boatdrill a chap might be sitting comfortably at his grub or having a pipe in his bunk when the bosens whistle would scream out to him that the ship was sinking an the passengers drownding and he was to come an git the boats out an save em nice sort o game it was too we had to run like mad with kegs o water an bags o biscuit an then run the boats out an launch em all the men were told off to certain boats an the passengers too the only difference was if a passenger didnt care about taking a hand in the game he didnt but we had to  one o the passengers who didnt play was major miggens he was very much agin it an called it tomfoolery he never would go to his boat but used to sit and sneer all the time  its only teaching the men to cut an run he said to the skipper one day if there ever was any need theyd run to the boats an leave us here dont tell me  thats not the way i should ha expected to hear you speak of british sailors major ses the skipper rather huffy  british swearers ses the major sniffing you dont hear their remarks when that whistle is blown its enough to bring a judgment on the ship  if you can point em out to me ill punish em says the skipper very warmly  im not going to point em out ses the major i symperthise with em too much they dont get any of their beauty sleep pore chaps an they want it every one of em  i thought that was a very kind remark o the major to make but o course some of the wimmin larfed i spose they think men dont want beauty sleep as its called  i heard the leftenant sympathising with the skipper arter that he said the major was simply jealous because the men drilled so beautifully an then they walked aft the leftenant talking very earnest an the skipper shaking his head at something he was saying  it was just two nights arter this id gone below an turned in when i began to dream that the major had borrowed the bosens whistle an was practising on it i remember thinking in my sleep what a comfort it was it was only the major when one of the chaps give me a dig in the back an woke me  tumble up ses he the ships afire  i rushed up on deck an there was no mistake about who was blowing the whistle the bell was jangling horrible smoke was rolling up from the hatches an some of the men was dragging out the hose an tripping up the passengers with it as they came running up on deck the noise and confusion was fearful  out with the boats ses tom hall to me dont you hear the whistle  what aint we going to try an put the fire out i ses  obey orders ses tom thats what weve got to do an the sooner were away the better you know whats in her  we ran to the boats then an i must say we got em out well and the very fust person to git into mine was the major in his piejammers arter all the others was in we ad im out agin he didnt belong to our boat an dissipline is dissipline any day  afore we could git clear o the ship however he came yelling to the side an said his boat had gone an though we prodded him with our oars he lowered himself over the side and dropped in  fortunately for us it was a lovely clear night there was no moon but the stars were very bright the engines had stopped an the old ship sat on the water scarcely moving another boat was bumping up against ours and two more came creeping round the bows from the port side an jined us  whos in command calls out the major  i am ses the first mate very sharplike from one of the boats  wheres the capn then called out an old lady from my boat o the name o prendergast  hes standing by the ship ses the mate  doing what ses mrs prendergast looking at the water as though she expected to see the skipper standing there  hes going down with the ship ses one o the chaps  then mrs prendergast asked somebody to be kind enough to lend her a handkerchief becos she had left her pocket behind aboard ship and began to sob very bitter  just a simple british sailor ses she snivelling going down with his ship there he is look on the bridge  we all looked an then some o the other wimmin wanted to borrer handkerchiefs i lent one of em a little cotton waste but she was so unpleasant about its being a trifle oily that she forgot all about crying and said shed tell the mate about me as soon as ever we got ashore  ill remember him in my prayers ses one o the wimmin who was crying comfortable in a big red bandana belonging to one o the men  all england shall ring with his deed ses another  sympathys cheap ses one of the men passengers solemnly if we ever reach land we must all band together to keep his widow an orphans  hear hear cries everybody  and well put up a granite tombstone to his memory ses mrs prendergast  spose we pull back to the ship an take him off ses a gentleman from another boat im thinking it ud come cheaper an perhaps the puir mon would really like it better himself  shame ses most of em an i reely bleeve theyd worked theirselves up to that pitch theyd ha felt disappointed if the skipper had been saved  we pulled along slowly the mates boat leading looking back every now and then at the old ship and wondering when she would go off for shed got that sort of stuff in her hold which ud send her up with a bang as soon as the fire got to it an we was all waiting for the shock  do you know where were going mr bunce calls out the major  yes ses the mate  whats the nearest land asks the major  bout a thousand miles ses the mate  then the major went into figures an worked out that it ud take us about ten days to reach land and three to reach the bottom o the water kegs he shouted that out to the mate an the young leftenant what was in the mates boat smoking a big cigar said thered be quite a run on granite tombstones he said it was a blessed thing he had disinherited his children for marrying agin his wishes so there wouldnt be any orphans left to mourn for him  some o the wimmin smiled a little at this an old mrs prendergast shook so that she made the boat rock we got quite cheerful somehow and one of the other men spoke up and said that owing to his only having reckoned two pints to the gallon the majors fingers wasnt to be relied upon  we got more cheerful then and we was beginning to look on it as just a picnic when im blest if the mates boat didnt put about and head for the ship agin  there was a commotion then if you like everybody talking and laughing at once and mrs prendergast said that such a thing as one singlehanded capn staying behind to go down with his ship and then putting the fire out all by himself after his men had fled had never been heard of before an she said it never would be again she said he must be terribly burnt and hed have to be put to bed and wrapped up in oily rags  it didnt take us long to get aboard again and the ladies fairly mobbed the skipper tom hall swore as ow mrs prendergast tried to kiss him an the fuss they made of him was ridiculous i heard the clang of the telegraph in the engineroom soon as the boats was hoisted up the engines started and off we went again  speech yells out somebody speech bravo ses the others bravo then the skipper stood up an made em a nice little speech first of all he thanked em for their partiality and kindness shewn to him and the orderly way in which they had left the ship he said it reflected credit on all concerned crew and passengers an no doubt they d be surprised when he told them that there hadnt been any fire at all but that it was just a test to make sure that the boat drill was properly understood  he was quite right about them being surprised noisy too they was an the things they said about the man theyd just been wanting to give granite tombstones to was simply astonishing it would have taken a whole cemetery o tombstones to put down all they said about him and then theyd ha had to cut the letters small  i vote we have an indignation meeting in the saloon to record our disgust at the capns behaviour ses the major fiercely i beg to propose that mr macpherson take the chair  i second that ses another fiercelike  i beg to propose the major instead ses somebody else in a heavy offhand sort o way mr macphersons boat not having come back yet  at first everybody thought he was joking but when they found he was really speaking the truth the excitement was awful fortunately as mrs prendergast remarked there was no ladies in the boat but there was several men passengers we were doing a good thirteen knots an hour but we brought up at once an then we ad the most lovely firework display i ever see aboard ship in my life blue lights and rockets and guns going all night while we cruised slowly about and the passengers sat on deck arguing as to whether the skipper would be hung or imprisoned for life  it was daybreak afore we sighted them just a little speck near the skyline an we bore down on them for all we was worth half an hour later they was alongside an of all the chilly miserablelooking men i ever see they was the worst  they had to be helped up the side amost and they was so grateful it was quite affecting until the true state o things was explained to them it seemed to change em wonderful an after mr macpherson had had three cups o hot coffee an four glasses o brandy he took the chair at the indignation meeting an went straight off to sleep in it they woke him up three times but he was so cross about it that the ladies had to go away an the meeting was adjourned  i dont think it ever came to much after all nobody being really hurt an the skipper being so much upset they felt sort o sorry for im  the rest of the passage was very quiet an comfortable but o course it all came out at the other end an the mate brought the ship home some o the chaps said the skipper was a bit wrong in the ed and while im not gainsaying that its my firm opinion that he was persuaded to do what he did by that young leftenant as i said afore he was a larky young chap an very fond of a joke if he didnt have to pay for it     brother hutchins  ive got a friend coming down with us this trip george said the master of the wave as they sat on deck after tea watching the river one of our new members brother hutchins  from the mission i spose said the mate coldly  from the mission confirmed the skipper youll like him george hes been one o the greatest rascals that ever breathed  well i dont know what you mean said the mate looking up indignantly  hes ad a most interestin life said the skipper hes been in half the jails of england to hear im talk is as good as reading a book and es as merry as they make em  oh and is e going to give us prayers afore breakfast like that fatnecked whitefaced old rascal what came down with us last summer and stole my boots demanded the mate  he never stole em george said the skipper  if yod eard that man cry when i mentioned to im your unjust suspicions youd never have forgiven yourself he told em at the meetin an they had prayers for you  you an your mission are a pack o fools said the mate scornfully youre always being done a man comes to you an ses es found grace and you find im a nice easy comfortable living e sports a bit of blue ribbon and a red nose at the same time dont tell me you ask me why i dont join you and i tell you its because i dont want to lose my common sense  youll know better one o these days george said the skipper rising i earnestly hope youll ave some great sorrow or affliction something almost too great for you to bear its the only thing thatll save you  i expect that fat chap what stole my boots would like to see it too said the mate  he would said the skipper solemnly he said so  the mate got up fuming and knocking his pipe out with great violence against the side of the schooner stamped up and down the deck two or three times and then despairing of regaining his accustomed calm on board went ashore  it was late when he returned a light burnt in the cabin and the skipper with his spectacles on was reading aloud from an old number of the evangelical magazine to a thin whitefaced man dressed in black  thats my mate said the skipper looking up from his book  is he one of our band inquired the stranger  the skipper shook his head despondently  not yet said the stranger encouragingly  seen too many of em said the mate bluntly the more i see of em the less i like em it makes me feel wicked to look at em  ah that aint you speaking now its the evil one said mr hutchins confidently  i spose you know im pretty well said the mate simply  i lived with him thirty years said mr hutchins solemnly then i got tired of him  i should think he got a bit sick too said the mate thirty days ud ha been too long for me  he went to his berth to give mr hutchins time to frame a suitable reply and returned with a full bottle of whisky and a tumbler and having drawn the cork with a refreshing pop mixed himself a stiff glass and lit his pipe mr hutchins with a deep groan gazed reproachfully at the skipper and shook his head at the bottle  you know i dont like you to bring that filthy stuff in the cabin george said the skipper  its not for me said the mate flippantly its for the evil one he ses the sight of his old pal utchins as turned his stomach  he glanced at the stranger and saw to his astonishment that he appeared to be struggling with a strong desire to laugh his lips tightened and his shifty little eyes watered but he conquered himself in a moment and rising to his feet delivered a striking addressin favor of teetotalism he condemned whisky as not only wicked but unnecessary declaring with a side glance at the mate that two acidulated drops dissolved in water were an excellent substitute  the sight of the whisky appeared to madden him and the skipper sat spellbound at his eloquence until at length after apostrophising the bottle in a sentence which left him breathless he snatched it up and dashed it to pieces on the floor  for a moment the mate was struck dumb with fury then with a roar he leaped up and rushed for the lecturer but the table was between them and before he could get over it the skipper sprang up and seizing him by the arm pushed him into the stateroom  lea go foamed the mate let me get at him  george said the skipper still striving with him im ashamed of you  ashamed be damned yelled the mate struggling what did he chuck my whisky away for  hes a saint said the skipper relaxing his hold as he heard mr hutchins lock himself in hes a saint george seein is beautiful words ad no effect on you he ad recourse to strong measures  wait till i get hold of im said the mate menacingly only wait ill saint im  is he better dear friend came the voice of mr hutchins from beyond the door because i forgot the tumbler  come out roared the mate come out and upset it  mr hutchins declined the invitation but from behind the door pleaded tearfully with the mate to lead a better life and even rebuked the skipper for allowing the bottle of sin to be produced in the cabin the skipper took the rebuke humbly and after requesting mr hutchins to sleep in the stateroom that night in order to frustrate the evident designs of the mate went on deck for a final look round and then came below and turned in himself  the crew of the schooner were early astir next morning getting under way but mr hutchins kept his bed although the mate slipped down to the cabin several times and tapped at his door when he did come up the mate was at the wheel and the men down below getting breakfast  sleep well inquired mr hutchins softly as he took a seat on the hatches a little distance from him  ill let you know when i havent got this wheel said the mate sourly  do said mr hutchins genially we shall see you at our meeting tonight he asked blandly  the mate disdained to reply but his wrath when at mr hutchins request the cabin was invaded by the crew that evening cannot be put into words  for three nights they had what mr hutchins described as lovefeasts and the mate as blamed beargardens the crew were not particularly partial to hymns considered as such but hymns shouted out with the full force of their lungs while sharing the skippers hymn book appealed to them strongly besides it maddened the mate and to know that they were defying their superior and at the same time doing good to their own souls was very sweet the boy whose voice was just breaking got off some surprising effects and seemed to compass about five octaves without distress  when they were exhausted with singing mr hutchins would give them a short address generally choosing as his subject a strong violenttempered man given to drink and coarse language the speaker proved conclusively that a man who drank would do other things in secret and he pictured this man going home and beating his wife because she reproached him for breaking open the childrens moneybox to spend the savings on irish whisky at every point he made he groaned and the crew as soon as they found they might groan too did so with extraordinary gusto the boys groans being weird beyond conception  they reached plymouth where they had to put out a few cases of goods just in time to save the mates reason for the whole ship owing to mr hutchins zeal was topsy turvy the ships cat sat up all one night cursing him and a blue ribbon he had tied round her neck and even the battered old teapot came down to meals bedizened with bows of the same proselytising hue  by the time they had got to their moorings it was too late to take the hatches off and the crew sat gazing longingly at the lights ashore their delight when the visitor obtained permission for them to go ashore with him for a little stroll was unbounded and they set off like schoolboys  they couldnt be with a better man said the skipper as the party moved off when i think of the good that mans done in under four days it makes me ashamed of myself  you had better ship im as mate said george thered be a pair of you then  theres greater work for im to do said the skipper solemnly  he saw the mates face in the waning light and moved off with a sigh the mate for his part leaned against the side smoking and as the skipper declined to talk on any subject but mr hutchins relapsed into a moody silence until the return of the crew some two hours later  mr hutchins is coming on after sir said the boy he told us to say he was paying a visit to a friend  whats the name of the pub asked the mate quietly  if you cant speak without showing your nasty temper george youd better hold your tongue said the skipper severely whats your opinion about mr hutchins my lads  a more open arted man never breathed said dan the oldest of the crew warmly  best feller i ever met in my life said another  you hear that said the skipper  i hear said the mate  es a christian said the boy i never knew what a christian was before i met im what do you think e give us  give you said the skipper  a pound cash said the boy a golden sovring each tork about christians i wish i knew a few more of em  well i never exclaimed the gratified skipper  an the way e did it was so nice said the oldest seamen e ses thats from me an the skipper e ses thank the skipper for it as much as me e ses  well now dont waste it said the skipper  i should bank it if i was you itll make a nice little nestegg  i ope it was come by honest thats all said the mate  o course it was cried the skipper youve got a ard cruel art george praps if it ad been a little softer youd ave ad one too  blast is sovrings said the surly mate id like to know where he got em from an wot e means by saying it come from you as much as im i never knew you to give money away  i spose said the skipper very softly he means that i put such like thought s into is art well youd better turn in my lads we start work at four  the hands went forward and the skipper and mate descended to the cabin and prepared for sleep the skipper set a lamp on the table ready for mr hutchins when he should return and after a short inward struggle bade the mate goodnight and in a couple of minutes was fast asleep  at four oclock the mate woke suddenly to find the skipper standing by his berth the lamp still stood burning on the table fighting feebly against the daylight which was pouring in through the skylight  not turned up yet said the mate with a glance at the visitors empty berth  the skipper shook his head spiritlessly and pointed to the table the mate following his finger saw a small canvas bag and by the side of it fourpence halfpenny in coppers and an unknown amount in brace buttons  there was twentythree pounds freight money in that bag when we left london said the skipper finding his voice at last  well what do you thinks become of it inquired the mate taking up the lamp and blowing it out  i cant think said the skipper myeds all confused bromr hutchins aint come back yet  i spose he was late and didnt like to disturb you said the mate without moving a muscle but ive no doubt es all right dont you worry about him  its very strange where its gone george faltered the skipper very strange  well utchins is a generous sort o chap said the mate e give the men five pounds for nothing so perhaps hell give you somethingwhen e comes back  go an ask the crew to come down here said the skipper sinking on a locker and gazing at the brazen collection before him  the mate obeyed and a few minutes afterwards returned with the men who swarming into the cabin listened sympathetically as the skipper related his loss  its a mystery which nobody can understand sir said old dan when he had finished and its no use tryin  one o them things what wont never be cleared up properly said the cook comfortably  well i dont like to say it said the skipper but i must the only man who could have taken it was hutchins  wot sir said dan that blessed man why id laugh at the idea  he couldnt do it said the boy not if he tried he couldnt he was too good  hes taken that twentythree poun said the skipper deliberately eighteen well call it because im goin to have five of it back  youre labourin under a great mistake sir said dan ambiguously  are you going to give me that money said the skipper loudly  beggin your pardon sir no said the cook speaking for the rest as he put his foot on the companionladder brother utchins gave us that money for singing them ims so well e said so and we aint ad no call to think as it warnt honestly come by nothing could ever make us think that would it mates  nothing said the others with exemplary firmness it couldnt be done  they followed the cook up on deck and leaning over the side gazed in a yearning fashion toward the place where they had last seen their benefactor then with a sorrowful presentiment that they could never look upon his like again they turned away and prepared for the labours of the day     the disbursement sheet  the old man was dead and his son edward reigned in his stead the old man had risen from an humble position in life his rule was easy and his manner of conducting business eminently approved of by the rough old seamen who sailed his small craft round the coast and by that sharp clerk simmons on whose discovery the old man was wont at times to hug himself in secret the proceedings when one of his skippers came home from a voyage were severely simple the skipper would produce a bag and emptying it upon the table give an account of his voyage whenever he came to an expenditure raking the sum out of the heap until at length the cash was divided into two portions one of which went to the owner the other to the skipper  but other men other manners the books of the inimitable simmons being overhauled revealed the startling fact that they were kept by single entry in addition to which a series of dots and dashes appeared against the figures forming a code the only key to which was locked up somewhere in simmonss interior  its a wonder the firm hasnt gone bankrupt long ago said the new governor after the clerk had explained the meaning of various signs and wonders what does this starfish against the entry mean  it isnt a starfish sir said simmons it means that one bag of sugar got wetted a little then if the consigners notice it we shall know we have got to allow for it  a pretty way of doing business upon my word itll all have to be altered said the other i must have new offices too this dingy little hole is enough to frighten people away  the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of captain fazackerly of the schooner sarah ann who having just brought up in the river had hastened to the office to report  mornin sir said the captain respectfully im glad to see you here sir but the office dont seem real like without your father sitting in it he was a good master and were all sorry to lose him  youre very good said the new master somewhat awkwardly  i expect itll take some time for you to get into the way of it said the captain with a view to giving the conversation a more cheerful turn  i expect it will said the new master thinking of the starfish  its a mercy simmons was not took too said the captain shaking his head as it is hes spared hell be able to teach you there ainthe lowered his voice not wishing to make simmons unduly proudthere aint a smarter clerk in all liverpool than wot he is  im glad to hear it said the new master regarding the old man with raised eyebrows as he extricated a plethoriclooking canvas bag from his jacket pocket and dropped it with a musical crash on the chipped office table his eyebrows went still higher as the old man unfastened the string and emptying the contents on to the table knitted his brows into reflective wrinkles and began to debit the firm with all the liabilities of a slow but tenacious memory  oh come said the owner sharply as the old man lovingly hooked out the sum of fiveandsixpence as a first instalment this wont do capn  wot wont do masr edward inquired the old man in surprise  why this way of doing business said the other its not businesslike at all you know  well its the way me an your pore old father has done it this last thirty year said the skipper an im sure ive never knowingly cheated him out of a hapenny and a better man o business than your father never breathed  yes well im going to do things a bit differently said the new master you must give me a proper disbursement sheet capn if you please  and what may that be inquired captain fazackerly as with great slowness he gathered up the money and replaced it in the bag i never heard of it afore  well i havent got time to teach you bookkeeping said the other somewhat nettled at the old mans manner cant you get some of your brother captains to show you some deepsea man would be sure to know  ill see what i can do sir said the skipper slowly as he turned towards the door my word was always good enough for your father  in a moody indignant frame of mind he stuck his hands furiously in his trousers pockets and passed heavily through the swingdoors at other times he had been wont to take a genial if heavy interest in passing events but in this instance he plodded on dwelling darkly upon his grievance until he reached by the mere force of habit a certain favourite tavern he pulled up sharply and as a mere matter of duty and custom and not because he wanted it went in and ordered a glass of gin  he drank three and was so hazy in his replies to the young lady behind the bar usually a prime favourite that she took offence and availing herself for private reasons of a public weapon coldly declined to served him with a fourth  wot said the astounded fazackerly coming out of his haze  youve had enough said the girl firmly you get aboard again and mind haw you do so  the skipper gazed at her for a moment in openmouthed horror and then jamming his hat firmly over his brows stumbled out of the door and into the street where he ran full into the arms of another mariner who was just entering  why zacky my boy cried the latter clapping him lustily on the back how goes it  in broken indignant accents the other told him  you come in with me said the newcomer  ill never enter that pub again said the skipper  you come in with me said the mastermind firmly  captain fazackerly hesitated a moment and then feeling that he was safe in the hands of the master of a foreigngoing barque followed him into the bar and from behind his back glared defiantly at his fair foe  two glasses o gin my dear said captain tweedie with the slightest possible emphasis  the girl who knew her customer served him without a murmur deftly avoiding the gaze of ungenerous triumph with which the injured captain favoured her as he raised the cooling beverage to his lips the glass emptied he placed it on the counter and sighed despondently  theres something up with you zacky said tweedie eyeing him closely as he bit the end off a cigar youve got something on your mind  ive been crool hurt said his friend in a hard cold voice my word aint good enough for the new guvnor he wants what he calls a disbursement sheet  well give him one said tweedie you know what it is dont you  captain fazackerly shook his head and pushing the glasses along the counter nodded for them to be refilled  you come aboard with me said tweedie after they had emptied them  captain fazackerly who had a doglike faith in his friend followed him into the street and on to his barque in a general way he experienced a social rise when he entered the commodious cabin of that noble craft and his face grew in importance as his host after motioning him to a seat placed a select array of writing materials before him  i spose ive got to do it he said slowly  of course you have said tweedie rolling his cigar between his thin lips youve got orders to do so havent you we must all obey those above us what would you do if one of your men refused to obey an order of yours  hit him in the face said captain fazackerly with simple directness  just so said tweedie who was always ready to impart moral teaching and when your governor asks for a disbursement sheet youve got to give him one now then head that papervoyage of the sarah ann 180 tons register garston docks to limerick  the captain squared his elbows and for a few seconds nothing was heard but his stertorous breathing and the scratching of the pen then a muttered execration and captain fazackerly put down his pen with a woebegone air  whats the matter said tweedie  ive spelt register without the d said the other thats what comes o being worried  it dont matter said tweedie hastily now what about stores wait a bit though of course ye repaired your sidelamps before starting  lor no said captain fazackerly staring what for they were all right  ye lie said tweedie sternly you did to repairs to sidelamps ten shillings now then did you paint her this trip  i did said the other looking at the last entry in a fascinated fashion  lets see said tweedie meditativelywell say five gallons of black varnish at one shilling and threepence a gallon  no no said the scribe i used gas tar at threepence a gallon  five gallons black varnish one shilling and threepence a gallon sixandthreepence said tweedie raising his voice a little have you got that down  after a prolonged struggle with his feelings the other said he had  twentyeight pounds black paint at twopence a pound continued tweedie  nay nay said the skipper i allus saves the soot out of the galley for that  the other captain took his cigar from his lips and gazed severely at his guest  am i dealing with a chimneysweep or a ships captain he inquired plaintively it would simplify matters a bit if i knew  go on captain tweedie said the other turning a fine purple colour how much did you say it was  twentyeight twos equals fiftysix thats fourandninepence continued tweedie his face relaxing to receive the cigar again and twentyeight pounds white lead at twentyeight shillings a hundredweight  three pennorth o whitings good enough for me matey said captain fazackerly making a stand  see here said tweedie whos making out this disbursement sheet you or me  you are said the other  very good then said his friend now dont you interrupt i dont mind telling you you must never use rubbish o that sort in a disbursement sheet it looks bad for the firm if any other owners saw that in your old mans sheet hed never hear the end of it and hed never forgive you thatll bewhat did i say seven shillings and now we come to the voyage ye had a tug to give ye a pluck out to the bar  no we went out with a fair wind said captain fazackerly toying with his pen  ye lie ye had a tug out to the bar repeated tweedie wearily did ye share the towing  why no i telle  thatll be three pounds then said tweedie  if yed shared it it would have been two pound ten you should always study your owner in these matters capn now what about bad weather any repairs to the sails  ay we had a lot o damage said fazackerly laying down his pen it took us days to repair em cost us four pounds we had to put into holyhead for shelter  four pounds said tweedie his voice rising almost to a scream  ay all that said fazackerly very solemnly  look here said tweedie in a choked voice blown away fore lower topsail forestaysail and carried away lifts to staysail to sailmaker for above eleven pounds eighteen shillings and tenpence then ye say ye put into holyhead for shelter well here in entering harbor well say loss of port anchor and thirty fathoms of chain cable  man alive said the overwrought skipper hitting the table heavily with his fist the old anchors there for him to see  to divers recovering same and placing on deck two pound ten continued tweedie raising his voice did you do any damage going into dock at limerick  more than weve done for years said fazackerly and shaking his head entered into voluminous details total seven pounds  seven pounds said the exasperated tweedie seven pounds for all that and your insurance dont begin till twentyfive pounds why damme you aint fit to be trusted out with a ship i firmly blieve if you lost her youd send in a bill for a suit of clothes and call it square now take this down and larn a business way o doing things in entering dock carried away starboard cathead and started starboard chain plates held survey of damage done decided to take off channel bends renew through bolts straighten plates and replace same also to renew cathead and caulk ships side in wake of plate six seams etc etc there now that looks better twentyseven pounds eighteen and sevenpence halfpenny and i think for all that damage its a very reasonable bill can you remember anything else  youve got a better memory than i have said his admiring friend wait a bit though yes i had my poor old dog washed overboard  dog said the deepsea man we cant put dogs in a disbursement sheet taint business  my old master would have given me another one though grumbled fazackerly i wouldnt ha parted with that dog for anything he knew as much as you or me that dog did i never knew him to bite an officer but i dont think there was ever a man came on the ship but what hed have a bit out of sooner or later  them sort of dogs do get washed overboard said tweedie impatiently  boys he couldnt abear pursued the other in tones of tender reminiscence the mere sight of a boardingschool of em out for a walk would give him hydrophoby almost  just so said tweedie ah theres cork fenders ye may pick them up floating down the river or they may come aboard in the night from a craft alongside theyre changeable sort o things but in the disbursement sheet they must go and best quality too fourandsixpence each any thing else  theres the dog said fazackerly persistently  copper nails tenpence said tweedie the dictator  havent bought any for months said the other but slowly entering it  well it aint exactly right said tweedie shrugging his shoulders but youre so set on him going in  him who asked captain fazackerly staring  the dog said tweedie if he goes in as copper nails he wont be noticed  if he goes in as tenpence im a dutchman said the bereaved owner scoring out the copper nails you never knew that dog properly tweedie  well never mind about the dog said tweedie lets cast the sheet what do you think it comes to  bout thirty pun hazarded the other  thirty fiddlesticks retorted tweedie there you are in black and whitesixtythree pounds eighteen shillings and tenpence hapenny  and is that what masr edward wants inquired captain fazackerly gasping  yes thats a properly drawn up disbursement sheet said tweedie in satisfied tones you see how it simplifies matters the governor can see at a glance how things stand while if you trusted to your memory you might forget something or else claim something you didnt have  i ought to have had them things afore said captain fazackerly shaking his head solemnly id ha been riding in my carriage by now  never ye dream of having another vyge without one said tweedie i doubt whether its lawful to render an account without one  he folded the paper and handed it to his friend who after inspecting it with considerable pride tucked it carefully away in his breast pocket  take it up in the morning said tweedie well have a bit o tea down here and then well go round a bit afterwards  captain fazackerly having no objection they had tea first and then accompanied by the first mate went out to christen the disbursement sheet the ceremony which was of great length was solemnly impressive towards the finish captain tweedie who possessed a very sensitive highlystrung nature finding it necessary to put a licensed victualler out of his own house before it could be completed to his satisfaction  the one thing which captain fazackerly remembered clearly the next morning when he awoke was the disbursement sheet he propped it against the coffeepot during breakfast and read selections to his admiring mate and after a refreshing toilet proceeded to the office simmons was already there and before the skipper could get to the purpose of his visit the head of the firm arrived  ive just brought the disbursement sheet you asked for sir said the skipper drawing it from his pocket  ah youve got it then said the new governor with a gracious smile you see it wasnt so much trouble after all  i dont mind the trouble sir interrupted captain fazackerly  you see it puts things on a better footing said the other i can see at a glance now how things stand and simmons can enter the items straight away into the books of the firm its more satisfactory to both of us sit down capn  the captain sat down his face glowing with this satisfactory recognition of his work  i met capn hargreaves as i was acoming up he said and i explained to him your ideas on the subject an he went straight back as straight as he could go to make out his disbursement sheet  ah we shall soon have things on a better footing now said the governor unfolding the paper while the skipper gazed abstractedly through the small dirty panes of the office window at the bustle on the quay below  for a short space there was silence in the office broken only by the halfaudible interjections of the reader then he spoke  simmons he said sharply  the old clerk slipped from his stool and obeying the motions of his employer inspected in great astonishment the first disbursement sheet which had ever entered the office he read through every item in an astonished whisper and having finished followed the governors example and gazed at the heavy figure by the window  captain fazackerly said his employer at length breaking a painful silence  sir said the captain turning his head a little  ive been talking with simmons about these disbursement sheets said the owner somewhat awkwardly simmons is afraid theyll give him a lot of extra trouble  the captain turned his head a little more and gazed stolidly at the astonished simmons  a man oughtnt to mind a little extra trouble if the firm wishes it he said somewhat severely  hes afraid it would throw his books out a bit continued the owner deftly avoiding the gaze of the injured clerk you see simmons bookkeeping is of the oldfashioned kind capn starfishes and all that kind of thing he continued incoherently as the gaze of simmons refusing to be longer avoided broke the thread of his discourse so i think well put the paper on the fire capn and do business in the old way have you got the money with you  i have sir said fazackerly feeling in his pocket as he mournfully watched his last nights work blazing up the chimney  fire away then said the owner almost cordially  captain fazackerly advanced to the table and clearing his throat fixed his eyes in a reflective stare on the opposite wall and commenced  blown away fore lower topsail forestaysail and carried away lifts to staysail to sailmaker for above eleven pounds eighteen shillings and tenpence he said with relish tug out to the bar three pounds to twentyeight pounds black soot i mean paint     rule of three  the long summer day had gone and twilight was just merging into night a ray of light from the lantern at the end of the quay went trembling across the sea and in the little harbour the dusky shapes of a few small craft lay motionless on the dark water  the master of the schooner harebell came slowly towards the harbour accompanied by his mate both men had provided ashore for a voyage which included no intoxicants and the dignity of the skipper always a salient feature had developed tremendously under the influence of brown stout he stepped aboard his schooner importantly and then turning to the mate who was about to follow suddenly held up his hand for silence  what did i tell you he inquired severely as the mate got quietly aboard  about knocking down the two policemen guessed the mate somewhat puzzled  no said the other shortly listen  the mate listened from the focsle came the low gruff voices of men broken by the silvery ripple of womens laughter  well im a dutchman said the mate with the air of one who felt he was expected to say something  after all i said to em said the skipper with weary dignity you eard what i said to em jack  nobody could ha swore louder testified the mate  an here they are said the skipper in amaze defying of me after all i said to em after all the threats ii employed  employed repeated the mate with relish  theyve been and gone and asked them females down the focsle again you know what i said id do jack if they did  said youd eat em without salt quoted the other helpfully  ill do worse than that jack said the skipper after a moments discomfiture whats to hinder us casting off quietly and taking them along with us  if you ask me said the mate i should say you couldnt please the crew better  well well see said the other nodding sagely dont make no noise jack  he set an example of silence himself and aided by the mate cast off the warps which held his unconscious visitors to their native town and the wind being off the shore the little schooner drifted silently away from the quay the skipper went to the wheel and the noise of the mate hauling on the jib brought a rough head out of the focsle the owner of which after a cry to his mates below sprang up on deck and looked round in bewilderment  stand by there cried the skipper as the others came rushing on deck shake em out  beggin your pardin sir said one of them with more politeness in his tones than he had ever used before but  stand by said the skipper  now then shouted the mate sharply lively there lively with it  the men looked at each other helplessly and went to their posts as a scream of dismay arose from the fair beings below who having just begun to realise their position were coming on deck to try and improve it  what roared the skipper in pretended astonishment what gells aboard after all i said it cant be i must be dreaming  take us back wailed the damsels ignoring the sarcasm take us back captain  no i cant go back said the skipper you see what comes o disobedience my gells lively there on that mainsl dye hear  we wont do it again cried the girls as the schooner came to the mouth of the harbour and they smelt the dark sea beyond take us back  it cant be done said the skipper cheerfully  its agin the lor sir said ephraim biddle solemnly  what taking my own ship out said the skipper in affected surprise how was i to know they were there im not going back taint likely as theyve made their beds so they must lay on em  they aint got no beds said george scott hastily it aint fair to punish the gals for us sir  hold your tongue said the skipper sharply  its agin the lor sir said biddle again if so be theyre passengers this ship aint licensed to carry passengers if so be as theyre took out agin their will its abductioni see the other day a chap had seven years for abducting one gal three sevensthree sevens isthree sevens is well its more years than youd like to be in prison sir  bosh said the skipper theyre stowaways an i shall put em ashore at the first port we touch atplymouth  a heartrending series of screams from the stowaways rounded his sentence screams which gave way to sustained sobbing as the schooner catching the wind began to move through the water  youd better get below my gals said biddle who was the eldest member of the crew consolingly  why dont you make him take us back said jenny evans the biggest of the three girls indignantly  cos we cant my dear said biddle reluctantly its agin the lor you dont want to see us put into prison do you  i dont mind said miss evans tearfully so long as we get back george take us back  i cant said scott sullenly  well you can look for somebody else then said miss evans with temper you wont marry me how much would you get if you did make the skipper put back  very likely six months said biddle solemnly  six months would soon pass away said miss evans briskly as she wiped her eye  it would be a rest said miss williams coaxingly  the men not seeing things in quite the same light they announced their intention of having nothing more to do with them and crowding together in the bows beneath two or three blankets condoled tearfully with each other on their misfortunes for some time the men stood by offering clumsy consolations but tired at last of repeated rebuffs and insults went below and turned in leaving the satisfied skipper at the wheel  the night was clear and the wind light as the effects of his libations wore off the skipper had some misgivings as to the wisdom of his action but it was too late to return and he resolved to carry on  looking at all the circumstances of the case he thought it best to keep the wheel in his own hands for a time and the dawn came in the early hours and found him still at his post  objects began to stand out clearly in the growing light and three dispirited girls put their heads out from the blankets and sniffed disdainfully at the sharp morning air then after an animated discussion they arose and casting their blankets aside walked up to the skipper and eyed him thoughtfully  as easy as easy said jenny evans confidently as she drew herself up to her full height and looked down at the indignant man  why he isnt any bigger than a boy said miss williams savagely  pity we didnt think of it before said miss davies i spose the crew wont help him  not they said miss evans scornfully if they do well serve them the same  they went off leaving the skipper a prey to gathering uneasiness watching their movements with wrinkled brow from the forecastle and the galley they produced two mops and a broom and he caught his breath sharply as miss evans came on deck with a pot of white paint in one hand and a pot of tar in the other  now girls said miss evans  put those things down said the skipper in a peremptory voice  shant said miss evans bluntly you havent got enough on yours she said turning to miss davies dont spoil the skipper for a haporth of tar  at this new version of an old saw they laughed joyously and with mops dripping tar and paint on the deck marched in military style up to the skipper and halted in front of him smiling wickedly  then the heart of the skipper waxed sore faint within him and with a wild yell he summoned the trusty crew to his side  the crew came on deck slowly and casting furtive glances at the scene pushed ephraim biddle to the front  take those mops away from em said the skipper haughtily  dont you interfere said miss evans looking at them over her shoulder  else well give you some said miss williams bloodthirstily  take those mops away from em bawled the skipper instinctively drawing back as miss evans made a pass at him  i dont see as ow we can interfere sir said biddle with deep respect  what said the astonished skipper  it would be agin the lor for us to interfere with people said biddle turning to his mates dead agin the lor  dont you talk rubbish said the skipper anxiously take em away from em its my tar and my paint and  you shall have it said miss evans reassuringly  if we touched em said biddle impressively itd be an assault at lor sides which theyd probably muss us up with em all we can do sir is to stand by and see fair play  fair play cried the skipper dancing with rage and turning hastily to the mate who had just come on the scene take those things away from em jack  well if its all the same to you said the mate id rather not be drawn into it  but id rather you were said the skipper sharply take em away  how inquired the mate pertinently  i order you to take em away said the skipper how is your affair  im not goin to raise my hand against a woman for anybody said the mate with decision its no part o my work to get messed up with tar and paint from lady passengers  its part of your work to obey me though said the skipper raising his voice all of you theres five of you with the mate and only three gells what are you afraid of  are you going to take us back demanded jenny evans  run away said the skipper with dignity run away  i shall ask you three times said miss evans sternly oneare you going back twoare you going back three  in the midst of a breathless silence she drew within striking distance while her allies taking up a position on either flank of the enemy listened attentively to the instructions of their leader  be careful he doesnt catch hold of the mops said miss evans but if he does the others are to hit him over the head with the handles never mind about hurting him  take this wheel a minnit jack said the skipper pale but determined  the mate came forward and took it unwillingly and the skipper trying hard to conceal his trepidation walked towards miss evans and tried to quell her with his eye the power of the human eye is notorious and miss evans showed her sense of the danger she ran by making an energetic attempt to close the skippers with her mop causing him to duck with amazing nimbleness at the same moment another mop loaded with white paint was pushed into the back of his neck he turned with a cry of rage and then realising the odds against him flung his dignity to the winds and dodged with the agility of a schoolboy through the galley and round the masts with the avenging mops in mad pursuit until breathless and exhausted he suddenly sprang on to the side and climbed frantically into the rigging  coward said miss evans shaking her weapon at him  come down cried miss williams come down like a man  its no good wasting time over him said miss evans after another vain appeal to the skippers manhood hes escaped get some more stuff on your mops  the mate who had been laughing boisterously checked himself suddenly and assumed a gravity of demeanour more in accordance with his position the mops were dipped in solemn silence and miss evans approaching regarded him significantly  now my dears said the mate waving his hand with a deprecating gesture dont be silly  dont be what inquired the sensitive miss evans raising her mop  you know what i mean said the mate hastily i cant help myself  well were going to help you said miss evans turn the ship round  you obey orders jack cried the skipper from aloft  its all very well for you sitting up there in peace and comfort said the mate indignantly im not going to be tarred to please you come down and take charge of your ship  do your duty jack said the skipper who was polishing his face with a handkerchief they wont touch you they darent theyre afraid to  youre egging em on cried the mate wrathfully i wont steer come and take it yourself  he darted behind the wheel as miss evans who was getting impatient made a thrust at him and then springing out gained the side and rushed up the rigging after his captain biddle who was standing close by gazed earnestly at them and took the wheel  you wont hurt old biddle i know he said trying to speak confidently  of course not said miss evans emphatically  tar dont hurt explained miss williams  its good for you said the third lady positively onetwo  its no good said the mate as ephraim came suddenly into the rigging youll have to give in  im if i will said the infuriated skipper  then an idea occurred to him and puckering his face shrewdly he began to descend  all right he said shortly as miss evans advanced to receive him ill go back  he took the wheel the schooner came round before the wind and the willing crew letting the sheets go hauled them in again on the port side  and now my lads said the skipper with a benevolent smile just clear that mess up off the decks and you may as well pitch them mops overboard theyll never be any good again  he spoke carelessly albeit his voice trembled a little but his heart sank within him as miss evans with a horrible contortion of her pretty face intended for a wink waved them back  you stay where you are she said imperiously well throw them overboardwhen weve done with them what did you say captain  the skipper was about to repeat it with great readiness when miss evans raised her trusty mop the words died away on his lips and after a hopeless glance from his mate to the crew and from the crew to the rigging he accepted his defeat and in grim silence took them home again     pickled herring  there was a sudden uproar on deck and angry shouts accompanied by an incessant barking the master of the brig arethusa stopped with his knife midway to his mouth and exchanging glances with the mate put it down and rose to his feet  theyre chevying that poor animal again he said hotly its scandalous  rupert can take care of himself said the mate calmly continuing his meal i expect if the truths known its hims been doin the chevying  youre as bad as the rest of em said the skipper angrily as a large brown retriever came bounding into the cabin poor old rube what have they been doin to you  the dog with a satisfied air sat down panting by his chair listening quietly to the subdued hubbub which sounded from the companion  well what is it roared the skipper patting his favourites head  its that blasted dawg sir cried an angry voice from above go down and show im your leg joe  an ave another lump took out of it i spose said another voice sourly not me  i dont want to look at no legs while im at dinner cried the skipper o course the dogll bite you if youve been teasing him  theres nobody been teasing im said the angry voice again thats the second one es bit and now joes goin to have im killedaint you joe  joes reply was not audible although the infuriated skipper was straining his ears to catch it  whos going to have the dog killed he demanded going up on deck while rupert who evidently thought he had an interest in the proceedings followed unobtrusively behind  i am sir said joe bates who was sitting on the hatch while the cook bathed an ugly wound in his leg a dogs only allowed one bite and hes ad two this week  he bit me on monday said the seaman who had spoken before now hes done for hisself  hold your tongue said the skipper angrily you think you know a lot about the law sam clark let me tell you a dogs entitled to have as many bites as ever he likes so as he dont bite the same person twice  that aint the way ive eard it put afore said clark somewhat taken back  hes the cutest dog breathing said the skipper fondly and he knows all about it he wont bite either of you again  and wot about them as asnt been bit yet sir inquired the cook  dont halloo before youre hurt advised the skipper if you dont tease him he wont bite you  he went down to his dinner followed by the sagacious rupert leaving the hands to go forward again and to mutinously discuss a situation which was becoming unbearable  it cant go on no longer joe said clark firmly this settles it  where is the stuff inquired the cook in a whisper  in my chest said clark softly i bought it the night he bit me  its a risky thing to do said bates  ow risky asked sam scornfully the dog eats the stuff and dies whos going to say what he died of as for suspicions let the old man suspect as much as he likes it aint proof  the stronger mind had its way as usual and the next day the skipper coming quietly on deck was just in time to see joe bates throw down a fine fat bloater in front of the now amiable rupert he covered the distance between himself and the dog in three bounds and seizing it by the neck tore the fish from its eager jaws and held it aloft  i just caught im in the act he cried as the mate came on deck what did you give that to my dog for he inquired of the conscience stricken bates  i wanted to make friends with him stammered the other  its poisoned you rascal and you know it said the skipper vehemently  wish i may die sir began joe  thatll do said the skipper harshly youve tried to poison my dog  i aint said joe firmly  you aint been trying to kill im with a poisoned bloater demanded the skipper  certainly not sir said joe i wouldnt do such a thing i couldnt if i tried  very good then said the skipper if its all right you eat it and ill beg your pardon  i aint goin to eat after a dog said joe shuffling  the dogs as clean as you are said the skipper id sooner eat after him than you  well you eat it then sir said bates desperately if its poisoned youll die and ill be hung for it i cant say no fairer than that can i  there was a slight murmur from the men who stood by watching the skipper with an air of unholy expectancy  well the boy shall eat it then said the skipper eat that bloater boy and ill give you sixpence  the boy came forward slowly and looking from the men to the skipper and from the skipper back to the men began to whimper  if you think its poisoned interrupted the mate you oughtnt to make the boy eat it i dont like boys but you must draw the line somewhere  its poisoned said the skipper shaking it at bates and they know it well ill keep it till we get to port and then ill have it analysed and itll be a sorry day for you bates when i hear its poisoned a months hard labour is what youll get  he turned away and went below with as much dignity as could be expected of a man carrying a mangled herring and placing it on a clean plate solemnly locked it up in his stateroom  for two days the crew heard no more about it though the skippers eyes gleamed dangerously each time that they fell upon the shrinking bates the weather was almost tropical with not an air stirring and the arethusa bearing its dread secret still locked in its stateroom rose and fell upon a sea of glassy smoothness without making any progress worth recording  i wish youd keep that thing in your berth george said the skipper as they sat at tea the second evening it puts me in a passion every time i look at it  i couldnt think of it capn replied the mate firmly it makes me angry enough as it is every time i think of em trying to poison that poor dumb creature i sort o choke i try to forget it  the skipper eyeing him furtively helped himself to another cup of tea  you havent got a tin box with a lid to it i spose he remarked somewhat shamefacedly  the mate shook his head i looked for one this morning he said there aint so much as a bottle aboard we could shove it into and it wants shoving into somethingbad it does  i dont like to be beat said the skipper shaking his head all them grinning monkeys forard ud think it a rare good joke id throw it overboard if it wasnt for that we cant keep it this weather  well look ere eres a way out of it said the mate call joe down and make him keep it in the focsle and take care of it  why you idiot hed lose it rapped out the other impatiently  o course he would said the mate but thats the most dignerified way out of it for you you can call im all sorts of things and abuse im for the rest of his life theyll prove themselves guilty by chucking it away wont they  it really seemed the only thing to be done the skipper finished his tea in silence and then going on deck called the crew aft and apprised them of his intentions threatening them with all sorts of pains and penalties if the treasure about to be confided to their keeping should be lost the cook was sent below for it and at the skippers bidding handed it to the grinning joe  and mind said the skipper as he turned away i leave it in your keepin and if its missing i shall understand that youve made away with it and i shall take it as a sign of guilt and act according  the end came sooner even than he expected they were at breakfast next morning when joe looking somewhat pale came down to the cabin followed by clark bearing before him an empty plate  well said the skipper fiercely  its about the erring sir said joe twisting his cap between his hands  well roared the skipper again  its gone sir said joe in bereaved accents  you mean youve thrown it away you infernal rascal bellowed the skipper  no sir said joe  ah i spose it walked up on deck and jumped overboard said the mate  no sir said joe softly the dog ate it sir  the skipper swung round in his seat and regarded him openmouthed  thedogateit he repeated  yes sir clark saw im do itdidnt you clark  i did said clark promptly he had made his position doubly sure by throwing it overboard himself  it comes to the same thing sir said joe sanctimoniously my innercence is proved just the same youll find the dog wont take no urt through it sir you watch im  the skipper breathed hard but made no reply  if you dont believe me sir praps youd like to see the plate where e licked it said joe give me the plate sam  he turned to take it but in place of handing it to him that useful witness dropped it and made hurriedly for the companionladder and by strenuous efforts reached the deck before joe although that veracious gentleman assisted from below by strong and willing arms made a good second     two of a trade  es a nero thats wot e is sir said the cook as he emptied a boiler of dirty water overboard  a what said the skipper  a nero said the cook speaking very slowly and distinctly a nero in real life a chap wot speaking for all forard were proud to have aboard along with us  i didnt know he was much of a swimmer said the skipper glancing curiously at a clumsily built man of middle age who sat on the hatch glancing despondently at the side  no more e aint said the cook an thats what makes im more eroish still in my own opinion  did he take his clothes off inquired the mate  not a bit of it said the delighted cook not a pair of trowsis nor even is at which was sunk  youre a liar cook said the hero looking up for a moment  you didnt take your trowsis off george said the cook anxiously  i chucked my at on the pavement growled george without looking up  well anyway you went over the embankment after that pore girl like a briton didnt you said the other  there was no reply  didnt you said the cook appealingly  did you expect me to go over like a dutchman or wot demanded george fiercely  thats is modesty said the cook turning to the others with the air of a showman e cant bear us to talk about it nearly drownded e was all but and a barge came along and shoved a boathook right through the seat of his trowsis an saved im stand up an show em your trowsis george  if i do stand up said george in a voice broken with rage itll be a bad day for you my lad  aint he modest said the cook dont it do you good to ear im he was just like that when they got him ashore and the crowd started patting him  didnt like it queried the mate  well they overdid it a little praps admitted the cook one old chap wot couldnt get near patted is ead with is stick but it was all meant in the way of kindness  im proud of you george said the skipper heartily  we all are said the mate  george grunted  ill write for the medal for him said the skipper were there any witnesses cook   heaps of em said the other but i gave em is name and address schooner john henry of limehouse is is home i ses and george cooper is name  you talked a damned sight too much said the hero you lean lopsided son of a tinker  theres is modesty agin said the cook with a knowing smile es busting with modesty is george you should ha seen im when a chap took is fortygraph  took his what said the skipper becoming interested  his fortygraph said the cook e was a young chap what was taking views for a noosepaper e took george drippin wet just as e come out of the water e took him arter e ad is face wiped an e took im when e was sitting up swearing at a man wot asked im whether e was very wet  an you told im where i lived and what i was said george turning on him and shaking his fist you did  i did said the cook simply youll live to thank me for it george  the other gave a dreadful howl and rising from the deck walked forward and went below giving a brother seaman who patted his shoulder as he passed a blow in the ribs which nearly broke them those on deck exchanged glances  well i dont know said the mate shrugging his shoulders seems to me if id saved a fellowcritters life i shouldnt mind hearing about it  thats what you think said the skipper drawing himself up a little if ever you do do anything of the kind perhaps youll feel different about it  well i dont see how you should know any more than me said the other  the skipper cleared his throat  there have been one or two little things in my life which im not exactly ashamed of he said modestly  that aint much to boast of said the mate wilfully misunderstanding him  i mean said the skipper sharply one or two things which some people might have been proud of but im proud to say that there isnt a living soul knows of em  i can quite believe that assented the mate and walked off with an irritating smile  the skipper was about to follow him to complain of the needless ambiguity of his remarks when he was arrested by a disturbance from the focsle in response to the cordial invitation of the cook the mate and one of the hands from the brig endeavour moored alongside had come aboard and gone below to look at george the manner in which they were received was a slur upon the hospitality of the john henry and they came up hurriedly declaring that they never wanted to see him again as long as they lived and shouting offensive remarks behind them as they got over the side of their own vessel  the skipper walked slowly to the focsle and put his head down  george he shouted  sir said the hero gruffly  come down into the cabin said the other turning away i want to have a little talk with you  george rose and first uttering some terrible threats against the cook who bore them with noble fortitude went on deck and followed the skipper to the cabin  at his superiors request he took a seat on the locker awkwardly enough but smiled faintly as the skipper produced a bottle and a couple of glasses  your health george said the skipper as he pushed a glass towards him and raised his own  my bes respecs sir said george allowing the liquor to roll slowly round his mouth before swallowing it he sighed heavily and putting his empty glass on the table allowed his huge head to roll on his chest  saving life dont seem to agree with you george said the skipper i like modesty but you seem to me to carry it a trifle too far  it aint modesty sir said george its that fortygraph when i think o that i go ot all over  i shouldnt let that worry me if i was you george said the other kindly looks aint everything  i didnt mean it that way said george very sourly my looks is good enough for me in fact it is a partly owing to my looks so to speak that im in a mess  a little more rum george said the skipper whose curiosity was roused i dont want to know your business far from it but in my position as capn if any of my crew gets in a mess i consider its my duty to lend them a hand out of it if i can  the world ud be a better place if there was more like you said george waxing sentimental as he sniffed delicately at the fragrant beverage if that noosepaper with them pictures gets into a certain partys ands im ruined  not if i can help it george said the skipper with great firmness how do you mean ruined  the seaman set his glass down on the little table and leaning over formed a word with his lips and then drew back slowly and watched the effect  what said the skipper  the other repeated the performance but beyond seeing that some word of three syllables was indicated the skipper obtained no information  you can speak a little louder he said somewhat crustily  bigamy said george breathing the word solemnly  you said the skipper  george nodded and if my first only gets hold of that paper and sees my phiz and reads my name im done for theres my reward for saving a fellowcritters life seven years  im surprised at you george said the skipper sternly such a good wife as youve got too  i aint saying nothing agin number two grumbled george its number one that didnt suit i left her eight years ago she was a bad un i took a vyge to australia furst just to put her out o my mind a bit an i never seed her since where am i if she sees all about me in the paper  is she what youd call a vindictive woman inquired the other nastytempered i mean  nastytempered echoed the husband of two if that woman could only have me put in jail shed stand on er ead for joy  well ill do what i can for you if the worst comes to the worst said the skipper youd better not say anything about this to anybody else  not me said george fervently as he rose an o course you  you can rely on me said the skipper in his most stately fashion  he thought of the seamans confidence several times during the evening and being somewhat uncertain of the law as to bigamy sought information from the master of the endeavour as they sat in the latters cabin at a quiet game of cribbage by virtue of several appearances in the law courts with regard to collisions and spoilt cargoes this gentleman had obtained a knowledge of law which made him a recognized authority from london bridge to the nore  it was a delicate matter for the master of the john henry to broach and with the laudable desire of keeping the heros secret he approached it by a most circuitous route he began with a burglary followed with an attempted murder and finally got on the subject of bigamy via the deceased wifes sister bill  what sort o bigamy inquired the master of the brig  oh two wives said captain thomsett  yes yes said the other but are there any mitigating circumstances in the case so that you could throw yourself on the mercy o the court i mean  my case said thomsett glaring it aint for me  oh no o course not said captain stubbs  what do you mean by o course not demanded the indignant master of the john henry  your deal said captain stubbs pushing the cards over to him  you havent answered my question said captain thomsett regarding him offensively  theres some questions said stubbs slowly as is best left unanswered when youve seen as much law as i have my lad youll know that one of the first principles of english law is that nobody is bound to commit themselves  do you mean to say you think it is me bellowed captain thomsett  i mean to say nothing said captain stubbs putting his huge hands on the table but when a man comes into my cabin and begins to hum an haw an hint at things and then begins to ask my advice about bigamy i cant help thinking this is a free country and theres no law agin thinking make a clean breast of it capn an ill do what i can for you  youre a blanked fool said captain thomsett wrathfully  captain stubbs shook his head gently and smiled with infinite patience praps so he said modestly praps so but theres one thing i can do and that is i can read people  you can read me i spose said thomsett sneeringly  easy my lad said the other still preserving though by an obvious effort his appearance of judicial calm ive seen your sort before one in pertikler i call to mind hes doing fourteen years now pore chap but you neednt be alarmed capn your secret is safe enough with me  captain thomsett got up and pranced up and down the cabin but captain stubbs remained calm he had seen that sort before it was interesting to the student of human nature and he regarded his visitor with an air of compassionate interest then captain thomsett resumed his seat and to preserve his own fair fame betrayed that of george  i knew it was either you or somebody your kind art was interested in said the discomfited stubbs as they resumed the interrupted game you cant help your face capn when you was thinking about that pore chaps danger it was working with emotion it misled me i own it but it aint often i meet such a feeling art as yours  captain thomsett his eyes glowing affectionately gripped his friends hand and in the course of the game listened to an exposition of the law relating to bigamy of a most masterly and complicated nature seasoned with anecdotes calculated to make the hardiest of men pause on the brink of matrimony and think seriously of their position  suppose this woman comes aboard after pore george said thomsett whats the best thing to be done  the first thing said captain stubbs is to gain time put her off  off the ship dye mean inquired the other  no no said the jurist pretend hes ill and cant see anybody by gum ive got it  he slapped the table with his open hand and regarded the other triumphantly  let him turn into his bunk and pretend to be dead he continued in a voice trembling with pride at his strategy its pretty dark down your focsle i know dont have no light down there and tell him to keep quiet  captain thomsetts eyes shone but with a qualified admiration  aint it somewhat sudden he demurred  captain stubbs regarded him with a look of supreme artfulness and slowly closed one eye  he got a chill going in the water he said quietly  well youre a masterpiece said thomsett ungrudgingly i will say this of you youre a masterpiece mind this is all to be kept quite secret  make your mind easy said the eminent jurist  if i told all i know theres a good many men in this river as ud be doing time at the present moment  captain thomsett expressed his pleasure at this information and having tried in vain to obtain a few of their names even going so far as to suggest some looked at the clock and shaking hands departed to his own ship captain stubbs left to himself finished his pipe and retired to rest and his mate who had been lying in the adjoining bunk during the consultation vainly trying to get to sleep scratched his head and tried to think of a little strategy himself he had glimmerings of it before he fell asleep but when he awoke next morning it flashed before him in all the fulness of its matured beauty  he went on deck smiling and leaning his arms on the side gazed contemplatively at george who was sitting on the deck listening darkly to the cook as that worthy read aloud from a newspaper  anything interesting cook demanded the mate  about george sir said the cook stopping in his reading theres pictures of im too  he crossed to the side and handing the paper to the mate listened smilingly to the little ejaculations of surprise and delight of that deceitful man as he gazed upon the likenesses wonderful he said emphatically wonderful i never saw such a good likeness in my life george thatll be copied in every newspaper in london and heres the name in full toogeorge cooper schooner john henry now lying off limehouse  he handed the paper back to the cook and turned away grinning as george unable to control himself any longer got up with an oath and went below to nurse his wrath in silence a little later the mate of the brig after a very confidential chat with his own crew lit his pipe and with a jaunty air went ashore  for the next hour or two george alternated between the focsle and the deck from whence he cast harassed glances at the busy wharves ashore the skipper giving it as his own suggestion acquainted him with the arrangements made in case of the worst and george though he seemed somewhat dubious about them went below and put his bed in order  its very unlikely shell see that particular newspaper though said the skipper encouragingly  people are sure to see what you dont want em too growled george somebody what knows us is sure to see it an show er  theres a lady stepping into a watermans skiff now said the skipper glancing at the stairs that wouldnt be her i spose  he turned to the seaman as he spoke but the words had hardly left his lips before george was going below and undressing for his part  if anybody asks for me he said turning to the cook who was regarding his feverish movements in much astonishment im dead  youre wot inquired the other  dead said george dead died at ten oclock this morning dye understand fathead  i cant say as ow i do said the cook somewhat acrimoniously  pass the word round that im dead repeated george hurriedly lay me out cookie ill do so much for you one day  instead of complying the horrified cook rushed up on deck to tell the skipper that georges brain had gone but finding him in the midst of a hurried explanation to the men stopped with greedy ears to listen the skiff was making straight for the schooner propelled by an elderly waterman in his shirtsleeves the sole passenger being a lady of ample proportions who was watching the life of the river through a black veil  in another minute the skiff bumped alongside and the waterman standing in the boat passed the painter aboard the skipper gazed at the fare and shivering inwardly hoped that george was a good actor  i want to see mr cooper said the lady grimly as she clambered aboard assisted by the waterman  im very sorry but you cant see him mum said the skipper politely  ho carnt i said the lady raising her voice a little you go an tell him that his lawful wedded wife what he deserted is aboard  it ud be no good mum said the skipper who felt the full dramatic force of the situation im afraid he wouldnt listen to you  ho i think i can persuade im a bit said the lady drawing in her lips where is e  up aloft said the skipper removing his hat  dont you give me none of your lies said the lady as she scanned both masts closely  hes dead said the skipper solemnly  his visitor threw up her arms and staggered back the cook was nearest and throwing his arms round her waist he caught her as she swayed the mate who was of a sympathetic nature rushed below for whisky as she sank back in the hatchway taking the reluctant cook with her  poor thing said the skipper  dont old er so tight cook said one of the men theres no necessity to squeeze er  pat er ands said another  pat em yourself said the cook brusquely as he looked up and saw the delight of the crew of the endeavour who were leaning over their vessels side regarding the proceedings with much interest  dont leave go of me said the newlymade widow as she swallowed the whisky and rose to her feet  stand by her cook said the skipper authoritatively  ay ay sir said the cook  they formed a procession below the skipper and mate leading the cook with his fair burden choking her sobs with a handkerchief and the crew following  what did he die of she asked in a whisper broken with sobs  chill from the water whispered the skipper in response  i cant see im she whispered its so dark here has anybody got a match oh heres some  before anybody could interfere she took a box from a locker and striking one bent over the motionless george and gazed at his tightlyclosed eyes and open mouth in silence  youll set the bed alight said the mate in a low voice as the end of the match dropped off  it wont hurt im whispered the widow tearfully  the mate who had distinctly seen the corpse shift a bit thought differently  nothing ll urt im now whispered the widow sniffing as she struck another match oh if he could only sit up and speak to me  for a moment the mate who knew georges temper thought it highly probable that he would as the top of the second match fell between his shirt and his neck  dont look any more said the skipper anxiously you cant do him any good  his visitor handed him the matches and for a short time sobbed in silence  weve done all we could for him said the skipper at length it ud be best for you to go home and lay down a bit  youre all very good im sure whispered the widow turning away ill send for him this evening  they all started especially the corpse  eh said the skipper  he was a bad usband to me she continued still in the same sobbing whisper but ill ave im put away decent  youd better let us bury him said the skipper we can do it cheaper than you can perhaps  no ill send for him this evening said the lady are they is clothes  the last he ever wore said the skipper pathetically pointing to the heap of clothing theres his chest poor chap just as he left it  the bereaved widow bent down and raising the lid shook her head tearfully as she regarded the contents then she gathered up the clothes under her left arm and still sobbing took his watch his knife and some small change from his chest while the crew in dumb show inquired of the deceased who was regarding her over the edge of the bunk what was to be done  i suppose there was some money due to him she inquired turning to the skipper  matter of a few shillings he stammered  ill take them she said holding out her hand  the skipper put his hand in his pocket and in his turn looked inquiringly at the late lamented for guidance but george had closed his eyes again to the world and after a moments hesitation he slowly counted the money into her hand  she dropped the coins into her pocket and with a parting glance at the motionless figure in the bunk turned away the procession made its way on deck again but not in the same order the cook carefully bringing up the rear  if theres any other little things she said pausing at the side to get a firmer grip of the clothes under her arm  you shall have them said the skipper who had been making mental arrangements to have george buried before her return  apparently much comforted by this assurance she allowed herself to be lowered into the boat which was waiting the excitement of the crew of the brig who had been watching her movements with eager interest got beyond the bounds of all decency as they saw her being pulled ashore with the clothes in her lap  you can come up now said the skipper as he caught sight of georges face at the scuttle  has she gone inquired the seaman anxiously  the skipper nodded and a wild cheer rose from the crew of the brig as george came on deck in his scanty garments and from behind the others peered cautiously over the side  where is she he demanded  the skipper pointed to the boat  that said george starting that that aint my wife  not your wife said the skipper staring whose is she then  how the devil should i know said george throwing discipline to the winds in his agitation it aint my wife  praps its one youve forgotten suggested the skipper in a low voice  george looked at him and choked ive never seen her before he replied selp me call her back stop her  the mate rushed aft and began to haul in the ships boat but george caught him suddenly by the arm  never mind he said bitterly better let her go she seems to know too much for me somebodys been talking to her  it was the same thought that was troubling the skipper and he looked searchingly from one to the other for an explanation he fancied that he saw it when he met the eye of the mate of the brig and he paused irresolutely as the skiff reached the stairs and the woman springing ashore waved the clothes triumphantly in the direction of the schooner and disappeared     an intervention  there was bad blood between the captain and mate who comprised the officers and crew of the sailingbarge swallow and the outset of their voyage from london to littleport was conducted in glum silence as far as the nore they had scarcely spoken and what little did pass was mainly in the shape of threats and abuse evening chill and overcast was drawing in distant craft disappeared somewhere between the waste of waters and the sky and the sidelights of neighbouring vessels were beginning to shine over the water the wind with a little rain in it was unfavourable to much progress and the trough of the sea got deeper as the waves ran higher and splashed by the barges side  get the sidelights out and quick you growled the skipper who was at the helm  the mate a blackhaired fierceeyed fellow of about twentyfive set about the task with much deliberation  and look lively you lump continued the skipper  i dont want none of your lip said the mate furiously so dont you give me none  the skipper yawned and stretching his mighty frame laughed disagreeably youll take what i give you my lad said he whether its lip or fist  lay a finger on me and ill knife you said the mate i aint afraid of you for all your size  he put out the sidelights casting occasional looks of violent hatred at the skipper who being a man of tremendous physique and rough tongue had goaded his subordinate almost to madness  if youve done skulking he cried as he knocked the ashes out of his pipe come and take the helm  the mate came aft and relieved him and he stood for a few seconds taking a look round before going below he dropped his pipe and stooped to recover it and in that moment the mate with a sudden impulse snatched up a handspike and dealt him a crushing blow on the head half blinded and stunned by the blow the man fell on his knees and shielding his face with his hands strove to rise before he could do so the mate struck wildly at him again and with a great cry he fell backwards and rolled heavily overboard the mate with a sob in his breath gazed wildly astern and waited for him to rise he waited minutes seemed to pass and still the body of the skipper did not emerge from the depths he reeled back in a stupor then he gave a faint cry as his eye fell on the boat which was dragging a yard or two astern and a figure which clung desperately to the side of it before he had quite realised what had happened he saw the skipper haul himself on to the stern of the boat and then roll heavily into it  panicstricken at the sight he drew his knife to cut the boat adrift but paused as he reflected that she and her freight would probably be picked up by some passing vessel as the thought struck him he saw the dim form of the skipper come towards the bow of the boat and seizing the rope begin to haul in towards the barge  stop shouted the mate hoarsely stop or ill cut you loose  the skipper let the rope go and the boat pulled up with a jerk  im independent of you the skipper shouted picking up one of the loose boards from the bottom of the boat and brandishing it if theres any sea on i can keep her head to it with this cut away  if i let you come aboard said the mate will you swear to let bygones be bygones  no thundered the other whether i come aboard or not dont make much difference itll be about twenty years for you you murdering hound when i get ashore  the mate made no reply but sat silently steering keeping however a wary eye on the boat towing behind he turned sick and faint as he thought of the consequences of his action and vainly cast about in his mind for some means of escape  are you going to let me come aboard presently demanded the skipper who was shivering in his wet clothes  you can come aboard on my terms repeated the mate doggedly  ill make no terms with you cried the other i hand you over to the police directly i get ashore you mutinous dog ive got a good witness in my head  after this there was silencesilence unbroken through the long hours of the night as they slowly passed then the dawn came the sidelights showed fainter and fainter in the water the light on the mast shed no rays on the deck but twinkled uselessly behind its glass then the mate turned his gaze from the wet cheerless deck and heaving seas to the figure in the boat dragging behind the skipper who returned his gaze with a fierce scowl was holding his wet handkerchief to his temple he removed it as the mate looked and showed a ghastly wound still neither of them spoke the mate averted his gaze and sickened with fear as he thought of his position and in that instant the skipper clutched the painter and with a mighty heave sent the boat leaping towards the stern of the barge and sprang on deck the mate rose to his feet but the other pushed him fiercely aside and picking up the handspike which lay on the raised top of the cabin went below half an hour later he came on deck with a fresh suit of clothes on and his head roughly bandaged and standing in front of the mate favoured him with a baleful stare  gimme that helm he cried  the mate relinquished it  you dog snarled the other to try and kill a man when he wasnt looking and then keep him in his wet clothes in the boat all night make the most o your time itll be many a day before you see the sea again  the mate groaned in spirit but made no reply  ive wrote everything down with the time it happened continued the other in a voice of savage satisfaction an ive locked that handspike up in my locker its got blood on it  thats enough about it said the mate turning at last and speaking thickly what ive done i must put up with  he walked forward to end the discussion but the skipper shouted out choice bits from time to time as they occurred to him and sat steer ing and gibing a gruesome picture of vengeance  suddenly he sprang to his feet with a sharp cry theres somebody in the water he roared stand by to pick him up  as he spoke he pointed with his left hand and with his right steered for something which rose and fell lazily on the water a short distance from them  the mate following his outstretched arm saw it too and picking up a boathook stood ready and they were soon close enough to distinguish the body of a man supported by a lifebelt  dont miss him shouted the skipper  the mate grasped the rigging with one hand and leaning forward as far as possible stood with the hook poised at first it seemed as though the object would escape them but a touch of the helm in the nick of time just enabled the mate to reach the hook caught in the jacket and with great care he gradually shortened it and drew the body close to the side  hes dead said the skipper as he fastened the helm and stood looking down into the wet face of the man then he stooped and taking him by the collar of his coat dragged the streaming figure on to the deck  take the helm he said  ay ay said the other and the skipper disappeared below with his burden  a moment later he came on deck again well take in sail and anchor sharp there he cried  the mate went to his assistance there was but little wind and the task was soon accomplished and both men after a hasty glance round ran below the wet body of the sailor lay on a locker and a pool of water was on the cabin floor  the mate hastily swabbed up the water and then lit the fire and put on the kettle while the skipper stripped the sailor of his clothes and flinging some blankets in front of the fire placed him upon them  fora long time they toiled in silence in the faint hope that life still remained in the apparently dead body  poor devil said the skipper at length and fell to rubbing again  i dont believe hes gone said the mate panting with his exertions he dont feel like a dead man  ten minutes later the figure stirred slightly and the men talked in excited whispers as they worked a faint sigh came from the lips of the sailor and his eyes partly opened  its all right matey said the skipper you lie still well do the rest jem get some coffee ready  by the time it was prepared the partly drowned man was conscious that he was alive and stared in a dazed fashion at the man who was using him so roughly conscious that his patient was improving rapidly the latter lifted him in his arms and placed him in his own bunk and proffered him some steaming hot coffee he sipped a little then lapsed into unconsciousness again the two men looked at each other blankly  some of em goes like that said the skipper ive seen it afore just as you think theyre pulling round they slip their cable  we must keep him warm said the mate i dont see as we can do any more  well get under weigh again said the other and pausing to heap some more clothes over the sailor he went on deck followed by the mate and in a short time the swallow was once more moving through the water then the skipper leaving the mate at the helm went below  half an hour passed  go and see what you can make of him said the skipper as he reappeared and took the helm he keeps coming round a bit and then just drifts back seems like as if he cant hook on to life dont seem to take no interest in it  the mate obeyed in silence and for the remainder of the day the two men relieved each other at the bedside of the sailor towards evening as they were entering the river which runs up to littleport he made decided progress under the skippers ministrations and the latter thrust his huge head up the hatchway and grinned in excusable triumph at the mate as he imparted the news then he suddenly remembered himself and the smile faded the light too faded from the mates face  bout that mutiny and attempted murder said the skipper and paused as though waiting for the mate to contradict or qualify the terms but he made no reply  i give you in charge as soon as we get to port continued the other soon as the ships berthed you go below  ay ay said the mate but without looking at him  nice thing itll be for your wife said the skipper sternly youll get no mercy from me  i dont expect none said the mate huskily what ive done ill stand to  the reply on the skippers lips merged into a grunt and he went below the sailor was asleep and breathing gently and regularly and after regarding him for some time the watcher returned to the deck and busied himself with certain small duties preparatory to landing  slowly the light faded out of the sky and the banks of the river grew indistinct and one by one the lights of littleport came into view as they rounded the last bend of the river and saw the little town lying behind its veil of masts and rigging the skipper came aft and took the helm from the mate and looked at him out of the corner of his eye as he stood silently waiting with his hands by his side  take in sail said the skipper shortly and leaving the helm a bit ran to assist him five minutes later the swallow was alongside of the wharf and then everything made fast and snug the two men turned and faced each other  go below said the skipper sternly the mate walked off and take care of that chap im going ashore if anybody asks you about these scratches i got em in a row down wappingdye hear  the mate heard but there was a thickness in his throat which prevented him from replying promptly by the time he had recovered his voice the other had disappeared over the edge of the wharf and the sound of his retreating footsteps rang over the cobblestone quay the mate in a bewildered fashion stood for a short time motionless then he turned and drawing a deep breath went below     the grey parrot  the chief engineer and the third sat at tea on the ss curlew in the east india docks the small and not overclean steward having placed everything he could think of upon the table and then added everything the chief could think of had assiduously poured out two cups of tea and withdraw by request the two men ate steadily conversing between bites and interrupted occasionally by a hoarse and sepulchral voice the owner of which being much exercised by the sight of the food asked for it prettily at first and afterwards in a way which at least compelled attention  thats pretty good for a parrot said the third critically seems to know what hes saying too no dont give it anything itll stop if you do  theres no pleasure to me in listening to coarse language said the chief with dignity  he absently dipped a piece of bread and butter in the thirds tea and losing it chased it round and round the bottom of the cup with his finger the third regarding the operation with an interest and emotion which he was at first unable to understand  youd better pour yourself out another cup he said thoughtfully as he caught the thirds eye  im going to said the other dryly  the man i bought it of said the chief giving the bird the sop said that it was a perfectly respectable parrot and wouldnt know a bad word if it heard it i hardly like to give it to my wife now  its no good being too particular said the third regarding the other with an illconcealed grin thats the worst of all you young married fellows seem to think your wife has got to be wrapped up in brown paper ten chances to one shell be amused  the chief shrugged his shoulders disdainfully i bought the bird to be company for her he said slowly shell be very lonesome without me rogers  how do you know inquired the other  she said so was the reply  when youve been married as long as i have said the third who having been married some fifteen years felt that their usual positions were somewhat reversed youll know that generally speaking theyre glad to get rid of you  what for demanded the chief in a voice that othello might have envied  well you get in the way a bit said rogers with secret enjoyment you see you upset the arrangements housecleaning and all that sort of thing get interrupted theyre glad to see you back at first and then glad to see the back of you  theres wives and wives said the bridegroom tenderly  and mines good one said the third registered a 1 at lloyds but she dont worry about me going away your wifes thirty years younger than you isnt she  twentyfive corrected the other shortly you see what im afraid of is that shell get too much attention  well women like that remarked the third  but i dont damn it cried the chief hotly when i think of it i get hot all over boiling hot  that wont last said the other reassuringly you wont care twopence this time next year  were not all alike growled the chief some of us have got finer feelings than others have i saw the chap next door looking at her as we passed him this morning  lor said the third  i dont want any of your damned impudence said the chief sharply he put his hat on straighter when he passed us what do you think of that  cant say replied the other with commendable gravity it might mean anything  if he has any of his nonsense while im away ill break his neck said the chief passionately i shall know of it  the other raised his eyebrows  ive asked the landlady to keep her eyes open a bit said the chief my wife was brought up in the country and shes very young and simple so that it is quite right and proper for her to have a motherly old body to look after her  told your wife queried rogers  no said the other fact is ive got an idea about that parrot im going to tell her its a magic bird and will tell me everything she does while im away anything the landlady tells me i shall tell her i got from the parrot for one thing i dont want her to go out after seven of an evening and shes promised me she wont if she does i shall know and pretend that i know through the parrot what do you think of it  think of it said the third staring at him think of it fancy a man telling a grownup woman a yarn like that  she believes in warnings and deathwatches and all that sort of thing said the chief so why shouldnt she  well youll know whether she believes in it or not when you come back said rogers and itll be a great pity because its a beautiful talker  what do you mean said the other  i mean itll get its little neck wrung said the third  well well see said gannett i shall know what to think if it does die  i shall never see that bird again said rogers shaking his head as the chief took up the cage and handed it to the steward who was to accompany him home with it  the couple left the ship and proceeded down the east india dock road side by side the only incident being a hot argument between a constable and the engineer as to whether he could or could not be held responsible for the language in which the parrot saw fit to indulge when the steward happened to drop it  the engineer took the cage at his door and not without some misgivings took it upstairs into the parlour and set it on the table mrs gannett a simplelooking woman with sleepy brown eyes and a docile manner clapped her hands with joy  isnt it a beauty said mr gannett looking at it i bought it to be company for you while im away  youre too good to me jem said his wife she walked all round the cage admiring it and the parrot which was of a hugely suspicious and nervous disposition having had boys at its last place turning with her after she had walked round him five times he got sick of it and in a simple sailorly fashion said so  oh jem said his wife  its a beautiful talker said gannett hastily and its so clever that it picks up everything it hears but itll soon forget it  it looks as though it knows what you are saying said his wife just look at it the artful thing  the opportunity was too good to be missed and in a few straightforward lies the engineer acquainted mrs gannett of the miraculous powers with which he had chosen to endow it  but you dont believe it said his wife staring at him openmouthed  i do said the engineer firmly  but how can it know what im doing when im away persisted mrs gannett  ah thats its secret said the engineer a good many people would like to know that but nobody has found out yet its a magic bird and when youve said that youve said all there is to say about it  mrs gannett wrinkling her forehead eyed the marvellous bird curiously  youll find its quite true said gannett when i come back that birdll be able to tell me how youve been and all about you everything youve done during my absence  good gracious said the astonished mrs gannett  if you stay out after seven of an evening or do anything else that i shouldnt like that birdll tell me continued the engineer impressively itll tell me who comes to see you and in fact it will tell me everything you do while im away  well it wont have anything bad to tell of me said mrs gannett composedly unless it tells lies  it cant tell lies said her husband confidently and now if you go and put your bonnet on well drop in at the theatre for half an hour  it was a prophetic utterance for he made such a fuss over the man next to his wife offering her his operaglasses that they left at the urgent request of the management in almost exactly that space of time  youd better carry me about in a bandbox said mrs gannett wearily as the outraged engineer stalked home beside her what harm was the man doing  you must have given him some encouragement said mr gannett fiercelymade eyes at him or something a man wouldnt offer to lend a lady his operaglasses without  mrs gannett tossed her headand that so decidedly that a passing stranger turned his head and looked at her mr gannett accelerated his pace and taking his wifes arm led her swiftly home with a passion too great for words  by the morning his anger had evaporated but his misgivings remained he left after breakfast for the curlew which was to sail in the afternoon leaving behind him copious instructions by following which his wife would be enabled to come down and see him off with the minimum exposure of her fatal charms  left to herself mrs gannett dusted the room until coming to the parrots cage she put down the duster and eyed its eerie occupant curiously she fancied that she saw an evil glitter in the creatures eye and the knowing way in which it drew the film over it was as near an approach to a wink as a bird could get  she was still looking at it when there was a knock at the door and a bright little womanrather smartly dressedbustled into the room and greeted her effusively  i just come to see you my dear because i thought a little outing would do me good she said briskly and if youve no objection ill come down to the docks with you to see the boat off  mrs gannett assented readily it would ease the engineers mind she thought if he saw her with a chaperon  nice bird said mrs cluffins mechanically bringing her parasol to the charge  dont do that said her friend hastily  why not said the other  language said mrs gannett solemnly  well i must do something to it said mrs cluffins restlessly  she held the parasol near the cage and suddenly opened it it was a flaming scarlet and for the moment the shock took the parrots breath away  he dont mind that said mrs gannett  the parrot hopping to the farthest corner of the bottom of his cage said something feebly finding that nothing dreadful happened he repeated his remark somewhat more boldly and being convinced after all that the apparition was quite harmless and that he had displayed his craven spirit for nothing hopped back on his perch and raved wickedly  if that was my bird said mrs cluflins almost as scarlet as her parasol i should wring its neck  no you wouldnt said mrs gannett solemnly and having quieted the bird by throwing a cloth over its cage she explained its properties  what said mrs cluffins unable to sit still in her chair you mean to tell me your husband said that  mrs gannett nodded hes awfully jealous of me she said with a slight simper  i wish he was my husband said mrs cluflins in a thin hard voice i wish c would talk to me like that i wish somebody would try and persuade c to talk to me like that  it shows hes fond of me said mrs gannett looking down  mrs cluffins jumped up and snatched the cover off the cage endeavoured but in vain to get the parasol through the bars  and you believe that rubbish she said scathingly bosh you wretch  i dont believe it said her friend taking her gently away and covering the cage hastily just as the bird was recovering but i let him think i do  i call it an outrage said mrs cluffins waving the parasol wildly i never heard of such a thing id like to give mr gannett a piece of my mind just about half an hour of it he wouldnt be the same man afterwardsid parrot him  mrs gannett soothing her agitated friend as well as she was able led her gently to a chair and removed her bonnet and finding that complete recovery was impossible while the parrot remained in the room took that wonderworking bird outside  by the time they had reached the docks and boarded the curlew mrs cluffins had quite recovered her spirits she roamed about the steamer asking questions which savoured more of idle curiosity than a genuine thirst for knowledge and was at no pains to conceal her opinion of those who were unable to furnish her with satisfactory replies  i shall think of you every day jem said mrs gannett tenderly  i shall think of you every minute said the engineer reproachfully  he sighed gently and gazed in a scandalised fashion at mrs cluflins who was carrying on a desperate flirtation with one of the apprentices  shes very lighthearted said his wife following the direction of his eyes  she is said mr gannett curtly as the unconscious mrs cluffins shut her parasol and rapped the apprentice playfully with the handle she seems to be on very good terms with jenkins laughing and carrying on i dont suppose shes ever seen him before  poor young things said mrs cluflins solemnly as she came up to them dont you worry mr gannett ill look after her and keep her from moping  youre very kind said the engineer slowly  well have a jolly time said mrs cluflins i often wish my husband was a seafaring man a wife does have more freedom doesnt she  more what inquired mr gannett huskily  more freedom said mrs cluflins gravely i always envy sailors wives they can do as they like no husband to look after them for nine or ten months in the year  before the unhappy engineer could put his indignant thoughts into words there was a warning cry from the gangway and with a hasty farewell he hurried below the visitors went ashore the gangway was shipped and in response to the clang of the telegraph the curlew drifted slowly away from the quay and headed for the spring bridge slowly opening in front of her  the two ladies hurried to the pierhead and watched the steamer down the river until a bend hid it from view then mrs gannett with a sensation of having lost something due so her friend assured her to the want of a cup of tea went slowly back to her lonely home  in the period of grass widowhood which ensued mrs cluffins visits formed almost the sole relief to the bare monotony of existence as a companion the parrot was an utter failure its language being so irredeemably bad that it spent most of its time in the spare room with a cloth over its cage wondering when the days were going to lengthen a bit mrs cluffins suggested selling it but her friend repelled the suggestion with horror and refused to entertain it at any price even that of the publican at the corner who had heard of the birds command of language and was bent upon buying it  i wonder what that beauty will have to tell your husband said mrs cluffins as they sat together one day some three months after the curlews departure  i should hope that he has forgotten that nonsense said mrs gannett reddening he never alludes to it in his letters  sell it said mrs cluffins peremptorily its no good to you and hobson would give anything for it almost  mrs gannett shook her head the house wouldnt hold my husband if i did she remarked with a shiver  oh yes it would said mrs cluffins you do as i tell you and a much smaller house than this would hold him i told c to tell hobson he should have it for five pounds  but he mustnt said her friend in alarm  leave yourself right in my hands said mrs cluffins spreading out two small palms and regarding them complacently itll be all right i promise you  she put her arm round her friends waist and led her to the window talking earnestly in five minutes mrs gannett was wavering in ten she had given away and in fifteen the energetic mrs cluffins was en route for hobsons swinging the cage so violently in her excitement that the parrot was reduced to holding on to its perch with claws and bill mrs gannett watched the progress from the window and with a queer look on her face sat down to think out the points of attack and defence in the approaching fray  a week later a fourwheeler drove up to the door and the engineer darting upstairs three steps at a time dropped an armful of parcels on the floor and caught his wife in an embrace which would have done credit to a bear mrs gannett for reasons of which a lack of muscle was only one responded less ardently  ha its good to be home again said gannett sinking into an easychair and pulling his wife on his knee and how have you been lonely  i got used to it said mrs gannett softly  the engineer coughed you had the parrot he remarked  yes i had the magic parrot said mrs gannett  hows it getting on said her husband looking round where is it  part of it is on the mantelpiece said mrs gannett trying to speak calmly part of it is in a bonnetbox upstairs some of its in my pocket and here is the remainder  she fumbled in her pocket and placed in his hand a cheap twobladed claspknife  on the mantelpiece repeated the engineer staring at the knife in a bonnetbox  those blue vases said his wife  mr gannett put his hand to his head if he had heard aright one parrot had changed into a pair of vases a bonnet and a knife a magic bird with a vengeance  i sold it said mrs gannett suddenly  the engineers knee stiffened inhospitably and his arm dropped from his wifes waist she rose quietly and took a chair opposite  sold it said mr gannett in awful tones sold my parrot  i didnt like it jem said his wife i didnt want that bird watching me and i did want the vases and the bonnet and the little present for you  mr gannett pitched the little present into the corner of the room  you see it mightnt have told the truth jem continued mrs gannett it might have told all sorts of lies about me and made no end of mischief  it couldnt lie shouted the engineer passionately rising from his chair and pacing the room its your guilty conscience thats made a coward of you how dare you sell my parrot  because it wasnt truthful jem said his wife who was somewhat pale  if you were half as truthful youd do vociferated the engineer standing over her you you deceitful woman  mrs gannett fumbled in her pocket again and producing a small handkerchief applied it deliberately to her eyes  ii got rid of it for your sake she stammered it used to tell such lies about you i couldnt bear to listen to it  about me said mr gannett sinking into his seat and staring at his wife with very natural amazement tell lies about me nonsense how could it  i suppose it could tell me about you as easily as it could tell you about me said mrs gannett there was more magic in that bird than you thought jem it used to say shocking things about you i couldnt bear it  do you think youre talking to a child or a fool demanded the engineer  mrs gannett shook her head feebly she still kept the handkerchief to her eyes but allowed a portion to drop over her mouth  i should like to hear one of the stories it told about me if you can remember them said the engineer with bitter sarcasm  the first lie said mrs gannett in a feeble but ready voice was about the time you were at genoa the parrot said you were at some concert gardens at the upper end of the town  one moist eye coming mildly from behind the handkerchief saw the engineer stiffen suddenly in his chair  i dont suppose there even is such a place she continued  iblevethereis said her husband jerkily ive heardour chapstalk of it  but you havent been there said his wife anxiously  never said the engineer with extraordinary vehemence  that wicked bird said that you got intoxicated there said mrs gannett in solemn accents that you smashed a little marbletopped table and knocked down two waiters and that if it hadnt been for the captain of the pursuit who was in there and who got you away youd have been locked up wasnt it a wicked bird  horrible said the engineer huskily  i dont suppose there ever was a ship called the pursuit continued mrs gannett  doesnt sound like a ships name murmured mr gannett  well then a few days later it said the curlew was at naples  i never went ashore all the time we were at naples remarked the engineer casually  the parrot said you did said mrs gannett  i suppose youll believe your own lawful husband before that damned bird shouted gannett starting up  of course i didnt believe it jem said his wife im trying to prove to you that the bird was not truthful but youre so hard to persuade  mr gannett took a pipe from his pocket and with a small knife dug with much severity and determination a hardened plug from the bowl and blew noisily through the stem  there was a girl kept a fruitstall just by the harbor said mrs gannett and on this evening on the strength of having bought threepennyworth of green figs you put your arm round her waist and tried to kiss her and her sweetheart who was standing close by tried to stab you the parrot said that you were in such a state of terror that you jumped into the harbour and were nearly drowned  mr gannett having loaded his pipe lit it slowly and carefully and with tidy precision got up and deposited the match in the fireplace  it used to frighten me so with its stories that i hardly knew what to do with myself continued mrs gannett when you were at suez  the engineer waved his hand imperiously  thats enough he said stiffly  im sure i dont want to have to repeat what it told me about suez said his wife i thought youd like to hear it thats all  not at all said the engineer puffing at his pipe not at all  but you see why i got rid of the bird dont you said mrs gannett if it had told you untruths about me you would have believed them wouldnt you  mr gannett took his pipe from his mouth and took his wife in his extended arms no my dear he said brokenly no more than you believe all this stuff about me  and i did quite right to sell it didnt i jem  quite right said mr gannett with a great assumption of heartiness best thing to do with it  you havent heard the worst yet said mrs gannett when you were at suez  mr gannett consigned suez to its only rival and thumping the table with his clenched fist forbade his wife to mention the word again and desired her to prepare supper  not until he heard his wife moving about in the kitchen below did he relax the severity of his countenance then his expression changed to one of extreme anxiety and he restlessly paced the room seeking for light it came suddenly  jenkins he gasped jenkins and mrs cluffins and i was going to tell cluffins about him writing to his wife i expect he knows the letter by heart     moneychangers  taint no use waiting any longer said hairy pilchard looking over the side of the brig towards the tower stairs es either waiting for the money or else es a spending of it whos coming ashore  give im another five minutes harry said another seaman persuasively it ud be uncommon ard on im if e come aboard and then ad to go an get another ships crew to elp im celebrate it  ard on us too said the cook honestly there he is  the other glanced up at a figure waving to

for a bit o money and begins to waste it directly theres threepence gone clean chucked away look at im just look at im  es got the money all right said the cook theres no doubt about that why e looks arf as large again as e did this morning  the crew bent oyer the side as the skiff approached and the fare who had been leaning back in the stern with a severely important air rose slowly and felt in his trousers pocket  theres a sixpence for you my lad he said pompously never mind about the change  all right old slackbreeches said the waterman with effusive goodfellowship up you get  three pairs of hands assisted the offended fare on board and the boy hovering round him slapped his legs vigorously  wot are you up to demanded mr samuel dodds ab turning on him  only dusting you down sam said the boy humbly  you got the money all right i spose sammy said steve martin  mr dodds nodded and slapped his breastpocket  right as ninepence he replied genially ive been with my lawyer all the arternoon pretty near es a nice feller  ow much is it sam inquired pilchard eagerly  one undred and seventythree pun seventeen shillings an ten pence said the heir noticing with much pleasure the effect of his announcement  say it agin sam said pilchard in awed tones  mr dodds with a happy laugh obliged him if youll all come down the focsle he continued ive got a bundle o cigars an a drop o something short in my pocket  lets ave a look at the money sam said pilchard when the cigars were alight  ah lets ave a look at it said steve  mr dodds laughed again and producing a small canvasbag from his pocket dusted the table with his big palm and spread out a roll of banknotes and a little pile of gold and silver it was an impressive sight and the cook breathed so hard that one note fluttered off the table three men dived to recover it while sam alive for the first time to the responsibilities of wealth anxiously watched the remainder of his capital  theres something for you to buy sweets with my lad he said restored to good humour as the note was replaced  he passed over a small coin and regarded with tolerant goodhumour the extravagant manifestation of joy on the part of the youth which followed he capered joyously for a minute or two and then taking it to the foot of the steps where the light was better bit it ecstatically  how much is it inquired the wandering steve you do chuck your money about sam  ony sixpence said sam laughing i expect if it ad been a shillin it ud ha turned his brain  it aint a sixpence said the boy indignantly its arf a suvrin  arf a wot exclaimed mr dodds with a sudden change of manner  arf a suvrin repeated the boy with nervous rapidity and thank you very much sam for your generosity if everybody was like you we should all be the better for it the world ud be a different place to live in concluded the youthful philosopher  mr dodds face under these fulsome praises was a study in conflicting emotions well dont waste it he said at length and hastily gathering up the remainder stowed it in the bag  what are you going to do with it all sam inquired harry  i aint made up my mind yet said mr dodds deliberately i ave thought of ouse property  i dont mean that said the other i mean wot are you going to do with it now to take care of it  why keep it in my pocket said sam staring  well if i was you said harry impressively i should ask the skipper to take care of it for me you know wot you are when youre a bit on sam  wot dyer mean demanded mr dodds hotly  i mean said harry hastily that youve got sich a generous nature that when youve ad a glass or two youre just as likely as not to give it away to somebody  i know what im about said mr dodds with conviction im not goin to get on while ive got this about me im just goin round to the bulls head but i shant drink anything to speak of myself anybody that likes to come tave anything at my expense is welcome  a flattering murmur which was music to mr dodds ear arose from his shipmates as they went on deck and hauled the boat alongside the boy was first in her and pulling out his pockethandkerchief ostentatiously wiped a seat for mr dodds  understand said that gentleman with whom the affair of the halfsovereign still rankled your drink is shandygaff    they returned to the brig at eleven oclock mr dodds slumbering peacefully in the stern of the boat propped up on either side by steve and the boy  his sleep was so profound that he declined to be aroused and was hoisted over the side with infinite difficulty and no little risk by his shipmates  look at im said harry as they lowered him down the forecastle what ud ha become of im if we hadnt been with im where would is money ha been  hell lose it as sure as eggs is heggs said steve regarding him intently bear a hand to lift im in his bunk harry  harry complied their task being rendered somewhat difficult by a slight return of consciousness in mr dodds lower limbs which spreading themselves out fanwise defied all attempts to pack them in the bunk  let em hang out then said harry savagely wiping a little mud from his face fancy that coming in for a fortin  e wont ave it long said the cook shaking his head  wot e wants is a shock said harry owd it be when he wakes up to tell im hes lost all is money  wots the good o telling im demanded the cook when es got it in his pocket  well lets

think cook inquired harry  i dont see no arm in it said the cook slowly the fright might do im good praps  it might be the saving of im said harry he leaned over the sleeping seaman and gently inserting his fingers in his breastpocket drew out the canvas bag there it is chaps he said gayly an ill give im sich a fright in the morning as he wont forget in a urry  he retired to his bunk and placing the bag under his pillow was soon fast asleep the other men followed his example and steve extinguishing the lamp the forecastle surrendered itself to \ sleep  at five oclock they were awakened by the voice of mr dodds it was a broken disconnected sort of voice at first like to that of a man talking in his sleep but as mr dodds head cleared his ideas cleared with it and in strong forcible language straight from the heart he consigned the eyes and limbs of some person or persons unknown to every variety of torment after which in a voice broken with emotion he addressed himself in terms of heartbreaking sympathy  shut up sam said harry in a sleepy voice why cant you go to sleep  sleep be anged said mr dodds tearfully ive lorst all my money  youre dreamin said harry lightly pinch yourself  mr dodds who had a little breath left and a few words still comparatively fresh bestowed them upon him  i tell you you havent lorst it said harry dont you remember giving it to that redaired woman with a baby  wot said the astounded mr dodds  you give it to er an told er to buy the baby a bun with it continued the veracious mr pilchard  told er to buy the baby a bun with it repeated mr dodds in a dazed voice told er to wot did you let me do it for wot was all you chaps standin by an doin to let me go an do it for  we did arsk you not to said steve joining in the conversation  mr dodds finding language utterly useless to express his burning thoughts sat down and madly i smashed at the table with his fists  wot was you adoin to let me do it he demanded at length of the boy you ungrateful little toad you can give me that arfsuvrin back dye hear i cant said the boy i followed your example and give it to the redaired woman to buy the baby another bun with  there was a buzzing noise in mr dodds head and the bunks and their grinning occupants went round and round  ere old up sam said pilchard shaking him in alarm its all right dont be a fool ive got the money  sam stared at him blankly  ive got the money repeated the seaman  mr dodds colour came back  howd you get it he inquired  i took it out of your pocket last night just to give you a lesson said harry severely dont you never be so silly agin sam  gimme my money said mr dodds glaring at him  you might ha lorst it you see sam continued his benefactor if i could take it anybody else could let this be a lesson to you  if you dont gimme my money began sam violently  its no good trying to do im a kindness said harry to the others as he turned to his bunk he can go an lose it for all i care  he put his hand in his bunk and then with a sudden exclamation searched somewhat hastily amongst the bedding mr dodds watching him with a scowl saw him take every article separately out of his bunk and then sink down appalled on the locker  youve took it samaintyou he gasped  look ere said mr dodds with ominous quietness when youve done your little game  its gone said harry in a scared voice somebodys taken it  look ere arry give im his money said steve impatiently a jokes a joke but we dont want too much of it  i aint got it said harry trembling sure as i stand ere its gone i took it out

sam said steve i saw somebody take it out of his bunk while he was asleep  why didnt you stop him cried harry starting up  i didnt like to interfere said steve simply but i saw where he went to  where demanded mr dodds wildly where  he went straight up on deck said steve slowly walked aft and then down into the cabin the skipper woke up and i heard im say something to him  say something to im repeated the bewildered dodds wot was it  well i ardly like to repeat it said steve hesitating  wot was it roared the overwrought mr dodds  well i eard this chap say something said steve slowly and then i heard the skippers voice but i dont like to repeat wot e said i reely dont  wot was it roared mr dodds approaching him with clenched fist  well if you will have it said steve with a little cough the old man said to me well done steve he ses youre the only sensible man of the whole bilin lot sams a fool e ses and arrys worse an if it wasnt for men like you steve life wouldnt be worth living     the lost ship  on a fine spring morning in the early part of the present century tetby a small port on the east coast was keeping high holiday tradesmen left their shops and labourers their work and flocked down to join the maritime element collected on the quay  in the usual way tetby was a quiet dull little place clustering in a tiny heap of town on one side of the river and perching in scattered redtiled cottages on the cliffs of the other  now however people were grouped upon the stone quay with its litter of fishbaskets and coils of rope waiting expectantly for today the largest ship ever built in tetby by tetby hands was to start upon her first voyage  as they waited discussing past tetby ships their builders their voyages and their fate a small piece of white sail showed on the noble barque from her moorings up the river the groups on the quay grew animated as more sail was set and in a slow and stately fashion the new ship drew near as the light breeze took her sails she came faster sitting the water like a duck her lofty masts tapering away to the sky as they broke through the white clouds of canvas she passed within ten fathoms of the quay and the men cheered and the women held their children up to wave farewell for she was manned from captain to cabinboy by tetby men and bound for the distant southern seas  outside the harbour she altered her course somewhat and bent like a thing of life to the wind blowing outside the crew sprang into the rigging and waved their caps and kissed their grimy hands to receding tetby they were answered by rousing cheers from the shore hoarse and masculine to drown the lachrymose attempts of the women  they watched her until their eyes were dim and she was a mere white triangular speck on the horizon then like a melting snowflake she vanished into air and the tetby folk some envying the bold mariners and others thankful that their lives were cast upon the safe and pleasant shore slowly dispersed to their homes  months passed and the quiet routine of tetby went on undisturbed other crafts came into port and discharging and loading in an easy comfortable fashion sailed again the keel of another ship was being laid in the shipyard and slowly the time came round when the return of tetbys pride for so she was named might be reasonably looked for  it was feared that she might arrive in the nightthe cold and cheerless night when wife and child were abed and even if roused to go down on to the quay would see no more of her than her sidelights staining the water and her dark form stealing cautiously up the river they would have her come by day to see her first on that horizon into which she had dipped and vanished to see her come closer and closer the good stout ship seasoned by southern seas and southern suns with the crew crowding the sides to gaze at tetby and see how the children had grown  but she came not day after day the watchers waited for her in vain it was whispered at length that she was overdue and later on but only by those who had neither kith nor kin aboard of her that she was missing  long after all hope had gone wives and mothers after the manner of their kind watched and waited on the cheerless quay one by one they stayed away and forgot the dead to attend to the living babes grew into sturdy ruddyfaced boys and girls boys and girls into young men and women but no news of the missing ship no word from the missing men slowly year succeeded year and the lost ship became a legend the man who had built her was old and gray and time had smoothed away the sorrows of the bereaved  it was on a dark blustering september night that an old woman sat by her fire knitting the fire was low for it was more for the sake of company than warmth and it formed an agreeable contrast to the wind which whistled round the house bearing on its wings the sound of the waves as they came crashing ashore  god help those at sea tonight said the old woman devoutly as a stronger gust than usual shook the house  she put her knitting in her lap and clasped her hands and at that moment the cottage door opened the lamp flared and smoked up the chimney with the draught and then went out as the old woman rose from her seat the door closed  whos there she cried nervously  her eyes were dim and the darkness sudden but she fancied she saw something standing by the door and snatching a spill from the mantelpiece she thrust it into the fire and relit the lamp  a man stood on the threshold a man of middle age with white drawn face and scrubby beard his clothes were in rags his hair unkempt and his light grey eyes sunken and tired  the old woman looked at him and waited for him to speak when he did so he took a step towards her and said  mother  with a great cry she threw herself upon his neck and strained him to her withered bosom and kissed him she could not believe her eyes her senses but clasped him convulsively and bade him speak again and wept and thanked god and laughed all in a breath  then she remembered herself and led him tottering to the old windsor chair thrust him in it and quivering with excitement took food and drink from the cupboard and placed before him he ate hungrily the old woman watching him and standing by his side to keep his glass filled with the homebrewed beer at times he would have spoken but she motioned him to silence and bade him eat the tears coursing down her aged cheeks as she looked at his white famished face  at length he laid down his knife and fork and drinking off the ale intimated that he had finished  my boy my boy said the old woman in a broken voice i thought you had gone down with tetbys pride long years ago  he shook his head heavily  the captain and crew and the good ship asked his mother where are they  captainandcrew said the son in a strange hesitating fashion it is a long storythe ale has made me heavy they are  he left off abruptly and closed his eyes  where are they asked his mother what happened  he opened his eyes slowly  iamtireddead tired i have notslept ill tellyoumorning  he nodded again and the old woman shook him gently  go to bed then your old bed jem its as you left it and its made and the sheets aired its been ready for you ever since  he rose to his feet and stood swaying to and fro his mother opened a door in the wall and taking the lamp lighted him up the steep wooden staircase to the room he knew so well then he took her in his arms in a feeble hug and kissing her on the forehead sat down wearily on the bed  the old woman returned to her kitchen and falling upon her knees remained for some time in a state of grateful pious ecstasy when she arose she thought of those other women and snatching a shawl from its peg behind the door ran up the deserted street with her tidings  in a very short time the town was astir like a breath of hope the whisper flew from house to house doors closed for the night were thrown open and wondering children questioned their weeping mothers blurred images of husbands and fathers long since given over for dead stood out clear and distinct smiling with bright faces upon their dear ones  at the cottage door two or three people had already collected and others were coming up the street in an unwonted bustle  they found their way barred by an old womana resolute old woman her face still working with the great joy which had come into her old life but who refused them admittance until her son had slept their thirst for news was uncontrollable but with a swelling in her throat she realised that her share in tetbys pride was safe  women who had waited and got patient at last after years of waitings could not endure these additional few hours despair was endurable but suspense ah god was their man alive what did he look like had he aged much  he was so fatigued he could scarce speak said she she had questioned him but he was unable to reply give him but till the dawn and they should know all  so they waited for to go home and sleep was impossible occasionally they moved a little way up the street but never very far and gathering in small knots excitedly discussed the great event it came to be understood that the rest of the crew had been cast away on an uninhabited island it could be nothing else and would doubtlessly soon be with them all except one or two perhaps who were old men when the ship sailed and had probably died in the mean time one said this in the hearing of an old woman whose husband if alive would be in extreme old age but she smiled peacefully albeit her lip trembled and said she only expected to hear of him that was all  the suspense became almost unendurable would this man never awake would it never be dawn the children were chilled with the wind but their elders would scarcely have felt an arctic frost with growing impatience they waited glancing at times at two women who held themselves somewhat aloof from the others two women who had married again and whose second husbands waited awkwardly enough with them  slowly the weary windy night wore away the old woman deaf to their appeals still keeping her door fast the dawn was not yet though the oftconsulted watches announced it near at hand it was very close now and the watchers collected by the door it was undeniable that things were seen a little more distinctly one could see better the grey eager faces of his neighbours  they knocked upon the door and the old womans eyes filled as she opened it and saw those faces unasked and unchid they invaded the cottage and crowded round the door  i will go up and fetch him said the old woman  if each could have heard the beating of the others hearts the noise would have been deafening but as it was there was complete silence except for some overwrought womans sob  the old woman opened the door leading to the room above and with the slow deliberate steps of age ascended the stairs and those below heard her calling softly to her son  two or three minutes passed and she was heard descending the stairs againalone the smile the pity had left her face and she seemed dazed and strange  i cannot wake him she said piteously he sleeps so sound he is fatigued i have shaken him but he still sleeps  as she stopped and looked appealingly round the other old woman took her hand and pressing it led her to a chair two of the men sprang quickly up the stairs they were absent but a short while and then they came down like men bewildered and distraught no need to speak a low wail of utter misery rose from the women and was caught up and repeated by the crowd outside for the only man who could have set their hearts at rest had escaped the perils of the deep and died quietly in his bed   the end
