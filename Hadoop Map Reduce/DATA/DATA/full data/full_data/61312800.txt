forest fireconclusion      preface  my dear lads  this tale of four boy hunters is a complete story in itself but forms the first volume of a line to be called the boy hunters series taking the heroes through various adventures while searching for big and little game in the woods and in the mountains  the boys are bright lively fellows of today with a natural taste for a life in the open and a fondness for a gun and a rod  in the present volume they organize their little club and after a good deal of talk obtain permission to go a number of miles from home and establish a camp on the edge of a lake  from this spot they are driven away by one who is their enemy and then they go elsewhere  they have fun and adventures in plenty around the camp and while out after both big and little game and they help to bring to justice two men who are hiding from the officers of the law today hunting in our country is not what it was some years ago many of the best hunting localities have become settled and it is becoming harder and harder to catch a sight of a deer or a moose or a bear or in fact any wild animal of size  in the far west the buffalo has been practically wiped out and in the east the deer and moose would also be gone were it not for the protection of the law which makes it illegal to shoot down such game during the closed season  with best wishes to all who love a gun and love good hunting i remain your sincere friend captain ralph bonehill     chapter i  target shooting and a plan   cling  a bullseye  cling  another bullseye i declare  cling  three bullseyes of all things  snap you are getting to be a wonder with the rifle  why even old jed sanborn couldnt do better than that  charley dodge a bright manly boy of fifteen laid down the rifle on the counter in the shooting gallery and smiled quietly  i guess it was more luck than anything shep he replied  perhaps i couldnt do it again  nonsense came from sheppard reed also a boy of fifteen  you have got it in you to shoot straight and that is all there is to it  i only wish i could shoot as well  how did you fellows make out came from a third youth as he entered the gallery  he was sixteen years old but hardly as large as the average lad of ten  snap just made three bullseyes cried shep red  made them as easily as pie too  and what did you make  made one bullseye and two inner rings  are you going to try your luck giant  humphi dont think i can hit the back of the building unless they move it up to me answered will caslette  but ill take a chance he added turning to the keeper of the gallery and fishing five cents from his pocket  got to learn to shoot if im going on a hunt you know he went on to his chums  then you can go with us questioned charley dodge quickly  i think somother said she would tell me for certain tomorrow  the small youth took the rifle handed to him and aiming carefully pulled the trigger  the outer ring said shep reed  thats not so bad but what it might be worse giant  oh it might be worse answered the small youth coolly  i might fire out of the window and kill somebody on the back street or hit a duck in racksons pond  here goes again  the second shot was a little better and the third made the bell ring much to the small youths delight  hullo you fellows came from the doorway a lively boy of fourteen came in curly hair dying and a cap set far back on his head been looking for you all over town for about sixteen hours been shooting eh  ill bet a can of buttermilk against a shoestring that you all made outer rings  hullo whopper called the others  come in and try your luck  cantim dead broke this morning answered frank dawson ive got to wait a year or two till my next allowance comes in  heres the money answered charley dodge producing five cents now whopper dont make more than three bullseyes  im going to make twentyleven answered the boy called whopper dont you know that i once went into a gallery in the city and made one hundred bullseyes in succession  the proprietor fainted and didnt get over it for two months  phew  thats the biggest whopper yet ejaculated giant  nothing like living up to your reputation  the boy who could tell big stories on all occasions took up the rifle and shot three times with care and as a result placed three inner rings to his credit  that isnt bad said shep reed  but snap is the boss rifleman of this crowd  then we must make him the leader of our gun club put in giant what do you say fellows  thats it cried the others  have you fellows got a gun club came from the man who kept the shooting gallery curiously  weve got something of that sort answered the newly declared leader  you see we expect to go out on a hunting tour this fall and so we got together and called ourselves a gun club  the fairview gun club corrected whopper  nothing like giving a title that looks like something as the french count said when he called himself a duke  where is your club going  oh just up in the mountains back of lake cameron answered snap  is the hunting good there  pretty fairso old jed sanborn says  well i wish you luck  you boys are good enough shots to bring down almost anything said the shooting gallery keeper  come on up to our orchard and talk things over said snap as he led the way from the gallery and in a moment more the boys were on the street and making their way to mr dodges apple orchard a quarter of a mile from the center of the town  the other boys knew as well as snap that there were some fine fall pippins in the orchard and like all growing lads each loved a good apple  the town of fairview was not a large one  there was one main street and a side street running to the little depot at which eight trains stopped daily  there were fifteen shops and stores a hotel and three churches  the houses numbered less than a hundred in the town proper although many others were located in the rich farming district close by  fairview was situated on the rocky river which ten miles below flowed into a beautiful sheet of water called lake cameron  the town was noted for its natural beauty and in the summertime not a few tourists stopped there  one of the principal men of the community was mr dodge charleys father  he was rich but preferred to live on his farm instead of moving to the town or the city  he was a school trustee and also held an interest in the summer hotel and in one of the big saw mills on the river  sheppard reed was the only son of a local physician who during the past twenty years had built up a substantial practice in and around fairview  shep and snap as they were always called were close chums and once in a while their own folks would refer to them as the twins  frank dawson had moved to fairview only two years before but had become a general favorite among the boys  he had a habit of exaggerating most woefully and this had gained for him the nickname of whopper  from this it must not be inferred that frank could not tell the truth for when it came to the pinch the lad was as truthful as anybody  his whoppers were always so big that everybody recognized them as such instantly  will caslette always called billy or giant was the son of a french widow lady who had come to fairview on the death of her husband seven years before  the widow had just enough to live on comfortably and she took a great pride in her offspring even though he was so small in stature  but though billy was small he was all there as the other boys said and promised to become a man every inch of him  arriving at the orchard the four boys walked to one of the best of the apple trees and with a stick brought down a dozen of the finest apples  then they selected a warm spot in the sunshine threw themselves on the sward and began to eat and discuss their plans at the same time  its a regular windfall for us that the old schoolhouse is going to be shut up next wednesday said snap  just think of two months of loafing  bless the storm that ripped off part of the roof came from shep  and bless the fact that they cant get it mended right away was wills comment  i dont believe theyll open again until after the holidays  of course they wont said whopper  they cant do it  theyve got to put on a new roof mend the water pipes reset the steps paint the place and do sixteen hundred and one things  the best thing we can do is to make all arrangements for going on our tour bright and early monday morning went on snap  we will have from now on to get ready in  that will be plenty of time  humph  i could get ready in an hour murmured whopper  whats there to do anyway  pick up our guns pack up some grub take along a tent and some fishing tackle and there you are  easy as sliding off a banana peel  is it came from snap  thats all you know about it  in the first place you must remember that this is no outing for a day or two or even a week  we have got to take supplies for at least a month if not two months  and i dont want to live in a tent when it gets good and cold  weve got to build a shack of some sort  there will be a hundred and one things to do before we are ready to start  and it is going to cost something too  how much asked giant anxiously  please dont make the amount too high or i wont be able to stand for my share  well figure it out said snap producing a notebook and a pencil  i suppose when it comes to such things as flour sugar salt coffee and the like we can get them from our homes  but there are other things that we will have to buy  for instance we will need plenty of powder and shot and well want to take medicines and plasters along in case of accidents  i can get those from my father interrupted shep  he has an emergency case that will be just the thing  how about began giant when he stopped short to gaze at a man who was running down the road at top speed  hullo mr harrison he called  where are you going in such a hurry  goin to the fire was the puffedout answer  fire ejaculated all of the boys leaping to their feet  where  down the river  reckon its the barnaby mill and the man went on his way  the boys gazed down the river and saw a thick volume of smoke rolling skyward  men and boys were running toward it from every direction  its the mill as sure as fate cried snap  come on im going to the fire fellows  and away he started  isnt that the mill in which your father owns an interest asked whopper  yes he owns a third share answered snap     chapter ii  the fire at the saw mill   it was indeed the barnaby place that was going up in flames and already the fire had gained much headway  the place was composed of the saw mill proper and half a dozen sheds used for the storage of cut lumber  the plant was valued at thirty thousand dollars so if it was swept away the loss would be a heavy one  the mill was a good half mile from the orchard but the boys were all good runners and covered the distance in a few minutes shep and snap arriving there first and little giant bringing up the rear with a face as red as a beet  a dozen men and boys were on hand besides the mill workers and a bucket brigade had been formed to throw buckets of water taken from the river on the flames  some men were bringing out a line of hose which was presently attached to the engine of the mill itself  i am going to help here cried snap throwing off his coat and he went to work with a will and the other lads did the same the buckets of water came along swiftly but for a long time it looked as if the whole plant was doomed to destruction  the fire was in a shed next to the saw mill itself a place one end of which was used as an office by the mill company  the wind was blowing the sparks directly to the mill proper  phew  but this is hot work cried one of the men  cant stand this much longer  dont give up pleaded the master of the mill  perhaps the wind will change  it certainly was warm work as all of the boys found out  the sparks and brands were dropping over them and once snaps shirt sleeve caught fire while shep had a spark blister his neck and cause him to let out a yell like an indian  in the midst of the excitement mr dodge arrived and a moment later the local fire engine an oldfashioned affair purchased from a neighboring city  the stream of water however did good service and the fire was kept largely to the shed in which it had started  the mill itself caught a dozen times but the flames were extinguished before they did material damage  finally the wind veered around blowing the sparks toward a cleared spot in the woods and then all saw that the worst of the affair was over but men and boys kept at their labors and did not stop until every spark of the conflagration had been extinguished  now it is over i am going down to the river and wash up said snap to shep and they walked to the edge of the stream followed by whopper and giant  i feel dirty from head to foot  your father can be thankful that the mill didnt go said whopper gosh what a blaze  i thought the whole county was going to burn up  i got burnt in about leventeen hundred spots  and i let a bucket of water drop on my foot put in giant say but didnt the edge of the bucket feel nice on my little toe and he limped along to the waters edge  having washed up the boys returned to the scene of the fire they found the mill master tom neefus in earnest conversation with mr dodge  you saw the rascal do it asked snaps father  i certainly did replied tom neefus  i started to catch him but then i came back to put out the blaze  i made up my mind it would be better to stop the fire than catch the man even though he was such a villain  whos a villain father asked shep  the man who started this fire  did a man start it asked the boy while several others drew closer to listen  so mr neefus says  he caught the fellow at the office desk in a corner the fellow had thrown a pile of shavings and saturated it with oil  as he ran away he threw a handful of lighted matches into the shavings and they caught instantly  i suppose he did that so that he could get away  he knew the men around here would try to save the property instead of going after him  exactly charley  he must have been a coldblooded villain to do such a thing for it might have been the means of burning down everything continued mr dodge  what was he doing at the desk mr dodge asked shep  he was evidently looking for money or something of value  did he get anything  nothing so far as mr neefus knows  the safe was locked up i believe  the strongbox mentioned stood in a corner of the office and the fire had swept all around it  it was quite hot but after some more water had been poured over it the master of the mill threw it open  the books are all rightthe fire wasnt hot enough to touch them said tom neefus  i dont thinkha  he stopped short gazing into a small compartment of the safe then his brow contracted  what have you discovered questioned mr dodge quickly  the money is goneand also those papers to that tract of land at spur road  the money  how much money  three hundred and fifty dollars  but i thought you said you had the safe locked went on mr dodge  i did have it locked  he must have opened it and then shut it up again before he went at the desk  the announcement by the master of the mill created something of a sensation and soon all the men and boys in the vicinity gathered to learn the particulars of the robbery  it was learned that the man who had perpetrated the deed was a tall slim individual who limped with his left foot when he ran  he had disappeared into the forest bordering the river and that was the last seen of him  he had red hair and a stubby red moustache  that very evening a reward of one hundred dollars was offered by the mill company for the capture of the thief and men and boys for miles around went on the hunt but without success mr dodge and the other men of the concern were very much worried but could do nothing further  the county authorities appeared to be helpless although the sheriff and two deputies spent two days in trying to get some trace of the criminal  it was as if the earth had opened and swallowed him up  the loss of the money was bad enough but it was learned by snap that this was not the worst of the affair by any means  for a long time the mill company had had a dispute with another lumber concern over the right to cut timber in a locality known as the spur road  the barnaby company had certain papers for this rightgetting them after much trouble  now these papers were gone and the dispute about the spur road tract might be again opened  i wish i had those papers back said mr dodge  if i had them i shouldnt mind the loss of the money so much although three hundred and fifty dollars is not an amount to be sneezed at  can the thief sell the papers to the felps lumber company father asked snap  he might do thatif they were mean enough to buy them  but i rather think the felps folks would be above thatalthough they are very very bitter against us  they cant get any more timber to cut around here and they dont want to move their plant the spur road tract will keep our mill busy for at least three years  the excitement of the mill fire and the search after the thief kept the four boys from speaking of the proposed outing for several days  but as soon as the school closed they met at snaps house to complete their arrangements  it had been no easy matter for the four to obtain permission to leave home on such an extended trip  mr dodge and dr reed were willing enough for they had gone out in a similar fashion when boys and thought it would do their sons good but with franks folks it was different and giants mother shook her head decidedly and only gave in after a long consultation with the doctor who had become her physician  they will be safe enough do not fear said dr reed  boys have to become selfreliant mrs caslette and the time to start is when they are young  after that the widow said no more and so it was settled so far as giant was concerned  then the three boys talked the matter over with whoppers folks and at last they gave in also and then the boys danced a regular wardance in whoppers back yard which made even mrs dawson laugh  well boys will be boys she said  but i do hope they dont run into a bear or shoot themselves  they are all good shots and know how to handle their guns answered mr dawson  they ought to be able to get along  mr dodge told me privately he was going to have old jed sanborn keep an eye on them and sanborn is one of the most reliable hunters and guides in this district  as soon as it was settled the boys began to get their stores ready  it was decided to go down the river as far as lake cameron in a rowboat belonging to the dodges and from there tote their outfit to wherever they decided to camp  if one spot did not suit after stopping there they would move on to some other point  the outfit was no light one when it was all gotten together for clothing each youth had an extra set of underwear and some socks  each carried a pair of shoes and wore boots and also had a coat that would do for both rain and warmth  their stores consisted principally of flour beans bacon coffee sugar salt pepper condensed milk and a few vegetables some fresh and others canned  for cooking purposes they had a nest of pots and pans of the lightest ware obtainable and for eating carried tin plates and tin cups and also knives forks and spoons  each boy wanted to take along his shotgun and in addition they took a rifle belonging to mr dodge and a pistol loaned to them by dr reed  each youth also carried a serviceable pocketknife and a waterproof matchsafe  i think weve got about all we need now said snap after looking at the collection  now all we want is those rubber blankets and the flannel ones and then we shall be about ready to start  will the rowboat hold the load questioned whopper  it seems to me there is about two thousand times too much stuff  the boat has got to hold it came from giant  but what i am thinking of is what a job well have carrying the load after we leave the boat  well if its too heavy we can make two trips instead of one said shep and so it was agreed     chapter iii  down the river   when snap awoke on sunday morning he was very much discouraged for the sky was overcast and by churchtime it was raining steadily  this will make it beastly for a start he grumbled while on his way to church in the family carriage  never mind answered his father  you can start tuesday as well as monday  id rather start on time answered the impatient boy  his mind was so taken up by the proposed outing he could scarcely bring himself to listen to the sermon and what was true of snap was also largely true of the others  by nightfall the rain cleared away and when snap went to bed the moon was shining brightly  the boy could hardly go to sleep and when he slumbered dreamed of being in camp with wolves and bears and deer on all sides of him  then he dreamed that it began to hail louder and louder and he awoke to hear some pebbles being thrown against the windowpane  he sprang up rushed to the window and saw giant standing in the yard fully ready for a start  hullo you  how long are you going to snooze demanded the small youth  ive been ready for an hour  dont you know that this is the allimportant day  i do cried snap  what time is it  halfpast six  i wanted to start by six  were to start at eight oclock answered snap and hurried into his clothing with all possible speed  by seven oclock all of the boys had had a good breakfast and then they bid their folks goodby and hurried down to the river it was a glorious morning as clear as crystal after the rain and with just the faintest breeze blowing  the stores had been packed away on saturday in a boathouse nearby and it was an easy matter to transfer them to the rowboat  the craft was rather crowded with goods and boys but the lads made the best of it  only two could use the oars so they took turns at rowing snap and whopper taking the blades at first with giant in the bow and shep in the stern steering  nearly everybody in the town had heard about the outing and many came to see them off  theyll be back in a week said one big boy with a laugh just wait till they catch a rainy spell  youre only mad because you cant go along ham spink cried snap  bah  i wouldnt go with you retorted ham spink  when i go out ill do it in firstclass style and with an a1 guide  no little twocent trip for me  hamilton spink was the son of a very aristocratic man who had come to fairview a year before  ham as all the boys called him was very much of a dude and always thought himself superior to the regular town boys  he smoked cigarettes and played pool and golf and rode horseback and did as much showing off as he possibly could  as a consequence the majority of the boys detested him  this isnt a twocent trip cried shep  i dont thank you to call it such  ill call it what i please muttered the dudish youth  oh dry off and keep cool came from whopper and he allowed his oar to slip on purpose sending a shower of water over the youth on the dock  hi  hi  stop came angrily as ham backed away  how dare you do such a thing and the dudish boy got out a silk handkerchief and began to wipe the water from his face and high collar  excuse me answered whopper drily  i beg two million pardons ham  you see i was holding the oar this way and i turned it so and iwell i declare there she goes again  and once more poor ham received a shower of water over his rather elegant suit  illill have the constable lock you up spluttered the dudish boy backing away rapidly  this iseroutrageousill ill tell your folks  thats right be a tattletale came from giant and then he began to sing softly  ham in the pan  ham in the pan hams the best of meat  ham in the pan  ham in the pan ham is good and sweet  you stop that roared ham spink and then as a dozen boys on the dock took up the darky song he turned and strode away with his rather short nose tilted high in the air  do you think hell call on our folks about this whispered whopper somewhat anxiously  i shouldnt like to leave under a cloud  oh he hasnt got backbone enough to make trouble answered shep  but shep was mistaken as we shall learn later  the rowboat was now some distance from the dock and with a final wave of the hand the boys began the journey to lake cameron  in a straight line the lake was about ten miles from the town but the river was a winding one so they had a row of over thirteen miles before them  i hope we havent forgotten anything said whopper  it would be a shame to have to go back eh fellows  we are not going back returned giant  if anything has been left behind we will have to get along without it  having left the town behind the boys reached a point on the stream where the trees and bushes were thick on either side  they turned in toward the left bank where the sun was not quite so strong for in spite of the fact that it was fall it promised to be warm  be careful along here cautioned shep  there are some big rocks just under the surface  he had scarcely spoken when there came a terrific bump which almost threw him overboard  whopper was sent sprawling on his side and his oar sent a shower of water over giant  wow came from whopper  say did we strike a fortress or what i thought i was going to the bottom sure  i said to be careful answered shep as the craft sheered off either move out to the middle of the stream or else go slower  no use of moving to the middle of the stream now said giant i want to land a short distance below here  what for asked the others  ill show you when we get there  presently they came to a clearing where there was a cornfield beyond this was a fine apple orchard and looking among the trees they espied some especially fine apples  we may as well take a few along said giant  who owns the orchard questioned whopper  pop lundy answered snap  the meanest farmer in this district  then he wont give us any apples declared whopper  well have to make an appropriation said giant coolly  he owes me some anyway  i once did an errand for him in town and he hardly gave me a thank you for it  if he catches us he will make it warm  well keep our eyes peeled  after a few words more the rowboat was run up under some bushes and all leaped ashore  they made their way through the bushes into the orchard proper and then hurried for the tree that seemed to be bearing the best of the fruit  these apples are certainly all right remarked shep biting into one which was extra juicy  we may as well take all we can carry of them  it was no easy task to get at the apples which were rather high up and one after another the boys got up into the lower branches and then mounted higher  here they stuffed their pockets until it was impossible to carry another one  well boys how much longer be you agoin to stay up there hey  the question came from the foot of the tree and much alarmed the four gazed below to see pop lundy standing there with a stout whip in his hand  i say how much longer be you agoin to stay there went on the mean farmer with a glare at them  oh how do you do mr lundy cried snap as cheerfully as he could  we were just rowing by and we thought wed sample your apples  really neow thet was kind wasnt it said the farmer sarcastically jest come deown and ye can sample this cowhide o mine  thanks but i just as soon stay here came softly from giant  fine work to be cotched at went on pop lundy  stealin a poor mans fruit  come deown an ill tan yer hide well fer ye  he was very angry and now he shook his cowhide whip at them  at that instant quite unintentionally shep let an apple core drop from his hand  pop lundy was looking up when the core hit him plumb in the left eye  yeou villain he cried dancing around  want fer to put my eye eout hey  oh wait till i git my hands on ye ill show ye a thing or two  mr lundy supposing we agree to pay you for the apples questioned snap after an awkward pause  how much demanded the farmer cautiously  he was a good deal of a miser and money was very dear to him  oh a fair price  dont pay him a cent whispered giant  let us all drop and run for it  if we do that he may report the matter at home and make trouble that way went on snap  he cant charge us only a few cents for what we have taken  will ye give me a dollar fer the apples asked pop lundy  a dollar ejaculated whopper  humph  i can get a barrel of these apples for a dollar  no yeou cant  im agoin to git six dollars fer emtheyre the best in these air parts  make it a dollar an ill let ye go  this is a regular holdup muttered shep  offer him twentyfive cents  at that moment came a loud cry from the direction of the farmhouse which was located at the upper end of the orchard  help help simon simon help me came in the voice of a woman     chapter iv  the disappearance of the boat   something is wrong sure exclaimed snap as the cry from the farmhouse was repeated  he looked below and saw that pop lundy was running away in the direction of the cry for assistance  now is our chance to get away cried whopper and dropped to the ground while the others did the same  wait came from snap  that sounds as if somebody was in great trouble  hadnt we better go and see what it means  and get caught by pop lundy queried giant  i dont care put in shep  if i can help a lady i am going to do it  he hurried off in the direction simon lundy had taken and one after another his chums followed  to get to the back door of the farmhouse they had to pass around a chicken house and a pig sty and as they were doing this they saw a burly negro leap a rail fence not far away  what is it jane they heard the farmer cry as he dashed into the house  there was no reply and coming to the door the four boys saw that the farmers wife lay back in a kitchen chair in a dead faint  sumbuddy hez killed her i guess moaned simon lundy  oh where is the villain  she isnt dead only fainted answered shep who had assisted his father on more than one occasion  got some smelling salts in the house  i dunno  ye kin look in the closets  shep and the others did so and soon the son of the physician found something that was beneficial  yet it was several minutes before the lady of the farm came to her senses and opened her eyes  where is he she murmured  take him away  take him away  who are ye atalkin about jane demanded the husband  thetheoh simon is it you  why didnt you come before  couldntcos i had these young whelps up an apple tree  but wot is it all about anyhow  the big negrohe wanted something to eat and then he got saucy and he picked up your watch from the mantelpiece  my watch the miserly farmer sprang to the mantelpiece  its gone sure enough he groaned  i saw the negro cried snap  he jumped that fence out there as we came up  thats right put in whopper  he was running like a house afire too  where did he go  nobody knew but some thought he might have taken to the road finding his wife had not been harmed only badly scared simon lundy ran out to the road and gazed up and down and the boys did the same  i dont see nuthin said pop lundy  let us run down the road a bit fellows suggested shep  will ye come back asked the farmer anxiously  ieri wont say nuthin about them apples  yes well be back answered snap  the boys spent the best part of an hour on the road hunting up and down for some trace of the negro but without success  they knew he was short and stocky and wore a light checked suit but that was all  when they returned to the farmhouse they heard mrs lundys story in detail  she had been on the point of sweeping the sittingroom when the negro had appeared and asked for mr lundy  she had told him her husband was out and then the colored man had wanted something to eat  she had refused to give him anything and then seeing the watch on the mantelpiece he had snatched the timepiece and run  she had screamed for assistance and then fainted from excitement  was the watch a valuable one asked snap  yes it was answered simon lundy  it was gold and given to me by my father years ago  i wouldnt take a hundred dollars fer it nohow  i was mighty careless to leave it on the mantelpiece but i didnt want to carry it around in the orchard when i picked apples  what will you do about it asked shep  i dunno  go tew teown an tell the constable i guess  be yeou goin to town  no we are off on a hunting trip answered giant  and by the way we had better be getting back to the boat he added to his chums  mr lundy well give you a quarter for those apples said shep  all right as ye please said the old farmer  he was so upset over the loss of his watch he could think of nothing else  the boys passed over the moneythat is shep did for he had been appointed treasurer of the expedition  then after a few words more the young hunters hurried back through the orchard to where they had left their rowboat among the bushes  gosh what a mean man was whoppers comment  to take that money after what we did to catch that negro  it isnt likely that hell get his gold watch back said giant that nigger will shake the dust of this locality from his feet as fast as he can  more than likely he belongs in some big city was whoppers comment  that is the way those chaps dogo to a lonely farmhouse and make sure the men are away and then take what they can lay hands on  if he hadnt heard pop lundy and us coming he would most likely have ransacked the house from end to end  they were soon at the river bank and forcing their way through the bushes  then snap looked around in perplexity  isnt this the spot where we left the boat he questioned gravely  i think so answered shep  well i dont see it  dont see it exclaimed whopper who was in the rear  why it must be here  all came out on the edge of the river and gazed up and down the shore in alarm  not a sight of the boat was to be seen anywhere  wonder if she floated off suggested giant  she couldnt answered shep  i tied her up and did it good too  there is the exact spot and he pointed out a stout bush in the dirt of the bank was the mark of the rowboats sharp bow  look there ejaculated whopper  see the size of those footprintsas big as canalboats  do you know what i think he almost shouted  that nigger ran off with our boat came in a chorus from the others  thats it  see there is where he came along the shore  he meant to hide here when he came across the boat  he saw it was well filled with things and jumped in and i suppose he rowed off as fast as he could added whopper bitterly  oh wouldnt i like to catch him  id make mincemeat of him i would  whopper stopped short and all of the boys looked at each other blankly  for some seconds nobody spoke but each was busy with his thoughts  if we cant find the boat began snap  well have to return home and give up the trip finished giant oh i dont want to do that  nor i came from the others  we must find our boat that is all there is to it said snap i dont believe he went up the river consequently he must have gone down  then let us get another boat and follow him  thats the talk  but where to get another boat was a question  snap ran back to the farmhouse and met pop lundy at the door  thought you boys was agoin down the river said the farmer suspiciously  we have learned what became of that nigger  what  he took our boat and ran off with it  well i vow  aint he the pesky rascal though  wot be yeou boys agoin tew do neow  we want to get another boat if possible and follow him  do you know where a boat can be had  yes ike welby has a boat  his farm is the next one down from mine  ill go along  i want to catch him ez much as yeou do  in a few minutes they were off in a body all of the boys accompanying the farmer to the next farm  ike welby was not at home but his wife said they could have the boat and welcome and procured for them two pairs of oars from the barn  i am glad that negro didnt come here she declared  i should have fainted dead away too and he would have gotten everything in the house  i trust you catch the rascal  we be agoin to try mighty hard answered simon lundy  there was a small boathouse at the end of the grounds and here was a good roundbottomed boat built for speed as well as pleasure for in his younger days ike welby had been quite an oarsman and had won more than one race they ran the rowboat into the river and all jumped in  then snap shoved off and all of the boys got at the oars  now then to make things hum said shep  we must try to spot that nigger before he thinks of going ashore     chapter v  another start   the four young hunters were used to rowing together so they made rapid progress when once they had caught the stroke  simon lundy sat in the stern of the craft gazing anxiously ahead  the wuss o it is hes got sech a tarnal good start of us remarked the farmer  he must be a mile away by this time  never mind well catch him before long if he sticks to the river said snap confidently  wisht i had brung a gun along  yes that would have been a good thing was sheps comment and that reminds me he added to his chums all of our weapons were left in the rowboat  yes and the nigger is well supplied with guns and pistols came from whopper  maybe he will try to shoot us full of a million holes when he spots us  oh deary me  dont say thet groaned simon lundy  ii dont want to be shot at not me  he wont dare to shoot said giant  we can pretend that we are all armed you know  on and on sped the rowboat making excellent progress on the smoothflowing river  about a mile was covered and they swept around first one bend and then another  i see a boat ahead roared the farmer  shes gone now he added as the craft shot behind some bushes at a point along the river  the four young oarsmen increased their stroke and soon gained the point  then the boat again came into full view and they could see that it was their own craft and that the colored man was rowing along at a good rate of speed  there he is was the cry  pull boys pull called out snap  they did pull and soon came closer to the craft ahead  then the negro chanced to look back and saw them  he was evidently chagrined and with out delay turned in toward shore close to where the trees grew thick  stop cried shep  stop you rascal  but the negro paid no attention excepting to renew his efforts to reach the river bank  he sent the rowboat in among the bushes with a loud swish and hopped ashore  then the other boat came up  stop roared simon lundy  give me back my watch  dont yo dar to follow me yelled the negro and showed a big horsepistol  if yo do somebody is dun gwine to git shot  dont yelled the farmer and fell flat in the rowboat  the boys were also alarmed and for the moment knew not what to do  in that space of time the negro darted back of some trees and was lost to view  look out boys hell shoot ye sure said simon lundy in a voice full of fear  he has gone announced snap  are all of our things safe asked shep anxiously  well soon find out put in whopper and leaped from one boat into the other  all made a hasty examination and found everything intact  even their weapons had not been touched for which they were exceedingly thankful  he wasnt expecting us explained giant  he thought hed get time later to go through our belongings  and the others concluded that giant had spoken the truth  what to do next was a question  simon lundy said he did not want to follow the negro since the rascal was armed and evidently full of fight  ill go after him if the others will said shep and the upshot of the matter was that the four boys went on a hunt leaving the cowardly farmer to watch the two boats  the boys went deep into the woods and even to the road beyond but saw nothing of the rascal that had disappeared  he will be on his guard now and keep out of sight said whopper ill bet he dont show himself again in two years  make it ten years while you are at it whopper said snap drily  well do you think he will show up  no  but we may see him some day  when the four young hunters returned to the boats they found simon lundy had hidden himself behind some bushes  he came out rather shamefacedly and asked if they had met the negro  yes and he said he was coming to chew you up answered whopper with a wink at his chums  hhe did quaked simon lundy  sasay hadnt we better be agoin  we are not going to bother to look for him any more said snap who was disgusted with the cowardly and miserly farmer  we are going on our way  an what be i agoin tew do  take mr welbys boat back answered snap shortly  you can row cant you  a leetle yes  then goodby to you said shep and leaped into the rowboat containing the camp outfit  hi  dont leave me here alone ejaculated pop lundy in fresh alarm  shove the boat out into the stream  this they did for him and soon he was rowing away from the spot as best he could fearful evidently that the negro would come as whopper had said to chew him up  hes about the limit was snaps comment when simon lundy was out of hearing  how i would love to play ghost on him  hed have a fit and die added shep  the negro had not disarranged the boat in the least so they were soon on their way shep and giant taking the oars  snap leaned back in the stern and stretched himself  tell you what fellows our outing is starting with lots of excitement wonder how it is going to end  perhaps it will end very tamely said whopper who was in the bow munching an apple  well strike several weeks of rain and not get a shot at anything larger than a rabbit  then well all take cold and have to send for a doctor and  say please heave him overboard somebody burst out giant hes just as cheerful as a funeral  we are going to have nothing but sunshine and i am going to shoot two bears four deer seventeen wildcats eighteen  hold on shouted snap  you have gotten into whoppers storybag giant and it wont do  oh i was fooling said whopper  we are going to have a peach of a time  we are going to strike an old lodge in the woodsome an old hermit once lived inand find a big pot of gold under the  bay window near the well just across the corner from the barber shop next to the school broke in shep  say cut out the fairy tales and get to business  does anybody know that it is exactly ten minutes to twelve  codfish and crullers  you dont say so came from whopper  i knew i was getting hollow somewhere  what shall we dogo ashore and cook dinner  might as well came from snap  our times our own remember we havent got to hurry  i know just the spot about quarter of a mile from here said shep  our family once went there for a picnic  theres a good spring of water there and a hollow for a fire and everything  pantry full of dishes and a tablecloth i suppose broke in the irrepressible whopper  i do love a picnic ground where you can pick napkins off the bushes and toothpicks too  the boys pushed the rowboat on its way and soon reached the spot that shep had mentioned and there they tied up at a treeroot sticking out of the river bank  beyond was a cleared space and a semicircle of stones with a pole in two notched posts for a fire and kettle  they soon had a blaze started and whopper filled the kettle at the spring and hung it to boil  this is just a taste of what is to come said snap  at this meal well have our sandwiches cake and some hot coffee  it will be different when we broil our deer meat or something like that and make hot biscuits  and roast our bear steaks put in whopper  just wait till you see the bear i shoot  he means the bear he runs away from said shep and this caused a laugh  as soon as the water was boiling they made coffee and then all sat around to enjoy their first meal in the open  the adventures of the morning had given them all good appetites and they did not stop until the entire allowance had disappeared  no more just now said snap  we must keep something for supper and for breakfast you know  after that we have got to live on regular camp fare  they lolled around for the best part of an hour then arose cleaned up the camp and started on their journey  and now for lake cameron cried shep  may we reach there without further mishaps     chapter vi  a first night in camp   lake cameron was a beautiful sheet of water connected with the river by a narrow but deep creek lined on either side with thick blackberry and elderberry bushes  around the lake the scenery was rather wild and had it been closer to the railroad would have been a great spot for sportsmen  even as it was many came up there to hunt and to fish and the boys were by no means certain that they would have even a small portion of the locality to themselves  i am going to see if i cant get a shot at something on the way said snap as they turned into the creek  there used to be wild turkeys up here so jed sanborn told me  is sanborn out hunting asked the small youth of the crowd  not just now giant  but he said he was coming to see us some time answered snap  snap had his shotgun ready for use and so had one of the other young hunters  the rowboat glided along silently  the sun was just preparing to go down beyond the hills to the westward  wait called snap in a low tone and stood up  those at the oars ceased rowing  the leader of the club took careful aim crack  went the piece  touch anything asked whopper  i did  go ahead and ill pick it up  they rowed on and a minute later snap reached out of the boat and hauled in a fine wild turkey that was still fluttering faintly  a twist of the neck put it out of its misery and the young hunter surveyed his game with satisfaction  first prize goes to snap cried shep  boys we are sure of a turkey dinner tomorrow anyway  they continued on their journey and at length came in sight of lake cameron surrounded by hills and the forest  a moment later whopper reached for his gun took careful aim and fired  only a rabbit he announced  but that is better than nothing  i should say it was answered giant readily  id like to bring down a gamebag full of them  think of the rabbit potpie we could make  here goes for something whispered shep and fired at a squirrel running around on a fallen tree  but the little creature was too nimble for him and got away unharmed  there is no use of my trying to get a shot at anything announced giant  the noise has scared away the rest of the game  as soon as we land i am going to try my hand at fishing  you can do that now replied snap  ill take your oar  there are some flies in yonder little red box and the white box had a few worms in it  ill try a worm and look for a perch or two answered the small lad  he soon had his line out and baited up and began to troll at the end of the boat  in a few minutes he got a bite and pulled up a fairsized perch  a sunfish followed then a sucker and then two more perch  whats the matter with that he asked rather proudly  nothing at all giant answered shep  shall i help  giant agreed and soon shep had brought in another perch  by this time they had come to a suitable landing and the rowboat was turned in and hauled well up on the shelving shore  i fancy this will make a good camping spot for tonight said snap  in the morning we can decide upon what we want to do next  all right said shep  let us start up a campfire and make ourselves to hum as the old folks used to say  any quantity of dry sticks were to be had and they had brought with them both an ax and a hatchet so they soon had the sticks reduced to a proper size for burning  near the shore were a number of bushes and they cut out a spot in the center of these and over the top spread the canvas they had brought with them  for a flooring they gathered some leaves and over this spread a rubber blanket when it came time to go to bed  it was very homelike and cheerful gathering around the campfire and all of the boys took a hand at preparing the supper which consisted of fried fish baked potatoes sandwiches cake and coffee  they took their time over the meal and did not finish until after eight oclock  then they sat around for an hour discussing their plans and telling stories  now the question comes up do we stand guard at night asked snap  oh let us all go to bed answered whopper  i dont believe any cannibals are coming to carry us offor an elephant either  what about a wildcat or a bear asked shep  well if you are afraid you can stay awake answered whopper  there was a moment of silence and then close at hand a hootowl let out an unexpected and exceedingly weird call  whopper gave a jump and so did shep and then all of the young hunters laughed  i am willing to let the guard slide if the others are willing too said snap and so it was decided  they fixed the fire so that it would not go out and then one after another retired to the shelter among the bushes  the moon was shining far above the trees and the center of the lake glistened like a mass of silver  occasionally they heard the hoot of the owl and the faroff bark of a fox but otherwise all was silent  when the boys awoke the sun was shining brightly  shep was the first to rouse up and he slipped outside and looked around the clearing and on to the lake  not a person or a creature was in sight  he stirred up the fire and piled on some wood and then began to wash up  hullo you up already the call came from snap and soon all of the others sprang up and came from the bush shelter  this is fine exclaimed whopper  my but the lake looks grand enough to take a bath in  better try it returned shep drily  but first id advise you to wash your face only  whopper ran to the shore and took a dip  phew  cold as greenlands icy mountain he ejaculated  say if a fellow took a bath in that hed stiffen into a mummy  no swim for me this morning  and after a good wash he fixed up and the others followed his example  all wanted some more perch and they went fishing for their breakfast in true campingout style  a mess was procured in less than half an hour and then they got one of the pans hot while snap made coffee and brought out the last of the bread they had brought along  our next bread or biscuits well have to make ourselves observed the youth  it was so nice to take it easy that the young hunters did not finish their breakfast and clean up again until the middle of the forenoon  during that time they talked matters over once more and decided to row around lake cameron and then make up their minds at what point to locate  once more the outfit was packed on board of the rowboat and they moved along the lake shore slowly taking in the advantages and disadvantages of every spot as they went along  some places seemed too high and rocky and some too low and marshy some too barren and others too overgrown with trees and brushwood  at last the circuit of the lake was finished and then by mutual consent they turned back to a point where there was a sloping sandy shore  the trees grew close to the waters edge north and south of this point but there was a cleared spot and back of this a series of rocks where they discovered a spring of clear cold water  i think this is the best camping spot of the lot said snap anyway it suits me  couldnt be better and i am perfectly satisfied returned shep  count me in on stopping here came from giant  why this is a perfect paradise remarked whopper  a fairyland of beauty and natural resources  i could live here a million years and never weary of gazing at the lake and  looking for something to eat finished shep  no i dont want a million years of this  but i think a few weeks will do very nicely  well if we are going to stay here the question is what sort of a shelter are we going to put up  oh let us build a regular log cabin cried giant  it will be such fun  a log cabin isnt built in a day answered snap  to build a good cabin will take quite some time  but we might build some kind of a shack he added as he saw the small lads face fall there are four small trees almost in a square  we can cut them off and they will do for the cornerposts and another tree in line with two in front will do for a doorpost  hurrah  snap has solved the problem of a cabin shouted whopper i declare snap you want to take out a license as an architect and builder  well go to work tomorrowas soon as weve gotten together something to eat  and in his joy whopper turned a handspring on some dead leaves coming down on his back with a thump  wow  ill not try that again in a hurry he grunted  we can take turns at building said shep  each day two can work on the cabin and two can go hunting or fishing  at the start we neednt to go after anything but small game  thats it said snap  but if any big game comes our way we can bring it down  or make a try at it corrected giant     chapter vii  something about a strange animal   they brought the boat up on the sand and placed their things in the shelter of some bushes and rocks covering everything with the canvas  it was growing late again and there was nothing to do but to try fishing once more and cook the wild turkey  snap used a fly this time and brought up a fine lake trout of which he was justly proud  up the shore shep saw some rabbits and went after them with his shotgun bringing down a pair that promised good eating  how fast the time goes up here exclaimed giant  why it doesnt seem two hours since we got up  that proves that we are enjoying ourselves answered snap  the time wont go quite so fast after we get used to it  well if we get tired of one spot we can move to another said whopper  it promised to be warm and clear that night so they slept out under the trees not far from their campfire  all was very quiet not even a hootowl coming to disturb them  but about four oclock snap awoke with a start and sat bolt upright something had awakened him but he could not tell what  he aroused shep  what is it snap  that is what i want to know shep  what do you mean  something just woke me up  did you notice anything  i did not  the talking aroused the other boys and all stared around them  nothing unusual was to be seen anywhere  snap must have been dreaming grunted whopper  i guess he ate too much supper last night  after a look around the boys went to sleep again and nobody got up until after seven oclock  then giant began to stir around among the stores  well i declare he shouted  come here fellows  what is it asked snap running forward followed by the others  struck a gold mine queried whopper  we had a visitor last night  a visitor cried the others in a chorus  yes  that must have been the noise snap heard  i knew i heard something murmured snap  but what kind of a visitor did we have  a fourlegged one answered giant  he rooted among our stores for something to eat  some animal ejaculated whopper  its a wonder he didnt try to chew us all up  is anything gone  is anything gone  well i rather guess  all the fish for one thing  and the rabbits and turkey  and that crust of bread  and about half of the sugar  the young hunters gazed about in consternation  evidently the visitor had rooted around their stores to his hearts content  do you know what i think it was came from shep  a fox  worse than that  you dont mean a bear do you queried whopper with a shiver and a hasty glance over his shoulder  yes and there he is shouted snap and ran for the trees helterskelter the others came after him whopper pitching headlong in his flight  hi hi save me roared the fallen one  dontdont let the bear chew me up  where is the bear demanded little giant catching up his gun then he looked at snap who was grinning broadly  youre fooling boys it was only a joke  a joke spluttered whopper  dodo you mean to say there is no bear  not here  but there may have been one last night  snap dodge you ought to bebe hung drawn and quartered and tarred and feathered in the bargain said whopper severely its an outrage toto  let it drop whopper  seriously though some wild animal has been here and eaten up part of our stores  the question is could it have been a bear  let us look around for tracks put in giant and got down on his hands and knees  the others began the hunt also and soon they came upon some large tracks leading deep into the woods and up the rocks beyond  it was certainly a bear said snap and now his voice had something of seriousness in it  boys i must say i dont like this  no more do i answered shep  why that bear might have killed us all while we slept  its queer he didnt visit us put in giant  i dont know but what he did said snap  perhaps he woke me up and then ran away  i certainly heard something or felt something  this is enough to give one the creeps was whoppers comment  i dont want to sleep where there are bears to crawl over one  somebody will have to remain on guard after this until we get some sort of a shelter built said shep and so it was agreed  i am going to build a bear trap too said giant  an old hunter from the west was telling me of the kind some indians make  you take some logs and build a sort of raft of them and place it on the ground where the bear is likely to come  you raise one corner of the raft up and fix a couple of sticks under it each fastened to another stick with a strong cord  on the cord you fasten the bait and then on the top of the raft you pile some heavy stones when the bear comes he tries to get at the bait but the only way he can get under the logs and stones is by dropping down on his side  he works his way in pulls on the bait and down come the logs and stones on top of him holding him fast and most likely killing him  thats an idea  well make such a trap sure cried whopper  that day was a busy one for all hands  to do as much work as possible on the shelter only a few hours were spent in hunting and fishing  but their luck was good and long before noon they had a dozen fish to their credit and also half a dozes rabbits a wild turkey three squirrels and some small birds  there that will keep us going for a while declared snap  now let us turn all our attention to the cabin so we can get away from mr bear if necessary  it was no easy matter to chop down the five trees to a height of about eight feet but once this was done cabin building began in earnest and by nightfall they had a rude roof over the posts and had the back logged up to a height of four feet  the next day they went at the task at sunrise finishing the back and putting in the two sides one with a slit of a window over which they nailed some slats so that nothing of size might get through  now this begins to look like something declared shep  i am afraid the front with a door though is going to bother us  well work it somehow answered snap confidently  in a few days the cabin was complete and it must be confessed that the young hunters were quite proud of their work  they made a sort of mud plaster and with this filled up the chinks between the logs and the roof they thatched with bark so as to keep out the rain  the floor they covered with pine boughs piling the boughs high up at the back for a big couch upon which all might rest at night  they also made a splitlog bench and a rude table from which they might eat when the weather drove them indoors but they were not equal to building a chimney and so continued to do their cooking outdoors  it was well that they hurried their cabin for the day after it was completed a heavy and cold rain set in lasting fortyeight hours  fortunately they had a fair supply of fish and game on hand so nobody had to go forth while the elements raged  they built a campfire close to the doorway of the cabinunder a sort of piazza top and there took turns at cooking and made themselves as comfortable as possible  this isnt so pleasant said whopper as he gazed out at the rain  i hope it doesnt last long  well we have got to take the weather as it comes said shep philosophically  we cant expect the sun to shine every day  id like it to rain during the night and be clear in the daytime  want your weather made to order laughed giant  fortunately the boys had brought along several books and games they had agreed that the books should be read only in bad weather and the games played only when they could not go out and now these pastimes came in very handy  they had checkers and dominos and a new card game that was just then all the rage  when night came they turned in early and slept soundly the fear of the bear no longer troubling them     chapter viii  an unwelcome arrival   the second week passed and they spent a quiet sunday in camp they were fortunate in their hunting and brought in large quantities of small game  shep brought down a silvertailed fox of which he was very proud and whopper laid low the biggest rabbit they had yet seen  one day giant and snap went out for partridge and brought in three all of fair size  they had also come across the track of some deer and hoped to get on the trail of big game in the near future  but tuesday morning brought a disagreeable surprise  they were just getting ready for dinner and giant was out in the boat fishing when they heard a noise that was new to them  what do you suppose that is asked whopper  sounds like an automobile approaching answered shep  but of course it cant be that  its a gasolene launch declared snap  there she is now and he pointed to an outlying spur of land around which the craft was puffing  the launch was a craft fully forty feet long and correspondingly broad of beam  she was piled high with an outfit for camping and in the boat were six men two of whom were evidently camp helpers and guides  i believe those men are coming here declared shep as the launch turned in toward them  the boys watched the approach of the gasolene launch with interest it did not take long for the craft to reach a position directly in front of the camp and there the power was turned off and one of the men prepared to leap ashore  hullo ejaculated a man in the stern of the launch gazing ashore at the cabin  what in thunder does this mean  no one answered him and a moment later the bow of the launch scraped the sand and one after another the men leaped out  the boat was tied up and the men approached the young hunters  i say what does this mean demanded the man who had spoken before  he was a burly individual with a heavy black moustache and closecut beard  the look out of his eye was far from a pleasant one  what does what mean returned snap as coolly as he could yet he felt that something was in the wind  this cried the man pointing to the cabin  who built that  we did put in shep  did you sneered the man  and who gave you permission to do it  nobody said whopper  we took permission  what have you got to say about it he added not liking the mans tone  what have i got to say about it ejaculated the bearded man ive got a good deal to say about it seems to me  dont you know this is my private property  no we didnt know that put in snap quickly  are you mr chester  no i am mr andrew felps  oh exclaimed snap but the word meant a good deal  he remembered that the man named was the head of the lumber company with which the barnaby lumber company had had its dispute over the spur road tract  snaps father had had several interviews with mr andrew felps and the feeling engendered was decidedly bitter  you boys have no right on this property went on andrew felps  i thought mr chester owned this tract of land  he did but he has sold out to the felps lumber company of which i am the head  who ar you  my name is charley dodge  humph  come from fairview  yes sir  is it your father who has the interest in the lumber company there  yes sir  at this discovery andrew felps face grew positively resentful  i suppose he sent you up here eh he snarled  no  we got permission to go camping out and picked this place as suiting us  well you knew what was good put in another of the men  did you see us looking around here a couple of weeks ago went on andrew felps  we did not  who are theseother kids with you  thank you but i am not a kid put in shep  my name is sheppard reed and i am the son of dr reed of fairview  this is frank dawson and the boy out in the boat is will caslette  we all belong at fairview  as snapi mean charleysays we came to camp out  we have always understood that this was a free campingout place  folks have come to this lake for years  well they are not coming here any more cried andrew felps  after this those who come will pay for the privilege  the place isnt fenced in said whopper  no but it will be shortly  i am going to have a wire fence put up  seeing there was a dispute going on giant came ashore  whats the trouble he sang out  bad news from home  nobad news right here murmured shep coming towards him  what do you mean  wait and see  i came down here to camp out myself went on andrew felps  i and my friends picked this very spot over two weeks ago  i am going to have a firstclass cabin built here shortly  you boys had no right to cut down the trees  cant we stay here blurted out giant  stay here  not much  youll get out just as fast as you can pack up  at this announcement the hearts of the boys fell instantly  all thought of the labor they had put on the cabin and the surroundings  this is too bad cried whopper  see here mr felps cant we stay if we pay you  no sir was the first answer  andrew felps looked at snap coldly  you can go home and tell your father i sent you  the remark made snap exceedingly angry and for the moment he lost his temper  you are more than mean he cried  we have worked hard to fit up this spot as you can see  but your meanness is nothing but what i should expect from one who would act as you did about that spur road tract of lumber  shut up you imp snarled andrew felps growing red in the face i have my rights as youll soon learn  pack up your duds and get out at once  well you are a gentleman cried shep also growing angry  but ive heard about you beforedown to fairview  well well go  yes and mighty quick too roared andrew felps and rushing forward he kicked at the campfire with his foot and sent one of the fryingpans whirling into the bushes  i wouldnt be so hard on the youngsters andy said one of the men in a low tone  oh i know them sam was andrew felpss answer  that dodges father has been trying to get the best of me for years  do you suppose i am going to give his cub any leeway  not much  some bitter words followed between the boys and the unreasonable timber dealer and then the young hunters began to pack up and put their belongings in the rowboat  oh but wouldnt i like to get square with him muttered whopper as the work went on  maybe well get a chance to square up some day answered shep i think he is more than mean  here leave that cabin alone came from andrew felps as snap began to knock down the front end with the ax  i may as well take it down as you dont want it said the boy  you leave it alone i say  maybe you want to use it sneered the youth  if so who is going to stop me  it was built out of my timber dont forget that smarty  perhaps you want to steal our outfit cried giant who was boiling with suppressed rage  say another word kid and ill throw you into the lake roared andrew felps  he came at giant so threateningly that the small boy had to retreat at last the things were stowed on the rowboat and the four young hunters boarded the craft  dont you dare to come back here cried andrew felps  thank you i like to pick my company returned whopper  what do you mean by that  i like to associate with a gentleman  say that again and ill make it warm for you roared the timber dealer and would have grabbed up a gun from his launch had not one of his companions prevented the move  here you might as well keep this while you are at it cried shep and hurled a dead rabbit ashore  the game was unusually ripe and caught andrew felps directly across the face  the man staggered back stumbled over a log and sat down directly in the midst of the scattered campfire     chapter ix  a night of discomfort   hi help i am burning up  gracious boys look at that burst from snaps lips  he got more than he expected  well i didnt intend to upset him into the fire burst out shep  i hope he doesnt get burnt  by this time andrew felps had rolled out of the blaze  his coat was on fire and so was one leg of his trousers  dive into the lake andy called out one of the men and hurried the unfortunate individual toward the water  there seemed no help for it and the timber dealer rushed into the icy water giving a shiver as he did so and then the danger was over  come we had better get out of here cried whopper in a low voice  hell be as mad as a thousand hornets now and ready to chew us up into mincemeat  all of the boys were at the oars and without delay they began to pull a strong stroke  come back here you young rascals cried one of the men of the party  come back i say  we are not going back declared snap  not much put in shep  id rather jump overboard  it served felps right for being so mean said giant  just look at all our work gone to waste  its enough to make one cry  and such a fine spot as it was too said shep  i doubt if we find another to equal it  it wont do any good if we doon this lake said snap  andrew felps will not let us stay here if he has purchased the propertyas he says he has  i am afraid it is all due to me that we have got to move on he added  that man hates my father worse than poison  it is his natural meanness thats what it is said whopper he is mean enough to get drowned so as to save the expense of a cemetery lot  while talking the boys continued to row steadily and soon a point of land took them out of sight of andrew felps and his party then they rested on their oars and held a consultation  this is certainly something we didnt bargain for was snaps comment  it knocks all of our plans endways as the saying goes  i hope youre not thinking of going home said giant quickly  home cried shep  dont you dare to mention such a thing  no i am not going home boys  but one thing is certain we cant stay at lake cameron  let us try our luck at firefly lake suggested whopper  that isnt as large as this lake but it is certainly a nice sheet of water  and the hunting around there ought to be just as good as around here  the others said they were willing and a little later they made their way out of lake cameron and sent the rowboat along the rocky watercourse in the direction of firefly lake  it was now past noon yet nobody was in the humor for eating  the more i think of andrew felps the madder i get said shep i dont see how a man can be so mean  it wouldnt have hurt him a bit to have let us stay there  i hope he has no luck at hunting grumbled giant  he deserves to go home skunked  he will get some gameor his guides will get it for him said snap  i wonder if it is possible that he has bought up firefly lake too  my gracious thats so ejaculated whopper  no use of going there if he has  hell root us out sooner or later  firefly lake belongs to half a dozen people said giant  why come to think of it one of my uncles had an interest up there  then i reckon well be safe  it was no easy matter to guide the rowboat through the narrow and swiftly flowing river they were now on and the young hunters had to give all their attention to the task  once or twice they struck the rocks rather sharp blows but no damage was done for which they were thankful  one thing is certain said snap when a wider part of the watercourse was gained  that gasolene launch can never follow us to this lake  its too large  yes and the tramp from one lake to the other is not easy added shep  old jed sanborn told me that  wont jed be angry when he learns that felps has bought up lake cameron put in giant  that was one of his favorite hunting and fishing places  they had to go so slow through some portions of the stream that it was nightfall by the time firefly lake was reached  it was clouding up and when the sun went down not a star showed itself  this looks as if we were going to have rain before morning was sheps comment  just our luckto be caught in the open  dont croak said snap  no matter what comes let us make the best of it  it was almost impossible in the fast gathering darkness to distinguish one part of the shore from another and they did not know where to land  seeing a small cove they made for it and pulled the rowboat up among some bushes  then they gathered some firewood started a blaze and set about getting a meal which should be a dinner and supper combined  well i am hungry now and no mistake said whopper  i think i could eat snakes eggs on toast or pickled eels feet  the campfire made things look more cheerful and a hearty meal did much toward restoring good humor  yet the boys felt sore over the way andrew felps had treated them and for this they could not be blamed  tomorrow well have to locate all over again said snap  and if we want to be comfortable well have to put up another cabin but we neednt to make it quite so complete as that other one was  let us look around and see if we cant find some sort of a natural shelter suggested shepsome cave or overhanging rocks or something like that  where the rocks can come down and bury us alive said whopper wouldnt that be charming  whopper youre as soothing as a funeral cried giant  we ought to make you build the next cabin all alone  well i could do that if i had time enough was the dry reply  among the trees the boys found a pretty fair shelter and here made themselves as comfortable as possible  they covered the stores in the boat with the canvas piled the wood on the campfire and then lay down to rest leaving giant to stand guard for the first two hours of the night  when giant called snap to relieve him it was already raining and the wind was rising  the fire had died down and they did not dare to stir it up for fear the wind would carry the sparks into the forest and cause a general conflagration  i guess we are in for it declared snap as he peered around in the darkness  just listen to the wind rising  giant retired leaving the leader of the tour on guard  snap walked around for a bit but then had to seek the shelter of the trees as the rain came down heavily  hullo whats this came from whopper as he sprang up  say i thought somebody was throwing a pail of water over me  the rain had come through the tree branches directly down upon his upturned face  in a few minutes more all of the boys arose as the wind was now sending the rain in all directions  the tree limbs bent low and threatened to break at every instant  phew cried whopper  there goes my cap and he made a dash after the whirling headgear catching it just as it was sailing for the lake  a moment later came a gust of wind that almost lifted them from their feet  the trees of the forest were bent lower than ever and amid the whistling of the tornado came a crack like that of a big pistol  look out for the treetop yelled shep and pulled snap to one side  all jumped into the open and were just in time to escape about ten feet of the top of the tree which sailed through the air and bit the lake surface with a loud splash  then down came half a dozen small branches several with birds nests on them  this is positively the worst storm yet was snaps comment after a perilous half hour had passed  i am wet to the skin  dont say a word groaned whopper  ive got about a barrel of water in my shoes and another barrel down my neck  i am going to see if the stores are safe came from shep and he hurried for the boat followed by snap  they found that the canvas had torn from its fastenings and was flapping wildly in the wind  the rain had soaked almost everything  this is certainly serious said snap as he did his best assisted by the others to pull the canvas into place once more and fasten it tight  we dont want our stores ruined  we can thank mr andrew felps for this experience grumbled shep  i suppose he is snug in our cabin and laughing at us  he must certainly be in the cabin said giant who had followed the others to the boat  they could do nothing to make themselves comfortable and so had to simply grin and bear it which they did with the best grace possible  they were afraid to remain under the trees for fear of getting struck by some falling branch  wonder how long this is going to last came from whopper an hour later  looks to me as if it was going to keep up a long time  there is no telling answered snap  i thinkhark  all listened and heard a strange humming  then the wind began to tear through the forest with fearful violence  it is surely a tornado yelled shep  get down all of you or youll be blown to nowhere     chapter x  giant and the maskalonge   the wind was making such a noise that little more could be said and as the tornado increased all of the boys threw themselves on the ground between a number of low bushes close to the lake shore  the rain was coming down in veritable sheets and the water was running into the lake in hundreds of rivulets  there goes something screamed giant as he caught sight of an object whirling over their heads  looked like a sail  it was the boat canvas answered whopper  maybe the boat will go next  say id just as lief be at home in my own little bed eh  dont mention it replied giant with a sigh  for fully an hour the wind tore around them in a manner that alarmed the young hunters in the extreme  they could do nothing to save either themselves or their stores and wondered what the morning would bring forth  more than one imagined that that was the last of the outing and they would have to return home  but by daybreak the storm let up and the wind gradually died down to nothing but a gentle breeze  at eight oclock the sun broke from under the scattering clouds and then all heaved a long sigh of relief  i never want to put in such a night again said shep  i was afraid every minute was going to be my last  this storm undoubtedly did a great deal of damage said snap i shouldnt wonder ifoh look at the top of yonder tree what is that  its the patch of canvas we had over the stores cried giant the wind took it to the top of the tree  somebody will have a climb to get it again  ill go after it later on said snap  the first thing to do is to build a big fire and get dry otherwise well all catch our deaths of cold  it was no easy matter to find wood dry enough to burn but once a blaze was started they found branches enough to pile on  they shed the majority of their garments and soon the warmth dried each piece much to their satisfaction and comfort  whopper had not been idle and he soon had a pot of hot coffee to which they added some condensed milk and watersoaked sugar  they also got some fish from the lake and the entire morning was devoted to drying out and getting a substantial meal  one comfort remarked shep well not want for firewood while we are here  i shouldnt be surprised if we can pick up quite some dead birds and small animals said snap  you generally can after such a storm as this  after a good meal they felt somewhat better and took a survey of the situation  then they brought out their stores and set them to dry on some stones in front of the campfire  a few articles had been rendered valueless and these they threw away  late in the afternoon shep and giant went fishing while snap and whopper walked for a short distance into the woods  we cant go very far said snap  it is too wet in the shade  i see one bird already said his companion and picked up a fine woodpecker  a thrush and two other birds they could not place followed and then they ran across a fallen tree under which lay two squirrels  this is hunting of a new kind said whopper  poor chaps he went on looking at the squirrels  i suppose that storm ripped your home completely to pieces  wait i see a good shot cried snap a few minutes later and raising his gun took careful aim  the report of the fowlingpiece was followed by a wild fluttering and then two partridges dropped down each seriously wounded  the boys dashed forward caught the game and quickly put them out of their misery  there we have done enough for today said snap but whopper blazed away nevertheless and brought down a rabbit that chanced to be limping across a clearing having had a paw broken by the storm  with their game in their bags the boys started back for the lake front  they were almost to the camping spot when a wild cry of alarm rent the air  help came in giants voice  let go let go came from shep an instant later  i cant i cant answered the smallest of the young hunters  something is wrong cried snap and dashed for the shore followed by his companion  when they came to the clearing they found shep standing up in the rowboat gesticulating wildly  giant was in the water and moving at a fairly rapid pace toward the centre of firefly lake  what does this mean questioned snap  he got some kind of a bite and the fish hauled him overboard answered shep  why dont you let the fish go screamed whopper  ii cant gasped giant  the line is twisted around my wrist  row for him shep called snap  he had scarcely spoken when the fish took another tack dragging poor giant toward the shore some distance above the camp  snap and whopper hurried in the direction and as the little youth managed to get a footing near the beach they ran in up to their ankles and dragged him to safety  then all three began to haul in on the fishing line  i see what it is cried snap  a maskalongeand a whopper too  snap was right and it was no mean task to bring the fish to the shore and even then it flopped around in a manner that scared them a little  the maskalonge was dark gray in color with small black spots and measured all of four feet and a half from head to tail  my but he is a whopper cried shep as he ran the boat ashore and surveyed the haul  no wonder he yanked giant overboard  giant you can be proud of such a haul said snap  i guess hes the kingpin of all the pike in this lake  well i am proud answered giant with a grin  just the same i dont relish being pulled overboard for any fish in the lake he must weigh something eh  fifteen to twenty pounds i guess said snap  its too bad we havent a scales along  weigh him in his own scales said whopper by way of some fun  i wish i could send this fish home to my mother said the small youth  wouldnt it make her eyes stick out though  it certainly would and some other folks would wonder too answered shep  but i dont see how you can do it  besides the maskalonge the boys had caught several pike of fair size so they were assured of enough to eat for several days  the best thing we can do tomorrow is to find a suitable camping spot and build a shelter said snap  we dont want to be caught out in the open again  the canvas at the treetop was secured and that night they slept between some bushes with this over them to keep off the night air  each of the young hunters took his turn at watching but nothing came to disturb them although whopper declared that he heard several foxes not far off  i thought they were going to pay us a visit but when they were about two hundred feet away they took a turn and that was the last i heard of them  on the following morning the young hunters were in the act of embarking in their rowboat for a tour around the shore of firefly lake when shep pointed out a small canoe coming swiftly toward them  in the craft sat a man of middle age with thick hair and a heavy beard  who can it be questioned whopper  perhaps it is one of the felps crowdto warn us away spoke up giant  if it is im rather for giving him a piece of our mind  it is jed sanborn cried shep  he must be out to do a little hunting or fishing on his own account  jed sanborn was a character well known to the people of the district surrounding the lakes  he was a hunter and trapper and had been all his life  he was a bachelor with no known relatives and lived in a little cabin on the mountainside two miles from lake cameron the boys had met him a number of times and knew him to be a good shot and a goodhumored individual  hullo jed where are you bound sang out snap as the hunter drew closer in his canoe  thought id find you up here boys was the answer  have a good time last night  no we had a beastly time answered shep  rained hard didnt it  where are you bound now  we were going to look around the lake thats all  we want to find a good campingout spot  folks down at fairview said you were going to lake cameron  so we were but mr andrew felps came along and drove us away  and after we had built a cabin too put in giant  huh thats just like him responded jed sanborn as he bumped alongside of the rowboat with his canoe he told me i couldnt hunt or fish around that lake either     chapter xi  in a new camp   when did you come from lake cameron asked snap after a pause  came from there right now  then you saw the felps crowd at the cabin we built queried whopper  so you built that shelter  we did  and he drove you off  it was dog mean thats all ive got to say  did he tell you he had bought that land went on snap  yes  oh hes as mean as they make em that feller added jed sanborn  hullo  where under the canopy did you git that big maskalonge he cried catching sight of the fish  giant caught it answered whopper  but he was pulled overboard doing it  and they had to help me land him added the small youth but rather proudly  well well  this beats the dutch  why i never caught such a fish but once in my whole life in these parts although ive hooked em on the st lawrence  its something to be proud of lad  youre as good a fisherman as is to be found anywhere  when did you leave fairview asked shep  the day after you did  i expected to meet you before but i had to go over to sand rock on business and i was delayed  i went up to lake cameron and i almost had a fight with andrew felps  he wanted to take away a mink i had caught in a trap  but i wouldnt give it up  and jed sanborn pointed to where the mink lay in the bottom of his canoe  do you know much about this lake jed asked snap  i think i doive spent plenty of time up here one year an another  where can we find the best camping place  the hunter scratched his head in thought  well  i know of two pretty good spots  maybe you had better see em both an then take your pick  all right well do that came from shep  will you show us the spots now  certainly  i havent got much else to do answered jed sanborn  he did not tell the lads that he had been asked to keep an eye on them fearing the information would not be to their liking  he was not to interfere with any of their movements unless he that they were running into positive danger  in a few minutes more the rowboat and the canoe were on the way up the western shore of firefly lake  it promised to be a perfect day with just sufficient coolness to make it exhilarating  in the trees that lined the lake shore the birds warbled merrily evidently glad that winter was not yet upon them  i reckon its going to be a good sporting season said jed sanborn as they pulled along the lake shore  if so you boys will be right in it as the saying goes  well we are out for all we can get answered snap  it was not long before they came to a spot that looked rather inviting but there was one drawbackthey would have to go quite a distance for spring water  now ill show you another spot which may prove better said the hunter  they turned one end of firefly lake and came up on the other shore suddenly whopper gave a cry  that looks good  so it does answered shep  jed is that the spot you had in mind  it is my lad  is there a spring handy  yes right behind the big rock to the leftthe purest water in these parts so i always thought  they lost no time in going ashore running the rowboat up into a tiny cove where an overhanging rock acted as a dock  there was a small cleared space between the tall trees and to one side grew a clump of trees in something of a semicircle  snap ran forward to investigate  why jed what does this mean  here is a shack already  some other hunters must have been here  i was here last season with two gentlemen from new york explained the hunter  i built that shack fer em  you can use it until you put up something betterthat is if you decide to stay here  let us stay by all means cried shep gazing around  its a beautiful spot  better than the one we had to give up at lake cameron came from giant  how about hunting jed  jest as good around here as tudder lake my boy  a vote was taken and all of the boys decided that they would remain at the spot  this being settled upon they brought their stores ashore and placed them in the shack so that no further rain could get at them  we have lost enough through the rain and that bear said snap and then had to tell jed sanborn all about the mysterious midnight visitor  oh but i wish i had been on handto git a crack at that bear cried the hunter  i aint had a crack at a bear fer some time they are gittin scarce around here  it was time to eat again and they made a splendid dinner of some baked maskalonge jed sanborn showing them how to turn out the fish in a manner that was appetizing to the last degree  shep also made some biscuits which if they were not firstclass were far from what boys usually call sinkers  i hope nobody comes to disturb us here said snap  i think if we are left alone well have the time of our lives  while they ate they discussed the question of putting up another cabin  giant was very eager to go ahead and so was whopperboth loving the work fully as much as they loved hunting and fishing  all right well build a cabin said snap  but first we must get together something to eat as we did before  that afternoon all went out hunting with jed sanborn and he showed them where to find a good supply of rabbits and took them to a hollow among the hills where the partridges were thick  all fired at once and as a consequence they got eight of the game their rabbits numbered sixteen and they also brought down three squirrels  coming back to the camp jed sanborn took a long shot at some wild ducks that were flying overhead and brought down two which he added to their stock  now do a little fishing and youll have enough to eat fer a week he said  before you go away i want you to show us how to set some traps jed said snap  ill do that was the answer and the very next day the old hunter made for them a trap to catch birds another for mink and also a beaver trap  when i come agin ill bring you something to put in the beaver trap said the hunter  its a stuff we call barkstone  the beavers cant resist it nohow  as soon as they smell it they have to walk right into the trap after it  he referred to castoreum a liquid obtained from the beaver or castor itself and having a powerful odor which acts on the animal just as catnip acts on a cat  the weather had now turned off colder and they were glad to huddle close to the campfire at night  before going to bed the hunter told the boys a bear story that all pronounced a rattler  the building of the new cabin began in earnest the next day and jed sanborn told them how it might be put together to the best advantage and even aided in cutting down some of the necessary logs  ive got to go back to town tomorrow he said  but ill come back here before very long  ill bring you anything you want  in that case ill make out a list answered snap and did so with the aid of the others  jed sanborn left the next day at noon and it was some time before they saw him again  and now to get at this cabin in earnest said shep after the departure of the hunter  jed sanborn had shown them how they might pile up some rocks for a rude chimney banking up the lower part outside with dirt and this they finished first  then the top was put on the new structure and the sides one end having a small door and the other an even smaller window  the flooring was of hard dirt with cedar boughs in two corners for couches  in the shack they found a rude bench and a table and these they transferred to the cabin  when they tried their new fireplace they found it worked well the smoke going up the rude chimney without difficulty  now this is something like declared giant as he surveyed the work  even in a storm we can be quite comfortable here  providing the roof doesnt leak declared shep  when it rains we must watch for leaks and try to stop them upwith bark or with the canvas     chapter xii  shep and the hollow tree   for several days after the cabin was finished the boys rested from their labors and took it easy  an unusually warm spell followed the short cold snap and one day at noon all took a dip in the lake  but the water was so cold they remained in only a few minutes and all were glad enough to hurry back into their clothing  a cold bath like that goes a good ways declared shep  if a fellow stayed in too long hed freeze to death  why my back is full of icicles now declared whopper  feels as if i had gotten locked in a refrigerator by mistake  like the tramp they caught at westport last summer came from giant with a laugh  he stole a ride on the cars and got into a refrigerator car by mistake  the car was packed with ice and wasnt opened for fortyeight hours after it started  the poor tramp was about half dead when they got him out  early on the following friday morning shep and snap went out on a hunt leaving whopper and giant to look after the camp and fish if they felt like putting out any lines  it was a bright breezy day and all of the boys were in the best of humor  we may not be back until late said snap as he and shep moved away  so dont worry if you dont see us  all rightwell save you some supper answered whopper  snap and shep had decided to try their luck in the woods to the north of firefly lake taking to an old deer trail that jed sanborn had pointed out to them  they were after any game that might appear but did not look for anything big for the older hunter had informed them that it would be next to impossible to spot any deer until the snow was on the ground  each youth carried his shotgun and his gamebag containing his dinner and also a good supply of ammunition  the boys walked a good half mile before they saw any indications of game  then snap called a halt and pointed to a little clearing looking through some brushwood shep made out half a dozen wild turkeys feeding peacefully  we ought to get at least two of them whispered snap  all ready  yes  then fire when i tell you  they came a little closer and both boys took careful aim  at the word the two shotguns rang out and to the delight of the two young hunters down came three of the wild turkeys  the rest flew away among the trees and were lost to sight immediately  thats a haul cried shep and ran forward  look out screamed snap an instant later  one of em is coming for you  his warning proved true and before snap could retreat the wounded wild turkey had flown directly into his face and was cracking the boy with its strong wings  get away  oh dear sang out poor shep and tried to beat the wounded creature off but the wild turkey was full of fight and renewed the attack with vigor  ill fix him  down with your hands ejaculated snap and rushing in he hit the turkey with the stock of his gun  the creature fell to the ground and before it could arise snap had his foot on it and then the little battle came to an end and soon all three of the wild turkeys were dead  well thats the first i knew a wild turkey would attack a fellow declared snap as he nursed a scratch on his left cheek  phew but he gave me some regular prizefighter blows  wild creatures of all kinds will fight if cornered answered his chum  be thankful that he didnt try to pick out your eyes  yes that is what i was looking out for answered shep  having secured the game they moved onward once more up a small hill and then through the hollow beyond  but though they kept on until noon nothing further worth shooting at presented itself  sitting down in the sun the boys ate their lunch and took a drink from a tiny brook flowing into the lake  then they tramped onward once more for another mile  humph  this sort of hunting doesnt amount to anything grumbled snap  if we hadnt run across those turkeys we should have been skunked  let us go a little further answered shep  here are two trails supposing i take the one over the hill and you the one nearest to the lake  if we dont see anything we can come back here  so it was agreed and a minute later they separated  shep took to rather a rough path and more than once felt that he would have to turn back and give up  but i am not going back till i hit something he told himself and just then a distant shot reached his ears  snap must have spotted something  i must do as well  a hundred feet further on he came to an old and widespreading tree  on the branches he discovered two squirrels of good size without delay he blazed away and when the smoke drifted away saw that both of the creatures were stone dead  they had not dropped to the ground but were caught in two crotches of the tree at a spot well over his head  ill have to climb up to get them he murmured and threw down his gun and his game bag  a limb was handy and he swung himself up into the tree and worked his way toward the trunk where the squirrels lay  the tree was old and partly split in half and the center of the trunk was hollow  just as he reached out to take hold of one of the squirrels his foot slipped and he began to slide down into the hollow  he clutched at the smooth wood but could not stay his progress and like a flash he disappeared from the sunlight into almost utter darkness  unfortunately for the young hunter the tree was hollow to its very roots and he went to the bottom reaching it with a jolt that made his teeth crack together  his hands were above him and he was wedged in so tightly that he could not bring them down  well of all things he murmured when he could catch his breath i am a prisoner now and no mistake  he looked up but a slight twist of the tree cut off the sunlight from overhead although he could see dimly after his eyes became somewhat accustomed to the semigloom  shep waited to get back his breath and then started to feel around for something by which he might raise himself  not a projection of any sort was at hand  how in the world am i to get out of this was the question which he asked himself  he could not answer the riddle and the cold perspiration stood out on his forehead  was it possible that he must remain a prisoner in the tree forever  ive got to get out somehow he told himself desperately  i must get out  again he felt around and tried to raise himself by means of his feet he went up several inches but that was all and a moment later slipped down again  it must be confessed that shep was now thoroughly alarmed and he trembled a little as he thought of the possible outcome of this unlookedfor adventure  perhaps he would have to remain there until he died of hunger and thirst  long afterwards his friends might find his bones  then he thought of crying for help and gave half a dozen shouts but no answer came back for nobody was in that vicinity  again he tried to raise himself and by a mighty effort got up a distance of a foot and a half  but that seemed to be the limit and utterly exhausted he dropped back gasping for breath  its no use he mused dismally  im caught in a regular vise  then he thought of cutting his way out of the tree and after a long struggle managed to get at his jackknife  but cutting in the position he occupied was a slow process and made his hand ache long before he had even a hole through which he might peer  at last he gave up the attempt and stood still not knowing what to do next  he felt that he was as good as buried alive  what was to be the outcome of this perilous adventure     chapter xiii  lost in the woods   snap had fairly good luck while on the hunt  he shot half a dozen rabbits and one of the plumpest partridges he had yet seen  as he moved along he listened for some shots from shep but hearing none concluded that his chum was having no success  its too bad thought snap at length  perhaps i had better go back and get him to come this way  with his game in his bag and over his shoulder he retraced his steps to where he had separated from shep and began to call his chum  not getting any answer he started after the other young hunter  he must have gone back he mused coming to a halt when he was within a hundred feet of the tree in which poor shep was a prisoner and if that is so i may as well go too  he might at least have waited for me  whistling carelessly to himself snap made his way back to the camp he found nobody at hand but presently whopper hove into sight with some fish followed by giant  hullo  thats a nice haul cried whopper  how did shep make out  i dont know  isnt he here  i havent seen him  neither have i put in the smallest of the young hunters  i thought he went out with you  so he did but we separated and i thought he came home as i couldnt find any trace of him  oh i guess hell come along after awhile observed whopper maybe he is trying to bring in an extra lot of game  i didnt hear him doing any shooting answered snap  however he was not much disturbed and the boys sat around the camp for an hour waiting for shep to return  then they prepared dinner and while eating talked about the sports still to come  i tell you i dont much like this said snap at last  i wish shep was back in camp  do you think anything has really happened to him questioned giant quickly  i dont know what to think  let us fire a signal  this suggestion from whopper met with approval and they fired a signal long before agreed upontwo shots in rapid succession  they waited impatiently but no answering shots came back  let us go out and look for him said giant  perhaps he has fallen into a hole and broken a leg or something like that  oh there are lots of things could happen to a fellow out here answered whopper  but i thought we could trust shep to take care of himself  they waited a while longer and then putting the camp in order set out on the hunt for the missing member of the gun club  it was an easy matter to reach the spot where snap and shep had separated  then they took to the trail shep had followed until they came to a bit of a clearing  oh my look there ejaculated giant suddenly  come back of the bushes quick before they see you  having hauled his companions behind the bushes he pointed to a spot beyond one end of the lake  i dont see anything said snap  i do cried whopper  some deer  yes three or four of em cried the little hunter  oh if we could only get at em  i think i understand now came from snap  shep must have gone after those deer  like as notand he didnt answer our signal for fear of scaring them answered giant  the sight of deer filled the three young hunters with enthusiasm and for the moment they gave up the idea of finding shep  snap thought he saw a path leading around the lake end and proposed they go after the game without delay  its our first chance at deer and it may be our last he said even if shep did go after them we may as well do our share toward bringing some of em down  the others were willing enough to go after the deer and away they went pushing through the brushwood and over the rocks in an endeavor to get around the end of the lake which at this locality formed a long vshape each side overhung with trees and bushes  they were making good progress and whopper was in advance when the young hunter let out a cry of alarm  a snake  a rattlesnake  he was right the rattlesnake was there and in order to get out of the way of the reptile they rushed pellmell into the woods until they suddenly found themselves in a swamp over their ankles they kept on until they reached higher ground and then paused in the midst of some tall brushwood  that was certainly a scare gasped giant  i dont want any rattlesnakes in mine  nor i put in whopper  gosh  he was about a hundred feet long and did you see the eyes  regular electric eyes  phew  it takes whopper to tell the plain truth said snap with a grin  but he was bad enough i admit he continued  if he hadnt been i shouldnt have legged it as i did  dont forget that we are out after the deer said giant after the excitement had somewhat died away  what direction is the game anyway  they looked around them and then for the first time noticed that they were surrounded by tall trees which all but shut out the sunlight  then the sun went under a cloud making it quite dark  come on this is the way said whopper and the others followed him without question but they seemed to get deeper and deeper into the forest and at last came to a halt close to the base of a series of big rocks  i think we have missed it said snap gazing around sharply  missed it queried giant  what do you mean  i mean we are not getting around the end of the lake at all  do you think we are lost  at this the leader of the gun club shrugged his shoulders  you can put it that way if you wish giant  oh dear  i dont want to be lost  oh we are not lost put in whopper briskly  come on  do you want to climb over the rocks whopper asked snap  no let us go around them  they attempted to do this only to find themselves caught in a tangle of undergrowth from which it was almost impossible to extricate themselves  then they came out at a point that was all but surrounded by big rocks  it was now so dark they could scarcely see in any direction  we may as well face the truth fellows said snap  we are lost  lost came from both of the others  yes lost  and how we are to get out of the mess i dont know  well this is the worst yet came with a groan from whopper  we start out to find shep and end up by getting lost  if he is back in camp he will have the laugh on us  this means goodby to the deer said giant  but i dont careif only we get back to camp in safety  let us climb a tree and look around suggested snap  this advice was followed but try their best they could not locate their camp although they saw firefly lake at a distance to the south of them  the sun was setting behind a bank of clouds and soon it grew positively black beneath the trees  it must be admitted that the young hunters felt in anything but a cheerful frame of mind  giant suggested that there might be more rattlesnakes at hand and this made all nervous and on constant guard against reptiles  are we going to stay here all night demanded whopper after a spell of silence  i dont see what else we can do answered snap  if we do have to stay i am going to have a fire put in giant and somebody ought to remain on guard  to be sure giant  all of us can take turns at watching and at keeping the fire going  wood was handy and finding something of a cleared space they built a fire and over this cooked the single squirrel giant had brought down shortly after leaving the regular camp  it was not much of a meal but it was all they had and with it they had to be content  even with one on guard it was rather hard for the other two to go to sleep though they were worn out by their long tramping around they slept only by fits and starts and they were glad enough when morning came and they saw the sunlight stealing over the treetops  and now for the camp cried snap  i hope nothing has happened there during our absence     chapter xiv  the boys and the wildcat   oh what a night  what a night  it was shep who uttered the words  the long spell of darkness had at last gone and looking up overhead he could see a bit of sunshine striking the edge of the hollow  in vain he had tried to get out of the tree  every plan had proved unsuccessful and he had been held a prisoner through the long hours which seemed to have no end  he was both hungry and thirsty and had slept only by winks as the saying goes  he no longer dared to think of the future fearing he would go mad was he really to remain there to die of thirst and hunger  was the hollow tree to prove his coffin  a bird fluttered down into the hollow and startled him  he raised his hand softly and tried to catch it but like a flash the bird was gone and he was left as lonely as before  another hour passed and his thirst seemed to grow upon him every minute  then he grew desperate and bracing himself tried with all of his strength to burst the hollow tree asunder  but the effort availed nothing  presently he heard something that caused him to rouse up  it was the sound of a shotgun discharged at a distance  they must be outperhaps they are looking for me he murmured i hope they come here  and he breathed a silent prayer that they might not pass him by in his sore distress  a little later he heard a curious scratching at the top of the hollow  he strained his eyes and saw a bushy tail swishing around  a wild animal he thought  will it come down on top of me  he gave a low call and the animal disappeared  but then after a period of several minutes it came back again and this time looked down into the hollow tree longingly  a wildcat  shep was right it was indeed wildcat that had come to pay him a visit and the beast seemed to be in anything but a good humor as it glared down upon the imprisoned young hunter  would the beast spring down upon him  that was the question shep asked himself  as quickly as he could he raised his hand which contained his jackknife  scat he hissed and alarmed once more the wildcat backed away from the hollow and sat down on a limb of the tree to think matters over  as a matter of fact the hollow tree was one of the wildcats favorite haunts and it did not know what to make of it to find it thus strangely inhabited  in the meantime the three young hunters who had lost themselves in the woods were doing their best to find their way back to camp  they had reached a small opening and whopper raised an unexpected cry  boys look  sheps gun as sure as fate ejaculated snap  and his gamebag added giant  what can this mean  i think began snap and then chanced to glance up into the tree he caught a full view of the wildcat and stopping his talk took quick aim and fired  the wildcat turned over in the air gave a second whirl and then disappeared from view  where did he go to asked giant recovering from his astonishment  fell into the tree answered whopper  hark  they listened and heard a faint cry for help  where is that from  the tree  shep must be in the tree  and the wildcats on top of him  im going to his help exclaimed snap and began to climb up the hollow tree without delay  when he gained the opening he peered down into it  shep  are you there he called out anxiously  yes was the faint answer  is that you snap  yes  is that wildcat alive  i guess not  but he has almost smothered me  how did you get down there  slipped down  get something and help me to get out  i will  poor shep  what a place to be in all night was whoppers comment i wouldnt go through that for two billion dollars  im going to cut a pole with a notch on the end said snap  we can pull him up with that  a number of saplings were handy and snap soon had the pole he desired  then all three of the boys climbed into the tree and lowered the pole  all ready cried snap  yes was the muffled answer from the bottom of the hollow  take care or somebody will slip out of the tree cautioned giant our footing isnt of the best  all three of the young hunters strained on the pole with all their might  at first they could not budge the doctors son but at last they gained a few inches and then the rest was easy  im glad i am out of that gasped shep when he could step on one of the trees branches  i dont know what i should have done had you not happened along  we started to look for you and got lost answered whopper and then told the story  shep was so weak he could scarcely use his feet and they had to help him to get to the ground  he told of his night of horror and of the experience with the wildcat  he was exceedingly thankful that they had shot the animal  we may as well take our time getting back to camp said snap  i shant feel like doing anything else today  i am going to do nothing but rest answered shep  arriving at the camp they were thankful to find everything just as they had left it  a fire was started up and preparations made for a substantial meal  then all took a good wash and ate their fill after which they declared they felt much better  i have learned one lesson said shep  i am going to give hollow trees a wide berth after this  and when i go out after deer i am going to make sure of where i am traveling said whopper  dont catch me getting lost fifteen miles from nowhere again  the wildcat had been brought along and during the afternoon snap skinned the carcass and hung the pelt up to cure  the carcass was thrown away as they did not know what else to do with it  after that several days passed quietly and then came another rain lasting the best part of a night  to their satisfaction the new cabin did not leak at all everything remaining as dry inside as before the downpour  now we have a cabin worth having was snaps comment  i hope that rain just leaked in all over mr andrew felps and his crowd  oh dont mention him cried shep  i hate to even hear the name  after the rain it was considerably colder and they were not slow in putting on some of the heavier underwear they had brought along by the suggestion of snap they also spent one whole day in cutting firewood and piling it up beside the cabin door  there is no telling what we may strike soon said snap  if a heavy fall of snow should arrive it wouldnt be very nice to be caught without a good supply of wood  oh we could go out in the snow and cut some said giant  not if it was real deep put in whopper  id rather have the wood on hand as snap says  the boys had not forgotten about the deer they had seen and one somewhat cloudy morning they started across the lake in the rowboat taking their guns and some provisions along  they headed directly for the spot where the game had been seen and then hunted for the trail  here it is cried shep presently  and it looks to be fresh  you are right answered snap  and that proves that the deer have been here since that heavy rain  now boys if we follow this trail with care we may be able to bring down something worth while  and then they set off to follow the trail little dreaming of the strange adventure in store for them     chapter xv  the cave in the mountain   the opposite shore of the lake was rocky and full of brushwood and it was rather difficult to follow the deer tracks which occasionally led directly across the rocks  once in a while they would miss the trail and then a grand hunt for prints would be instituted until the trail was recovered  they passed over one small hill and then came to a broad hollow fronting something of a mountain  i see some deer cried whopper pointing with his hand  five or six of em  the young hunter was right and all gazed at the game with longing eyes  the deer were more than a third of a mile away on the mountainside  let me see said snap the wind is blowing from the west  so we had better make a semicircle and come up on the other side of the game  if we dont the wind will carry our scent to them and theyll be off like a shot  silently the others followed the directions of their leader and once again they plunged into the brushwood  the way was harder than before and more than once they had to halt not knowing exactly how to proceed  this is dead loads of fun grunted whopper  never had such fun since i was born  its almost as good as chopping wood when the other fellows are playing ball  do you want to go back questioned snap quickly  for you can if you wish you know  humph not much  im going to see the end of it  then dont grumble put in giant  its harder work for me to climb the rocks than you  on they went until they came to another opening  they gazed forward eagerly but to their chagrin the deer had disappeared  now what do you make of that came quickly from shep  they cant be far off said snap cheerfully  perhaps they are just beyond the bushes yonder  up the mountainside they went sometimes abreast and then in indian file  soon they came to a mass of heavy undergrowth  gracious what a tangle this is cried giant  i dont seem to be \able to get through no matter how hard i try  ill help you answered snap and worked his way to the small youths side  say fellows the bottom isnt very safe here exclaimed whopper a second later  its all spongy  let us get out put in shep thinking of his experience in the hollow tree  they tried to turn but before they could make any progress felt the brushwood sinking rapidly  then came a crashing of branches and vines and down slipped all four of the young hunters from the bright light of day into utter darkness  all gave yells for they were thoroughly frightened  they were pitched together in a heap and held tight to one another as they went down first a distance of fifteen or twenty feet and then twice further  we are in water gasped shep when he could speak  the water was up to their ankles but speedily it reached their knees  at last when the downward movement had come to an end the boys drew long breaths and tried to gaze around them  they were in a mass of brushwood and this brushwood seemed to be floating on the water  all was pitch dark around them for they had not come down straight but in something of a zigzag fashion  well of all things came from whopper  are we going down to the center of the earth  it looks like it answered giant with a groan  one thing seems to be certain fellowswe are not meant to get those deer  that looks to be true answered snap  this is about as bad as being down that hollow tree said shep he was more than glad that he was not alone  having recovered their breath a little the young hunters tried to decide upon what would be the best thing to attempt next  we have got to get out that is all there is to it said snap  well i am willing said whopper gravely  see any stairs around asked giant  maybe snap has spotted an elevator said whopper with a grin if so snap press the button by all means  i dont think this is any laughing matter said the leader of the gun club  no more do i answered shep quickly  the sooner we get out of this hole the better  we are moving again ejaculated giant and all felt that he was right  the whole mass of brushwood floated off on something of an underground stream carrying the boys with it  the movement continued for a distance of at least two hundred feet and then the bushes became stationary  as it was still pitch dark around them snap lit a match and set fire to a dry bush  by the light they saw they were in a hollow that was not unlike a cave in the mountain  at their feet ran the stream that had carried them forward disappearing under some overhanging rocks  on all sides were rocks and dirt with here and there a decayed tree root showing that they were not very far under the earths surface  heres an adventure was sheps comment  we must be careful or well bring down that dirt above us and be buried alive  we are about buried alive now said giant  id give a good bit to be out of this hole  stepping from the brushwood the boys made their way to the dirt and rocks beyond  by this time each had a kind of a torch so the place was fairly well lighted  walking back a distance they saw where the smoke curled tothrough the shaft down which they had fallen so unceremoniously  but the top of the shaft was hidden from their view  i dont know how we are going to get up that was sheps comment after looking the ground over  if we try it we may bring all the dirt and rocks down on our heads  just my idea of it answered snap  let us try to find some other way out  they walked back and forth in the cave and then by common consent sat down on some flat rocks to consider the situation  nobody felt like joking for all felt the seriousness of the situation  that water must come to the surface somewhere said snap  but it may be a good distance from here  as they were wet to the knees one after another got down in the stream and examined the rocks  some thought they saw daylight under the water beyond the rocks but nobody was sure  if it wasnt so cold a fellow could take a dive and find out said shep  but i dont want a dive in such water as that and the others agreed with him  it was noontime and whopper suggested that they have something to eat  i am willing said snap  but dont eat too much  there is no telling how long well have to remain down here  so they ate sparingly and washed the meal down with water from the underground stream which was as pure as it was cold  the afternoon was passed in looking around the cave  all they found of interest were the bones of several wild animals  perhaps they fell into this place and couldnt get out again suggested shep gloomily  snap had obtained a long stick and with this he was poking at the ceiling in various spots  he worked with care and the others watched him with interest  there look at that he cried presently  the stick has gone through into something  he withdrew the stick as he concluded and the boys saw a single ray of light shoot down upon them  all sprang to the opening quickly  there is daylight there that is sure cried whopper and his voice had a ring of hope in it  let us dig away a little dirt and see what comes of it  all were willing and they poked at the dirt with care using such sticks as they could find for the purpose  at first the ground came away slowly but soon snap noticed several cracks  look out there he cried  something is coming down  get back  all leaped out of danger and the next moment down came a mass of dirt rocks and brushwood scattering in all directions  the downfall left a hole all of two yards in diameter and they could easily look out on the sky  hurrah cried whopper  this is how the young hunters escape from their underground dungeon cell  the fall of the dirt and rocks had left a mound on the center of the cave floor and by mounting this they were enabled to pull themselves to the earths surface  it is safe to say that never were boys more delighted to get out of a hole  after this i am going to be careful where i step said shep first it was a hollow tree and then this cave  maybe the next time i wont get out at all and he gave a little shiver     chapter xvi  a successful deer hunt   while they were in the cave all thought concerning the deer had been vanished but now they were at liberty once more the four young hunters were just as eager as ever to get a shot at the game  we must hurry if we want to do anything said snap  it is such a gloomy day that it will be dark soon and then the deer will surely give us the slip  on they went up the mountainside but now taking care that they should go into no more caves  thus several hundred feet were covered then of a sudden snap held up his hand  hark  all listened and heard a crashing in the brushwood  like a flash five deer leaped into view rushing across a small opening  they saw the boys and were out of sight again in a twinkling before a gun could be raised at them  why didnt you shoot cried shep to snap  why didnt you  i didnt have my gun ready came from whopper  neither did i added giant  the four young hunters gazed at each other sheepishly enough  their long tramp had been all in vain  were a lot of doughheads grumbled shep  come all the way for those deer and thenoh say lets go back home  i wasnt thinking the deer would come this way said snap  but this proves the truth of jed sanborns words  he told me when i went hunting i must be ready for a shot all the time  there was an awkward silence  the boys were bitterly chagrined  cant we follow them up again asked giant  not tonight answered whopper  they may go several miles before they stop  they got so close to us that they were thoroughly scared my what an opportunity we lost for bagging at least four of them  we better not tell anybody of this experience said whopper  if we do everybody will have the laugh on us  it was growing dark already and they thought the best they could do would be to go down to the lake and row back to camp  during the day they had allowed some small game to pass unmolested and this now added to their discomfiture  i am going to stir up something before i go back declared whopper  so am i added snap  it took the best part of an hour to get back to the lake shore and on the way they discovered several rabbits some squirrels and over a dozen birds of good size  the bringing down of this game served to raise their spirits a bit but they still felt decidedly sore whenever they thought of the deer  it was nightfall when they rowed across the lake and struck the shore in front of their camp  while giant tied up the boat the others hurried to the cabin  hullo somebody has been here exclaimed snap glancing around hastily  his words were true as the others could readily see  all of their stores had been overhauled and some few of them taken away  on the floor lay the broken bowl of a clay pipe and near it some halfburnt tobacco  hullo  anybody around here called out shep and ran outside to gaze around  no answer came back nor did anybody show himself  it was evidently a man and he smoked a clay pipe said snap  couldnt have been jed sanborn asked whopper  he smokes sometimes  no jed wouldnt tumble the stores around in this fashion answered snap  and besides if he came here he would most likely be back now to see us  no this is the work of some stranger  maybe somebody from the felps camp put in giant who had come up  that is possible said snap  let us see just what is missing said shep  they made a careful examination of all the things in the camp  one lad had lost some underwear another a pair of socks and a handkerchief and another a blanket  some provisions were gone also a knife and fork a cup a fryingpan and half a dozen other things  whoever was here evidently fitted himself to camp out observed shep  i wish we could catch him  id give him a piece of my mind  so would i added whopper  all were too tired however to hunt for the interloper and all they did that evening was to get supper and take it easy  when they turned in it was raining but by midnight the stars came out one by one  after this i shall hate to leave the camp all alone for fear somebody will run off with our things remarked snap while at breakfast  just the way i feel about it answered shep  yet we cant watch the things all the time  for several days they remained close to the camp and then received a second visit from jed sanborn  he reported that everything was going on well at fairview and listened to what they had to tell with much interest  yes you must get those deer by all means he said  but about the feller that come here and took your things  he must have been a mean critter an no mistake  jed sanborn was quite willing to go out with them after the deer and the start was made on the following morning  they were soon across firefly lake and then the old hunter showed the boys an easy trail over the hill and up the distant mountain  gracious  this beats going through the bushes cried giant  its a pity we didnt know of this trail before said whopper  it might have saved us from going about steen miles out of our way  well youll know it after this said jed sanborn with a quiet smile  cant learn everything in a day ye know  the woods is like book larninye have got to learn a page at a time  they walked along until nearly noon and then came to something of a clearing  here all took a sharp gaze around and at last saw two deer far over to the eastward  we can walk straight for em said the old hunter  the wind is blowing our way  once more they hurried on this time with hopes beating high  half the distance was covered when jed sanborn halted the boys  look to your guns lads  is every gun ready for use  mine is came from one after another as the examination was made  good  now remember if we come up to the deer and you shoot aim for the one thats in line with youthat is the boy on the left takes the left deer the boy on the right takes the deer on the right a boy in the middle takes one in the middle and so on do you understand that  they all said that they did  very good  now one thing more  dont get scared  shoot quickly but take as good an aim as you possibly can  if the deer is coming toward you let him git putty close before you let drive  having issued these instructions the old hunter moved on once more and the boys followed  each had his weapon ready for use and each advanced with as little noise as possible  the deer were in a little glade cropping the tender grass around a small spring  they were six in number including a fairsized buck who occasionally raised his head as if on guard  but the wind as jed sanborn had said was blowing directly from the deer to the hunters so nothing in the air gave the game the alarm until it was too late  when the old hunter raised his hand the boys knew it was a signal to halt  jed sanborn crouched low and wormed his way to some bushes fringing the glade and the young hunters did the same  it was a thrilling sight and it made the boys tremble in eager anticipation  not a word was spoken for they scarcely dared to breathe  in a minute each hunter had his gun into position giant resting on a rock and whopper in the crotch of a low tree  ill take the buck whispered jed sanborn  ready  yes  then fire  crack went the several firearms in a scattering volley and the buck and one of the others pitched headlong not to rise  another deer was hit in the side but leaped into the bushes and was soon lost to sight  still another went limping off on three legs  after em  finish em up yelled jed sanborn and led in the chase across the glade and into the brushwood beyond  here they caught sight of the limping deer and all of the boys gave it a shot which finished it in short order  three anyway was the old hunters comment  not so bad  you brought down the buck and snap brought down the deer near him said whopper  and all of you brought down the third one said snap  i think as jed says it is not such a bad haul  can we get the others asked giant anxiously  i want to do better than i have  no use of going after em now said the old hunter  they will run too far  some daylisten  they listened and from a distance heard two gun shots followed by several more  somebody else is out said shep  wonder who it can be  he was destined to find out before he was many hours older     chapter xvii  the rival campers   it was no light matter to get the three deer down to the lake shore the old hunter showed the boys how to lash the game to long poles resting the poles on their shoulders as they walked along  i believe ill take the buck to town said jed sanborn  i can get a good price for him there  will you take one of the deer home for us asked snap after consulting with his fellowmembers of the gun club  sure i will lad  we want the meat divided came from shep  give each family its fair share  and so it was arranged and the boys told jed sanborn to tell their folks that all was going well and they were having the time of their lives  after jed sanborn had departed the four boys set to work to cut up the deer they had kept  they nailed the hide up so that it might he preserved and then cut a fine venison steak for supper  now weve got a real camp cried snap enthusiastically  just think of it  deer meat  and he fairly danced a jig for joy  it was certainly a happy gathering and the young hunters voted the venison steak the best meat they had ever eaten  well i declare cried whopper presently as he gazed across the lake  am i mistaken or is that a campfire i see  it certainly is a fire answered snap leaping to his feet  maybe it belongs to those persons we heard shooting after we shot the deer suggested shep  the boys were curious to know what sort of folks could be in that vicinity and after it was talked over snap and whopper entered the rowboat and moved over the lake in the direction of the strange light  i see three persons moving around announced snap as they drew closer  let us remain on the lake until we make sure what sort of people they are  they drew closer with caution and at last made out five young men among them ham spink the fairview dude who was as usual smoking a cigarette  its the whole ham spink crowd muttered snapham and dick bush carl dudder sid foley and sam anderson  i didnt know they were coming up here  ham said something about going hunting answered whopper  dont you know how he stuck up his nose at our way of going out  yes i remember  but i dont see that their camp looks any better than ours does went on snap  see they have a fancy striped tent that looks well but it cant be very warm  they have one of those patent cook stoves snap  they dont use the campfire to cook by  well id just as soon use the regular fire  see they have a washstand and a regular lookingglass went on whopper  nothing like being in style is there  during their conversation the two boys had allowed their craft to float close to shore  now one of the lads in the camp saw the boat and leaped up in alarm  somebody is coming fellows he called out  oh its only snap dodge and whopper dawson drawled ham spink lighting a fresh cigarette  what do you want he asked abruptly  nothing answered snap coldly  then why did you come over  we wanted to find out who was camping here thats all  humph  you are over there aint you went on spink  yes  had any luck hunting  a little  just wait till we get down to business  we are going to bring down everything in sight went on ham spink  he could hardly talk without blowing his own horn as some of the boys put it  were you out for something this afternoon asked whopper curiously  what business is that of yours asked one of the other boys  none at all  yes we were out  we got two fine wild turkeys answered ham spink tomorrow we are going after some deer we saw early this morning  maybe you wont get them ham said snap  why not id like to know  we got three of them this afternoon  three deer came from nearly all of the rival hunters  yes  oh thats a fairytale came from ham spink  you cant make me believe it  it is true said whopper  jed sanborn was along  he took two of the deer to town and we have the other at our camp  humph  think you are some pumpkins i suppose sneered ham spink well let me tell you one thing dont you dare to interfere with our hunting after this  we have as much right to hunt here as you have  we saw those deer first and it was our right to shoot them  then why didnt you shoot  next time we will said one of the other boys  how long are you going to stay here  as long as we please  a few more words passed and then snap and whopper turned their boat around and started back for their own camp  hardly had they done this when something whizzed through the air and landed in the bottom of the boat with a squashing sound  it was a tomato that was overripe and the center splashed over both boys  who threw that cried snap in anger  there was no answer  whoever threw that is too cowardly to own to it went on the leader of the fairview gun club  do you mean to say we are a set of cowards blustered ham spink  yes you are to do such a mean thing as that in the dark  just then another overripe tomato came whizzing over the rowboat had not whopper ducked his head he must have been struck  wait ill give them a dose of shot cried whopper reaching down into the boat as if to take a gun  as a matter of fact the boys had brought no weapons with them  hi hi dont you dare to shoot roared ham spink in terror  dont shoot  dont shoot came from some of the dudes friends  are you going to throw any more things at us demanded whopper  no no  some of the boys on shore were so scared that they ran for the nearest trees and got out of sight  we ought to give them a shot or two said snap seeing the joke of the situation  maybe it will put some common sense into them  dont came once more from three of the boys on shore and they drew further out of sight than ever  you are a set of cowards said snap  now dont you dare to make any more trouble for us  if you do youll surely get into hot water  wellerlet you alone if youll let us alone answered ham spink in a voice that trembled  very well then see that you remember that said snap  a moment later he and whopper rowed away and soon the darkness hid them from the view of the spink party  then the boys on shore drew a sigh of relief  what rowdies declared one boy who was as dudish as spink  i really believe they would have shot us dont you know  very very rude said the youth who had thrown one of the tomatoes  they ought to be locked up for threatening us declared ham spink it is an outrage that we cannot come here for an outing without being bothered by such low creatures  i tell you what we can do piped in one of the crowd  let us go over to their camp some day when they are away and hide all their things on them  yes thats an idea cried several  it will be lots of fun and they wont know who did it  well we want to be certain that nobody is around said ham spink for if they caught us at it they would surely kill us  oh well be careful     chapter xviii  a mixup in camp   after the deer hunt the young hunters were content to take it easy for several days lolling around the camp or going out fishing on the lake or up the river beyond  while fishing one day giant and shep ran into several of the spink crowd and some unpleasant words passed  when the rival campers separated the feeling upon both sides was very bitter  i dont like those chaps at all was sheps comment  i am sorry they came to firefly lake  they make me sick was the way giant expressed himself  and they are such dudes too with their fancy hunting outfits and patent fishing gear  and not one of them can shoot worth a cent said snap  how do you know that  i saw them at the shootinggallery one day  they couldnt make a single bullseye try their best and lots of times they didnt even hit the target  on friday shep came into camp from a walk up the lake and his face showed his excitement  i saw some more deer he cried  come on all of you  its the chance of our lives  this announcement filled the crowd with excitement and soon they were asking all sorts of questions of the doctors son  he had looked across the upper end of the lake and had seen seven or eight deer making their way along one of the mountain trails  well take to the boat and go over said snap  hurry up and get some provisions together  this may keep us out all day  the boys set to work with a will and in twenty minutes were ready for the trip  they kicked out the campfire shut up the cabin and then leaped into the rowboat and took up the oars  i suppose the cabin is safe said snap a little anxiously  safe enough answered shep whose mind was on the deer  the young hunters rowed up the lake with all speed and landing tied their craft fast among the bushes  this will be an allday chase i guess said giant  well what of it returned whopper  our time is our own  i hope we get at least one deer  the young hunters soon passed out of sight of the shore and a moment later another rowboat appeared containing ham spink and his particular crony dick bush  say ham did you hear what they said asked dick bush eagerly  i certainly did dick drawled spink  they expect to be gone all day  exactly  this will give us the chance we have been looking for  by jove thats so  we can go over to their camp and do just as we please and they will never know who did it  not unless they come back sooner than we expect  we can stop them from coming back in a hurry  i dont see how  over yonder is their boat  we can tow that along  when they find the boat gone theyll have to walk around the end of the lake and that will take a long time  so it will  do you think it is safe to take the boat now  we can wait a little while  they waited and at last thinking the coast clear pulled the other craft from the bushes and tied it to the stern of their own boat then they wound up their lines for they had been fishing and lost no time in rowing to their camp where they had left their cronies lolling in the sun smoking cigarettes and playing cards  hullo where did you pick up the boat asked one of the other boys  it belongs to the snap dodge crowd answered ham spink  boys we have got the chance of our lives to get square with that crowd now he added  matters were speedily explained and all of the dudish boys present voted it would be just the thing to go over to the other camp and make a mix of it as they expressed it  no time was lost in getting away from their own camp and it did not take them long to get to the opposite shore of the lake  here they took the second rowboat and hid it under some overhanging bushes  well make it look as if it drifted here said ham spink and this was done a broken line dragging in the water over the bow  arriving at the other camp the dudish boys proceeded to make themselves at home  feeling certain snaps crowd would not return for some time they rekindled the fire and cut themselves some meat and took whatever of the stores they wanted  inside of an hour a good dinner was ready and they sat down to this with gusto  nothing like living on the fat of the land observed ham spink must say their coffee is all right  thats because you made it good and strong said another of the boys  heres a fine can of condensed milk said another helping himself liberally  i found some fine sardines put in still another  and here is a tin of fancy crackers  and some good cheese  say boys they must be living pretty well eh  so the talk ran on while the ham spink crowd ate whatever they desired  as the meal progressed they grew reckless and began to throw things around so that more than a quarter of the stores were literally wasted  after the meal was over the boys set to work to hide what remained of the stores in the brushwood back of the camp  they carried everything out of the cabin even to the blankets and extra clothing some clothing was thrown high into a tree and some shoes were placed under a flat rock  it was not until four in the afternoon that ham spink and his cronies began to think of getting back to their own camp  they were all in rare good humor thinking they had accomplished something wonderfully smart  we must watch for the return of snap dodge and his chums said ham  to be sure put in dick bush  wont their eyes open when they see this  i just guess  finest trick i ever played in my life dont you know drawled one of the dudish boys  the fire was kicked out and they took themselves to their boat  a strong wind was coming up ruffling the surface of firefly lake  wish we didnt have to row in the wind said ham spink  we can take our time said another  they were a lazy idle set and wrangled over the question of who should row the boat  at last it was decided that all should take a turn and they started  the wind was increasing every minute and no sooner were they out on the lake than the full blast caused the waves to dash over the side  hi  i dont like this cried one of the boys in alarm  the boat may go over  well we have got to get back to our camp said ham in dismay  he did not like the roughness himself  to keep the water from coming into the boat they had to row into the wind and this took them some distance away from their camp  even as it was every boy got more or less wet which put them in an ill humor  i didnt calculate on this when i started out grumbled one as he surveyed his fancy outing costume  ill have to have these pressed again before long and he sighed  there was a point of land around which the wind was sweeping at a furious pace and to avoid this spot they decided to tie up their boat in a safe cove and walk to their camp through the woods  its blowing up another storm said one of the boys  i think it will rain tonight and rain hard  wont those other fellows enjoy itif they cant find their things  the things will get wet  humph what do we care grumbled ham spink  maybe theyll make us pay for anything that is spoiled  i shant pay a cent  nor i came from several  the walk through the brushwood and over the rocks was not so pleasant and all of the dudish boys were glad when they at last came in sight of the spot where their own camp was located  its growing awfully dark said one  and just listen to that wind  its a regular gale  the wind was indeed blowing a gale and all of the boys hurried forward faster than ever until they stood in the midst of their camp then with startled eyes they gazed around quickly and a howl of dismay went up  what does this mean  all of our best things are gone  yes and the best of the eating too  somebody has been here while we were away  i see what it means  cried ham spink in a great rage  while we were at the other camp those fellows came here and fixed things up as you see     chapter xix  another hunt after deer   all unconscious of what was taking place during their absence snap and his chums went on their way in the direction in which shep had spotted the deer  having learned a few points from jed sanborn they kept to the trail and made sure that the wind was not blowing from them to the game they hoped to lay low  it was a rough and laborious climb up the mountainside and once they missed the trail and got into a pocket so that they could go no further  then on turning back shep saw two magnificent wild turkeys and was strongly tempted to bring one of them down  if you do youll scare the deer sure said whopper  i know it but if we miss the deer ill be sorry i didnt take this shot  well thats the gamble in hunting put in giant  i saw a rabbit awhile ago i could have had for the asking  having gotten out of the pocket they went on once more and shortly before noon reached a knob of the mountain  from that point they made out nine or ten deer a distance to the north of them  this is certainly a great chance said snap enthusiastically  we dont want to miss it by carelessness  remember what jed sanborn told us  all looked to their firearms and then went forward with scarcely a word  coming to the last fringe of brushwood they got down on their hands and knees and moved on until the game was brought once more into view  the shot offered was certainly a good one and in a few whispered words the young hunters decided what they would do  each was to aim at his own deer and fire as many shots as he pleased  they took their positions and snap asked if they were ready  a dead silence followed  fire  all of the shotguns went off in a volley and then the shots came scatteringly  three of the deer went down dead and one was mortally wounded  a big buck got a glancing shot in the flank and mad with pain and terror turned and leaped in the direction of the young hunters  look out ejaculated shep  he is coming for us  give him another shot yelled giant  my gun is empty  snap took hasty aim but the shot only struck the buck in the side  then the beast came on with lowered antlers as if to pin snap against a tree  at that moment whopper fired hitting the buck in the right foreleg down went the animal but struggled up a moment later and tried to leap into the brushwood where shep was concealed  as he came down over the doctors son the boy was badly frightened and gave the buck a shove with his hand  weak from loss of blood the beast fell over  then shep struck him a blow over the head with the gun stock and giant finished him with a shot at close range in the meantime the other deer that had been mortally wounded was put out of its misery and then the short but sharp contest came to an end  what a haul ejaculated snap as he reloaded his weapon  this is something to make town folks stare  we must send some of the deer home put in whopper  yes yes cried the others  it was with tremendous pride that the four young hunters looked the game over  the deer were young and tender and the buck had a fine head fit for mounting  this haul will open the eyes of the spink crowd remarked whopper  if they werent so mean we might send them some venison said shep  they wouldnt thank you for it broke in giant  they are too hightoned for that sort of thing  with so much game the boys hardly knew what to do  the deer were heavy and it was all two of them cared to do carrying one between them hung from a pole  well we have got to get them to the lake somehow said snap so the sooner we get at the job the better  dont grumble  grumble shouted shep  why i feel like singing  and he broke into a merry whistle  they took the deer down to the lake in three trips  it made them pant to climb over some of the rocks and when the job was done they were all out of breath  have you fellows noticed how the wind is rising remarked giant as he paused to wipe the perspiration from his forehead  yes answered shep  we are surely fixing for a storm  by the way shep came from snap dont you wish you had shot a turkey instead of the deer  dont say turkeys replied the doctors son reproachfully  they had brought the deer close to the spot where the rowboat had been tied up and now whopper went to get the craft  soon he returned in anxiety  didnt we tie up here he questioned  certainly answered giant  the boat is gone  gone came from all of the others  yes  a rush was made for the lake front and they gazed in blank amazement at the spot where the craft had been left  we havent made any mistake have we asked snap slowly  no this is the very spot said whopper  i know it by that tree yonder  whopper is right put in giant  then one of two things has happened  either the boat drifted away  it couldnt drift awayit was too well tied  then somebody took it  perhaps the fellow who visited our camp cried whopper  there was a moment of awkward silence  each youth was wondering what was best to do next  hi you fellows came from nearby stop  they turned to find themselves confronted by dick bush the dude and another of the rival campers named carl dudder  what do you want asked snap shortly  youve been over to our camp havent you blustered dick bush  what makes you think that asked whopper  because you turned everything upside down and ran off with some of our things  we havent been near your camp put in giant  we have been out after these and he pointed to the game  when the dudish youths saw the deer they were astonished  did you kill all those cried carl dudder  we did  today  yes  then you werent near our camp questioned dick bush uneasily  we havent been within a mile of your camp answered snap  we left our boat here this morning and went directly into the mountains we just got backto find our boat gone  well ill be blessed gasped carl dudder and then he gave his companion a peculiar look  do you know anything about our boat bush demanded snap sharply  whyierthat is  dont say anything whispered his companion quickly  whats that asked shep  so you do know eh  what have you done with the boat  ieri didnt say i knew  but you do knowyour actions show it shouted whopper  boys dont let them get away until they tell us where our boat is  snap and the others were quick to act and dick bush and carl dudder were at once surrounded  look hereyouyou let us go said dick bush  his face showed how uncomfortable he felt  tell us where the boat is  ieri dont know  that isnt true said whopper  tell the truth bush unless you want us to duck you in the lake  at the mention of a ducking the dudish boy lost the most of his courage  dont do that he whined  ithat is it was only a joke weerwe took the boat to the other side of the lake  so that we could walk around to our camp eh said snap his eyes showing his anger  it was as dick says only a jokeand we got paid back for it put in carl dudder  how  somebody came to our camp and robbed us  we thought it was your crowd  were you really robbed asked shep  yes some of our best clothing is gone and also some of our stores  well we were not near your camp i can give you my word of honor on that said snap  then some common thief must have come along and done it     chapter xx  in a storm on the lake   snap and his chums were much interested in what the rival campers had to relate and questioned the two dudes closely  they could see that both bush and dudder were unusually ill at ease  well all this doesnt help us any said shep  it is going to storm and i want to get back to camp  trot around that boat or else lend us yours  well have to lend you ours said dick bush  butbut  but what  ieri cant tell you answered bush and turned away  is there anything else wrong asked giant  maybe you were over to our camp  were you asked snap catching carl dudder by the arm  let go  i want you to answer me dudder  i wont answer  then it is true  what did you do at our camp asked shep  go and find out  carl dudder had scarcely spoken when he found himself flat on his back with snap on top of him  in the meantime the other boys caught hold of dick bush  we must get at the bottom of this said snap  something is wrong here that is certain  it wasnt my plan whined dick bush who seemed to be more cowardly than his companion  ii didnt do hardly anything  well you cant blame it on me retorted carl dudder  maybe it was ham spinks plan suggested whopper  it was  and what did you do  hid your stuff on you said dick bush in a low tone  anything else  well weerwe took a little meat and had some dinner while we were over there  after that the two dudish boys confessed what had been done laying the greater part of the blame on the others of their party  snap and his chums were rightly indignant  we ought to duck you in the lake and then have you locked up said snap  it is what you deserve  no no came with a shiver from dick bush  let us off and ill pay my share of the damage done  it isnt a question of money said shep  its your utter meanness  the wind was now blowing so violently that the boys began to grow alarmed and after a brief talk snap and his chums decided to follow bush and dodder to their camp taking their guns with them the deer were hung up in some trees out of the reach of other animals  the coming of snap and his friends to the rival camp produced another stormy scene and for awhile it looked as if there would be an open fight  the young hunters laid down the law good and hard and ham spink and his crowd were much alarmed in consequence  you had no right to touch our things and i could have you arrested for it said snap  now our boat is gone i am going to claim yours until we get ours back  that aint fair cried ham spink  it has got to be fair answered snap stubbornly  most of our stores are gone too growled the dudish youth  that isnt our fault  will youerwill you sell us one of your deer faltered another of the crowd  if you absolutely need it yes otherwise no said shep  yes we need it  we are almost cleaned out of everything  one of you has got to go with us said snap a moment later  what for  to show us where our things are  well tell you where they are said several  they were afraid to cross the lake in such a wind  the secret was revealed and a few minutes later snap and his chums started for the boat which was close at hand  you can have this boat as soon as the wind lets up said giant  and what of the deer  you can take the smallest said snap  but mind dont touch the others or it will be the worse for you he added sternly  it was dark and blowing a full gale when the four young hunters embarked  they realized that the journey to their camp would be a perilous one and wished that the other crowd was more friendly so that they could remain with them all night  but they had not been asked to stay and were too proud to mention it  phew but this is a sockdollager was whoppers comment  blowing about two thousand miles an hour i guess  i hope it doesnt send us to the bottom  dont be so cheerful said shep  boys we have got to do some nice work with the oars or else ship a lot of water he added gazing out on the black and angry lake  well come on said giant  the sooner we get at it the sooner well be on the other side  all took their places at the oars and a few strokes sufficed to send them well out into firefly lake  here they felt the full force of the breeze and in a twinkling sheps cap was blown from his head  my cap  here it is answered snap passing it over  say boys this is a corker sure  can anybody see ahead  i can see a little said whopper  but not a great deal  they rowed on bending low to escape the fury of the wind  the rowboat rocked violently and every time she went down some water came in over the gunwale  let us move down the lake suggested shep  we cant go straight across  we can come up again on the other shoreif the wind will let us  presently they reckoned that they had reached the middle of the lake and here all was very dark  they ceased rowing in order to get their bearings  i am a little twisted said snap  can we be in the vicinity of humpback rock  perhaps we are answered one of the others  again they took up the oars  the wind tore along at a frightful rate of speed and the water was a mass of whitecaps  i think began giant when there came a sudden thump  the rowboat had struck the mass of rocks just mentioned lying near the center of the lake  the craft tipped over and into the lake went the four young hunters with a loud splash  as snap went down he felt shep on top of him  then they clasped hands and came to the surface  not far away was the upturned rowboat  shep are you all right  ii guess so was the chattering reply  oh but its cold  a moment later giant loomed up in the darkness and all three of the boys took hold of the overturned boat  where is whopper asked shep  i dont know answered the smallest of the young hunters  what a happening  we must find whopper cried snap  hello whopper he called as loudly as he could  a distant cry came back  then those on the boat continued to call and soon they made out their chum swimming desperately some yards away  come this way said shep  iicant swim  ive gotaa chill was the despairing answer  hearing this both snap and shep lost not a moment in going to whoppers assistance  he was on the point of going down when they caught hold of him and brought him over to the rowboat  as best they could all four of the young hunters climbed up on the keel of the boat placing whopper between them  its as cold as greenland said whopper  what are we to do  i dont knowdrift i reckon answered snap  the wind will carry us down the lake said giant who appeared to suffer the least of all  but i say boys all of our guns are gone and other things too  well never mind that just now said snap  let us be thankful if we save our lives  what you dont think there is serious danger asked the small youth  doesnt it look like it giant  the wind is coming up again cried shep and just then they felt its full force  with the wind came a dash of rain pelting them mercilessly  truly they were in a position as uncomfortable as it was dangerous     chapter xxi  a camp and a prisoner   slowly the minutes went by  the wind continued to blow strongly and the rain came down as hard as ever  all of the boys were capless and the cold chilled them to the very marrow of their bones  id give all i am worth to be in camp near a big fire came from giant presently  i cant sit up mumuch lonlonger put in whopper weakly  i am like aa lump of ice already  i think we must be getting close to shore said snap as bravely as he could  keep up your courage  he was at the end of the boat and allowed himself to slip down into the lake  hi come back called shep in fresh alarm  i am only going to see how deep it is was the reply  a few minutes later snap announced that he could touch bottom all strained their eyes and thought they could see the shore at a short distance  snap forced the craft in that direction and soon found himself in water but three feet deep  we are all right now boys he called out  come let us pull the boat in  they did so and soon the four young hunters were standing in the sopping wet brushwood on the edge of the lake  they had no idea where they had landed and only a dim notion regarding the location of their camp  i think the best thing we can do said snap is to stay around here somewhere and start a good big campfire  if we try to get back to our camp we may get lost and also take our death of cold the quicker we start a fire the better it will be for us  all right start a fire said whopper  but it is going to be no easy matterwith all the wood so wet  look yonder boys cried giant  am i mistaken or do i see a light  it certainly is a light said shep looking in the direction pointed outa place quite a distance from the lake  maybe some other campers are around  i hope so said snap  perhaps we can get something to eat  all were hungry as well as cold and the idea of a meal appealed to them strongly  snap led the way through the low brushwood in the direction of the campfire which was burning under a series of overhanging rocks  let me see what sort of a place it is first warned snap as they drew closer  we dont want to run into any tramps or worse  nobody appeared to be around the campfire which was burning brightly in spite of the rain and wind  it was a wellsheltered spot and in the rocks was a hollowedout place against which leaned some split logs forming a rude shack  catching up a firebrand snap gazed into the shack  he gave a good look and then came outside and held up his hand for silence  ive made a discovery he whispered excitedly  what asked the others  do you remember that negro who stole pop lundys watch  yes  well he is in there fast asleep  that rascal cried shep  are you sure  look for yourselves  they did so and saw that it was the same colored man beyond the shadow of a doubt  he rested on a couch of pine boughs flat on his back and snoring lustily  he was evidently the only occupant of the camp  look there whispered giant pointing to a tin can that had had some condensed milk in it  that looks like our stuff  look at the clay pipe put in whopper  do you know what i think  he is the rascal who looted our camp  yes and maybe he is the fellow who looted the spink camp too  let us make him a prisoner  all were willing and they looked around for a rope  here is his horsepistol said snap picking it up  i think ill keep it for the present  a rope happened to be handy and with great care they fastened one end around the negros right wrist  then they brought that hand over to the other and tied the two together  with another piece of the rope they tied one ankle fast to the other  the job was just finished when the negro awoke in a lazy sort of way he stared stupidly at the young hunters and then his eyes opened widely and he sat bolt upright  whawhats dis he stammered  whar did yo cum from  stay where you are ordered snap sternly and flourished the horsepistol  dodoan yo shoot me cried the negro  then stay right where you are  if you try to get up this pistol may go off  has yo been afollerin me  never mind  we have found you and you are our prisoner put in shep  huh  does yo tink ise afraid ob foah boys  well do you want to be shot asked snap holding the pistol on a level with the colored mans head  stop screamed the rascal  dont do dat  it might go off  then you keep quiet  what have you done with simon lundys gold watch asked giant  dont know nuffin about any gold watch  yes you do  you took itthere is no use of your denying it came from shep  is dat man around asked the colored rascal suspiciously  are you alone here asked snap ignoring the question  suah i is  say boys yo let me go an ill make it all right wid yo went on the evildoer struck by a sudden idea  what is your name asked whopper  jeff thompson  where do you belong  over to hamilton  what did you do with that gold watch  i aint said dat i had de watch  but we are positive you took it said snap come tell us where it is  i dun hocked it was the low answer  hocked it queried giant  yes pawned it fo six dollahs  where  at levys store in williamsport  where is the ticket asked shep  heah in my pocket  ise a poah man dats wot i am went on jeff thompson  i didnt hab no wuk an i was desprit  so i tuk dat watch  i meant to git it back some day  no doubt said snap sarcastically  give me the ticket he added and stowed the pawnbrokers receipt carefully away in his own clothes  after that jeff thompson confessed that he had visited both the camp of the young hunters and that of ham spinks crowd and taken such things as struck his fancy  he was a shiftless mortal and half intoxicated and did not care much what became of himself  the boys were too cold and hungry to listen just then to his story in detail and threatening to shoot him if he dared to move they piled some more wood on the fire rummaged around through the stores thompson had collected and prepared themselves a hot and welcome meal  the negro watched them for awhile and then turned over and pretended to go to sleep again  maybe he is playing possum whispered shep  well keep our eyes on him answered snap  the boys were glad enough to crouch close to the fire and get dry and warm  they piled on as much wood as possible and drank a large quantity of hot coffee to keep from taking cold  and thus the night wore slowly away  each got a few cat naps but that was all  about three oclock the storm went down and by sunrise the rain and the wind were a thing of the past  the boys were around early and they gave jeff thompson such a breakfast as they thought he needed  the negro begged for his liberty and when he could not get it began to grow abusive  here none of that said snap decidedly  you keep quiet or ill place a gag in your mouth  i aint gwine ter let no foah boys do me up cried the negro  let us gag him cried whopper and began to make a gag of a tree root  but then jeff thompson cooled down and said no more  the young hunters hardly knew what to do and after a consultation it was decided to look for their own rowboat and then take a message to ham spinks crowd  the boat was easily located in the daylight and whopper rowed across the lake and told his story to the rival campers  humph that negro ought to be locked up said ham spink  he took the very best of our stores  well you will have to help take him to town said whopper  well do that too was the answer     chapter xxii  rabbits nuts and a snake   it was arranged that snap and whopper with two of the spink crowd should take jeff thompson and turn him over to the authorities at the same time notifying simon lundy of what they were doing and giving him the pawnticket for the watch  the boat belonging to the spink crowd was righted and the oars were located and this craft was used for the trip  the negro was tightly bound so that it was impossible for him to make any trouble  we are going to do what we can to put the camp in order said shep when the others were ready to leave  and we are going to hunt for our guns too  the trip from firefly lake to lake cameron did not take long and then began the journey to simon lundys farm  they landed at the foot of the orchard  leaving the negro in charge of whopper ham spink and carl dudder snap ran up to the house  is mr lundy in he asked of mrs lundy who answered his summons at the door  simon somebody wants to see you said the woman  whats wanted asked the miserly farmer coming forward  we have caught that thief mr lundy  do tell burst out mrs lundy  did you git my watch back questioned the farmer eagerly  no but here is a pawnticket for it  how much did he pawn it fer  six dollars  i aint goin to pay it not me ejaculated simon lundy  the pawnbroker is got to give it up without any pay  the farmer put on his coat and walked down to the boat with him then he got in and all rowed to fairview as fast as they could  their coming produced something of a sensation as the boys were not expected  the negro was locked up promptly and a constable went off with simon lundy to recover the watch  then snap and whopper went home to remain overnight  the boys passed lightly over the trials through which they had passed fearing that if they told the bare truth they would not be permitted to go away to finish the outing  early in the morning snap and whopper had a plain talk with ham spink  it scared the dudish and overbearing youth and as a consequence he obtained for them some additional stores to take the place of those used or destroyed by the spink crowd  ill make everything right said ham spink  only keep mum and he was as good as his word  in the meantime shep and giant worked with a will to put the camp in order once more and also brought across the lake the deer that had been shot down  it made them exceedingly angry to see how the camp had been treated by ham spink and his cronies  those fellows dont know what a joke is said shep  this is past being funny  waitsnap will make them toe the mark answered the smaller youth  he said he would do it before he left  during the afternoon the two boys took the rowboat and also some lines and a dragnet and rowed over to the vicinity of humpback rock where the tipping over had occurred  you can see how shallow the water is here said shep  we ought to find at least some of our things  here is where the boat went over answered giant and gazing down into the water he added  and there is one of the guns  they hooked the weapon up without a great deal of trouble and soon located another gun and then a gamebag  this encouraged them and they kept at the task until sundown finding all the outfit but one gamebag which shep declared of little value as the strap was broken  this is better luck than i anticipated said giant  now we must clean the guns without delay  the entire evening was spent in overhauling and oiling the guns and in drying out the gamebags  they also dressed one of the deer hanging up the meat as before  the spink crowd had taken the smallest of the game and for this they were to pay regular market prices  when snap and the others got back they brought with them a whole boatload of provisions and other things and were followed by jed sanborn in his canoe  the hunter had agreed to take the deer to fairview for them  he was joyful to think they had had such luck  dont need me to show ye how to bring down deer he observed with a grin on his homely face  you have done prime boys prime an im proud of ye  a portion of the provisions was left at the camp and then ham spink and his crony crossed the lake while jed sanborn remained with snap and the others  had to buy a deer from ye did they chuckled jed sanborn when spink and dudder were out of hearing  they wont never make no hunters not if they try a hundred years  id starve to death afore id buy meat here with the woods so full o things to shoot  i laid down the law good and hard said snap  i dont think they will give us any more trouble  i think dudder is rather ashamed of himself said whopper  but ham spink is so thickskinned it doesnt strike through  what did they do to the negro asked giant  locked him up for trial  did pop lundy get his watch back asked shep  yes after a little trouble  the pawnbroker was awfully mad  he wants to send the colored fellow to jail too  snap and whopper were glad to learn that the outfit had been recovered and they had jed sanborn look at the guns to make certain that all were fit to use  didnt hurt em a mite said the old hunter  but they couldnt have stayed in the water much longer  it was lucky the boat went over where the water was shallow said giant  had the water been deep perhaps we shouldnt have gotten back a thing  after the old hunter had departed with the deer the boys set to work in earnest to fix up their camp once more  some of the things had been spoiled by the heavy storm but ham spink had made good as snap said so nothing was really lost so far as the young hunters were concerned  after several days of rest the boys felt once more in proper trim for sport and went out after a bunch of rabbits and squirrels they were fairly lucky and three oclock of the afternoon found them on the return to the camp  let us look for some nuts suggested whopper  the others were willing and made their way to a group of trees growing some distance up the lake shore  nuts were to be had in plenty and soon they had their pockets and the corners of their gamebags well filled  i see another tree with some extra large nuts cried shep come on  he led the way to the tree in question which grew on a bit of land projecting far out into the lake  they soon had some of the big nuts and were about to return whence they had come when snap uttered a cry  a snake  where came from the others  thereunder the tree roots  snap was right a big snake was close at hand under some tree roots over which they had just stepped  i dont want anything to do with a snake gasped giant  let us get out of here  then all of the young hunters gazed at each other in dismay  the snake was directly in their path to the shore proper  it was a water reptile and all of five or six feet long  as they approached it raised its head and gave a curious hissing sound  all of the boys crowded back  only whopper had his gun the other weapons having been left at the foot of the other nut trees  the snake certainly looked ugly  evidently it did not like having its domain invaded  ill give it a shot cried whopper and raised the shotgun carefully but just as he was on the point of firing the reptile disappeared  where is he  he went under the tree roots  maybe he took to the water  the four young hunters gazed anxiously  then of a sudden they saw the snake again  it came up through the tree roots almost at their feet hissing more viciously than ever     chapter xxiii  after mountain brook mink   shoot him whopper  such was the exclamation from all of the others and in haste the lad named took hasty aim and pulled the trigger  the shot was a poor one the charge merely tearing across the side of the water snake  with another hiss it whipped around and in a twinkling had itself curled around whoppers left leg  hi take him off  take him off screamed the young hunter in terror  dont let him bite me  snap sprang forward  his one idea was to save his chum and he did not think of his own peril  beware cautioned giant  watching his chance snap put his foot on the tail of the water snake  the reptile whipped around wildly and wound itself about the lower limbs of both boys  ill get a gun yelled shep and made a dash for the nearest of the firearms  dont shoot us called out whopper  catching up a weapon shep came up close and let drive almost in the face of the water snake  it was a telling shot and the reptile whipped wildly this way and that  then it fell into the water and was quickly lost to sight  isis he gone gasped whopper  yes answered giant  shep finished him  that was no joke said snap when he could speak  he was trembling from head to foot  a joke  well i reckon not spluttered whopper  ugh  it makes me shiver to think about it  let us get out of here came from snap  remember where there is one snake there may be more  then i am going to quit right now cried shep and lost no time in leaving the neighborhood followed by the others  the boys concluded that they had had adventures enough for one day and went back to camp  here two of the lads set to work to make a rabbit potpie with dumplings  they had seen such things made at home and went at the task with care  when the potpie was served all declared it the best ever  perhaps the dumplings were a trifle heavy but what of that  living in the open air had sharpened their appetites wonderfully and nobody was disposed to quarrel over the meal  the next day was rather cold and misty and they kept in or near the cabin  snap had brought some extra sugar and also some chocolate along and the morning was devoted to candymaking some with nuts and some without  the candy was very good and while they ate a fair share the rest was put away to be eaten a little at a time  so far since leaving their first camp they had not seen or heard of andrew felps but that afternoon an old hunter strolled into their locality and asked if they could furnish him with a meal and a shakedown until morning offering three rabbits in payment  i think we can accommodate you said snap  and you can keep your rabbits  the face of the old hunter looked familiar and while he was eating it came out that his name was jack dalton and that he had been one of the two guides who had come up to lake cameron with the felps party  i got sick of working for that crowd said jack dalton  they wanted to make a regular nigger of me and i up and told felps i wouldnt stand for it  is the other guide with them asked shep  humph dad begow aint no reglar guidehes only a camp followerdishwasher an like that  he pertends to be a guide but he aint no good at shootin  yes hes with em but he only stayed because they raised his wages  they wanted to raise mine when they saw i was really goin but i told em money wasnt everything  i dont wonder that you got sick of andrew felps put in giant you know how he treated is  it was dirt mean lad an i about told him so too  but the felpses always was a hard crowd to deal with  he thought he was gettin one in on mr dodge when he fired you out  i thought as much said snap  he is very bitter against my father  it is because of the lumber businesshe wanted the tract of lumber to cut that the barnaby company got hold of went on jack dalton  how are you amakin it  fine said snap and then he and his chums told of all the game that had been brought downthey having kept a record in a little book the leader of the gun club carried  thats firstclass boys said the guide  couldnt be better now all they got were two wild turkeys some rabbits and one small deer  i led em to a fine herd o deer but they wanted to do the shootin all alone  when it came time to let drive felps and one o the other men got buck fever and shot wild and most of the deer got away  that was one thing made me sick  they cant shoot fer sour apples  and theyll blame their ill luck on you when they get home said whopper  moren likely  but i dont care fer thet  folks in these parts know what jack dalton kin do  jest you ask jed sanborn about it  yes sanborn has spoken about you answered snap  he said you had brought down some of the biggest deer and bears in these parts  exactly so boy although i dont want to blow about it  tootin yer own horn aint perlite  but i aint afraid o what sech a feller as andy felps says  that night jack dalton told them the story of a bear hunt which was more than ordinarily interesting  he said that bears were by no means plentiful in the lake region and yet there were a few around some of pretty fair size  youll run across one when ye least expect it said the old hunter  when that happens take your time an shoot to kill  if ye dont mr bear may come up an hug you to death jess fer the fun o it  i am going to set a bear trap said one of the boys and told of the plan which was approved by jack dalton  before leaving the next morning the old hunter told them where he thought they could bring down a mink or two and after his departure they set off to see what luck they might have  the weather was now getting colder and there was a promise of snow in the air  yet about ten oclock the sun broke through the clouds and then it grew a bit warmer  a little snow will make hunting very fine declared snap as they trudged along  as it is now it is next to impossible to track any big game  the spot jack dalton had mentioned was nearly two miles from their camp along a rocky watercourse flowing into a small lake between lake cameron and firefly lake  here among the rocks was a favorite haunt of the mountain brook mink as they are popularly called  as they neared the locality the young hunters looked to their weapons and then advanced with caution  the water gurgling over the rocks drowned the sounds of their advance and so they came upon the mink without being discovered  two of the animals were in sight one on either side of the small stream  as all wanted the honor of bringing down the mink shep and snap fired at one and whopper and giant at the other  the aim of the boy hunters was true and the game dropped down where they stood  fine mink these declared snap after an examination  just look at the heavy fur  you are right answered whopper  but the fur will he thicker yet later in the season  with the mink in their gamebags they pushed on up the tiny watercourse and not long after roused up some partridge the game going up with a rush that at first scared them  but they shot as quickly as they could and each had a partridge to his credit  this day is opening finely declared whopper  we are bound to get about a hundred birds and animals ill wager  thats right pile it on answered shep with a grin  i thought you had been keeping down lately  oh a hundred is nothing said whopper airily  maybe ill get that many myself  i once heard of a man who shot two hundred wild turkeys in a day  i dont call that sport put in giant  i call that butchery  so do i answered snap  even as it is i sometimes think we are shooting too much  well if we dont bring the game down somebody else will said whopper  some day theyll have to pass some more laws protecting game was sheps comment  if they dont there wont be anything to shoot inside of the next fifteen or twenty years  my father said that some folks were advocating a law to stop all deershooting for two years or longer said shep  that would give them a chance to multiply  well i am going to shoot what i cannow i am out here said whopper     chapter xxiv  ham spink and the skunk   but the boys streak of luck came to an end as quickly as it began try their best they could locate no more large game and had to content themselves with a squirrel and a few fairsized birds  i am getting tired of this remarked shep after they had tramped across several hills  let us call it off and get back to camp  the others were willing and they turned their footsteps in the direction of the cabin  half of the distance was covered when snap stopped his companions  look over on yonder hill he said  isnt that ham spinks crowd  it is and there is ham in advance answered whopper  let us go over and see what they have got put in giant curiously  the curiosity of the others was also excited and they turned in the direction snap had pointed out and soon came up to one of the rival hunters  hullo cried snap goodnaturedly  how are you getting along  the boy addressed was dick bush and he answered with a scowl  shot any deer lately asked whopper  no was the surly response  got anything at all asked giant  one rabbit  have you anything went on dick bush also curious  oh a few things was snaps careless answer and he winked at his chums  we have some birds and a squirrel said whopper  oh we didnt shoot any birds put in ham spink coming up aint that fine and he held up a mediumsized rabbit  by this time the whole crowd had surrounded our friends  all the rival campers had were two rabbits and a small woodchuck that was of no account  how do you like these said snap and showed up the mink and the rest of the game  at the sight of the game ham spinks eyes opened widely and the others from the rival camp showed their astonishment  where did you get all that game asked the leader of the other camp  shot it  not today  yes today answered giant proudly  then somebody must have helped you said am spink enviously maybe jed sanborn is around  no we brought this game down alone  where did you get the mink  up that little brook you see yonder  i didnt know there was any mink around here came from carl dudder guess ill look for some myself  well i wish you luck said snap pleasantly  yes you wish us a pile of luck burst out ham spink  i rather guess you wish we wouldnt bring down a thing  no i am not so mean ham  there is enough for all in these woods  bah dont tell me snorted the dudish youth and stalked off followed by two of his cronies  ham spink was dressed in as fine a hunting outfit as he could procure and his shotgun was an expensive nickelplated affairthe kind of a gun some old hunters who know will not have for a gift  ham spink had just caught sight of a small animal hidden in the long grass of a glade but a short distance away  i am going to bring it down whatever it is he cried to dick bush  keep back  hams found something to shoot at cried one of the other boys  they all held back to give their leader a chance to show his ability snap and his chums watched curiously  i dont see anything began giant and then he burst into a laugh  its a skunk  a skunk repeated shep  if thats so ham had better give it a wide berth  it was indeed a skunk dark in color and with a bushy tail  as it moved along in the grass it looked somewhat like a large black cat  excited ham spink ran close took hasty aim and let fire  the skunk was hit but not badly wounded  it swished around and an instant later the dudish young hunter received a stream of liquid over his cheek and shoulder that almost paralyzed him  oh oh take it away screamed poor ham  oh dear me  phw what a stench gasped dick bush falling back a step or two  thats a skunk yelled giant  get out of the wayunless you want your clothing ruined  the offensive odor was now so powerful in that vicinity that nearly all of the young hunters fell hack to another position some distance away  in the meantime the skunk ran for the bushes and disappeared from view  oh dear  oh this isis fearful gasped ham spink putting his thumb and forefinger to his nose  whawhat am i to do  ham has caught it and no mistake whispered snap  hell be as sweet as a bag of bone fertilizer after this was sheps comment  youll be able to smell him ten miles off vouchsafed whopper youll recognize him in the dark with your eyes closed  hi you  dont you make fun of me bawled the dudish youth turning wrathfully on our friends  i hope the shooting was good ham said snap drily  dont be afraid to bury yourself ham if you feel like it added shep  iill bury you stormed the unfortunate youth  oh what a mess he groaned  dick what shall i do  i dont know was the answer  only please keep away from me theerthe odor makes me sick really it does  huh im sick myself  i didnt know it was a skunk  why didnt somebody warn me  take off your clothes and bury them suggested giant  that sometimes takes the smell away  oh hang the clothes  ill burn them up growled ham  what shall i do for myself  wash yourself with carbolic soap suggested shep  i havent any  then take a mud bath came from whopper  after that use common soap and youll be rid of the worst of it  i suppose you think youve got the laugh on me grunted ham spink he was about as angry and helpless as he could be  oh we are weeping for you ham said shep  come on fellows and he started off and soon his friends followed him  oh but he does smell prime said whopper when they were out of bearing  hed down a cologne factory in one round  it is certainly awful answered snap  it was too bad to spoil that nice suit of clothes  i am thankful that we didnt meet the skunk came from giant  i remember meeting a skunk years agowhen i was a little boy said shep  i thought it was a cat and wanted to pick it up i think the skunk was getting ready for me when our dog came along and scared the thing away  ham spink was indeed in a sorry plight  the smell was so bad that none of his friends wanted to go near him and they begged him to keep his distance  in anger he stalked back to his camp and there took off the almost ruined suit and buried it in the ground for fortyeight hours which removed the worst of the odor following the advice given he washed himself in a mud paste allowing the mud to dry on him at the heat of the fire  later he washed the mud off and used some heavily scented toilet soap and thus removed the worst of the odor from his person  but it was a good week before he felt as clean as he had previous to the encounter with the obnoxious animal     chapter xxv  surrounded by wolves   from jack dalton the boys had heard of a beautiful silver deer said to be roaming the woods on the hills back of firefly lake and whopper and giant talked a great deal of going after the game and seeing if they could not lay the deer low  i know we can do it if only we can spot the animal said giant and think what a feather it will be in our cap  i am going after that deer even if the others wont go added whopper and so it was finally decided that whopper and the small youth should go in quest of the silver deer while snap and shep remained at the camp to try their hands at erecting a trap for beavers and also some traps for birds  it may be added that deep in the woods they had erected a bearfall and baited the same but so far no bear had shown himself in that vicinity although the wolves had stolen the bait on two occasions  in order to be prepared for big game whopper and giant took along one shotgun and the rifle and also a huntingknife  one gamebag was filled with provisions for they did not know how long the outing would last  the boys started off in the best of spirits taking to a trail the old hunter had pointed out to them  there had been a flurry of snow during the night but this was soon melted by the sun which at breakfast time had come out as brightly as ever  what a beautiful spot this is said giant gazing back to the lake before plunging into the woods  it is strange that so few folks come up here to camp  well its lucky for us answered whopper  we shouldnt care for manyespecially of the andrew felps kind  oh dont mention him whopper  it makes me angry to think of him and i dont want my days fun spoiled  soon the vicinity of the lake was left behind and then the boys began to climb the first rise of ground  fortunately the trail was good and they made rapid progress  arriving at the top of the hill they gazed around eagerly  nothing in sight so far said whopper after a long pause  well the day is young yet was the hopeful answer  again they went on and this time scared up several rabbits and also several animals they could not name so quickly did they disappear again  the boys did not fire however being determined to do nothing to scare the deer away should the game be within hearing  when about noon they came to a clear spring of water they were glad enough to sit down and rest and partake of their noonday lunch washing it down with copious draughts of water  folks can say what they please remarked whopper smacking his lips when one is good and dry nothing is so satisfying as a drink of plain clear water  youre right there whopper  how some men can prefer liquor is beyond my comprehension  they dont know what is good for them thats why giant  the boys looked around the spring with care and made out several tracks which they thought might belong to a deer  these led along the trail they were following and once more the boy hunters moved on refreshed by the rest and the lunch and cheered by the hope that they might soon get a glimpse of the game they were after  less than a quarter of a mile further on they found that the trail came to an abrupt end in something of a glade at the foot of another hill  there had been a landslide during the summer and this had obliterated the path  heres a go cried whopper gazing around in perplexity  i suppose old jack dalton didnt know about this landslide  we must be carefulif we go on whopper  that land may give way  we dont want to get underground again  not much  once was enough  they walked along the hill and at last came to something that looked a little like a trail  then they went forward once more covering a good mile  the vicinity was full of rocks and they had to pick their way with care for fear of tumbling down into a crevice or twisting an ankle  this is growing worse whopper said giant coming to a halt for breath  i had no idea it was so rough had you  no  one thing is certainwe are not on the trail  just what i was thinking  we are getting deeper and deeper into this mess  well have to turn back  and without that deer  thats too bad  we may see the deer elsewhere  they walked on a hundred feet further reaching an opening surrounded by rocks on every side  here was a tall tree with branches hanging low to the ground  im going up into the tree and look around said whopper  he hung his rifle on one of the limbs and began the ascent  giant did likewise and soon the pair were close to the top of the tree  by parting the topmost branches they got a fairly good look of the country for a long distance on every side  they could see the waters of lake cameron shimmering in one direction and the waters of firefly lake shimmering in another and they also caught several glimpses of rocky river and some other bodies of water still further away  nothing of the deer sighed whopper after a long look around  let us make sure came from giant and swept every point of the compass with his sharp eyes  i see something far to the north of here he announced  but what it is i cant make out  whopper looked in the direction but could see nothing clearly  something is moving among the bushes he said slowly  it may possibly be a deer but i doubt it  it was rather pleasant in the tree and they rested near the top for some time  then of a sudden whopper started up  whats that giant  whats what  that noise below  i dont hear anything  i do and i am going down to see what is doing  whopper began to descend and the smaller youth followed him  well i never  wolves  yes and look at the number  the words were true  under the tree a number of wolves had congregated  there were at least twentyfive or thirty of them and they were all of good size  as soon as they saw the boys they retreated a few feet and then began to snarl savagely  say whopper i dont like this observed giant with a grave shake of his head  i dont like it myself  they dont look extra friendly  friendly  i guess not  they are mighty savage  i wonder where they came from  i am sure i dont know  perhaps from over the mountains  dont you remember jed sanborn telling us of the packs of wolves over near pine mountain  yes  the two boy hunters had not ventured to the lowest limb of the tree now as whopper started to step down one of the wolves large and savage leaped up at him with a vicious snarl  not today cried whopper and drew himself up again  i dont want you to sample my leg  if we only had our guns sighed giant  i wanted to get them giant  but i dont know if it will do any goodthere are so many of them  one or two less wont count  the wolves now seemed to grow impatient and snapped and snarled loudly as they crowded around the tree and tried to leap up towards the boys  they were evidently a hungry lot  ive got an idea said giant presently  i am going to cut a notched stick and reach down for the guns with that  just the thing answered his chum  the stick was soon cut and then both boys went fishing with it  both the gun and the rifle were hanging up by straps and it was an easy matter to catch the notch under the straps and hoist the weapons up to where the youths stood  hurrah  so far so good cried giant  now then well give the wolves something that will surprise them  yes but dont forget one thing giant  the shots will surely scare the game away from around here and that will mean goodby to the silver deerat least for the present  well we have got to do something  i agree on that  ill take that savagelooking fellow right below us  and ill fire at the one over yonder  are you ready  there was a pause  yes  then fire  and the shotgun and the rifle spoke up almost as one piece     chapter xxvi  something about trapping   when the smoke cleared away the two boy hunters saw two wolves stretched upon the ground dead  the rest of the pack had retreated yelping and snarling more frightfully than ever  thats the time we did it cried whopper reloading the rifle while giant attended to his shotgun  but it hasnt sent them away was the answer of the smaller youth here they come back  giant was right  sniffing suspiciously the remaining wolves came as close to the tree as before  strange to say they scarcely paid any attention to those that had been killed  let us fire again said whopper and his companion nodded  once more the weapons rang out and again two of the wolves dropped  this time the remainder of the pack grew scared and vanished into the brushwood as if by magic  they have gone cried giant excitedly  i thought that would make em skip  dont be so sure about that was whoppers reply  they may be watching us from behind the bushes  if theyi see one of them now  let us give them another shot  again the weapons were discharged both boys thinking it great sport to lay the wolves low  this time two more were hit but merely wounded  they ran away yelping with pain and the balance of the pack went after them  looking from the tree the boy hunters saw them cross an open space some distance away and then plunge into the woods of the next hillside  that finished them said whopper drawing a sigh of relief  they are now thoroughly scared and i dont think theyll dare to come back  nevertheless the boys remained in the tree for half an hour longer but the wolves were really gone and at last they dropped to the ground  this ends hunting for today remarked giant  its too bad  well we shot something answered whopper grimly and pointed to the wolves  what shall we do with them  leave them here  but no let us take the smallest along  the meat will make good bait for the traps  after that there was nothing to do but to start back for the camp and this they did without further delay  it was a hard walk and they often stopped to rest  on the way they were fortunate enough to stir up some partridge and brought down three and also got two rabbits  well well not go back emptyhanded after all said whopper  it was long past dark when they came in sight of the campfire which snap and shep were keeping burning brightly on purpose so that it might light their way  here they come cried snap and ran forward to meet them  whats this  a wolf i declare  then you didnt find the silver deer  we didnt get a chance said giant and then he and whopper told their story  you can be thankful that you escaped from those wolves said snap  i thought wolves didnt attack folks excepting in the dead of winter when they couldnt get anything to eat remarked shep  that is usually the case answered snap  but once in a while they do as they did todaywhen there is a large pack of them  snap and shep had made their traps and had some success at fishing having caught four pike of fair size and also several catfish  that night came a fall of snow which covered the ground to the depth of several inches  in the morning it was so cold they were glad enough to hug the fire until nearly noon  in the afternoon whopper went out on the lake and soon came back with news  what do you think he called out  the spink crowd is leaving  breaking up camp queried giant  yes they are loading everything in their boat  this announcement produced a mild sensation and after a consultation snap and his chums decided to row across the lake and watch proceedings  ham spink and his cronies were indeed leaving and in far from a good humor  none of them was a good shot and they did not possess the patience necessary to become good hunters or fishermen  as a consequence they had brought down very little game and caught only a few fish  their stock of provisions brought from home was running low and each boy in the camp had voted the outing a failure  going to leave us called out snap as he and his friends rested on their oars a short distance from the rival camp  yes was ham spinks surly response  whats the matter  dont you like the hunting here asked whopper  oh dont be so inquisitive came from dick bush  i guess you are glad enough to see us go  not at all said giant  you are welcome to stay so long as you dont interfere with our doings  we dont think much of this place grunted ham spink  it may be good enough in the middle of summer but not now when winter is coming on  are you going right home ham asked snap  what business is that of yours  i thought if you were you might sell us what stores you have left over  we have nothing to sell to you was the cold reply  we might make a trade put in shep  we have got some plump partridge and rabbits to spare  humph  are you saying that just to tease us  not at all  here are the rabbits and the partridge too and the doctors son held them up  now as it happened ham spink and his cronies were very anxious to take some game home but had nothing but one rabbit and a little squirrel  they gazed longingly at the plump game shep exhibited  let us take them whispered dick bush  nobody will know how we got them  at this ham spinks eyes brightened  he was not above telling an untruth when he felt like it  what will you take for what you have he called out  what have you got  the rival campers looked over such provisions as they had left and enumerated the articlessugar cocoa flour some canned goods and some preserves  snap and his chums went ashore and investigated  well trade even said snap at last after talking with his chums  but on one condition  what is that  that you take some letters home for us and deliver them as soon as you arrive  all right well do that said carl dudder  the trade was made on the spot and the letters written and on the following morning ham spink and his cronies left the vicinity of firefly lake  it was the last our friends saw of the dudish youth and his friends for some time to come  i think he feels sick all over remarked shep after the other crowd had departed  he certainly isnt in high spirits commented snap  ill wager a new cap against a balloon that they tell everybody in town they shot those partridge and the rabbits came from giant  sure thing exclaimed whopper  and theyll say they shot about a thousand other things besides  i know em  they can all blow to beat the band when they want to  on the following monday it was clear and cool and the boys set out to look at their beaver traps of which three had been placed in position  to their delight two of the traps held beavers and to their astonishment the third trap held a muskrat  hullo  here is something i wasnt looking for cried snap hes a fine haul he added looking the muskrat over  and the beavers are fine too added shep  boys i think we can count ourselves lucky and no mistake  let us set the traps again said whopper who was excited over the haul  this was done and the boy hunters returned to their camp well pleased at what they had caught  i wish wed get something in the bear trap said giant  the small youth had set his heart on getting a bear before it should be time to return home  on the day following shep and giant went out after nuts and were gone the best part of the day  when they returned to the camp they were both excited and wanted to see snap without delay  whats it all about asked the leader of the gun club  we may be mistaken answered shep but we think we have made a discovery of importance  what kind of a discovery  we think we have located the man who set fire to the sawmill and ran away with those documents answered giant     chapter xxvii  the deserted cottage   giants announcement filled snap with keen interest and he wanted to know at once all shep and the small youth could tell  we went directly up the lake said giant  took the road around the rocks that jed sanborn showed us  we found the nut trees and  never mind the nut trees interrupted snap  tell me about that man  well back of the trees is a cleared spotmaybe it was a farm some years ago and in the midst of the clearing is an old halftumbleddown cottage  we walked over to the cottage and looked in at the window  and we saw a man sitting on a box with a barrel before him put in shep  on the barrel he had a board and on the board were spread some papers that the man was looking over  the man was tall and thin and had red hair and a short red moustache  that tallies with the man who stole the money and the papers cried snap excitedly  did he limp too  slightly with his left foot  he must be our man  but what is he doing around here  i dont know answered shep  as soon as he saw us he jumped up and put the papers in his pocket  what did you do asked whopper  he asked us what we wanted and shep told him we were out nutting said giant  then he asked us who we were  did you tell him  we did said shep and then we asked him who he was but he put us off  he said he was out tramping the mountains for his health  did he seem to be staying at the cottage  yes at least he had a bag full of provisions with him and a gun too  was he alone  he seemed to be  did you see the documents he had closely  not very said giant  but we saw something of a map on one of them  one of the stolen papers was a map of that lumber tract said snap thoughtfully  boys if that is the rascal who set fire to the sawmill we ought to capture him he continued  thats the talk cried whopper  but we want to be sure of what we are doing  it wont do to arrest the wrong man  if we could only get a look at those papers said shep they would surely tell the tale  did he look like a guilty man went on snap  he acted scared when he saw us and he got the papers out of sight in a jiffy  and he is certainly tall and thin and has a red moustache and red hair  well that fits the rascal who is wanted pretty closely  its queer that hed come to a place like this was whoppers comment  maybe he thinks it is best to keep in hiding at least for the present  but why doesnt he go elsewhere  he may be afraid to show himself in town or at a railroad station  the matter was talked over for an hour and then it was decided to visit the old cottage as early as possible on the following morning  and let us take our guns declared snap  and well take a rope tooin case we have to tie him up  the boys could scarcely sleep that night so excited were they over the prospect ahead  all of them were up at dawn and procured breakfast as quickly as they could  then the gamebags were filled with provisions the guns were overhauled and snap got the rope he had mentioned  now i guess we are ready said shep  wait till i kick out the fire said whopper  dont want the place to burn up while we are away  the fire extinguished they set off on their journey and were soon a goodly distance from the lake  the snow had disappeared and the day promised to be an unusually warm one  they did not look for any game and when a rabbit crossed their path nobody shot at it  we are after other game today observed snap grimly  if only we have the same success as we had when we caught that nigger came from whopper  that was dead easy  i dont think well catch him asleep said shep  he is a wideawake fellow if nothing else  on and on they went covering several miles  they passed the trees that were loaded with nuts but did not stop and soon came in sight of the clearing  now go slow cautioned snap  if he sees us from a distance he may take it into his head to run away  maybe one or two of us had better go forward and investigate suggested giant  this was thought a good plan and snap and shep went forward slowly and cautiously until they gained the very edge of the clearing  i see smoke coming out of the chimney said snap  that would seem to show he is still there  the door to the old cottage was tightly closed and growing bolder the two young hunters walked to it and knocked loudly  see that he doesnt slip out the other way whispered snap to his chum and shep at once ran around to the other side of the building  as there was no answer to the summons snap knocked on the door a second time  still there was no response  guess ill go in he murmured and pushed the door open  the apartment beyond was the livingroom of the old cottage and a glance showed him a smouldering fire in the fireplace  nobody was visible  from the kitchen the boy hunter went into the room beyond and then ran upstairs  see anybody called shep as snap showed himself at a brokenout window  no  call the others  shep did as requested and soon all of the young hunters were making an investigation of the premises  he must have gone away this morning said giant  see how the fire is still burning  i wish i knew where he had gone to said snap with a long sigh  perhaps we can find out if we search closely  in the cottage they found the remains of some meals the stranger had had and also some scraps of paper including an envelope addressed to lusher barrock  i wonder if that is his name said snap  more than likely answered giant  did you ever hear of him before  no  they tried to put the pieces of paper together but the effort was a failure  here is where he did some figuring said whopper pointing to the board which contained numerous pencil marks  maybehullo look here  whats up now asked snap running forward  here is the name of andrew felps  felps came from all of the others in a chorus  can that man have been here asked giant  i must say i dont understand this came from snap  but i have got an idea  what is it snap  of course i may be all wrong but ill give it to you for what it is worth  do you remember what my father said about those papers  that they related to a certain patch of timber land said giant  yes and that the felps people wanted to get hold of the patch well this lusher barrock may be hanging around here trying to sell the papers  to sell them said shep looking puzzled  exactly  they are of no use to him but they might be of use to andrew felps and his lumber company  you mean that by getting the papers felps might keep your folks from cutting down the lumber on that tract  yes and more  felps may have some way of getting hold of the land himself if these papers are destroyed  i dont know the whole truth of the case but i know my father wanted the papers and he didnt want andrew felps to learn that they were missing  snap i think you have struck the truth ejaculated shep  i dont know of anything else that would bring this barrockif thats his nameto this locality  he must be watching his chance to meet andrew felps  would felps be mean enough to buy the papers from him asked whopper  why that would be dishonest  i think that man is mean enough for anything burst out giant who was not inclined to forget how badly he and his chums had been treated by the individual in question  if this is true snap the best thing we can do is to go over to the felps camp and watch out for this lusher barrock said shep  and that is what i am going to do answered snap  when will you go questioned whopper  as soon as possible  we cant get to the camp very well from here  well have to go back to firefly lake first  do you suppose this barrock went that way  maybe he did or else he knows of some trail over the mountain  well we can go back to the lake and then start for lake cameron without delay said snap and so it was settled     chapter xxviii  the boy hunters and a bear   the boys stopped to get dinner and then hurried back to the cabin with all possible speed  this has been a long tramp for nothing was giants comment as they trudged along  oh i dont think so answered whopper  i think we have learned a good deal  on the way back they could not resist the temptation to shoot what game came in their way and thus brought down several rabbits a squirrel four quail and two wild ducks that chanced to show themselves near the end of the lake  as they neared the cabin they had to pass the bear trap that had been set so many days  they heard a peculiar grunting  listen cried snap coming to a halt  what is that  i am sure i dont know said shep  sounds like some beast in pain  maybe it is something in the trap cried giant and moved forward on a run before anybody could stop him  as giant drew in sight of the trap something caught his eyes that brought him stock still in wonder  there fast in the trap lay a small bear and close at hand was another bear evidently trying to get the prisoner free  look out there giant sang out snap as he too saw the situation  two bears by all that is lucky ejaculated whopper  at the sounds of the boys voices the free bear turned swiftly evidently he was in a rage and for a good reason for the bear in the trap was his mate  he is coming for you cried shep  what he said was true the bear was indeed coming for giant  he stood up on his hind legs and confronted the young hunter  a moment more and his powerful paw must have knocked giant down and perhaps have killed the lad  but snap had somewhat recovered from his astonishment and raising his shotgun quickly he pulled the trigger  the dose of shot took the bear in the side of the face and stung him so bitterly that he fell back a few steps  but this was only for the moment  soon he gathered himself once more and then turned upon snap  shoot him cried the young leader of the gun club and a second later came the crack of the rifle that shep carried  the bullet pierced the bears side and he rolled over and over in pain  good for you shep sang out snap  shoot him again somebody  for an answer both whopper and giant fired their shotguns and the bear received both charges in his rump  again he rolled over and over uttering a roar that could be heard for a long distance he tried to arise and did so once dragging himself toward whopper who lost no time in retreating  by this time snap was ready for another shot and growing bolder he watched his chance ran in and let the bear have the buckshot directly between the eyes  then shep took a second shot also hitting bruin in the throat  this was too much for the bear and with a quiver and a gasp he sank in a heap and a moment later breathed his last  is hehe dead gasped giant after the bear had been quiet for a full minute  i think so answered snap  but dont go near him yethe may be playing a trick on us  i am not going near him  the bear in the trap is alive called out whopper who had just made an examination  all lost no time in reloading their weapons and then they peered into the trap  the bear under the logs and stones gave a grunt of pain and rage  ill fix her said snap and drawing close let drive at the bears head  it was a telling shot and soon the bear stretched out and then the battle with the two creatures came to an end  what a magnificent haul cried giant after they were certain both bears were dead  i wonder what ham spink and his crowd would say to this came from snap  they wouldnt believe it unless they saw it returned whopper boys do you know what i think  i think we ought to take those bears home  just what i think too said giant  i want my mother to see them  well i am willing answered snap  but i think we ought to visit lake cameron first and see if we cant find this lusher barrock  we can stop at lake cameron on the way answered whopper  it was late in the day already and by the time they had dragged the bears to camp it was night  as they sat around the campfire they talked matters over and decided to break camp the very next day  they had had about all the hunting they wished for the present and getting the two bears topped matters off as snap put it  the bears were loaded into the boat and anchored out in the lake and then the boys got supper and went to bed  snap was soon asleep and so were giant and shep and all slept soundly until about midnight when the leader of the club awoke a start  hullo  whats up now he called out and this cry aroused shep and giant  what is it snap  where is whopper  i dont know where he is answered snap  listen  the three did so and from a distance heard a groan and then a thrashing around in the bushes back of the cabin  something is wrong that is sure gasped giant  whopper must be in trouble  come on and see returned snap and catching up his gun he ran from the shelter  shep and giant were not slow in following  when they got outside all had become quiet again and they knew not in what direction to turn  there was no moon but the stars shone like so many diamonds in the heavens  where is he asked shep after a breathless pause  i dont know answered snap  hullo whopper he called out  there was no reply to his shout and he moved into the bushes cautiously with the others at his heels  then of a sudden he came upon whopper who stood by a bush tugging away manfully  get back murmured whopper  get back you beast  say fellows this is the worst bear of the lot  down he goes  that makes four bears for yours truly  i know whats the matter shouted snap lowering his gun  he has got the nightmare  yes and got it bad too put in giant  my see him hustle with the bush  shall we wake him up asked shep  noit may not be good for him answered snap  oh i am going to wake him up came from giant and before the others could stop him he ran forward and caught whopper by the arm  wake up whopper he called  wake up old man  youve got em bad  at first whopper paid no attention  then his struggles with the bush ceased and he opened his eyes and stared about him in bewilderment  whwhat is the matter  whwhere am i he stammered gazing around stupidly  youve been asleep and dreaming explained snap  you thought you were after a bear  so i wasafter a dozen bears  did ii kill any  there are no bears here  you were only dreaming  oh whopper rubbed his eyes  no bears at all  none but what we shot yesterday  you went to sleep and the next thing we knew you were out here pulling at this bush  where am i  back of the cabin put in shep  you had better go to bed again  and please dont dream of any more bears added giant with a grin  whopper scratched his head in perplexity  funny how i got here  i dont understand it at all  oh but say i was having the fight of my life  i should say so answered snap looking around  you must have pulled up those three bushes yonder  getting strong in your sleep  i am glad he didnt dream i was a bear remarked shep  there wouldnt have been anything left of me by the time he woke up  i know how it was said whopper as the full truth dawned on him  i ate a very hearty supper last night and when i went to bed my head was full of those two bears we brought down  that gave me the nightmare  then after this well have to send you to bed supperless said snap  not much cried whopper     chapter xxix  a strange meeting in the forest   despite whoppers nightmare and what had followed the boy hunters slept soundly for the rest of the night  all arose at daybreak and procured what was destined to be their last meal in the camp for that season  i rather hate to leave the spot said snap while packing away the breakfast things  we have had some good fun here  we must come back some time by all means declared shep  maybe this winter  yes some hunting up here in midwinter wouldnt go bad came from giant  we could bring snowshoes along and have jolly times  thats the talk ejaculated whopper  i have always wanted to go hunting on snowshoes and we could build a big snowhouse too  well that is something to talk over another time put in snap remember just now we want to locate that mill robber if we can and also get those bears home  it took quite some time to pack all of the things aboard the rowboat and the craft was heavily loaded with the outfit and the game  will it carry us too questioned shep as he looked at the boat dubiously  it has got to carry us declared whopper  but it will be rather hard rowing  all tried the boat and found it would carry them although the gunwale sank low into the water  then they cleaned up the camp shut up the cabin and were all ready for the start  goodby to the camp cried giant lifting his cap  and hurrah for the first outing of our gun club added snap  and they gave the cheers with a will  snap and whopper took the oars first and the course was out of firefly lake and through the narrow watercourse running into lake cameron  it was a cool clear day with a stiff breeze stirring the bushes and trees of the forest  i see some turkeys cried shep while on the way  i must have a last shot  and so must i came from the others  all caught up their guns and as the boat drifted closer to the game each let drive  two of the turkeys were killed outright while two more were badly wounded and easily secured  one each said giant  exactly answered snap  and now we have got to stop or well sink the boat sure  well enough is enough said whopper  i think all told we have had the best luck possible  even if we didnt get a silver deer  thats soi forgot about that deer  well he will keep for another time eh fellows  thats right  it was shortly after noon that they turned into lake cameron and landed near the mouth of that body of water  all were hungry and partook readily of the lunch that had been brought along  now whats the next part of the programme asked giant looking at snap  i dont think it will be advisable for us to show ourselves to the felps crowd answered the leader of the gun club  oh let us do a little scout work said whopper  we can easily hide the boat and get around to the camp on foot  the matter was talked over while they ate their midday meal and at the conclusion of the repast they shoved the rowboat with its load into a cove and under some overhanging brushwood  then taking only their guns and gamebags and some provisions they set off for their first camping spot on foot  we must be on our guard cautioned snap  i do not want any of those men to see us if it can possibly be avoided  well watch out answered shep  a minute later half a dozen fat rabbits crossed their path directly in front of them  the temptation to bring the game down was strong but they resisted not wishing to make any noise  a little later they heard two gunshots at a distance  some of the men must be out hunting observed giant  gracious  i hope they dont mistake us for game cried whopper  let us walk more in the open answered snap  then they cant make any mistake  the way was rocky and uneven and long before they came in sight of their first camp the boys were somewhat footsore and weary  this isnt the nicest kind of tramping in the world is it came from shep  dont say a word answered giant  i just came within an inch of twisting my left ankle  they had a small brook to cross and there stopped for a drink of water  they were just going on again when another distant gunshot sounded out  they must be doing a lot of hunting today observed snap  id like to know if they can bring anything down  not if what that old guide said was true answered shep  they advanced a few yards further when shep suddenly halted and made his chums do the same  whats up now whispered whopper  see a bear  whopper has bears on the brain came from giant with a grin  i see two men over back of yonder rocks answered snap  they seem to be doing some hard talking  who are they  one of them is andrew felps  and the other  i dont know who he is  he is the man we are after cried whopper dont you see his red hair and red moustache  let us go around the rocks and get closer in that way said snap and his suggestion was followed out promptly  well what do you want of me anyway barrock they heard andrew felps say to the man with the red hair  i want to talk business answered lush barrock as he was commonly called  well get to business then went on the lumber merchant  i am not going to stay here all day  you said you had something to say that would interest me  its true too mr felps  well out with it then  lush barrock paused and cleared his throat  evidently he did not know exactly how to go about what he had in mind to do  i reckon you know the barnaby lumber folks he began  yes was the short answer  they have been trying to get hold of a certain lumber tract up at the spur road  what of that  i understand your company has been trying to get hold of the same tract of land  what business is that of yours  none of my businessin one waybut a good deal of my business in another way  i dont understand you barrock  stop talking in riddles and get down to business  can i trust you mr felps  i mean will you keep a secret  that depends answered andrew felps coldly  i want to help you so that you can get the best of the barnaby people  how can you help me  ill tell you if youll promise to keep the matter a secret  hum the lumber merchant paused for a moment  well go on  you wont give me away  no  well when they got their right to that spur road tract certain papers had to be signed  i know that  then they had a fire at their sawmill  i know that too  during that fire those papers disappeared  ha cried andrew felps with interest  you are certain of that  i am  and youyou the lumber dealer paused  in a roundabout way i met the fellow who had the papers  for a consideration he let me have them  if you want them you can have themprovided you will pay the price     chapter xxx  words and a blow   the boy hunters had listened to the foregoing conversation with intense interest  there could be no doubt but what this barrock was the man they were after  his tale that he had procured the missing papers from somebody else was pure fictiongotten up merely to deceive andrew felps  we ought to make him a prisoner on the spot whispered shep  waiti want to learn what andrew felps will do murmured snap  you want me to buy the papers from you eh said andrew felps after a pause  yes answered lush barrock boldly  dont you know that you have no right to the documents  oh i dont want you to preach to me andy felps  if you want the papers say so  if not  if not what  maybe ill return them to the barnaby folks  i understand mr dodge offered a reward for them  what do you want for the papers asked andrew felps cautiously  they ought to be worth several thousand dollars but you can have them for one thousand dollars  nonsense barrock  what would i do with the papers  destroy them  what after giving you a thousand dollars for them  lush barrock nodded  its this way felps he said  if you get this contract out of the way i am sure you can make another contractfor your own company  the spur road folks feel sore and i know you can fix matters up with old haley who is a miser and willing to do almost anything for money  have you the papers with you  do you want to buy them  i want to see what i am getting first  lusher barrock made a movement as if to take something from his breastpocket  just at that moment heavy footsteps sounded out directly behind the four boy hunters and two men belonging to the felps crowd appeared upon the scene  hullo  what are you youngsters doing here demanded one of the men  wewe came over on business stammered snap  he hardly knew what to say the meeting was such an unexpected one  who is there cried out andrew felps and ran around the edge of the rocks  what you  where did you come from  andrew felps was followed by lush barrock  when the fellow who had robbed the sawmill saw snap and his chums he was almost struck dumb  see here began andrew felps his face growing dark what do you  stop him yelled snap and pointed to lush barrock who had suddenly taken to his heels  stop him somebody  snap made a dash after the robber and was followed by his three chums  barrock was a good runner and soon disappeared into the bushes  we must catch him panted snap  we must not let him get away  he went on after lush barrock with all speed  the course was through the bushes and over some rocks  then of a sudden a voice sounded out ahead  stop all of you  if you dont ill fire  oh snap do you think he will fire at us gasped giant and came to a halt followed by the rest  if you fire so will we sang out snap and brought around his shotgun  but no answer came back and now lush barrock was both out of sight and hearing  yet the boy hunters did not give up the chase  they followed the trail as best they could to a brook but there lost it in the water  then they hunted around for a good quarter of an hour but without avail  too bad groaned snap  oh how i wish i had put my hands on that rascal  he is certainly a bad one was whoppers comment  yes and andrew felps is almost as bad said shep  he would have bought those papers  they retraced their steps toward the lake and soon met andrew felps and his companions  did you catch him asked the lumber dealer nervously  no was snaps short answer  do you know him went on andrew felps curiously  i know him to be the man who robbed the sawmill and set the place on fire  is that so  andrew felps put on an appearance of great surprise  dont you know it too said snap bluntly  me  of course not  whyerif i knew he was that kind of a man andrew felps broke off short  were you listening to our talk  we were put in whopper  we heard every word too  ahem  well ierthat is i was only sounding the fellow said the lumber dealer lamely  to this snap did not say anything although andrew felps looked at him inquiringly  you dont suppose i was going to have anything to do with him demanded andrew felps after a pause  yes i do said snap bluntly  bah  nonsense  if he had shown those papers i should have taken them away from him  to keep  no to return to their rightful owners  to this snap made no reply  andrew felps was clearly disconcerted  evidently you dont believe me boy  still snap was silent  see here do you expect to make trouble for me on this account pursued the lumber dealer growing angry  i shall tell the truth thats all said snap  i see  youll try to make it appear that i am in with thisthis fellow snorted the lumber dealer  well just you take care or you may get into trouble  if i get into trouble i guess ill know how to take care of myself returned snap stoutly  he had scarcely uttered the words when andrew felps caught him roughly by the shoulder  boy take care how you talk to me  let go of me exclaimed snap with flashing eyes  let go i say and he jerked himself away  dont you dare lay your hands upon me again andrew felps  ha you imp snarled the lumber dealer and caught hold of snap once more  this time the boy tried to free himself but in vain  if you dont let go ill strike you he panted and the next moment he struck out landing a hard blow on the lumber dealers nose  the latter was so amazed he fell back and released his hold  oh my nose groaned the man  you young scoundrel  ill  at that moment came a cry of alarm from a distance  hullo  hullo  come this way  the woods are on fire  well be burnt out before we know it     chapter xxxi  the forest fireconclusion   the cry was such an unexpected one that for the moment every one who heard it was dumfounded  the men stared at each other and so did the boys  then all looked up and saw a thick mass of smoke rolling over the forest  the wind was blowing briskly and soon the smoke began to envelop the entire crowd  say fellows we must get out of here exclaimed shep  we cant stay or well be burnt up  thats the truth put in giant  let us get back to our boat  to the camp came from andrew felps and ran off followed by the other men  shall we go after them asked snap  what good will it do said shep  they can get out on the lake in their boatif the fire gets too strong for them  the wind is blowing it directly to the lake said whopper  my but it has gained headway he added looking around  the smoke was growing thicker and already they could see the sparks floating overhead  from a distance they heard a wild cry but could not make out what it was  turning around they started for the spot where they had left their boat  in their mad rush to gain the craft they did not notice that they got off the trail until they were halted by a mass of brushwood on all sides of them  this cant be right panted giant  i didnt notice this before  we have made some mistake ejaculated shep  maybe we are going away from the lake  they gazed around  the smoke was growing thicker and now a few burning brands fell close by  one thing is certain we cant stay here came from snap  let us go straight downhill  that will bring us to water sooner or later  this was considered good advice and all acted on it without delay the smoke was now so thick they could scarcely see in any direction the light of the sun was obscure making it as dark as if it was night  here is a little stream called out giant presently  this must run into the lake  all stepped into the brook and followed it for several hundred feet then snap called a halt  here is our lost trail  snap is right said shep  come on the boat cannot be far off  once more they went on the smoke growing so thick they had to crouch down to get their breath  the tears were streaming from their eyes and whopper let out a yell as a burning brand floated down on his neck raising a blister  here is the boat thank fortune said snap a minute later  how they tumbled into the craft they scarcely knew  the painter was cut and they shoved off into the lake just as a fierce gust of wind sent a cloud of smoke and a shower of sparks down upon them  phew but that was a narrow escape muttered shep when the shore had been left behind and they could catch their breath  we are not out of danger yet said snap  this fire may be worse than we think  if it takes in the whole lake district well be hemmed in on all sides  look exclaimed giant  am i mistaken or is a storm coming up and he pointed to the sky  those are certainly clouds not smoke said whopper  oh i hope it does rain and puts out the fire  i shouldnt like to see this fine forest destroyed  nor i added snap  if it is burned down it will be mr felpss loss came from giant he said he had bought the district up youll remember  as they pulled along well away from the shore they suddenly heard a mad cry for aid  whats that asked snap  a man on shore ejaculated whopper  see himover on yonder rocks  it is that barrock said shep  help me came from the man who was waving his arms wildly  take me off or ill be burnt up  let us row to him said snap  the rowboat was turned in toward shore without delay  in the meantime to escape the smoke and burning brands lusher barrock rushed into the lake up to his knees  save me he bawled again  i cant swim  well save you answered snap  but see here barrock he added suddenly  what  you will have to give us those documents you took from the sawmill  iiaint got them  well then well leave you where you are said snap just to test the rascal  no  no  iill give you the papers  very well then  the craft came alongside of the robber and he was helped on board he was badly scared and trembling from head to foot  a burning brand had come down on his left ear singeing that member and also his fiery red hair  now give me those papers demanded snap and without waiting thrust his hand into the mans pocket and drew them forth  have you the money too  ii  hand it over or well search you  ive got three hundred dollars said lush barrock lamely  i spent about fifty dollars  the money was handed over to snap and he placed it and the papers in an inner pocket of his jacket  then the robber was ordered to sit at the bow of the boat and not move and a pistol he carried was taken from him  it was not long after this that it began to rain  at first the downfall was not great but presently there was a perfect deluge and then the boy hunters knew that the danger from the forest fire was over  looking up the lake they saw andrew felps and his party in their launch unharmed  the camp of the lumber dealer however had been burned out clean and clear along with all of the provisions  thats what he gets for taking our cabin from us was giants comment  not wishing to meet the lumber dealer again now that they had made lush barrock a prisoner snap directed his chums to row out of the lake and on to the river  the boys pulled a good stroke and despite the load on board the craft made fair progress  this fire will worry the folks at home said shep  i am glad we made up our minds to break camp  yes answered whopper  everything happened for the best after all  the boat was still some miles from fairview when they saw another craft approaching  it contained mr dodge and jed sanborn  safe are you sang out mr dodge as he drew near  we were afraid that forest fire would do you some harm  we had a pretty close shave of it father answered snap  weve got a prisoner for you mr dodge sang out shep somewhat proudly  here is the rascal who set fire to the sawmill  is it possible cried mr dodge  that fire was anan accident grumbled lusher barrock  all a mistake  ive got the documents he took and three hundred dollars of the money said snap  well  well  this is famous boys said mr dodge  my sakes alive look at the bears called out jed sanborn as giant pulled aside the canvas that lay over the game  who shot em  we shot one and caught the other in the trap answered giant dont you think we did pretty well for boys  well for boys  why men couldnt do any better  youre the best boy hunters anywhere  the prisoner was transferred to the boat containing mr dodge and jed sanborn and snap gave to his parent the money and the documents that had been recovered  then both boats headed for fairview which was reached at nightfall  great was the surprise of the town folks when it was learned that the man who had set fire to the sawmill had been captured  he was put in jail and later on tried and sent to prison for a term of years  there was another surprise when it was noised about that the boy hunters had laid low not only several deer and a good deal of small game but also two fairsized bears  the bears were placed on public exhibition at one of the stores and many came to look at them  ham spink and his cronies were intensely jealous but did not dare to give vent to their feelings  snap and his chums took no notice of the dudish youth and his followers  we have the best of it and they know it said snap  boys we must go out again this winter said shep  come what do you say  all agreed instantly and how they went out and what good times they had will be told in another volume of this series to be called guns and snowshoes or the winter outing of the boy hunters  the best hunting is often to be had when there is snow on the ground and my readers can rest assured that the four boy hunters made the most of their opportunities  a while after the boys got home it was learned that andrew felps had escaped with his party unharmed but all had lost practically everything they had taken along but the launch  the forest had been much damaged especially that tract which the felps lumber company had purchased for cutting purposes so the lumber merchant was out in more ways than one  nothing was said to him about the talk he had had with lusher barrock and he himself was afraid to open his mouth about it and soon the incident was practically forgotten  the barnaby company went to work at the spur road tract and nobody attempted to stop them  boys we had a dandy time didnt we said snap one evening after he had had his fill of venison steak  we had the best time ever said shep  may we have many more like it  just wait till this winter cried whopper  i am going to kill sixteen deer twenty bears two hundred wild turkeys and about a thousand rab  draw it mild whopper ejaculated giant  wait till the time comes and then do your best  and whopper did wait and so did the rest and here let us leave them and say goodby
