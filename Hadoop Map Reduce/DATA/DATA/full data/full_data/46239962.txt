46239962	further foolishness sketches and satires on the follies of the day   by stephen leacock     preface  many years ago when i was a boy at school we had over our class an ancient and spectacled schoolmaster who was as kind at heart as he was ferocious in appearance and whose memory has suggested to me the title of this book  it was his practice on any outburst of gaiety in the classroom to chase us to our seats with a bamboo cane and to shout at us in defiance     now then any further foolishness  i find by experience that there are quite a number of indulgent readers who are good enough to adopt the same expectant attitude towards me now  stephen leacock mcgill university montreal november 1 1916     contents  follies in fiction  i    stories shorter still  ii   the

meet this demand at the source and check it any of the stories below if left to soak overnight in a barrel of rainwater will swell to the dimensions of a dollarfifty novel   i an irreducible detective story  hanged by a hair or a murder mystery minimised  the mystery had now reached its climax first the man had been undoubtedly murdered secondly it was absolutely certain that no conceivable person had done it  it was therefore time to call in the great detective  he gave one searching glance at the corpse in a moment he whipped out a microscope  ha ha he said as he picked a hair off the lapel of the dead mans coat the mystery is now solved  he held up the hair  listen he said we have only to find the man who lost this hair and the criminal is in our hands  the inexorable chain of logic was complete  the detective set himself to the search  for four days and nights he moved unobserved through the streets of new york scanning closely every face he passed looking for a man who had lost a hair  on the fifth day he discovered a man disguised as a tourist his head enveloped in a steamer cap that reached below his ears the man was about to go on board the gloritania  the detective followed him on board  arrest him he said and then drawing himself to his full height he brandished aloft the hair  this is his said the great detective it proves his guilt  remove his hat said the ships captain sternly  they did so  the man was entirely bald  ha said the great detective without a moment of hesitation he has committed not one murder but about a million   ii a compressed old english novel  swearword the unpronounceable  chapter one and only  ods bodikins exclaimed swearword the saxon wiping his mailed brow with his iron hand a fair morn withal methinks twert lithlier to rest me in yon glade than to foray me forth in yon fray twert it not  but there happened to be a real anglosaxon standing by  where in heavens name he said in sudden passion did you get that line of english  churl said swearword it is anglosaxon  youre a liar shouted the saxon it is not it is harvard college sophomore year option no 6  swearword now in like fury threw aside his hauberk his baldrick and his needlework on the grass  lay on said swearword  have at you cried the saxon  they laid on and had at one another  swearword was killed  thus luckily the whole story was cut off on the first page and ended   iii a condensed interminable novel  from the cradle to the grave or a thousand pages for a dollar  notethis story originally contained two hundred and fifty thousand words but by a marvellous feat of condensation it is reduced without the slightest loss to a hundred and six words     i  edward endless lived during his youth    in maine       in new hampshire          in vermont             in massachusetts                in rhode island                   in connecticut     ii  then the lure of the city lured him his fate took him to    new york to chicago and to philadelphia  in chicago he lived    in a boardinghouse on lasalle avenue    then he boarded    in a livinghouse on michigan avenue  in new york he    had a room in an eatinghouse on fortyfirst street    and then    ate in a roominghouse on fortysecond street  in philadelphia he    used to sleep on chestnut street    and then    slept on maple street  during all this time women were calling to him he knew    and came to be friends with       margaret jones          elizabeth smith             arabella thompson                jane williams                   maud taylor  and he also got to know pretty well    louise quelquechose       antoinette alphabetic          estelle etcetera  and during this same time art began to call him    pictures began to appeal to him       statues beckoned to him          music maddened him             and any form of recitation or elocution drove                him beside himself     iii  then one day he married margaret jones    as soon as he had married her       he was disillusioned          he now hated her  then he lived with elizabeth smith    he had no sooner sat down with her than       he hated her  half mad he took his things over to arabella thompsons flat to live with her  the moment she opened the door of the apartment he loathed her    he saw her as she was  driven sane with despair he then  our staff here cut the story off there are hundreds and hundreds of pages after this they show edward endless grappling in the fight for clean politics the last hundred pages deal with religion edward finds it after a big fight but no one reads these pages there are no women in them our staff cut them out and merely show at the end     edward purified       uplifted          transluted  the whole story is perhaps the biggest thing ever done on this continent perhaps     ii snoopopaths or fifty stories in one  this particular study in the follies of literature is not so much a story as a sort of essay the average reader will therefore turn from it with a shudder the condition of the average readers mind is such that he can take in nothing but fiction and it must be thin fiction at thatthin as gruel nothing else will sit on his stomach  everything must come to the presentday reader in this form if you wish to talk to him about religion you must dress it up as a story and label it bethsheba or the curse of david if you want to improve the readers morals you must write him a little thing in dialogue called mrs potiphar dines out if you wish to expostulate with him about drink you must do so through a narrative called red rumshort enough and easy enough for him to read it without overstraining his mind while he drinks cocktails  but whatever the story is about it has got to dealin order to be read by the average readerwith a man and a woman i put these words in capitals to indicate that they have got to stick out of the story with the crudity of a drawing done by a child with a burnt stick in other words the story has got to be snoopopathic this is a word derived from the greeksnoopoor if there never was a greek verb snoopo at least there ought to have been oneand it means just what it seems to mean nine out of ten short stories written in america are snoopopathic  in snoopopathic literature in order to get its full effect the writer generally introduces his characters simply as the man and the woman he hates to admit that they have no names he opens out with them something after this fashion the man lifted his head he looked about him at the gaily bedizzled crowd that besplotched the midnight cabaret with riotous patches of colour he crushed his cigar against the brass of an egyptian tray bah he murmured is it worth it then he let his head sink again  you notice it he lifted his head all the way up and let it sink all the way down and you still dont know who he is for the woman the beginning is done like this the woman clenched her white hands till the diamonds that glittered upon her fingers were buried in the soft flesh the shame of it she murmured then she took from the table the telegram that lay crumpled upon it and tore it into a hundred pieces he dare not she muttered through her closed teeth she looked about the hotel room with its garish furniture he has no right to follow me here she gasped  all of which the reader has to take in without knowing who the woman is or which hotel she is staying at or who dare not follow her or why but the modern reader loves to get this sort of shadowy incomplete effect if he were told straight out that the womans name was mrs edward dangerfield of brick city montana and that she had left her husband three days ago and that the telegram told her that he had discovered her address and was following her the reader would refuse to go on  this method of introducing the characters is bad enough but the new snoopopathic way of describing them is still worse the man is always detailed as if he were a horse he is said to be tall well set up with straight legs  great stress is always laid on his straight legs no magazine story is acceptable now unless the mans legs are absolutely straight why this is i dont know all my friends have straight legsand yet i never hear them make it a subject of comment or boasting i dont believe i have at present a single friend with crooked legs  but this is not the only requirement not only must the mans legs be straight but he must be cleanlimbed whatever that is and of course he must have a welltubbed look about him how this look is acquired and whether it can be got with an ordinary bath and water are things on which i have no opinion  the man is of course cleanshaven this allows him to do such necessary things as turning his cleanshaven face towards the speaker laying his cleanshaven cheek in his hand and so on but every one is familiar with the face of the uptodate cleanshaven snoopopathic man there are pictures of him by the million on magazine covers and book jackets looking into the eyes of the womanhe does it from a distance of about six incheswith that snoopy earnest expression of brainlessness that he always wears how one would enjoy seeing a mana real one with nevada whiskers and long bootsland him one solid kick from behind  then comes the woman of the snoopopathic story she is always beautifully groomed who these grooms are that do it and where they can be hired i dont know and she is said to be exquisitely gowned  it is peculiar about the woman that she never seems to wear a dressalways a gown why this is i cannot tell in the good old stories that i used to read when i could still read for the pleasure of it the heroines that was what they used to be calledalways wore dresses but now there is no heroine only a woman in a gown i wear a gown myselfat night it is made of flannel and reaches to my feet and when i take my candle and go out to the balcony where i sleep the effect of it on the whole is not bad but as to its revealing every line of my figureas the womans gown is always said toand as to its suggesting even more than it revealswell it simply does not so when i talk of gowns i speak of something that i know all about  yet whatever the woman does her gown is said to cling to her whether in the street or in a cabaret or in the drawingroom it clings if by any happy chance she throws a lace wrap about her then it clings and if she lifts her gownas she is apt toit shows not what i should have expected but a jupon and even that clings what a jupon is i dont know with my gown i never wear one these people i have described the man and the womanthe snoopopathsare of course not husband and wife or brother and sister or anything so simple and oldfashioned as that she is some one elses wife she is the wife of the other man just what there is for the reader about other mens wives i dont understand i know tons of them that i wouldnt walk round a block for but the reading public goes wild over them the oldfashioned heroine was unmarried that spoiled the whole story you could see the end from the beginning but with another mans wife the way is blocked something has got to happen that would seem almost obvious to anyone  the writer therefore at once puts the two snooposthe man and the womaninto a frightfully indelicate position the more indelicate it is the better sometimes she gets into his motor by accident after the theatre or they both engage the drawingroom of a pullman car by mistake or else best of all he is brought accidentally into her room at an hotel at night there is something about an hotel room at night apparently which throws the modern reader into convulsions it is always easy to arrange a scene of this sort for example taking the sample beginning that i gave above the man whom i left sitting at the cabaret table above rises unsteadily it is the recognised way of rising in a cabaretand settling the reckoning with the waiter staggers into the street for myself i never do a reckoning with the waiter i just pay the bill as he adds it and take a chance on it  as the man staggers into the night air the writer has timejust a little time for the modern reader is impatientto explain who he is and why he staggers he is rich that goes without saying all cleanlimbed men with straight legs are rich he owns copper mines in montana all welltubbed millionaires do but he has left them left everything because of the other mans wife it was that or madnessor worse he had told himself so a thousand times this little touch about worse is used in all the stories i dont just understand what the worse means but snoopopathic readers reach for it with great readiness so the man had come to new york the only place where stories are allowed to be laid under an assumed name to forget to drive her from his mind he had plunged into the mad round ofi never could find it myself but it must be there and as they all plunge into it it must be as full of them as a sheet of tanglefoot is of flies  as the man walked home to his hotel the cool night air steadied him but his brain is still filled with the fumes of the wine he had drunk notice these fumes it must be great to float round with them in ones brain where they apparently lodge i have often tried to find them but i never can again and again i have said waiter bring me a scotch whisky and soda with fumes but i can never get them  thus goes the man to his hotel now it is in a room in this same hotel that the woman is sitting and in which she has crumpled up the telegram it is to this hotel that she has come when she left her husband a week ago the readers know without even being told that she left him to work out her own salvationdriven by his cold brutality beyond the breakingpoint and there is laid upon her soul as she sits there with clenched hands the dust and ashes of a broken marriage and a loveless life and the knowledge too late of all that might have been  and it is to this hotel that the womans husband is following her  but the man does not know that she is in the hotel nor that she has left her husband it is only accident that brings them together and it is only by accident that he has come into her room at night and stands thererooted to the threshold now as a matter of fact in real life there is nothing at all in the simple fact of walking into the wrong room of an hotel by accident you merely apologise and go out i had this experience myself only a few days ago i walked right into a ladys roomnext door to my own but i simply said oh i beg your pardon i thought this was no 343  no she said this is 341  she did not rise and confront me as they always do in the snoopopathic stories neither did her eyes flash nor her gown cling to her as she rose nor was her gown made of rich old stuff no she merely went on reading her newspaper  i must apologise i said i am a little shortsighted and very often a one and a three look so alike that i cant tell them apart im afraid  not at all said the lady good evening  you see i added this room and my own being so alike and mine being 343 and this being 341 i walked in before i realised that instead of walking into 343 i was walking into 341  she bowed in silence without speaking and i felt that it was now the part of exquisite tact to retire quietly without further explanation or at least with only a few murmured words about the possibility of tomorrow being even colder than today i did so and the affair ended with complete savoir faire on both sides  but the snoopopaths man and woman cant do this sort of thing or at any rate the snoopopathic writer wont let them the opportunity is too good to miss as soon as the man comes into the womans roombefore he knows who she is for she has her back to himhe gets into a condition dear to all snoopopathic readers  his veins simply surged his brain beat against his temples in mad pulsation his breath came and went in quick short pants this last might perhaps be done by one of the hotel bellboys but otherwise it is hard to imagine  and the womannoiseless as his step had been she seemed to sense his presence a wave seemed to sweep over her she turned and rose fronting him full this doesnt mean that he was full when she fronted him her gownbut we know about that already it was a cowards trick she panted  now if the man had had the kind of savoir faire that i have he would have said oh pardon me i see this room is 341 my own room is 343 and to me a one and a three often look so alike that i seem to have walked into 341 while looking for 343 and he could have explained in two words that he had no idea that she was in new york was not following her and not proposing to interfere with her in any way and she would have explained also in two sentences why and how she came to be there but this wouldnt do instead of it the man and the woman go through the grand snoopopathic scene which is so intense that it needs what is really a new kind of language to convey it  helene he croaked reaching out his armshis voice tensed with the infinity of his desire  back she iced and then why have you come here she hoarsed what business have you here  none he glooped none i have no business they stood sensing one another  i thought you were in philadelphia she saidher gown clinging to every fibre of her as she spoke  i was he wheezed  and you left it she sharped her voice tense  i left it he said his voice glumping as he spoke need i tell you why he had come nearer to her she could hear his pants as he moved  no no she gurgled you left it it is enough i can understandshe looked bravely up at himi can understand any man leaving it  then as he moved still nearer her there was the sound of a sudden swift step in the corridor the door opened and there stood before them the other man the husband of the womanedward dangerfield  this of course is the grand snoopopathic climax when the author gets all three of themthe man the woman and the womans husbandin an hotel room at night but notice what happens  he stood in the opening of the doorway looking at them a slight smile upon his lips  well he said then he entered the room and stood for a moment quietly looking into the mans face  so he said it was you he walked into the room and laid the light coat that he had been carrying over his arm upon the table he drew a cigarcase from his waistcoat pocket  try one of these havanas he said  observe the calm of it this is what the snoopopath lovesno rage no blusteringcalmness cynicism he walked over towards the mantelpiece and laid his hat upon it he set his boot upon the fender  it was cold this evening he said he walked over to the window and gazed a moment into the dark  this is a nice hotel he said this scene is what the author and the reader love they hate to let it go theyd willingly keep the man walking up and down for hours saying well  the man raised his head yes its a good hotel he said then he let his head fall again  this kind of thing goes on until if possible the reader is persuaded into thinking that there is nothing going to happen then  he turned to the woman go in there he said pointing to the bedroom door mechanically she obeyed this by the way is the first intimation that the reader has that the room in which they were sitting was not a bedroom the two men were alone dangerfield walked over to the chair where he had thrown his coat  i bought this coat in st louis last fall he said his voice was quiet even passionless then from the pocket of the coat he took a revolver and laid it on the table marsden watched him without a word  do you see this pistol said dangerfield  marsden raised his head a moment and let it sink  of course the ignorant reader keeps wondering why he doesnt explain but how can he what is there to say he has been found out of his own room at night the penalty for this in all the snoopopathic stories is death it is understood that in all the new york hotels the night porters shoot a certain number of men in the corridors every night  when we married said dangerfield glancing at the closed door as he spoke i bought this and the mate to itfor herjust the same with the monogram on the buttsee and i said to her if things ever go wrong between you and me there is always this way out  he lifted the pistol from the table examining its mechanism he rose and walked across the room till he stood with his back against the door the pistol in his hand its barrel pointing straight at marsdens heart marsden never moved then as the two men faced one another thus looking into one anothers eyes their ears caught a sound from behind the closed door of the inner rooma sharp hard metallic sound as if some one in the room within had raised the hammer of a pistola jewelled pistol like the one in dangerfields hand  and then  a loud report and with a cry the cry of a woman one shrill despairing cry  or no hang iti cant consent to end up a story in that fashion with the dead woman prone across the bed the smoking pistol with a jewel on the hilt still clasped in her handthe red blood welling over the white laces of her gownwhile the two men gaze down upon her cold face with horror in their eyes not a bit lets end it like this  a shrill despairing cryed charlie come in here quick hurry the steam coil has blown out a plug you two boys quit talking and come in here for heavens sake and fix it and indeed if the reader will look back he will see there is nothing in the dialogue to preclude it he was misled thats all i merely said that mrs dangerfield had left her husband a few days before so she hadto do some shopping in new york she thought it mean of him to follow her and i never said that mrs dangerfield had any connection whatever with the woman with whom marsden was in love not at all he knew her of course because he came from brick city but she had thought he was in philadelphia and naturally she was surprised to see him back in new york thats why she exclaimed back and as a matter of plain fact you cant pick up a revolver without its pointing somewhere no one said he meant to fire it  in fact if the reader will glance back at the dialoguei know he has no time to but if he doeshe will see that being something of a snoopopath himself he has invented the whole story     iii foreign fiction in imported instalments  serge the superman a russian novel  translated with a hand pump out of the original russian     special editorial note or fit of convulsions into    which an editor falls in introducing this sort of    story to his readers we need offer no apology to    our readers in presenting to them a russian novel    there is no doubt that the future in literature lies    with russia the names of tolstoi of turgansomething    and dostoiwhatisit are household words in america    we may say with certainty that serge the superman is    the most distinctly russian thing produced in years    the russian view of life is melancholy and fatalistic    it is dark with the gloom of the great forests of the    volga and saddened with the infinite silence of the    siberian plain hence the russian speech like the    russian thought is direct terse and almost crude in    its elemental power all this appears in serge the    superman it is the directest tersest crudest thing    we have ever seen we showed the manuscript to a friend    of ours a critic a man who has a greater command of    the language of criticism than perhaps any two men in    new york today he said at once this is big it is    a big thing done by a big man a man with big ideas    writing at his very biggest the whole thing has a    bigness about it that is and here he paused and    thought a moment and addedbig after this he sat    back in his chair and said big big big till we    left him we next showed the story to an english critic    and he said without hesitation or with very little    this is really not half bad last of all we read    the story ourselves and we rose after its perusalitself    not an easy thing to doand said wonderful but    terrible all through our free lunch that day we    shuddered   chapter i  as a child serge lived with his fatherivan ivanovitch and his motherkatrina katerinavitch in the house too were nitska the serving maid itch the serving man and yump the cook his wife  the house stood on the borders of a russian town it was in the heart of russia all about it was the great plain with the river running between low banks and over it the dull sky  across the plain ran the post road naked and bare in the distance one could see a moujik driving a threehorse tarantula or perhaps swill the swineherd herding the swine far away the road dipped over the horizon and was lost  where does it go to asked serge but no one could tell him  in the winter there came the great snows and the river was frozen and serge could walk on it  on such days yob the postman would come to the door stamping his feet with the cold as he gave the letters to itch  it is a cold day yob would say  it is gods will said itch then he would fetch a glass of kwas steaming hot from the great stove built of wood that stood in the kitchen  drink little brother he would say to yob and yob would answer little uncle i drink your health and he would go down the road again stamping his feet with the cold  then later the spring would come and all the plain was bright with flowers and serge could pick them then the rain came and serge could catch it in a cup then the summer came and the great heat and the storms and serge could watch the lightning  what is lightning for he would ask of yump the cook as she stood kneading the mush or dough to make slab or pancake for the morrow yump shook her knob or head with a look of perplexity on her big mugg or face  it is gods will she said  thus serge grew up a thoughtful child  at times he would say to his mother matrinska little mother why is the sky blue and she couldnt tell him  or at times he would say to his father boob russian for father what is three times six but his father didnt know  each year serge grew  life began to perplex the boy he couldnt understand it no one could tell him anything  sometimes he would talk with itch the serving man  itch he asked what is morality but itch didnt know in his simple life he had never heard of it  at times people came to the housesnip the schoolmaster who could read and write and cinch the harness maker who made harness  once there came popoff the inspector of police in his blue coat with fur on it he stood in front of the fire writing down the names of all the people in the house and when he came to itch serge noticed how itch trembled and cowered before popoff cringing as he brought a threelegged stool and saying sit near the fire little father it is cold popoff laughed and said cold as siberia is it not little brother then he said bare me your arm to the elbow and let me see if our mark is on it still and itch raised his sleeve to the elbow and serge saw that there was a mark upon it burnt deep and black  i thought so said popoff and he laughed but yump the cook beat the fire with a stick so that the sparks flew into popoffs face you are too near the fire little inspector she said it burns  all that evening itch sat in the corner of the kitchen and serge saw that there were tears on his face  why does he cry asked serge  he has been in siberia said yump as she poured water into the great iron pot to make soup for the week after the next  serge grew more thoughtful each year  all sorts of things occurrences of daily life set him thinking one day he saw some peasants drowning a tax collector in the river it made a deep impression on him he couldnt understand it there seemed something wrong about it  why did they drown him he asked of yump the cook  he was collecting taxes said yump and she threw a handful of cups into the cupboard  then one day there was great excitement in the town and men in uniform went to and fro and all the people stood at the doors talking  what has happened asked serge  it is popoff inspector of police answered itch they have found him beside the river  is he dead questioned serge  itch pointed reverently to the groundhe is there he said  all that day serge asked questions but no one would tell him anything popoff is dead they said they have found him beside the river with his ribs driven in on his heart  why did they kill him asked serge  but no one would say  so after this serge was more perplexed than ever  every one noticed how thoughtful serge was  he is a wise boy they said some day he will be a learned man he will read and write  defend us exclaimed itch it is a dangerous thing  one day liddoff the priest came to the house with a great roll of paper in his hand  what is it asked serge  it is the alphabet said liddoff  give it to me said serge with eagerness  not all of it said liddoff gently here is part of it and he tore off a piece and gave it to the boy  defend us said yump the cook it is not a wise thing and she shook her head as she put a new lump of clay in the wooden stove to make it burn more brightly  then everybody knew that serge was learning the alphabet and that when he had learned it he was to go to moscow to the teknik and learn what else there was  so the days passed and the months presently ivan ivanovitch said now he is ready and he took down a bag of rubles that was concealed on a shelf beside the wooden stove in the kitchen and counted them out after the russian fashion ten ten and yet ten and still ten and ten till he could count no further  protect us said yump now he is rich and she poured oil and fat mixed with sand into the bread and beat it with a stick  he must get ready they said he must buy clothes soon he will go to moscow to the teknik and become a wise man  now it so happened that there came one day to the door a drosky or onehorse carriage and in it was a man and beside him a girl the man stopped to ask the way from itch who pointed down the post road over the plain but his hand trembled and his knees shook as he showed the way for the eyes of the man who asked the way were dark with hate and cruel with power and he wore a uniform and there was brass upon his cap but serge looked only at the girl and there was no hate in her eyes but only a great burning and a look that went far beyond the plain serge knew not where and as serge looked the girl turned her face and their eyes met and he knew that he would never forget her and he saw in her face that she would never forget him for that is love  who is that he asked as he went back again with itch into the house  it is kwartz chief of police said itch and his knees still trembled as he spoke  where is he taking her said serge  to moscow to the prison answered itch there they will hang her and she will die  who is she asked serge what has she done and as he spoke he could still see the girls face and the look upon it and a great fire went sweeping through his veins  she is olga ileyitch answered itch she made the bomb that killed popoff the inspector and now they will hang her and she will die  defend us murmured yump as she heaped more clay upon the stove     chapter ii  serge went to moscow he entered the teknik he became a student he learned geography from stoj the professor astrography from fudj the assistant together with giliodesy orgastrophy and other native russian studies  all day he worked his industry was unflagging his instructors were enthusiastic if he goes on like this they said he will some day know something  it is marvellous said one if he continues thus he will be a professor  he is too young said stoj shaking his head he has too much hair  he sees too well said fudj let him wait till his eyes are weaker  but all day as serge worked he thought and his thoughts were of olga ileyitch the girl that he had seen with kwartz inspector of police he wondered why she had killed popoff the inspector he wondered if she was dead there seemed no justice in it  one day he questioned his professor  is the law just he said is it right to kill  but stoj shook his head and would not answer  let us go on with our orgastrophy he said and he trembled so that the chalk shook in his hand  so serge questioned no further but he thought more deeply still all the way from the teknik to the house where he lodged he was thinking as he climbed the stair to his attic room he was still thinking  the house in which serge lived was the house of madame vasselitch it was a tall dark house in a sombre street there were no trees upon the street and no children played there and opposite to the house of madame vasselitch was a building of stone with windows barred that was always silent in it were no lights and no one went in or out  what is it serge asked  it is the house of the dead answered madame vasselitch and she shook her head and would say no more  the husband of madame vasselitch was dead no one spoke of him in the house were only students most of them were wild fellows as students are at night they would sit about the table in the great room drinking kwas made from sawdust fermented in syrup or golgol the russian absinth made by dipping a gooseberry in a bucket of soda water then they would play cards laying matches on the table and betting ten ten and yet ten till all the matches were gone then they would say there are no more matches let us dance and they would dance upon the floor till madame vasselitch would come to the room a candle in her hand and say little brothers it is ten oclock go to bed then they went to bed they were wild fellows as all students are  but there were two students in the house of madame vasselitch who were not wild they were brothers they lived in a long room in the basement it was so low that it was below the street  the brothers were pale with long hair they had deepset eyes they had but little money madame vasselitch gave them food eat little sons she would say you must not die  the brothers worked all day they were real students one brother was halfoff he was taller than the other and stronger the other brother was kwitoff he was not so tall as halfoff and not so strong  one day serge went to the room of the brothers the brothers were at work halfoff sat at a table there was a book in front of him  what is it asked serge  it is solid geometry said halfoff and there was a gleam in his eyes  why do you study it said serge  to free russia said halfoff  and what book have you said serge to kwitoff  hamblin smiths elementary trigonometry said kwitoff and he quivered like a leaf  what does it teach asked serge  freedom said kwitoff  the two brothers looked at one another  shall we tell him everything said halfoff  not yet said kwitoff let him learn first later he shall know  after that serge often came to the room of the two brothers  the two brothers gave him books read them they said  what are they asked serge  they are in english said kwitoff they are forbidden books they are not allowed in russia but in them is truth and freedom  give me one said serge  take this said kwitoff carry it under your cloak let no one see it  what is it asked serge trembling in spite of himself  it is caldwells pragmatism said the brothers  is it forbidden asked serge  the brothers looked at him  it is death to read it they said  after that serge came each day and got books from halfoff and kwitoff at night he read them they fired his brain all of them were forbidden books no one in russia might read them serge read hamblin smiths algebra he read it all through from cover to cover feverishly he read murrays calculus it set his brain on fire can this be true he asked  the books opened a new world to serge  the brothers often watched him as he read  shall we tell him everything said halfoff  not yet said kwitoff he is not ready  one night serge went to the room of the two brothers they were not working at their books littered about the room were blacksmiths tools and wires and pieces of metal lying on the floor there was a crucible and underneath it a blue fire that burned fiercely beside it the brothers worked serge could see their faces in the light of the flame  shall we tell him now said kwitoff the other brother nodded  tell him now he said  little brother said kwitoff and he rose from beside the flame and stood erect for he was tall will you give your life  what for asked serge  the brothers shook their heads  we cannot tell you that they said that would be too much will you join us  in what asked serge  we must not say said the brothers we can only ask are you willing to help our enterprise with all your power and with your life if need be  what is your enterprise asked serge  we must not divulge it they said only this will you give your life to save another life to save russia  serge paused he thought of olga ileyitch only to save her life would he have given his  i cannot he answered  good night little brother said kwitoff gently and he turned back to his work  thus the months passed  serge studied without ceasing if there is truth he thought i shall find it all the time he thought of olga ileyitch his face grew pale justice justice he thought what is justice and truth     chapter iii  now when serge had been six months in the house of madame vasselitch ivan ivanovitch his father sent itch the serving man and yump the cook his wife to moscow to see how serge fared and ivan first counted out rubles into a bag ten and ten and still ten till itch said it is enough i will carry that  then they made ready to go itch took a duck from the pond and put a fish in his pocket together with a fragrant cheese and a bundle of sweet garlic and yump took oil and dough and mixed it with tar and beat it with an iron bar so as to shape it into a pudding  so they went forth on foot walking till they came to moscow  it is a large place said itch and he looked about him at the lights and the people  defend us said yump it is no place for a woman  fear nothing said itch looking at her  so they went on looking for the house of madame vasselitch  how bright the lights are said itch and he stood still and looked about him then he pointed at a burleski or theatre let us go in there and rest he said  no said yump let us hurry on  you are tired said itch give me the pudding and hurry forward so that you may sleep i will come later bringing the pudding and the fish  i am not tired said yump  so they came at last to the house of madame vasselitch and when they saw serge they said how tall he is and how well grown but they thought he is pale ivan ivanoviteh must know  and itch said here are the rubles sent by ivan ivanovitch count them little son and see that they are right  how many should there be said serge  i know not said itch you must count them and see  then yump said here is a pudding little son and a fish and a duck and a cheese and garlic  so that night itch and yump stayed in the house of madame vasselitch  you are tired said itch you must sleep  i am not tired said yump it is only that my head aches and my face burns from the wind and the sun  i will go forth said itch and find a fisski or drugstore and get something for your face  stay where you are said yump and itch stayed  meantime serge had gone upstairs with the fish and the duck and the cheese and the pudding as he went up he thought it is selfish to eat alone i will give part of the fish to the others and when he got a little further up the steps he thought i will give them all of the fish and when he got higher still he thought they shall have everything  then he opened the door and came into the big room where the students were playing with matches at the big table and drinking golgol out of cups here is food brothers he said take it i need none  the students took the food and they cried rah rah and beat the fish against the table but the pudding they would not take we have no axe they said keep it  then they poured out golgol for serge and said drink it  but serge would not  i must work he said and all the students laughed he wants to work they cried rah rah  but serge went up to his room and lighted his taper made of string dipped in fat and set himself to study i must work he repeated  so serge sat at his books it got later and the house grew still the noise of the students below ceased and then everything was quiet  serge sat working through the night then presently it grew morning and the dark changed to twilight and serge could see from his window the great building with the barred windows across the street standing out in the grey mist of the morning  serge had often studied thus through the night and when it was morning he would say it is morning and would go down and help madame vasselitch unbar the iron shutters and unchain the door and remove the bolts from the window casement  but on this morning as serge looked from his window his eyes saw a figure behind the barred window opposite to him it was the figure of a girl and she was kneeling on the floor and she was in prayer for serge could see that her hands were before her face and as he looked all his blood ran warm to his head and his limbs trembled even though he could not see the girls face then the girl rose from her knees and turned her face towards the bars and serge knew that it was olga ileyitch and that she had seen and known him  then he came down the stairs and madame vasselitch was there undoing the shutters and removing the nails from the window casing  what have you seen little son she asked and her voice was gentle for the face of serge was pale and his eyes were wide  but serge did not answer the question  what is that house he said the great building with the bars that you call the house of the dead  shall i tell you little son said madame vasselitch and she looked at him still thinking yes she said he shall know  it is the prison of the condemned and from there they go forth only to die listen little son she went on and she gripped serge by the wrist till he could feel the bones of her fingers against his flesh there lay my husband vangorod vasselitch waiting for his death months long he was there behind the bars and no one might see him or know when he was to die i took this tall house that i might at least be near him till the end but to those who lie there waiting for their death it is allowed once and once only that they may look out upon the world and this is allowed to them the day before they die so i took this house and waited and each day i looked forth at dawn across the street and he was not there then at last he came i saw him at the window and his face was pale and set and i could see the marks of the iron on his wrists as he held them to the bars but i could see that his spirit was unbroken there was no power in them to break that then he saw me at the window and thus across the narrow street we said goodbye it was only a moment sonia vasselitch he said do not forget and he was gone i have not forgotten i have lived on here in this dark house and i have not forgotten my sonsyes little brother my sons i sayhave not forgotten now tell me sergius ivanovitch what you have seen  i have seen the woman that i love said serge kneeling behind the bars in prayer i have seen olga ileyitch  her name said madame vasselitch and there were no tears in her eyes and her voice was calm her name is olga vasselitch she is my daughter and tomorrow she is to die     chapter iv  madame vasselitch took serge by the hand  come she said you shall speak to my sons and she led him down the stairs towards the room of halfoff and kwitoff  they are my sons she said olga is their sister they are working to save her  then she opened the door halfoff and kwitoff were working as serge had seen them before beside the crucible with the blue flame on their faces  they had not slept  madame vasselitch spoke  he has seen olga she said it is today  we are too late said halfoff and he groaned  courage brother said kwitoff she will not die till sunrise it is twilight now we have still an hour let us to work  serge looked at the brothers  tell me he said i do not understand  halfoff turned a moment from his work and looked at serge  brother he said will you give your life  is it for olga asked serge  it is for her  i give it gladly said serge  listen then said halfoff our sister is condemned for the killing of popoff inspector of police she is in the prison of the condemned the house of the dead across the street her cell is there beside us there is only a wall between look  halfoff as he spoke threw aside a curtain that hung across the end of the room serge looked into blackness it was a tunnel  it leads to the wall of her cell said halfoff we are close against the wall but we cannot shatter it we are working to make a bomb no bomb that we can make is hard enough we can only try once if it fails the noise would ruin us there is no second chance we try our bombs in the crucible they crumble they have no strength we are ignorant we are only learning we studied it in the books the forbidden books it took a month to learn to set the wires to fire the bomb the tunnel was there we did not have to dig it it was for my father vangorod vasselitch he would not let them use it he tapped a message through the wall keep it for a greater need now it is his daughter that is there  halfoff paused he was panting and his chest heaved there was perspiration on his face and his black hair was wet  courage little brother said kwitoff she shall not die  listen went on halfoff the bomb is made it is there beside the crucible it has power in it to shatter the prison but the wires are wrong they do not work there is no current in them something is wrong we cannot explode the bomb  courage courage said kwitoff and his hands were busy among the wires before him i am working still  serge looked at the brothers  is that the bomb he said pointing at a great ball of metal that lay beside the crucible  it is said halfoff  and the little fuse that is in the side of it fires it and the current from the wires lights the fuse  yes said halfoff  the two brothers looked at serge for there was a meaning in his voice and a strange look upon his face  if the bomb is placed against the wall and if the fuse is lighted it would explode  yes said halfoff despairingly but how the fuse is instantaneous without the wires we cannot light it it would be death  serge took the bomb in his hand his face was pale  let it be so he said i will give my life for hers  he lifted the bomb in his hand i will go through the tunnel and hold the bomb against the wall and fire it he said halfoff light me the candle in the flame be ready when the wall falls  no no said halfoff grasping serge by the arm you must not die  my brother said kwitoff quietly let it be as he says it is for russia  but as halfoff turned to light the candle in the flame there came a great knocking at the door above and the sound of many voices in the street  all paused  madame vasselitch laid her hand upon her lips  then there came the sound as of grounded muskets on the pavement of the street and a sharp word of command  soldiers said madame vasselitch  kwitoff turned to his brother  this is the end he said explode the bomb here and let us die together  suddenly madame vasselitch gave a cry  it is olgas voice she said  she ran to the door and opened it and a glad voice was heard crying  it is i olga and i am free  free exclaimed the brothers  all hastened up the stairs  olga was standing before them in the hall and beside her were the officers of the police and in the street were the soldiers the students from above had crowded down the stairs and with them were itch the serving man and yump the cook  i am free cried olga liberated by the bounty of the czarrussia has declared war to fight for the freedom of the world and all the political prisoners are free  rah rah cried the students war war war  she is set free said the officer who stood beside olga the charge of killing popoff is withdrawn no one will be punished for it now  i never killed him said olga i swear it and she raised her hand  you never killed him exclaimed serge with joy in his heart you did not kill popoff but who did  defend us said yump the cook since there is to be no punishment for it i killed him myself  you they cried  it is so said yump i killed him beside the river it was to defend my honour  it was to defend her honour cried the brothers she has done well  they clasped her hand  you destroyed him with a bomb they said  no said yump i sat down on him  rah rah rah said the students  there was silence for a moment then kwitoff spoke  friends he said the new day is coming the dawn is breaking the moon is rising the stars are setting it is the birth of freedom see we need it notand as he spoke he grasped in his hands the bomb with its still unlighted fuserussia is free we are all brothers now let us cast it at our enemies

to go now other people are going     v the call of the carburettor or    mr blinks and his friends  first get a motor in your own eye and then you will overlook more easily the motor in your brothers eyesomewhere in the bible  by all means lets have a reception said mrs blinks its the quickest and nicest way to meet our old friends again after all these years and goodness knows this house is big enough for itshe gave a glance as she spoke round the big receptionroom of the blinkses residenceand these servants seem to understand things so perfectly its no trouble to us to give anything only dont lets ask a whole lot of chattering young people that we dont know lets have the older people the ones that can talk about something really worth while  thats just what i say answered mr blinkshe was a small man with insignificance written all over himlet me listen to people talk thats what i like im not much on the social side myself but i do enjoy hearing good talk thats what i liked so much over in england all themall those people that we used to meet talked so well and in france those ladies that run saloons on sunday afternoons  sallongs corrected mrs blinks its sounded like it was a g she picked up a pencil and paper well then she said as she began to write down names well ask judge ponderus  sure assented mr blinks rubbing his hands hes a fine talker if hell come  theyll all come said his wife to a house as big as this and well ask the rev dr domb and his wifeor no hes archdeacon domb now i hearand hell invite bishop sollem so they can talk together  thatll be good said mr blinks i remember years and years ago hearing them twothose two talking about religion all about the soul and the body man it was deep it was clean beyond me thats what i like to listen to  and professor potofax from the college went on mrs blinks you remember the big stout one  i know said her husband  and his daughter shes musical and mrs buncomtalk shes a great light on woman suffrage and miss scragg and mr underdonethey both write poetry so they can talk about that  itll be a great treat to listen to them all said mr blinks  a week later on the day of the blinkses reception there was a string of motors three deep along a line of a hundred yards in front of the house  inside the reception rooms were filled  mr blinks insignificant even in his own house moved to and fro among his guests  archdeacon domb and dean sollem were standing side by side with their heads gravely lowered as they talked over the cups of tea that they held in their hands  mr blinks edged towards them  thisll be something pretty good he murmured to himself as he got within reach of their conversation  what do you do about your body the archdeacon was asking in his deep solemn tones  practically nothing said the bishop a little rub of shellac now and then but practically nothing  you wash it of course asked dr domb  only now and again but far less than you would think i really take very little thought for my body  ah said dr domb reflectively i went all over mine last summer with linseed oil  but didnt you find said the bishop that it got into your pipes and choked your feed  it did said dr domb munching a bit of toast as he spoke in fact i have had a lot of trouble with my feed ever since  try flushing your pipes out with hot steam said the bishop mr blinks had listened in something like dismay  motorcars he murmured whod have thought it  but at this moment a genial heartylooking person came pushing towards him with a cheery greeting  im afraid im rather late blinks he said  delayed in court eh judge said blinks as he shook hands  no blew out a plug said the judge stalled me right up  blew out a plug exclaimed dr domb and the bishop deeply interested at once  a cracked insulator i think said the judge  possibly said the archdeacon very gravely the terminal nuts of your dry battery were loose  mr blinks moved slowly away  dear me he mused how changed they are  it was a relief to him to edge his way quietly into another group of guests where he felt certain that the talk would be of quite another kind  professor potofax and miss scragg and a number of others were evidently talking about books  a beautiful book the professor was saying one of the best things to my mind at any rate that has appeared for years theres a chapter on the silencing of exhaust gas which is simply marvellous  is it illustrated questioned one of the ladies  splendidly said the professor among other things there are sectional views of check valves and flexible roller bearings  ah do tell me about the flexible bearings murmured miss scragg  mr blinks moved on  wherever he went among his guests they all seemed stricken with the same mania he caught their conversation in little scraps  i ran her up to forty with the greatest of ease then threw in my high speed and got seventy out of her without any troubleno i simply used a socket wrench it answers perfectlyyes a solution of calcium chloride is very good but of course the hydrochloric acid in it has a powerful effect on the metal  dear me mused mr blinks are they all mad  meantime around his wife who stood receiving in state at one end of the room the guests surged to and fro  so charmed to see you again exclaimed one youve been in europe a long time havent you oh mostly in the south of england are the roads good last year my husband and i went all through shakespeares country its just delightful they sprinkle it so thoroughly and stratfordonavon itself is just a treat its all oiled every bit of it except the little road by shakespeares house but we didnt go along that then later we went up to the lake district but its not so good they dont oil it  she floated away to give place to another lady  in france every summer she exclaimed oh how perfectly lovely dont you think the french cars simply divine my husband thinks the french body is far better modelled than ours he saw ever so many of them he thought of bringing one over with him but it costs such a lot to keep them in good order  the theatres said another lady how you must have enjoyed them i just love the theatres last week my husband and i were at the palatialits moving pictureswhere they have that film with the motor collision running its just wonderful you see the motors going at full speed and then smash right into one anotherand all the people killedits really fine  have they all gone insane said mr blinks to his wife after the guests had gone  dreadful isnt it she assented i never was so bored in my life  why they talk of nothing else but their motorcars said blinks weve got to get a car i suppose living at this distance from the town but im hanged if i intend to go clean crazy over it like these people  and the guests as they went home talked of the blinkses  i fear said dr domb to judge ponderus that blinks has hardly profited by his time in europe as much as he ought to have he seems to have observed nothing i was asking him about the new italian touring car that they are using so much in rome he said he had never noticed it and he was there a month  is it possible said the judge where were his eyes  all of which showed that mr and mrs blinks were in danger of losing their friends for ever  but it so happened that about three weeks later blinks came home to his residence in an obvious state of excitement his face was flushed and he had on a silly little round cap with a glazed peak  why clarence cried his wife whatever is the matter  matter he exclaimed there isnt anything the matter i bought a car this morning thats all say its a beauty a regular peach four thousand with ten off i ran it clean round the shed alone first time the chauffeur says he never saw anybody get on to the hang of it so quick get on your hat and come right down to the garage ive got a man waiting there to teach you to run it hurry up  within a week or two after that one might see the blinkses any morning in fact every morning out in their car  good morning judge calls blinks gaily as he passes hows that carburettor actinggood morning archdeacon is that plug trouble of yours all right againhullo professor let me pick you up and ride you up to the college oh its no trouble what do you think of the bearings of this car arent they just dandy  and so mr blinks has got all his friends back again  after all the great thing about being crazy is to be all crazy together     vi the two sexes in fives or sixes     a dinnerparty study  but surely exclaimed the hostess looking defiantly and searchingly through the cut flowers of the centrepiece so that her eye could intimidate in turn all the five men at the table one must admit that women are mens equals in every way  the ladywiththebust tossed her head a little and echoed oh surely  the debutante lifted her big blue eyes a little towards the ceiling with the upward glance that stands for innocence she said nothing waiting for a cue as to what to appear to be  meantime the chief lady guest known to be in suffrage work was pinching up her lips and getting her phrases ready like a harpooner waiting to strike she knew that the hostess meant this as an opening for her  but the soft lady whom men like toyed with a bit of bread on the tablecloth she had a beautiful hand and smiled gently the other women would have called it a simper to the men it stood for profound intelligence  the five men that sat amongst and between the ladies received the challenge of the hostesss speech and answered it each in his own way  from the heavy host at the head of the table there came a kind of deep grunt nothing more he had heard this same talk at each of his dinners that season  there was a similar grunt from the heavy business friend of the host almost as broad and thick as the host himself he knew too what was coming he proposed to stand by his friend man for man he could sympathise the ladywiththebust was his wife  but the half man with the moon face who was known to work side by side with women on committees and who called them comrades echoed  oh surely with deep emphasis  the smooth gentleman there for business reasons exclaimed with great alacrity women equal oh rather  last of all the interesting man with long hair known to write for the magazinesall of thembegan at once  i remember once saying to mrs pankhurst but was overwhelmed in the general conversation before he could say what it was he remembered saying to mrs pankhurst  in other words the dinnerparty at about course number seven had reached the inevitable moment of the discussion of the two sexes  it had begun as dinnerparties do  everybody had talked gloomily to his neighbour over the oysters on one drink of white wine more or less brightly to two people over the fish on two drinks quite brilliantly to three people on three drinks and then the conversation had become general and the european war had been fought through three courses with champagne everybody had taken an extremely broad point of view the heavy business friend had declared himself absolutely impartial and had at once got wet with rage over cotton the chief lady guest had explained that she herself was half english on her mothers side and the ladywith thebust had told how a lady friend of hers had a cousin who had travelled in hungary she admitted that it was some years ago things might have changed since then the interesting man having got the table where he wanted it had said i remember when i was last in sofiaby the way it is pronounced sayahfeeahtalking with radovitchor radeeahvitch as it should be soundedthe foreign secretary on what the sobranjeit is pronounced soophrangeewould be likely to doand by the time he had done with the sobranje no one dared speak of the war any more  but the hostess had got out of it the opening she wanted and she said  at any rate it is wonderful what women have done in the war  and are doing echoed the half man with the moon face  and then it was that the hostess had said that surely every one must admit women are equal to men and the topic of the sexes was started all the women had been waiting for it anyway it is the only topic that women care about even men can stand it provided that fifty per cent or more of the women present are handsome enough to justify it  i hardly see how after all that has happened any rational person could deny for a moment continued the hostess looking straight at her husband and his heavy business friend that women are equal and even superior to men surely our brains are just as good and she gave an almost bitter laugh  dont you think perhaps began the smooth gentleman  no i dont said the hostess youre going to say that we are inferior in things like mathematics or in logical reasoning we are not but after all the only reason why we are is because of training think of the thousands of years that men have been trained answer me that  well might it not be began the smooth gentleman  i dont think so for a moment said the hostess i think if wed only been trained as men have for the last two or three thousand years our brains would be just as well trained for the things they were trained for as they would have been now for the things we have been trained for and in that case wouldnt have dont you agree with me she said turning to the chief lady guest whom she suddenly remembered that after all we think more clearly  here the interesting man who had been silent longer than an interesting man can without apoplexy began  i remember once saying in london to sir charles doosey  but the chief lady guest refused to be checked  weve been gathering some rather interesting statistics she said speaking very firmly syllable by syllable on that point at our settlement we have measured the heads of five hundred factory girls making a chart of them you know and the feet of five hundred domestic servants  and dont you find began the smooth gentleman  no said the chief lady guest firmly we do not but i was going to say that when we take our measurements and reduce them to a scale of a hundredi think you understand me  ah but come now interrupted the interesting man theres nothing really more deceitful than anthropometric measures i remember once saying in london to sir robert bittellthe sir robert bittell you know  here everybody murmured oh yes except the heavy host and his heavy friend who with all their sins were honest men  i said sir robert i want your frank opinion your very frank opinion  but here there was a slight interruption the soft lady accidentally dropped a bangle from her wrist on to the floor now all through the dinner she had hardly said anything but she had listened for twenty minutes from the grapefruit to the fish while the interesting man had told her about his life in honduras it is pronounced hondooras and for another twenty while the smooth gentleman who was a barrister had discussed himself as a pleader and when each of the men had begun to speak in the general conversation she had looked deep into their faces as if hanging on to their words so when she dropped her bangle two of the men leaped from their chairs to get it and the other three made a sort of struggle as they sat by the time it was recovered and replaced upon her arm a very beautiful arm the interesting man was sidetracked and the chief lady guest who had gone on talking during the bangle hunt was heard saying  entirely so that seems to me the greatest difficulty before us so few men are willing to deal with the question with perfect sincerity  she laid emphasis on the word and the half man with the moon face took his cue from it and threw a pose of almost painful sincerity  why is it continued the chief lady guest that men always insist on dealing with us just as if we were playthings just so many dressedup dolls  here the debutante immediately did a doll  if a woman is attractive and beautiful the lady went on so much the better she had no intention of letting go of the doll business entirely but surely you men ought to value us as something more than mere dolls  she might have pursued the topic but at this moment the smooth gentleman who made a rule of standing in all round and had broken into a side conversation with the silent host was overheard to say something about womens sense of humour  the table was in a turmoil in a moment three of the ladies speaking at once to deny a womans sense of humour is the last form of social insult  i entirely disagree with you said the chief lady guest speaking very severely i know it from my own case from my own sense of humour and from observation last week for example we measured no less than seventyfive factory girls  well im sure said the ladywiththebust i dont know what men mean by our not having a sense of humour im sure i have i know i went last week to a vaudeville and i just laughed all through of course i cant read mark twain or anything like that but then i dont call that funny do you she concluded turning to the hostess  but the hostess feeling somehow that the ground was dangerous had already risen and in a moment more the ladies had floated out of the room and upstairs to the drawingroom where they spread themselves about in easy chairs in billows of pretty coloured silk  how charming it is the chief lady guest began to find men coming so entirely to our point of view do you know it was so delightful tonight i hardly heard a word of dissent or contradiction  thus they talked except the soft lady who had slipped into a seat by herself with an album over her knees and with an empty chair on either side of her there she waited  meantime down below the men had shifted into chairs to one end of the table and the heavy host was shoving cigars at them thick as ropes and passing the port wine with his big fist round the neck of the decanter but for his success in life he could have had a place as a bar tender anywhere  none of them spoke till the cigars were well alight  then the host said very deliberately taking each word at his leisure with smoke in between  of coursethissuffrage business  tommyrot exclaimed the smooth gentleman with great alacrity his mask entirely laid aside  damn foolishness gurgled the heavy business friend sipping his port  of course you cant really discuss it with women murmured the host  oh no assented all the others even the half man sipped his wine and turned traitor there being no one to see  you see said the host if my wife likes to go to meetings and be on committees why i dont stop her  neither do i mine said the heavy friend it amuses her so i let her do it his wife the ladywiththebust was safely out of hearing  i remember once began the interesting man saying tohe paused a moment for the others were looking at himanother man that if women did get the vote theyd never use it anyway all they like is being talked about for not getting it  after which having exhausted the woman question the five men turned to such bigger subjects as the fall in sterling exchange and the presidents seventeenth note to germany  then presently they went upstairs and when they reached the door of the drawingroom a keen observer or indeed any kind of observer might have seen that all five of them made an obvious advance towards the two empty seats beside the soft lady     vii the grass bachelors guide      with sincere apologies to the ladies periodicals  there are periods in the life of every married man when he is turned for the time being into a grass bachelor  this happens for instance in the summer time when his wife is summering by the sea and he himself is simmering in the city it happens also in the autumn when his wife is in virginia playing golf in order to restore her shattered nerves after the fatigues of the seaside it occurs again in november when his wife is in the adirondacks to get the benefit of the altitude and later on through the winter when she is down in florida to get the benefit of the latitude the breaking up of the winter being notoriously a trying time on the system any reasonable man is apt to consent to his wifes going to california in the later spring the season of the bursting flowers and the young buds every woman likes to be with her mother in the country it is not fair to stop her  it thus happens that at various times of the year a great number of men unable to leave their business are left to their own resources as housekeepers in their deserted houses and apartments it is for their benefit that i have put together these hints on housekeeping for men it may be that in composing them i owe something to the current number of the leading womens magazines if so i need not apologise i am sure that in these days we men all feel that we men and we women are so much alike or at least those of us who call ourselves so that we need feel no jealousy when we men and we women are striving each or both in the same direction if in opposite ways i hope that i make myself clear i am sure i do  so i feel that if we men who are left alone in our houses and apartments in the summertime would only set ourselves to it we could make life not only a little brighter for ourselves but also a little less bright for those about us  nothing contributes to this end so much as good housekeeping the first thing for the housekeeper to realise is that it is impossible for him to attend to his housekeeping in the stiff and unbecoming garments of his business hours when he begins his day he must therefore carefully consider     what to wear before dressing  the simplest and best thing will be found to be a plain sacque or kimono cut very full so as to allow of the freest movement and buttoned either down the front or back or both if the sleeve is cut short at the elbow and ruffled above the bare arm the effect is both serviceable and becoming it will be better especially for such work as lighting the gas range and boiling water to girdle the kimono with a simple yet effective rope or tasselled silk which may be drawn in or let out according to the amount of water one wishes to boil a simple kimono of this sort can be bought almost anywhere for 250 or can be supplied by messrs einstein  fickelbrot see advertising pages for twentyfive dollars  having a kimono such as this our housekeeper can either button himself into it with a buttonhook very good ones are supplied by messrs einstein  fickelbrot see ad at a very reasonable price or even higher or better still he can summon the janitor of the apartment who can button him up quite securely in a few minutes time a quarter of an hour at the most we men cannot impress upon ourselves too strongly that for efficient housekeeping time is everything and that much depends on quiet effective movement from place to place or from any one place to any number of other places we are now ready to consider the allimportant question     what to select for breakfast  our housekeeper will naturally desire something that is simple and easily cooked yet at the same time sustaining and invigorating and containing a maximum of food value with a minimum of cost if he is wise he will realise that the food ought to contain a proper quantity of both proteids and amygdaloids and while avoiding a nitrogenous breakfast should see to it that he obtains sufficient of what is albuminous and exogamous to prevent his breakfast from becoming monotonous careful thought must therefore be given to the breakfast menu  for the purpose of thinking a simple but very effective costume may be devised by throwing over the kimono itself a thin lace shawl with a fichu carried high above the waistline and terminating in a plain insertion a bit of old lace thrown over the housekeepers head is at once serviceable and becoming and will help to keep the dust out of his brain while thinking what to eat for breakfast  very naturally our housekeepers first choice will be some kind of cereal the simplest and most economical breakfast of this kind can be secured by selecting some cereal or grain foodsuch as oats flax split peas that have been carefully strained in the colander or beans that have been fired off in a gun any of these cereals may be bought for ten cents a pound at a grocersor obtained from messrs einstein  fickelbrot for a dollar a pound or more supposing then that we have decided upon a pound of split peas as our breakfast the next task that devolves upon our housekeeper is to     go out and buy it  here our advice is simple but positive shopping should never be done over the telephone or by telegraph the good housekeeper instead of telegraphing for his food will insist on seeing his food himself and will eat nothing that he does not first see before eating this is a cardinal rule for the moment then the range must be turned low while our housekeeper sallies forth to devote himself to his breakfast shopping the best costume for shopping is a simple but effective suit cut in plain lines either square or crosswise and buttoned wherever there are buttonholes a simple hat of some dark material may be worn together with plain boots drawn up well over the socks and either laced or left unlaced no harm is done if a touch of colour is added by carrying a geranium in the hand we are now ready for the street     test of effective shopping  here we may say at once that the crucial test is that we must know what we want why we want it where we want it and what it is time as we men are only too apt to forget is everything and since our aim is now a pound of split peas we must as we sally forth think of a pound of split peas and only a pound a cheery salutation may be exchanged with other morning shoppers as we pass along but only exchanged split peas being for the moment our prime business we must as rapidly and unobtrusively as possible visit those shops and only those shops where split peas are to be had  having found the split peas our housekeepers next task is to pay for them this he does with money that may be either carried in the hand or better tucked into a simple etui or dodu that can be carried at the wrist or tied to the ankle the order duly given our housekeeper gives his address for the delivery of the peas and then as quietly and harmlessly as possible returns to his apartment his next office and a most important one it is is now ready to be performed this new but necessary duty is     waiting for the delivery van  a good costume for waiting for the delivery van in is a simple brown suit slashed with yellow and purple and sliced or gored from the hip to the feet as time is everything the housekeeper after having put on his slashed costume for waiting for the delivery van may set himself to the performance of a number of light household tasks at the same time looking occasionally from the window so as to detect the arrival of the van as soon as possible after it has arrived among other things he may now feed his canary by opening its mouth with a buttonhook and dropping in coffee beans till the little songster shows by its gratified air that it is full a little time may be well spent among the flowers and bulbs of the apartment clipping here a leaf and here a stem and removing the young buds and bugs for work among the flowers a light pair of rather long scissors say a foot long can be carried at the girdle or attached to the etui and passed over the shoulder with a looped cord so as to fall in an easy and graceful fold across the back the moment is now approaching when we may expect     the arrival of the van  the housekeeper will presently discover the van drawn up in the front of the apartment and its driver curled up on the seat now is the moment of activity hastily throwing on a peignoir the housekeeper descends and receiving his parcel reascends to his apartment the whole descent and reascent is made quickly quietly and if possible only once     putting the peas to soak  remember that unsoaked peas are hard forcible and surcharged with a nitrogenous amygdaloid that is in reality what chemical science calls putrate of lead on the other hand peas that are soaked become large voluble textile and while extremely palatable are none the less rich in glycerine starch and other lacteroids and bactifera to contain the required elements of nutrition split peas must be soaked for two hours in fresh water and afterwards boiled for an hour and a quarter eightyfive minutes  it is now but the work of a moment to lift the saucepan of peas from the fire strain them through a colander pass them thence into a net or bag rinse them in cold water and then spread the whole appetising mass on a platter and carry it on a fireshovel to the diningroom as it is now about six oclock in the evening our housekeeper can either     telephone to his club    and order a thin soup    with a bite of fish    two lamb chops with asparagus    and send word also    for a pint of moselle    to be laid on ice  or he can sit down and eat those dn peas     we know which he will do     viii every man and his friends mr crunchs       portrait gallery as edited from his private thoughts   i his views on his employer  a mean man i say it of course without any prejudice and without the slightest malice but the man is mean small i think is the word i am not thinking of course of my own salary it is not a matter that i would care to refer to though as a matter of fact one would think that after fifteen years of work an application for an increase of five hundred dollars is the kind of thing that any man ought to be glad to meet halfway not that i bear the man any malice for it none if he died tomorrow no one would regret his death as genuinely as i would if he fell into the river and got drowned or if he fell into a sewer and suffocated or if he got burned to death in a gas explosion there are a lot of things that might happen to him i should feel genuinely sorry to see him cut off  but what strikes me more than the mans smallness is his incompetence the man is absolutely no good its not a thing that i would say outside as a matter of fact i deny it every time i hear it though every man in town knows it how that man ever got the position he has is more than i can tell and as for holding it he couldnt hold it half a day if it werent that the rest of us in the office do practically everything for him  why ive seen him send out letters i wouldnt say this to anyone outside of course and i wouldnt like to have it repeatedletters with actually mistakes in english think of it in english ask his stenographer  i often wonder why i go on working for him there are dozens of other companies that would give anything to get me only the other dayits not ten years agoi had an offer or practically an offer to go to japan selling bibles i often wish now i had taken it i believe id like the japanese theyre gentlemen the japanese they wouldnt turn a man down after slaving away for fifteen years  i often think ill quit him i say to my wife that that man had better not provoke me too far or some day ill just step into his office and tell him exactly what i think of him id like to i often say it over to myself in the street car coming home  hed better be careful thats all     ii the minister whose church he attends  a dull man dull is the only word i can think of that exactly describes himdull and prosy i dont say that he is not a good man he may be i dont say that he is not i have never seen any sign of it if he is but i make it a rule never to say anything to take away a mans character  and his sermons really that sermon he gave last sunday on esau seemed to me the absolute limit i wish you could have heard it i mean to saydrivel i said to my wife and some friends as we walked away from the church that a sermon like that seemed to me to come from the dregs of the human intellect mind you i dont believe in criticising a sermon i always feel it a sacred obligation never to offer a word of criticism when i say that the sermon was punk i dont say it as criticism i merely state it as a fact and to think that we pay that man eighteen hundred dollars a year and hes in debt all the time at that what does he do with it he cant spend it its not as if he had a large family theyve only four children its just a case of sheer extravagance he runs about all the time last year it was a trip to a synod meeting at new yorkaway four whole days and two years before that dashing off to a scripture conference at boston and away nearly a whole week and his wife with him  what i say is that if a mans going to spend his time gadding about the country like thathere today and there tomorrowhow on earth can he attend to his parochial duties  im a religious man at least i trust i am i believe and more and more as i get olderin eternal punishment i see the need of it when i look about me as i say i trust i am a religious man but when it comes to subscribing fifty dollars as they want us to to get the man out of debt i say no  true religion as i see it is not connected with money     iii his partner at bridge  the man is a complete ass how a man like that has the nerve to sit down at a bridge table i dont know i wouldnt mind if the man had any ideaeven the faintest ideaof how to play but he hasnt any three times i signalled to him to throw the lead into my hand and he wouldnt i knew that our only ghost of a chance was to let me do all the playing but the ass couldnt see it he even had the supreme nerve to ask me what i meant by leading diamonds when he had signalled that he had none i couldnt help asking him as politely as i could why he had disregarded my signal for spades he had the gall to ask in reply why i had overlooked his signal for clubs in the second hand round the very time mind you when i had led a three spot as a sign to him to let me play the whole game i couldnt help saying to him at the end of the evening in a tone of such evident satire that anyone but an ass would have recognised it that i had seldom had as keen an evening at cards  but he didnt see it the irony of it was lost on him the jackass merely saidquite amiably and unconsciously that he thought id play a good game presently me play a good game presently  i gave him a look just one look as i went out but i dont think he saw it he was talking to some one else     iv his hostess at dinner  on what principle that woman makes up her dinner parties is more than human brain can devise mind you i like going out to dinner to my mind its the very best form of social entertainment but i like to find myself among people that can talk not among a pack of numbskulls what i like is good general conversation about things worth talking about but among a crowd of idiots like that what can you expect youd think that even society people would be interested or pretend to be in real things but not a bit i had hardly started to talk about the rate of exchange on the german mark in relation to the fall of sterling billsa thing that you would think a whole table full of people would be glad to listen towhen first thing i knew the whole lot of them had ceased paying any attention and were listening to an insufferable ass of an englishmani forget his name youd hardly suppose that just because a man has been in flanders and has his arm in a sling and has to have his food cut up by the butler thats any reason for having a whole table full of people listening to him and especially the women they have a way of listening to a fool like that with their elbows on the table that is positively sickening  i felt that the whole thing was out of taste and tried in vain in one of the pauses to give a lead to my hostess by referring to the prospect of a shipping subsidy bill going through to offset the register of alien ships but she was too utterly dense to take it up she never even turned her head all through dinner that ass talked he and that silly young actor theyre always asking there that is perpetually doing imitations of the vaudeville people that kind of thing may be all right for those who care for iti frankly dontoutside a theatre but to my mind the idea of trying to throw people into fits of laughter at a dinnertable is simply execrable taste i cannot see the sense of people shrieking with laughter at dinner i have i suppose a better sense of humour than most people but to my mind a humourous story should be told quietly and slowly in a way to bring out the point of the humour and to make it quite clear by preparing for it with proper explanations but with people like that i find i no sooner get well started with a story than some fool or other breaks in i had a most amusing experience the other daythat is about fifteen years agoat a summer hotel in the adirondacks that one would think would have amused even a shallow lot of people like those but i had no sooner started to tell itor had hardly done more than to describe the adirondacks in a general waythan first thing i know my hostess stupid woman had risen and all the ladies were trooping out  as to getting in a word edgeways with the men over the cigarsperfectly impossible theyre worse than the women they were all buzzing round the infernal englishman with questions about flanders and the army at the front i tried in vain to get their attention for a minute to give them my impressions of the belgian peasantry during my visit there in 1885 but my host simply turned to me for a second and said have some more port and was back again listening to the asinine englishman  and when we went upstairs to the drawingroom i found myself to my disgust sidetracked in a corner of the room with that supreme old jackass of a professortheir uncle i think or something of the sort in all my life i never met a prosier man he bored me blue with long accounts of his visit to serbia and his impressions of the serbian peasantry in 1875  i should have left early but it would have been too noticeable  the trouble with a woman like that is that she asks the wrong people to her parties   but  v his little son  you havent seen him why thats incredible you must have he goes past your house every day on his way to his kindergarten you must have seen him a thousand times and hes a boy you couldnt help noticing youd pick that boy out among a hundred right away theres a remarkable boy youd say i notice people always turn and look at him on the street hes just the image of me everybody notices it at once  how old hes twelve twelve and two weeks yesterday but hes so bright youd think he was fifteen and the things he says youd laugh ive written a lot of them down in a book for fear of losing them some day when you come up to the house ill read them to you come some evening come early so that well have lots of time he said to me one day dad he always calls me dad what makes the sky blue pretty thoughtful eh for a little fellow of twelve hes always asking questions like that i wish i could remember half of them  and im bringing him up right i tell you i got him a little savings box a while ago and have got him taught to put all his money in it and not give any of it away so that when he grows up hell be all right  on his last birthday i put a five dollar gold piece into it for him and explained to him what five dollars meant and what a lot you could do with it if you hung on to it you ought to have seen him listen  dad he says i guess youre the kindest man in the world arent you  come up some time and see him     ix more than twicetold tales or     every man his own hero  i  the familiar story told about himself by the commercial traveller who sold goods to the man who was regarded as impossible  what they said youre getting off at midgeville youre going to give the jones hardware company a try ehand then they all started laughing and giving me the merry ha ha well i just got my grip packed and didnt say a thing and when the train slowed up for midgeville out i slid give my love to old man jones one of the boys called after me and get yourself a couple of porous plasters and a pair of splints before you tackle himand then they all gave me the ha ha again out of the window as the train pulled out  well i walked uptown from the station to the jones hardware company is mr jones in the office i asked of one of the young fellers behind the counter hes in the office he says all right but i guess you cant see him he saysand he looked at my grip what name shall i say says he dont say any name at all i says just open the door and let me in  well there was old man jones sitting scowling over his desk biting his pen in that way he has he looked up when i came in see here young man he says you cant sell me any hardware he says mr jones i says i dont want to sell you any hardware im not here to sell you any hardware i know i says as well as you do i says that i couldnt sell any hardware if i tried to but i says i guess it dont do any harm to open up this sample case and show you some hardware i says young man says he if you start opening up that sample case in here youll lose your time thats alland he turned off sort of sideways and began looking over some letters  thats all right mr jones i says thats all right im here to lose my time but im not going out of this room till you take a look anyway at some of this new cutlery im carrying  so open i throws my sample case right across the end of his desk look at that knife i says mr jones just look at it clear sheffield at threethirty the dozen and theyre a knife that will last till you wear the haft off it oh pshaw he growled i dont want no knives theres nothing in knives  well i knew he didnt want knives see i knew it but the way i opened up the sample case it showed up just by accident so to speak a box of those new electric burnersadjustable you knowtheyll take heat off any size of socket you like and use it for any mortal thing in the house i saw old jones had his eyes on them in a minute whats those things you got there he growls those in the box oh i said thats just a new line i said the boss wanted me to take along some sort of electric rig for heating i said but i dont think theres anything to it but here now mr jones is a spoon ive got on this tripits the new delphide you cant tell that sir from silver no sir i says i defy any man money down to tell that there delphide from genuine refined silver and theyre a spoon thatll last  let me see one of those burners says old man jones breaking in  well sir in about two minutes more i had one of the burners fixed on to the light socket and old jones with his coat off boiling water in a tin cup out of the store and timing it with his watch  the next day i pulled into toledo and went and joined the other boys up to the jefferson house well they says have you got that plaster on and started in to give me the ha ha again oh i dont know i says i guess this is some plaster isnt it and i took out of my pocket an order from old man jones for two thousand adjustable burners at fourtwenty with two off some plaster eh i says  well sir the boys looked sick  old man jones gets all his stuff from our house now oh he aint bad at all when you get to know him    ii  the wellknown story told by the man who has once had a strange psychic experience  what you say about presentiments reminds me of a strange experience that i had myself  i was sitting by myself one night very late reading i dont remember just what it was that i was reading i think it wasor no i dont remember what it was well anyway i was sitting up late reading quietly till it got pretty late on in the night i dont remember just how late it washalfpast two i think or perhaps threeor no i dont remember but anyway i was sitting up by myself very late reading as i say it was late and after all the noises in the street had stopped the house somehow seemed to get awfully still and quiet well all of a sudden i became aware of a sort of strange feelingi hardly know how to describe iti seemed to become aware of something as if something were near me i put down my book and looked around but could see nothing i started to read again but i hadnt read more than a page or say a page and a halfor no not more than a page when again all of a sudden i felt an overwhelming sense ofsomething i cant explain just what the feeling was but a queer sense as if there was something somewhere  well im not of a timorous disposition naturallyat least i dont think i ambut absolutely i felt as if i couldnt stay in the room i got up out of my chair and walked down the stairs in the dark to the diningroom i felt all the way as if some one were following me do you know i was absolutely trembling when i got into the diningroom and got the lights turned on i walked over to the sideboard and poured myself out a drink of whisky and soda as you know i never take anything as a rule or at any rate only when i am sitting round talking as we are nowbut i always like to keep a decanter of whisky in the house and a little soda in case of my wife or one of the children being taken ill in the night  well i took a drink and then i said to myself i said see here im going to see this thing through so i turned back and walked straight upstairs again to my room i fully expected something queer was going to happen and was prepared for it but do you know when i walked into the room again the feeling or presentiment or whatever it was i had had was absolutely gone there was my book lying just where i had left it and the reading lamp still burning on the table just as it had been and my chair just where i had pushed it back but i felt nothing absolutely nothing i sat and waited awhile but i still felt nothing  i went downstairs again to put out the lights in the diningroom i noticed as i passed the sideboard that i was still shaking a little so i took a small drink of whiskythough as a rule i never care to take more than one drinkunless when i am sitting talking as we are here  well i had hardly taken it when i felt an odd sort of psychic feelinga sort of drowsiness i remember in a dim way going to bed and then i remember nothing till i woke up next morning  and heres the strange part of it i had hardly got down to the office after breakfast when i got a wire to tell me that my motherinlaw had broken her arm in cincinnati strange wasnt it no not at halfpast two during that nightthats the inexplicable part of it she had broken it at halfpast eleven the morning before but you notice it was halfpast in each case thats the queer way these things go  of course i dont pretend to explain it i suppose it simply means that i am telepathicthats all i imagine that if i wanted to i could talk with the dead and all that kind of thing but i feel somehow that i dont want to  eh thank you i willthough i seldom take more than thanks thanks thats plenty of soda in it     iii  the familiar narrative in which the successful business man recounts the early struggles by which he made good  no sir i had no early advantages whatever i was brought up plain and hardtry one of these cigars they cost me fifty cents each in fact i practically had no schooling at all when i left school i didnt know how to read not to read good its only since ive been in business that ive learned to write english that is so as to use it right but ill guarantee to say there isnt a man in the shoe business today can write a better letter than i can but all that i know is what ive learned myself why i cant do fractions even now i dont see that a man need and i never learned no geography except what i got for myself off railroad folders i dont believe a man needs more than that anyway ive got my boy at harvard now his mother was set on it but i dont see that he learns anything or nothing that will help him any in business they say they learn them character and manners in the colleges but as i see it a man can get all that just as well in businessis that wine all right if not tell me and ill give the head waiter hell they charge enough for it what youre drinking costs me fourfifty a bottle  but i was starting to tell you about my early start in business i had it good and hard all right why when i struck new yorki was sixteen theni had just eighty cents to my name i lived on it for nearly a week while i was walking round hunting for a job i used to get soup for three cents and roast beef with potatoes all you could eat for eight cents that tasted better than anything i can ever get in this damn club it was down somewhere on sixth avenue but ive forgotten the way to it  well about the sixth day i got a job down in a shoe factory working on a machine i guess youve never seen shoemachinery have you no you wouldnt likely its complicated even in those days there were thirtyfive machines went to the making of a shoe and now we use as many as fiftyfour id never seen the machines before but the foreman took me on you look strong he said ill give you a try anyway  so i started in i didnt know anything but i made good from the first day i got four a week at the start and after two months i got a raise to fourtwentyfive  well after id worked there about three months i went up to the floor manager of the flat i worked on and i said say mr jones do you want to save ten dollars a week on expenses how says he why i said that foreman im working under on the machine ive watched him and i can do his job dismiss him and ill take over his work at half what you pay him can you do the work he says try me out i said fire him and give me a chance well he said i like your spirit anyway youve got the right sort of stuff in you  so he fired the foreman and i took over the job and held it down it was hard at first but i worked twelve hours a day and studied up a book on factory machinery at night well after id been on that work for about a year i went in one day to the general manager downstairs and i said mr thompson do you want to save about a hundred dollars a month on your overhead costs how can i do that says he sit down why i said you dismiss mr jones and give me his place as manager of the floor and ill undertake to do his work and mine with it at a hundred less than youre paying now he turned and went into the inner office and i could hear him talking to mr evans the managing director the young fellow certainly has character i heard him say then he came out and he said well were going to give you a try anyway we like to help out our employes all we can you know and youve got the sort of stuff in you that were looking for  so they dismissed jones next day and i took over his job and did it easy it was nothing anyway the higher up you get in business the easier it is if you know how i held that job two years and i saved all my salary except twentyfive dollars a month and i lived on that i never spent any money anyway i went once to see irving do this macbeth for twentyfive cents and once i went to a concert and saw a man play the violin for fifteen cents in the gallery but i dont believe you get much out of the theatre anyway as i see it theres nothing to it  well after a while i went one day to mr evanss office and i said mr evans i want you to dismiss mr thompson the general manager why whats he done he says nothing i said but i can take over his job on top of mine and you can pay me the salary you give him and save what youre paying me now sounds good to me he says  so they let thompson go and i took his place that of course is where i got my real start because you see i could control the output and run the costs up and down just where i liked i suppose you dont know anything about costs and all thatthey dont teach that sort of thing in collegesbut even you would understand something about dividends and would see that an energetic man with lots of character and business in him if hes general manager can just do what he likes with the costs especially the overhead and the shareholders have just got to take what he gives them and be glad to you see they cant fire himnot when hes got it all in his own handsfor fear it will all go to pieces  why would i want to run it that way for well ill tell you i had a notion by that time that the business was getting so big that mr evans the managing director and most of the board had pretty well lost track of the details and didnt understand it theres an awful lot you know in the shoe business its not like ordinary things its complicated and so id got an idea that i would shove them clean out of itor most of them  so i went one night to see the president old guggenbaum up at his residence he didnt only have this business but he was in a lot of other things as well and he was a mighty hard man to see he wouldnt let any man see him unless he knew first what he was going to say but i went up to his residence at night and i saw him there i talked first with his daughter and i said i just had to see him i said it so she didnt dare refuse theres a way in talking to women that they wont say no  so i showed mr guggenbaum what i could do with the stock i can put that dividend i says clean down to zeroand theyll none of them know why you can buy the lot of them out at your own price and after that ill put the dividend back to fifteen or twenty in two years  and where do you come in says the old man with a sort of hard look he had a fine business head the old man at least in those days  so i explained to him where i came in all right he said go ahead but ill put nothing in writing mr guggenbaum you dont need to i said youre as fair and square as i am and thats enough for me  his daughter let me out of the house door when i went i guess shed been pretty scared that shed done wrong about letting me in but i said to her it was all right and after that when i wanted to see the old man id always ask for her and shed see that i got in all right  got them squeezed out oh yes easy there wasnt any trouble about that you see the old man worked up a sort of jolt in wholesale leather on one side and i fixed up a strike of the hands on the other we passed the dividend two quarters running and within a year we had them all scared out and the bulk of the little shareholders of course trooped out after them they always do the old man picked up the stock when they dropped it and onehalf of it he handed over to me  thats what put me where i am now do you see with the whole control of the industry in two states and more than that now because we have the amalgamated tanneries in with us so its practically all one concern  guggenbaum did i squeeze him out no i didnt because you see i didnt have to the way it waswell i tell youi used to go up to the house see to arrange things with himand the way it waswhy you see i married his daughter see so i didnt exactly need to squeeze him out he lives up with us now but hes pretty old and past business in fact i do it all for him now and pretty well everything he has is signed over to my wife she has no head for it and shes sort of timid anyway always wasso i manage it all of course if anything happens to the old man then we get it all i dont think hell last long i notice him each day how weak hes getting  my son in the business well id like him to be but he dont seem to take to it somehowim afraid he takes more after his mother or else its the college thats doing it somehow i dont think the colleges bring out business character do you     x a study in still lifemy tailor  he always stands thereand has stood these thirty yearsin the back part of his shop his tape woven about his neck a smile of welcome on his face waiting to greet me  something in a serge he says or perhaps in a tweed  there are only these two choices open to us we have had no others for thirty years it is too late to alter now  a serge yes continues my tailor something in a dark blue perhaps he says it with all the gusto of a new idea as if the thought of dark blue had sprung up as an inspiration mr jennings this is his assistant kindly take down some of those dark blues  ah he exclaims now here is an excellent thing his manner as he says this is such as to suggest that by sheer good fortune and blind chance he has stumbled upon a thing among a million  he lifts one knee and drapes the cloth over it standing upon one leg he knows that in this attitude it is hard to resist him cloth to be appreciated as cloth must be viewed over the bended knee of a tailor with one leg in the air  my tailor can stand in this way indefinitely on one leg in a sort of ecstasy a kind of local paralysis  would that make up well i ask him  admirably he answers  i have no real reason to doubt it i have never seen any reason why cloth should not make up well but i always ask the question as i know that he expects it and it pleases him there ought to be a fair give and take in such things  you dont think it at all loud i say he always likes to be asked this  oh no very quiet indeed in fact we always recommend serge as extremely quiet  i have never had a wild suit in my life but it is well to ask  then he measures meround the chest nowhere else all the other measures were taken years ago even the chest measure is only doneand i know itto please me i do not really grow  a little fuller in the chest my tailor muses then he turns to his assistant mr jennings a little fuller in the chesthalf an inch on to the chest please  it is a kind fiction growth around the chest is flattering even to the humblest of us  yes my tailor goes onhe uses yes without any special meaningand shall we say a week from tuesday mr jennings a week from tuesday please  and will you please i say send the bill to but my tailor waves this aside he does not care to talk about the bill it would only give pain to both of us to speak of it  the bill is a matter we deal with solely by correspondence and that only in a decorous and refined style never calculated to hurt  i am sure from the tone of my tailors letters that he would never send the bill or ask for the amount were it not that from time to time he is himself unfortunately pressed owing to large consignments from europe but for these heavy consignments i am sure i should never need to pay him it is true that i have sometimes thought to observe that these consignments are apt to arrive when i pass the limit of owing for two suits and order a third but this can only be a mere coincidence  yet the bill as i say is a thing that we never speak of instead of it my tailor passes to the weather ordinary people always begin with this topic tailors i notice end with it it is only broached after the suit is ordered never before  pleasant weather we are having he says it is never other so i notice with him perhaps the order of a suit itself is a little beam of sunshine  then we move together towards the front of the store on the way to the outer door  nothing today i suppose says my tailor in shirtings  no thank you  this is again a mere form in thirty years i have never bought any shirtings from him yet he asks the question with the same winsomeness as he did thirty years ago  and nothing i suppose in collaring or in hosiery  this is again futile collars i buy elsewhere and hosiery i have never worn  thus we walk to the door in friendly colloquy somehow if he failed to speak of shirtings and hosiery i should feel as if a familiar cord had broken  at the door we part  good afternoon he says a week from tuesdayyes good afternoon  such isor wasour calm unsullied intercourse unvaried or at least broken only by consignments from europe  i say it was that is until just the other day  and then coming to the familiar door for my customary summer suit i found that he was there no more there were people in the store unloading shelves and piling cloth and taking stock and they told me that he was dead it came to me with a strange shock i had not thought it possible he seemedhe should have been immortal  they said the worry of his business had helped to kill him i could not have believed it it always seemed so still and tranquilweaving his tape about his neck and marking measures and holding cloth against his leg beside the sunlight of the window in the back part of the shop can a man die of that yet he had been going behind they said however that is done for years his wife they told me would be left badly off i had never conceived him as having a wife but it seemed that he had and a daughter too at a conservatory of music yet he never spoke of herand that he himself was musical and played the flute and was the sidesman of a churchyet he never referred to it to me in fact in thirty years we never spoke of religion it was hard to connect him with the idea of it  as i went out i seemed to hear his voice still saying and nothing today in shirtings  i was sorry i had never bought any  there is i am certain a deep moral in this but i will not try to draw it it might appear too obvious     peace war and politics     xi germany from within out  the adventure which i here narrate resulted out of a strange psychological experience of a kind that outside of germany would pass the bounds of comprehension  to begin with i had fallen asleep  of the reason for my falling asleep i have no doubt i had remained awake nearly the whole of the preceding night absorbed in the perusal of a number of recent magazine articles and books dealing with germany as seen from within i had read from cover to cover that charming book just written by lady de washaway under the title ten years as a toady or the perhapsburgs as i didnt know them her account of the life of the imperial family of austria simple unaffected homelike her picture of the good old emperor dining quietly off a cold potato and sitting after dinner playing softly to himself on the flute while his attendants gently withdrew one by one from his presence her description of merry boisterous largehearted prince stefan karl who kept the whole court in a perpetual roar all the time by asking such riddles as when is a sailor not a sailor the answer being of course when he is a german princein fact the whole book had thrilled me to the verge of spiritual exhaustion  from lady de washaways work i turned to peruse hugo von halbwitzs admirable book easy marks or how the german government borrows its funds and after that i had read karl von wigglerounds despatches and barnstuffs confidential letters to criminals  as a consequence i fell asleep as if poisoned  but the amazing thing is that whenever it was or was not that i fell asleep i woke up to find myself in germany  i cannot offer any explanation as to how this came about i merely state the fact  there i was seated on the grassy bank of a country road  i knew it was germany at once there was no mistaking it the whole landscape had an orderliness a method about it that is alas never seen in british countries the trees stood in neat lines with the name of each nailed to it on a board the birds sat in regular rows four to a branch and sang in harmony very simply but with the true german feeling  there were two peasants working beside the road one was picking up fallen leaves and putting them into neat packets of fifty the other was cutting off the tops of the late thistles that still stood unwithered in the chill winter air and arranging them according to size and colour in germany nothing is lost nothing is wasted it is perhaps not generally known that from the top of the thistle the germans obtain picrate of ammonia the most deadly explosive known to modern chemistry while from the bulb below butter crude rubber and sweet cider are extracted in large quantities  the two peasants paused in their work a moment as they saw me glance towards them and each with the simple gentility of the german working man quietly stood on his head until i had finished looking at him  i felt quite certain of course that it must only be a matter of a short time before i would inevitably be arrested  i felt doubly certain of it when i saw a motor speeding towards me with a stout man in military uniform and a prussian helmet seated behind the chauffeur  the motor stopped but to my surprise the military man whom i perceived to be wearing the uniform of a general jumped out and advanced towards me with a genial cry of  well herr professor  i looked at him again  why fritz i cried  you recognize me he said  certainly i answered you used to be one of the six german waiters at mccluskeys restaurant in toronto  the general laughed  you really took us for waiters he said well well my dear professor how odd we were all generals in the german army my own name is not fritz schmidt as you knew it but count von boobenstein the boobs of boobenstein he added proudly are connected with the hohenzollerns when i am commanded to dine with the emperor i have the hereditary right to eat anything that he leaves  but i dont understand i said why were you in toronto  perfectly simple special military service we were there to make a report each day we kept a record of the velocity and direction of the wind the humidity of the air the distance across king street and the height of the cpr building all this we wired to germany every day  for what purpose i asked  pardon me said the general and then turning the subject with exquisite tact do you remember max he said  do you mean the tall melancholy looking waiter who used to eat the spare oysters and drink up what was left in the glasses behind the screen  ha exclaimed my friend but why did he drink them why do you know that that manhis real name is not max but ernst niedelfeinis one of the greatest chemists in germany do you realise that he was making a report to our war office on the percentage of alcohol obtainable in toronto after closing time  and karl i asked  karl was a topographist in the service of his high serenity the king regnant of bavariahere my friend saluted himself with both hands and blinked his eyes four timeshe made maps of all the breweries of canada we know now to a bottle how many german soldiers could be used in invading canada without danger of death from drought  how many was it i asked  boobenstein shook his head  very disappointing he said in fact your country is not yet ripe for german occupation our experts say that the invasion of canada is an impossibility unless we use milwaukee as a basebut step into my motor said the count interrupting himself and come along with me stop you are cold this morning air is very keen take this he added picking off the fur cap from the chauffeurs head it will be better than that hat you are wearingor here wait a moment  as he spoke the count unwound a woollen muffler from the chauffeurs neck and placed it round mine  now then he added this sheepskin coat  my dear count i protested  not a bit not a bit he cried as he pulled off the chauffeurs coat and shoved me into it his face beamed with true german generosity  now he said as we settled back into the motor and started along the road i am entirely at your service try one of these cigars got it alight right you notice no doubt the exquisite flavour it is a tannhauser our chemists are making these cigars now out of the refuse of the tanneries and glue factories  i sighed involuntarily imagine trying to blockade a people who could make cigars out of refuse imagine trying to get near them at all  strong arent they said von boobenstein blowing a big puff of smoke in fact it is these cigars that have given rise to the legend a pure fiction i need hardly say that our armies are using asphyxiating gas the truth is they are merely smoking germanmade tobacco in their trenches  but come now he continued your meeting me is most fortunate let me explain i am at present on the intelligence branch of the general staff my particular employment is dealing with foreign visitorsthe branch of our service called for short the eingewanderte fremden verfullungs bureau how would you call that  it sounds i said like the bureau for stuffing up incidental foreigners  precisely said the count though your language lacks the music of ours it is my business to escort visitors round germany and help them with their despatches i took the ford party throughin a closed cattlecar with the lights out they were greatly impressed they said that though they saw nothing they got an excellent idea of the atmosphere of germany it was i who introduced lady de washaway to the court of franz joseph i write the despatches from karl von wiggleround and send the necessary material to ambassador von barnstuff in fact i can take you everywhere show you everything and here my companions military manner suddenly seemed to change into something obsequiously and strangely familiarit wont cost you a cent not a cent unless you care  i understood  i handed him ten cents  thank you sir he said then with an abrupt change back to his military manner now then what would you like to see the army the breweries the royal court berlin what shall it be my time is limited but i shall be delighted to put myself at your service for the rest of the day  i think i said i should like more than anything to see berlin if it is possible  possible answered my companion nothing easier  the motor flew ahead and in a few moments later we were making our arrangements with a local stationmaster for a special train to berlin  i got here my first glimpse of the wonderful perfection of the german railway system  i am afraid said the stationmaster with deep apologies that i must ask you to wait half an hour i am moving a quarter of a million troops from the east to the west front and this always holds up the traffic for fifteen or twenty minutes  i stood on the platform watching the troops trains go by and admiring the marvellous ingenuity of the german system  as each train went past at full speed a postal train feldposteisenbahnzug moved on the other track in the opposite direction from which a shower of letters were thrown in to the soldiers through the window immediately after the postal train a soup train soupzug was drawn along from the windows of which soup was squirted out of a hose  following this there came at full speed a beer train bierzug from which beer bombs were exploded in all directions  i watched till all had passed  now said the stationmaster your train is ready here you are  away we sped through the meadows and fields hills and valleys forests and plains  and nowherei am forced like all other travellers to admit itdid we see any signs of the existence of war everything was quiet orderly usual we saw peasants diggingin an orderly wayfor acorns in the frozen ground we saw little groups of soldiers drilling in the open squares of villagesin their quiet german fashion each man chained by the leg to the man next to him here and there great zeppelins sailed overhead dropping bombs for practice on the less important towns at times in the village squares we saw clusters of haggard women quite quiet and orderly waving little red flags and calling bread bread  but nowhere any signs of war certainly not  we reached berlin just at nightfall i had expected to find it changed to my surprise it appeared just as usual the streets were brilliantly lighted music burst in waves from the restaurants from the theatre signs i saw to my surprise that they were playing hamlet east lynne and potash and perlmutter everywhere was brightness gaiety and lightheartedness  here and there a merrylooking fellow with a brush and a pail of paste and a roll of papers over his arm would swab up a casualty list of two or three thousand names amid roars of goodnatured laughter  what perplexed me most was the sight of thousands of men not in uniform but in ordinary civilian dress  boobenstein i said as we walked down the linden avenue i dont understand it  the men he answered its a perfectly simple matter i see you dont understand our army statistics at the beginning of the war we had an army of three million very good of these one million were in the reserve we called them to the colours that made four million then of these all who wished were allowed to volunteer for special services half a million did so that made four and a half million in the first year of the war we suffered two million casualties but of these seventyfive per cent or one and a half million returned later on to the colours bringing our grand total up to six million this six million we use on each of six fronts giving a grand total of thirty six million  i see i said in fact i have seen these figures before in other words your men are inexhaustible  precisely said the count and mark you behind these we still have the landsturm made up of men between fiftyfive and sixty and the landslide reputed to be the most terrible of all the german levies made up by withdrawing the men from the breweries that is the last final act of national fury but come he said you must be hungry is it not so  i am i admitted but i had hesitated to acknowledge it i feared that the food supply  boobenstein broke into hearty laughter  food supply he roared my dear fellow you must have been reading the english newspapers food supply my dear professor have you not heard we have got over that difficulty entirely and for ever but come here is a restaurant in with you and eat to your hearts content  we entered the restaurant it was filled to overflowing with a laughing crowd of diners and merrymakers thick clouds of blue cigar smoke filled the air waiters ran to and fro with tall steins of foaming beer and great bundles of bread tickets soup tickets meat cards and butter coupons  these were handed around to the guests who sat quietly chewing the corners of them as they sipped their beer  nowthen said my host looking over the printed menu in front of him what shall it be what do you say to a ham certificate with a cabbage ticket on the side or how would you like lobstercoupon with a receipt for asparagus  yes i answered or perhaps as our journey has made me hungry one of these beef certificates with an affidavit for yorkshire pudding  done said boobenstein  a few moments later we were comfortably drinking our tall glasses of beer and smoking tannhauser cigars with an appetising pile of coloured tickets and certificates in front of us  admit said von boobenstein goodnaturedly that we have overcome the food difficulty for ever  you have i said  it was a pure matter of science and efficiency he went on it has long been observed that if one sat down in a restaurant and drank beer and smoked cigars especially such a brand as these tannhausers during the time it took for the food to be brought by a german waiter all appetite was gone it remained for the german scientists to organise this into system have you finished or would you like to take another look at your beef certificate  we rose von boobenstein paid the bill by writing iou on the back of one of the cardsnot forgetting the waiter for whom he wrote on a piece of paper god bless youand we left  count i said as we took our seat on a bench in the siegesallee or alley of victory and listened to the music of the military band and watched the crowd i begin to see that germany is unconquerable  absolutely so he answered  in the first place your men are inexhaustible if we kill one class you call out another and anyway onehalf of those we kill get well again and the net result is that you have more than ever  precisely said the count  as to food i continued you are absolutely invulnerable what with acorns thistles tanbark glue tickets coupons and certificates you can go on for ever  we can he said  then for money you use ious anybody with a lead pencil can command all the funds he wants moreover your soldiers at the front are getting dug in deeper and deeper last spring they were fifty feet under ground by 1918 they will be nearly 200 feet down short of mining for them we shall never get them out  never said von boobenstein with great firmness  but there is one thing that i dont quite understand your navy your ships there surely we have you sooner or later that whole proud fleet in the kiel canal will come out under fire of our guns and be sunk to the bottom of the sea there at least we conquer  von boobenstein broke into loud laughter  the fleet he roared and his voice was almost hysterical and overstrung as if high living on lobstercoupons and oversmoking of tannhausers was undermining his nerves the fleet is it possible you do not know why all germany knows it capture our fleet ha ha it now lies fifty miles inland we have filled in the canalpushed in the banks the canal is solid land again and the fleet is high and dry the ships are boarded over and painted to look like german inns and breweries prinz adelbert is disguised as a brewer admiral von tirpitz is made up as a head waiter prince heinrich is a bar tender the sailors are dressed up as chambermaids and some day when jellicoe and his men are coaxed ashore they will drop in to drink a glass of beer and thenpouf we will explode them all with a single torpedo such is the naval strategy of our scientists are we not a nation of sailors  von boobensteins manner had grown still wilder and more hysterical there was a queer glitter in his eyes  i thought it better to soothe him  i see i said the allies are beaten one might as well spin a coin for heads or tails to see whether we abandon england now or wait till you come and take it  as i spoke i took from my pocket an english sovereign that i carry as a luckypiece and prepared to spin it in the air  von boobenstein as he saw it broke into a sort of hoarse shriek  gold gold he cried give it to me  what i exclaimed  a piece of gold he panted give it to me give it to me quick i know a place where we can buy bread with it real breadnot ticketsfoodgive me the goldgoldfor breadwe can getbread i am starvinggoldbread  and as he spoke his hoarse voice seemed to grow louder and louder in my ears the sounds of the street were hushed a sudden darkness fell and a wind swept among the trees of the alley of victorymoaningand a thousand a myriad voices seemed to my ear to take up the cry  gold bread we are starving  then i woke up     xii abdul aziz has his      an adventure in the yildiz kiosk  come come abdul i said putting my hand not unkindly on his shoulder tell me all about it  but he only broke out into renewed sobbing  there there i continued soothingly dont cry abdul look heres a lovely narghileh for you to smoke with a gold mouthpiece see wouldnt you like a little latakia eh and heres a little toy armenianlook see his head come offsnick there its on again snick now its off look abdul  but still he sobbed  his fez had fallen over his ears and his face was all smudged with tears  it seemed impossible to stop him  i looked about in vain from the little alcove of the hall of the yildiz kiosk where we were sitting on a persian bench under a lemontree there was no one in sight i hardly knew what to do  in the yildiz kioski think that was the name of the placei scarcely as yet knew my way about in fact i had only been in it a few hours i had come thereas i should have explained in commencingin order to try to pick up information as to the exact condition of things in turkey for this purpose i had assumed the character and disguise of an english governess i had long since remarked that an english governess is able to go anywhere see everything penetrate the interior of any royal palace and move to and fro as she pleases without hindrance and without insult no barrier can stop her every royal court however splendid or however exclusive is glad to get her she dines with the king or the emperor as a matter of course all state secrets are freely confided to her and all military plans are submitted to her judgment then after a few weeks residence she leaves the court and writes a book of disclosures  this was now my plan  and up to the moment of which i speak it had worked perfectly  i had found my way through turkey to the royal capital without difficulty the poke bonnet the spectacles and the long black dress which i had assumed had proved an ample protection none of the rude turkish soldiers among whom i had passed had offered to lay a hand on me this tribute i am compelled to pay to the splendid morality of the turks they wouldnt touch me  access to the yildiz kiosk and to the sultan had proved equally easy i had merely to obtain an interview with codfish pasha the secretary of war whom i found a charming man of great intelligence a master of three or four languages as he himself informed me and able to count up to seventeen  you wish he said to be appointed as english or rather canadian governess to the sultan  yes i answered  and your object  i propose to write a book of disclosures  excellent said codfish  an hour later i found myself as i have said in a flagstoned hall of the yildiz kiosk with the task of amusing and entertaining the sultan  of the difficulty of this task i had formed no conception here i was at the outset with the unhappy abdul bent and broken with sobs which i found no power to check or control  naturally therefore i found myself at a loss the little man as he sat on his cushions in his queer costume and his long slippers with his fez fallen over his lemoncoloured face presented such a pathetic object that i could not find the heart to be stern with him  come now abdul i said be good  he paused a moment in his crying  why do you call me abdul he asked that isnt my name  isnt it i said i thought all you sultans were called abdul isnt the sultans name always abdul  mine isnt he whimpered but it doesnt matter and his face began to crinkle up with renewed weeping call me anything you like it doesnt matter anyway id rather be called abdul than be called a wwwar lord and a gggeneral when they wont let me have any say at all  and with that the little sultan burst into unrestrained crying  abdul i said firmly if you dont stop crying ill go and fetch one of the bashibazouks to take you away  the little sultan found his voice again  there arent any bubbubbashibazouks left he sobbed  none left i exclaimed where are they gone  theyve tttaken them all awwway  who have  the ggggermans sobbed abdul and theyve sent them all to ppppoland  come come abdul i said straightening him up a little as he sat brace up be a turk be a mohammedan dont act like a christian  this seemed to touch his pride he made a great effort to be calm i could hear him muttering to himself allah illallah mohammed rasoul allah he said this over a good many times while i took advantage of the pause to get his fez a little straighter and wipe his face  how many times have i said it he asked presently  twenty  twenty that ought to be enough shouldnt it said the sultan regaining himself a little isnt prayer helpful eh give me a smoke  i filled his narghileh for him and he began to suck blue smoke out of it with a certain contentment while the rose water bubbled in the bowl below  now abdul i said as i straightened up his cushions and made him a little more comfortable what is it what is the matter  why he answered theyve all gggone  now dont cry tell me properly  theyve all gone bbback on me boohoo  who have whove gone back on you  why everybody the english and the french and everybody  what do you mean i asked with increasing interest tell me exactly what you mean whatever you say i will hold sacred of course  i saw my part already to a volume of interesting disclosures  they used to treat me so differently abdul went on and his sobbing ceased as he continued they used to call me the bully boy of the bosphorus they said i was the guardian of the golden gate they used to let me kill all the armenians i liked and nobody was allowed to collect debts from me and every now and then they used to send me the nicest ultimatumsoh you dont know he broke off how nice it used to be here in the yildiz in the old days we used all to sit round here in this very hall me and the diplomats and play games such as ultimatum ultimatum whos got the ultimatum oh say it was so nice and peaceful and we used to have big dinners and conferences especially after the military manoeuvres and the autumn massacresme and the diplomats all with stars and orders and me in my white fez with a copper tasseland hold discussions about how to reform macedonia  but you spoilt it all abdul i protested  i didnt i didnt he exclaimed almost angrily id have gone on for ever it was all so nice they used to present methe diplomats didwith what they called their minimum and then we i mean codfish pasha and me had to draft in return our maximumseeand then we all had to get together again and frame a status quo  but that couldnt go on for ever i urged  why not said abdul it was a great system we invented it but everybody was beginning to copy it in fact we were leading the world before all this trouble came didnt you have anything of our system in your country what do you call itin canada  yes i admitted now that i come to think of it we were getting into it but the war has changed it all  exactly said abdul there you are all changed the good old days gone for ever  but surely i said you still have friendsthe bulgarians  the sultans little black eyes flashed with anger as he withdrew his pipe for a moment from his mouth  the low scoundrels he said between his teeth the traitors  why theyre your allies  yes allah destroy them they are theyve come over to our side after centuries of fighting they refuse to play fair any longer theyre on our side who ever heard of such a thing bah but of course he added more quietly we shall massacre them just the same we shall insist in the terms of peace on retaining our rights of massacre but then no doubt all the nations will  but you have the germans i began  hush hush said abdul laying his hand on my arm some one might hear  you have the germans i repeated  the germans said abdul and his voice sounded in a queer singsong like that of a child repeating a lesson are my noble friends the germans are my powerful allies the kaiser is my good brother the reichstag is my fostersister i love the germans i hate the english i love the kaiser the kaiser loves me  stop stop abdul i said who taught you all that  abdul looked cautiously around  they did he said in a whisper theres a lot more of it would you like me to recite some more or no no whats the good ive no heart for reciting any longer and at this abdul fell to weeping again  but abdul i said i dont understand why are you so distressed just now all this has been going on for over two years why are you so worried just now  oh exclaimed the little sultan in surprise you havent heard i seeyouve only just arrived why today is the last day after today it is all over  last day for what i asked  for intervention for the intervention of the united states the only thing that can save us it was to have come today by the end of this full moonour astrologers had predicted itsmith pasha minister under heaven of the united states had promised if it came to send it to us at the earliest moment how do they send it do you know in a box or in paper  stop i said as my ear caught the sound of footsteps theres some one coming now  the sound of slippered feet was distinctly heard on the stones in the outer corridor  abdul listened intently a moment  i know his slippers he said  who is it  it is my chief secretary toomuch koffi yes here he comes  as the sultan spoke the doors swung open and there entered an aged turk in a flowing gown and coloured turban with a melancholy yellow face and a long white beard that swept to his girdle  who do you say he is i whispered to abdul  my chief secretary he whispered back toomuch koffi  he looks like it i murmured  meantime toomuch koffi had advanced across the broad flagstones of the hall where we were sitting with hands lifted he salaamed four timeseast west north and south  what does that mean i whispered  it means said the sultan with visible agitation that he has a communication of the greatest importance and urgency which will not brook a moments delay  well then why doesnt he get a move on i whispered  hush said abdul  toomuch koffi now straightened himself from his last salaam and spoke  allah is great he said  and mohammed is his prophet rejoined the sultan  allah protect you and make your face shine said toomuch  allah lengthen your beard said the sultan and he added aside to me in english which toomuch koffi evidently did not understand im all eagerness to know what it isits something big for sure the little man was quite quivering with excitement as he spoke do you know what i think it is i think it must be the american intervention the united states is going to intervene eh what dont you think so  then hurry him up i urged  i cant said abdul it is impossible in turkey to do business like that he must have some coffee first and then he must pray and then there must be an interchange of presents  i groaned for i was getting as impatient as abdul himself  do you not do public business like that in canada the sultan continued  we used to but we have got over it i said  meanwhile a slippered attendant had entered and placed a cushion for the secretary and in front of it a little persian stool on which he put a quaint cup filled with coffee black as ink  a similar cup was placed before the sultan  drink said abdul  not first until the lips of the commander of the faithful  he means after you i said hurry up abdul  abdul took a sip  allah is good he said  and all things are of allah rejoined toomuch  abdul unpinned a glittering jewel from his robe and threw it to the feet of toomuch  take this poor bauble he said  toomuch koffi in return took from his wrist a solid bangle of beaten gold  accept this mean gift from your humble servant he said  right said abdul speaking in a changed voice as the ceremonies ended now then toomuch what is it hurry up be quick what is the matter  toomuch rose to his feet lifted his hands high in the air with the palms facing the sultan  one is without he said  without what i asked eagerly of the sultan  withoutoutside dont you understand turkish what you call in englisha gentleman to see me  and did he make all that fuss and delay over that i asked in disgust why with us in canada at one of the public departments of ottawa all that one would have to do would be simply to send in a card get it certified then simply wait in an anteroom simply read a newspaper send in another card wait a little then simply send in a third card and then simply  pshaw said abdul the cards might be poisoned our system is best speak on toomuch who is without is it perchance a messenger from smith pasha minister under heaven of the united states  alas no said toomuch it is he it is the large one  as he spoke he rolled his eyes upward with a gesture of despair  he cried abdul and a look of terror convulsed his face the large one shut him out call the chief eunuch and the major domo of the harem let him not in  alas said toomuch he threw them out of the window lo he is here he enters  as the secretary spoke a double door at the end of the hall swung noisily open at the blow of an imperious fist and with a rattle of arms and accoutrements a man of gigantic stature wearing full military uniform and a spiked helmet strode into the room  as he entered an attendant who accompanied him also in a uniform and a spiked helmet called in a loud strident voice that resounded to the arches of the hall  his high excellenz feld marechal von der doppelbauch spezial representant of his majestat william ii deutscher kaiser and king of england  abdul collapsed into a little heap his fez fell over his face toomuch koffi had slunk into a corner  von der doppelbauch strode noisily forward and came to a stand in front of abdul with a click and rattle after the prussian fashion  majestat he said in a deep thunderous voice i greet you i bow low before you salaam i kiss the floor at your feet  but in reality he did nothing of the sort he stood to the full height of his six feet six and glowered about him  salaam said abdul in a feeble voice  but who is this added the fieldmarshal looking angrily at me  my costume or rather my disguise for as i have said i was wearing a poke bonnet with a plain black dress seemed to puzzle him  my new governess said abdul she came this morning she is a professor  bah said the fieldmarshal a woman a professor bah  no no said abdul in protest and it seemed decent of the little creature to stick up for me shes all right she is interesting and knows a great deal shes from canada  what exclaimed von der doppelbauch from canada but stop it seems to me that canada is a country that we are at war with let me think canada i must look at my listhe pulled out a little set of tablets as he spokelet me see britain great britain british north america british guiana british nigeriaha of course under kkandahar korfu no i dont seem to see it fritz he called to the aidedecamp who had announced him telegraph at once to the topographical staff at berlin and find out if we are at war with canada if we arehe pointed at methrow her into the bosphorus if we are not treat her with every consideration with every distinguished consideration but see that she doesnt get away keep her tight till we are at war with canada as no doubt we shall be wherever it is and then throw her into the bosphorus  the aide clicked his heels and withdrew  and now your majesty continued the fieldmarshal turning abruptly to the sultan i bring you good news  more good news groaned abdul miserably winding his clasped fingers to and fro alas good news again  first said von der doppelbauch the kaiser has raised you to the order of the black dock here is your feather  another feather moaned abdul here toomuch take it and put it among the feathers  secondly went on the fieldmarshal checking off his items as he spoke your contribution your personal contribution to his majestys twentythird imperial loan is accepted  i didnt make any sobbed abdul  no difference said von der doppelbauch it is accepted anyway the telegram has just arrived accepting all your money my assistants are packing it up outside  abdul collapsed still further into his cushions  third and this will rejoice your majestys heart your troops are again victorious  victorious moaned abdul victorious again i knew they would be i suppose they are all dead as usual  they are said the marshal their souls he added reverently with a military salute are in heaven  no no gasped abdul not in heaven dont say that not in heaven say that they are in nishvana our turkish paradise  i am sorry said the fieldmarshal gravely this is a christian war the kaiser has insisted on their going to heaven  the sultan bowed his head  ishmillah he murmured it is the will of allah  but they did not die without glory went on the fieldmarshal their victory was complete set it out to yourself and here his eyes glittered with soldierly passion there stood your troopsten thousand in front of them the russiansa hundred thousand what did your men do did they pause no they charged  they charged cried the sultan in misery dont say that have they charged again just allah he added turning to toomuch they have charged again and we must pay we shall have to paywe always do when they charge alas alas they have charged again everything is charged  but how nobly rejoined the prussian imagine it to yourself here beside this stool let us say were your men there across the cushion were the russians all the ground between was mined we knew it our soldiers knew it even our staff knew it even prinz tattelwitz halfstuff our commander knew it but your soldiers did not what did our prinz do the prinz called for volunteers to charge over the ground there was a great shoutfrom our men our german regiments he called again there was another shout he called still again there was a third shout think of it and again prinz halfstuff called and again they shouted  who shouted asked the sultan gloomily  our men our germans  did my turks shout asked abdul  they did not they were too busy tightening their belts and fixing their bayonets but our generous fellows shouted for them then prinz halfstuff called out the place of honour is for our turkish brothers let them charge and all our men shouted again  and they charged  they didand were all gloriously blown up a magnificent victory the blowing up of the mines blocked all the ground checked the russians and enabled our men by a prearranged rush to advance backwards taking up a new strategic  yes yes said abdul i knowi have read of it alas only too often and they are dead toomuch he added quietly drawing a little pouch from his girdle take this pouch of rubies and give them to the wives of the dead general of our divisionone to each he had i think but seventeen his walk was quiet allah give him peace  stop said von der doppelbauch i will take the rubies i myself will charge myself with the task and will myself see that i do it myself give me them  be it so toomuch assented the sultan humbly give them to him  and now continued the fieldmarshal there is yet one other thing further still more he drew a roll of paper from his pocket toomuch he said bring me yonder little table with ink quills and sand i have here a manifesto for his majesty to sign  no no cried abdul in renewed alarm not another manifesto not that i signed one only last week  this is a new one said the fieldmarshal as he lifted the table that toomuch had brought into place in front of the sultan and spread out the papers on it this is a better one this is the best one yet  what does it say said abdul peering at it miserably i cant read it its not in turkish  it is your last word of proud defiance to all your enemies said the marshal  no no whined abdul not defiance they might not understand  here you declare went on the fieldmarshal with his big finger on the text your irrevocable purpose you swear that rather than submit you will hurl yourself into the bosphorus  where does it say that screamed abdul  here beside my thumb  i cant do it i cant do it moaned the little sultan  more than that further went on the prussian quite undisturbed you state hereby your fixed resolve rather than give in to cast yourself from the highest pinnacle of the topmost minaret of this palace  oh not the highest dont make it the highest moaned abdul  your purpose is fixed nothing can alter it unless the allied powers withdraw from their advance on constantinople you swear that within one hour you will fill your mouth with mud and burn yourself alive  just allah cried the sultan does it say all that  all that said von der doppelbauch all that within an hour it is a splendid defiance the kaiser himself has seen it and admired it these he said are the words of a man  did he say that said abdul evidently flattered and is he too about to hurl himself off his minaret  for the moment no replied von der doppelbauch sternly  well well said abdul and to my surprise he began picking up the pen and making ready i suppose if i must sign it i must then he marked the paper and sprinkled it with sand for one hour well well he murmured von der doppelbauch pasha he added with dignity you are permitted to withdraw commend me to your imperial master my brother tell him that when i am gone he may have constantinople provided onlyand a certain slyness appeared in the sultans eyethat he can get it farewell  the fieldmarshal majestic as ever gathered up the manifesto clicked his heels together and withdrew  as the door closed behind him i had expected the little sultan to fall into hopeless collapse  not at all on the contrary a look of peculiar cheerfulness spread over his features  he refilled his narghileh and began quietly smoking at it  toomuch he said quite cheerfully i see there is no hope  alas said the secretary  i have now went on the sultan apparently but sixty minutes in front of me i had hoped that the intervention of the united states might have saved me it has not instead of it i meet my fate well well it is kismet i bow to it  he smoked away quite cheerfully  presently he paused  toomuch he said kindly go and fetch me a sharp knife doubleedged if possible but sharp and a stout bowstring  up to this time i had remained a mere spectator of what had happened but now i feared that i was on the brink of witnessing an awful tragedy  good heavens abdul i said what are you going to do  do why kill myself of course the sultan answered pausing for a moment in an interval of his cheerful smoking what else should i do what else is there to do i shall first stab myself in the stomach and then throttle myself with the bowstring in half an hour i shall be in paradise toomuch summon hither from the inner harem fatima and falloola they shall sit beside me and sing to me at the last hour for i love them well and later they too shall voyage with me to paradise see to it that they are both thrown a little later into the bosphorus for my heart yearns towards the two of them and he added thoughtfully especially perhaps towards fatima but i have never quite made up my mind  the sultan sat back with a little gurgle of contentment the rose water bubbling soothingly in the bowl of his pipe  then he turned to his secretary again  toomuch he said you will at the same time send a bowstring to codfish pasha my chief of war it is our sign you know he added in explanation to meit gives codfish leave to kill himself and toomuch send a bowstring also to beefhash pasha my viziergood fellow he will expect itand to macpherson effendi my financial adviser let them all have bowstrings  stop stop i pleaded i dont understand  why surely said the little man in evident astonishment it is plain enough what would you do in canada when your ministersas i think you call themfail and no longer enjoy your support do you not send them bowstrings  never i said they go out of office but  and they do not disembowel themselves on their retirement have they not that privilege  never i said what an idea  the ways of the infidel said the little sultan calmly resuming his pipe are beyond the compass of the true intelligence of the faithful yet i thought it was so even as here i had read in your newspapers that after your last election your ministers were buried aliveburied under a landslide was it not we thought ithere in turkeya noble fate for them  they crawled out i said  ishmillah ejaculated abdul but go toomuch and listen thou alsofor in spite of all thou hast served me wellshalt have a bowstring  oh master master cried toomuch falling on his knees in gratitude and clutching the sole of abduls slipper it is too kind  nay nay said the sultan thou hast deserved it and i will go further this stranger too my governess this professor bring also for the professor a bowstring and a twobladed knife all canada shall rejoice to hear of it the students shall leap up like young lambs at the honour that will be done bring the knife toomuch bring the knife  abdul i said abdul this is too much i refuse i am not fit the honour is too great  not so said abdul i am still sultan i insist upon it for listen i have long penetrated your disguise and your kind design i saw it from the first you knew all and came to die with me it was kindly meant but you shall die no common death yours shall be the honour of the double knifelet it be extra sharp toomuchand the bowstring  abdul i urged it cannot be you forget i have an appointment to be thrown into the bosphorus  the death of a dog never cried abdul my will is still law toomuch kill him on the spot hit him with the stool throw the coffee at him  but at this moment there were heard loud cries and shouting as in tones of great gladness in the outer hall of the palace doors swinging to and fro and the sound of many running feet one heard above all the call it has come it has come  the sultan looked up quickly  toomuch he said eagerly and anxiously quick see what it is hurry hurry haste do not stay on ceremony drink a cup of coffee give me five centsfifty cents anythingand take leave and see what it is  but before toomuch could reply a turbaned attendant had already burst in through the door unannounced and thrown himself at abduls feet  master master he cried it is here it has come as he spoke he held out in one hand a huge envelope heavy with seals i could detect in great letters stamped across it the words washington and office of the secretary of state  abdul seized and opened the envelope with trembling hands  it is it he cried it is sent by smith pasha minister under the peace of heaven of the united states it is the intervention i am saved  then there was silence among us breathless and anxious  abdul glanced down the missive reading it in silence to himself  oh noble he murmured oh generous it is too much too splendid a lot  what does it say  look said the sultan the united states has used its good offices it has intervened all is settled my fate is secure  yes yes i said but what is it  is it believable exclaimed abdul it appears that none of the belligerents cared about me at all none had designs upon me the war was not made as we understood toomuch as an attempt to seize my person all they wanted was constantinople not me at all  powerful allah murmured toomuch why was it not so said  for me said the sultan still consulting the letter great honours are prepared i am to leave constantinople that is the sole condition it shall then belong to whoever can get it nothing could be fairer it always has i am to have a safe conductis it not nobleto the united states no one is to attempt to poison meis it not generosity itselfneither on land nor evenmark this especially toomuchon board ship nor is anyone to throw me overboard or otherwise transport me to paradise  it passes belief murmured toomuch koffi allah is indeed good  in the united states itself went on abdul or i should say themselves toomuch for are they not innumerable i am to have a position of the highest trust power and responsibility  is it really possible i said greatly surprised  it is so written said the sultan i am to be placed at the head as the sole head or sovereign ofhow is it writtena turkish bath establishment in new york there i am to enjoy the same freedom and to exercise just as muchit is so writtenexactly as much political power as i do here is it not glorious  allah illallah cried the secretary  you toomuch shall come with me for there is a post of great importance placed at my disposalso it is writtenunder the title of rubber down toomuch let our preparations be made at once notify fatima and falloola those two alone shall go for it is a christian country and i bow to its prejudices two i understand is the limit but we must leave at once  the sultan paused a moment and then looked at me  and our good friend here he added we must leave to get out of this yildiz kiosk by whatsoever magic means he came into it  which i did  and i am assured by those who know that the intervention was made good and that abdul and toomuch may be seen to this day or to any other day moving to and fro in their slippers and turbans in their turkish bath emporium at the corner of broadway and  but stop that would be saying too much especially as fatima and falloola occupy the upstairs  and it is said that abdul has developed a very special talent for heating up the temperature for his christian customers  moreover it is the general opinion that whether or not the kaiser and such people will get their deserts abdul aziz has his     xiii in merry mexico  i stood upon the platform of the little deserted railway station of the frontier and looked around at the wide prospect so this i said to myself is mexico  about me was the great plain rolling away to the sierras in the background the railroad track traversed it in a thin line there were no treesonly here and there a clump of cactus or chaparral a tuft of doggrass or a few patches of dogwood at intervals in the distance one could see a hacienda standing in majestic solitude in a cup of the hills in the blue sky floated little banderillos of white cloud while a graceful hidalgo appeared poised on a crag on one leg with folded wings or floated lazily in the sky on one wing with folded legs  there was a drowsy buzzing of cicadas half asleep in the cactus cups and from some hidden depth of the hills far in the distance the tinkling of a mule bell  i had seen it all so often in moving pictures that i recognised the scene at once  so this is mexico i repeated  the station building beside me was little more than a wooden shack its door was closed there was a sort of ticket wicket opening at the side but it too was closed  but as i spoke thus aloud the wicket opened there appeared in it the head and shoulders of a little wizened man swarthy and with bright eyes and pearly teeth  he wore a black velvet suit with yellow facings and a tall straw hat running to a point i seemed to have seen him a hundred times in comic opera  can you tell me when the next train i began  the little man made a gesture of spanish politeness  welcome to mexico he said  could you tell me i continued  welcome to our sunny mexico he repeatedour beautiful glorious mexico her heart throbs at the sight of you  would you mind i began again  our beautiful mexico torn and distracted as she is greets you in the name of the de facto government thrice welcome su casa he added with a graceful gesture indicating the interior of his little shack come in and smoke cigarettes and sleep su casa you are capable of spanish is it not  no i said it is not but i wanted to know when the next train for the interior  ah he rejoined more briskly you address me as a servant of the de facto government momentino one moment  he shut the wicket and was gone a long time i thought he had fallen asleep  but he reappeared he had a bundle of what looked like railway time tables very ancient and worn in his hand  did you say he questioned the interior or the exterior  the interior please  ah good excellentfor the interior the little mexican retreated into his shack and i could hear him murmuring for the interior excellent as he moved to and fro  presently he reappeared a look of deep sorrow on his face  alas he said shrugging his shoulders i am desolado it has gone the next train has gone  gone when  alas who can tell yesterday last month but it has gone  and when will there be another one i asked  ha he said resuming a brisk official manner i understand having missed the next you propose to take another one excellent what business enterprise you foreigners have you miss your train what do you do do you abandon your journey no do you sit downdo you weep no do you lose time you do not  excuse me i said but when is there another train  that must depend said the little official and as he spoke he emerged from his house and stood beside me on the platform fumbling among his railway guides the first question is do you propose to take a de facto train or a de jure train  when do they go i asked  there is a de jure train continued the stationmaster peering into his papers at two pm a very good trainsleepers and dinersone at four a through trainsleepers observation car dining car corridor compartmentsthat also is a de jure train  but what is the difference between the de jure and the de facto  its a distinction we generally make in mexico the de jure trains are those that ought to go that is in theory they go the de facto trains are those that actually do go it is a distinction clearly established in our correspondence with huedro huilson  do you mean woodrow wilson  yes huedro huilson presidentde jureof the united states  oh i said now i understand and when will there be a de facto train  at any moment you like said the little official with a bow  but i dont see  pardon me i have one here behind the shed on that side track excuse me one moment and i will bring it  he disappeared and i presently saw him energetically pushing out from behind the shed a little railroad lorry or hand truck  now then he said as he shoved his little car on to the main track this is the train seat yourself i myself will take you  and how much shall i pay what is the fare to the interior i questioned  the little man waved the idea aside with a polite gesture  the fare he said let us not speak of it let us forget it how much money have you  i have here i said taking out a roll of bills fifty dollars  and that is all you have  yes  then let that be your fare why should i ask more were i an american i might but in our mexico no what you have we take beyond that we ask nothing let us forget it good and now would you prefer to travel first second or third class  first class please i said  very good let it be so here the little man took from his pocket a red label marked first class and tied it on the edge of the hand car it is more comfortable he said now seat yourself seize hold of these two handles in front of you move them back and forward thus beyond that you need do nothing the working of the car other than the mere shoving of the handles shall be my task consider yourself in fact senor as my guest  we took our places i applied myself as directed to the handles and the little car moved forward across the plain  a glorious prospect i said as i gazed at the broad panorama  magnifico is it not said my companion alas my poor mexico she want nothing but water to make her the most fertile country of the globe water and soil those only and she would excel all others give her but water soil light heat capital and labour and what could she not be and what do we see distraction revolution destructionpardon me will you please stop the car a moment i wish to tear up a little of the track behind us  i did as directed my companion descended and with a little bar that he took from beneath the car unloosed a few of the rails of the light track and laid them beside the road  it is our custom he explained as he climbed on board again we mexicans when we move to and fro always tear up the track behind us but what was i saying ah yesdestruction desolation alas our mexico  he looked sadly up at the sky  you speak i said like a patriot may i ask your name  my name is raymon he answered with a bow raymon domenico y miraflores de las gracias  and may i call you simply raymon  i shall be delirious with pleasure if you will do so he answered and dare i ask you in return your business in our beautiful country  the car as we were speaking had entered upon a long gentle downgrade across the plain so that it ran without great effort on my part  certainly i said im going into the interior to see general villa  at the shock of the name raymon nearly fell off the car  villa general francesco villa it is not possible  the little man was shivering with evident fear  see him see villa not possible let me show you a picture of him instead but approach himit is not possible he shoots everybody at sight  thats all right i said i have a written safe conduct that protects me  from whom  here i said look at themi have two  raymon took the documents i gave him and read aloud  the bearer is on an important mission connected with american rights in mexico if anyone shoots him he will be held to a strict accountability w w ah excellent he will be compelled to send in an itemised account excellent and this other let me see if anybody interferes with the bearer i will knock his face in t r admirable this is if anything better than the other for use in our country it appeals to our quick mexican natures it is as we say simpatico it touches us  it is meant to i said  and may i ask said raymon the nature of your business with villa  we are old friends i answered i used to know him years ago when he kept a mexican cigar store in buffalo it occurred to me that i might be able to help the cause of peaceful intervention i have already had a certain experience in turkey i am commissioned to make general villa an offer  i see said raymon in that case if we are to find villa let us make all haste forward and first we must direct ourselves yonderhe pointed in a vague way towards the mountainswhere we must presently leave our car and go on foot to the camp of general carranza  carranza i exclaimed but he is fighting villa  exactly it is possiblenot certainbut possible that he knows where villa is in our mexico when two of our generalistas are fighting in the mountains they keep coming across one another it is hard to avoid it  good i said let us go forward  it was two days later that we reached carranzas camp in the mountains  we found him just at dusk seated at a little table beneath a tree  his followers were all about picketing their horses and lighting fires  the general buried in a book before him noticed neither the movements of his own men nor our approach  i must say that i was surprised beyond measure at his appearance  the popular idea of general carranza as a rude bandit chief is entirely erroneous  i saw before me a quiet scholarlylooking man bearing every mark of culture and refinement his head was bowed over the book in front of him which i noticed with astonishment and admiration was todhunters algebra close at his hand i observed a work on decimal fractions while from time to time i saw the general lift his eyes and glance keenly at a multiplication table that hung on a bough beside him  you must wait a few moments said an aidedecamp who stood beside us the general is at work on a simultaneous equation  is it possible i said in astonishment  the aidedecamp smiled  soldiering today my dear senor he said is an exact science on this equation will depend our entire food supply for the next week  when will he get it done i asked anxiously  simultaneously said the aidedecamp  the general looked up at this moment and saw us  well he asked  your excellency said the aidedecamp there is a stranger here on a visit of investigation to mexico  shoot him said the general and turned quickly to his work  the aidedecamp saluted  when he asked  as soon as he likes said the general  you are fortunate indeed said the aidedecamp in a tone of animation as he led me away still accompanied by raymon you might have been kept waiting round for days let us get ready at once you would like to be shot would you not smoking a cigarette and standing beside your grave luckily we have one ready now if you will wait a moment i will bring the photographer and his machine there is still light enough i think what would you like it called the fate of a spy thats good isnt it our syndicate can always work up that into a tworeel film all the rest of itthe camp the mountains the general the funeral and so onwe can do tomorrow without you  he was all eagerness as he spoke  one moment i interrupted i am sure there is some mistake i only wished to present certain papers and get a safe conduct from the general to go and see villa  the aidedecamp stopped abruptly  ah he said you are not here for a picture a thousand pardons give me your papers one momenti will return to the general and explain  he vanished and raymon and i waited in the growing dusk  no doubt the general supposed explained raymon as he lighted a cigarette that you were here for las machinas the moving pictures  in a few minutes the aidedecamp returned  come he said the general will see you now  we returned to where we had left carranza  the general rose to meet me with outstretched hand and with a gesture of simple cordiality  you must pardon my error he said  not at all i said  it appears you do not desire to be shot  not at present  later perhaps said the general on your return no doubt provided he added with grave courtesy that sat well on him that you do return my aidedecamp shall make a note of it but at present you wish to be guided to francesco villa  if it is possible  quite easy he is at present near here in fact much nearer than he has any right to be the general frowned we found this spot first the light is excellent and the mountains as you have seen are wonderful for our pictures this is by every rule of decency our scenery villa has no right to it this is our revolutionthe general spoke with rising animationnot his when you see the fellow tell him from meor tell his managerthat he must either move his revolution further away or by heaven illill use force against him but stop he checked himself you wish to see villa good you have only to follow the straight track over the mountain there he is just beyond at the little village in the hollow el corazon de las quertas  the general shook hands and seated himself again at his work the interview was at an end we withdrew  the next morning we followed without difficulty the path indicated a few hours walk over the mountain pass brought us to a little straggling village of adobe houses sleeping drowsily in the sun  there were but few signs of life in its one streeta mule here and there tethered in the sun and one or two mexicans drowsily smoking in the shade  one building only evidently newly made and of lumber had a decidedly american appearance its doorway bore the sign general offices of the company and under it the notice keep out while on one of its windows was painted general manager and below it the legend no admission and on the other secretarys office go away  we therefore entered at once  general francesco villa said a clerk evidently american yes hes here all right at least this is the office  and where is the general i asked  the clerk turned to an assistant at a desk in a corner of the room  wheres frank working this morning he asked  over down in the gulch said the other turning round for a moment theres an attack on american cavalry this morning  oh yes i forgot said the chief clerk i thought it was the indian massacre but i guess thats for tomorrow go straight to the end of the street and turn left about half a mile and youll find the boys down there  we thanked him and withdrew  we passed across the open plaza and went down a narrow side road bordered here and there with adobe houses and so out into the open country here the hills rose again and the road that we followed wound sharply round a turn into a deep gorge bordered with rocks and sage brush we had no sooner turned the curve of the road than we came upon a scene of great activity men in mexican costume were running to and fro apparently arranging a sort of barricade at the side of the road others seemed to be climbing the rocks on the further side of the gorge as if seeking points of advantage i noticed that all were armed with rifles and machetes and presented a formidable appearance of villa himself i could see nothing but there was a grim reality about the glittering knives the rifles and the maxim guns that i saw concealed in the sage brush beside the road  what is it i asked of a man who was standing idle watching the scene from the same side of the road as ourselves  attack of american cavalry he said nonchalantly  here i gasped  yep in about ten minutes soon as they are ready  wheres villa  its him theyre attacking they chase him here see this is an ambush villa rounds on them right here and they fight to a finish  great heavens i exclaimed how do you know that  know it why because i seen it aint they been trying it out for three days why id be in it myself only im off work got a sore toe yesterdayhorse stepped on it  all this was of course quite unintelligible to me  but its right here where theyre going to fight i asked  sure said the american as he moved carelessly aside as soon as the boss gets it all ready  i noticed for the first time a heavylooking man in an american tweed suit and a white plug hat moving to and fro and calling out directions with an air of authority  here he shouted what in hl are you doing with that machine gun youve got it clean out of focus here jose come in closerthats right steady there now and dont forget at the second whistle you and pete are dead here you pete how in thunder do you think you can die there youre all out of the picture and hidden by that there sage brush thats no place to die and boys remember one thing now die slow edhe turned and called apparently to some one invisible behind the rockswhen them two boys is killed turn her round on them slew her round good and get them centre focus now then are you all set ready  at this moment the speaker turned and saw raymon and myself  here youse he shouted get further back youre in the picture or say no stay right where you are you he said pointing to me stay right where you are and ill give you a dollar to just hold that horror you understand just keep on registering it dont do another thing just register that face  his words were meaningless to me i had never known before that it was possible to make money by merely registering my face  no no cried out raymon my friend here is not wanting work he has a message a message of great importance for general villa  well called back the boss hell have to wait we cant stop now all ready boys onetwonow  and with that he put a whistle to his lips and blew a long shrill blast  then in a moment the whole scene was transformed rifle shots rang out from every crag and bush that bordered the gully  a wild scamper of horses hoofs was heard and in a moment there came tearing down the road a whole troop of mounted mexicans evidently in flight for they turned and fired from their saddles as they rode the horses that carried them were wild with excitement and flecked with foam the mexican cavalry men shouted and yelled brandishing their machetes and firing their revolvers here and there a horse and rider fell to the ground in a great whirl of sand and dust in the thick of the press a leader of ferocious aspect mounted upon a gigantic black horse waved his sombrero about his head  villait is villa cried raymon tense with excitement is he not magnifico but look lookthe americanos they are coming  it was a glorious sight to see them as they rode madly on the heels of the mexicansa whole company of american cavalry their horses shoulder to shoulder the men bent low in their saddles their carbines gripped in their hands they rode in squadrons and in line not like the shouting confused mass of the mexicansbut steady disciplined irresistible  on the right flank in front a greyhaired officer steadied the charging line the excitement of it was maddening  go to it i shouted in uncontrollable emotion your mexicans are licked raymon theyre no good  but look said raymon seethe ambush the ambuscada  for as they reached the centre of the gorge in front of us the mexicans suddenly checked their horses bringing them plunging on their haunches in the dust and then swung round upon their pursuers while from every crag and bush at the side of the gorge the concealed riflemen sprang into viewand the sputtering of the machine guns swept the advancing column with a volley  we could see the american line checked as with the buffet of a great wave men and horses rolling in the road through the smoke one saw the greyhaired leader dismounted his uniform torn his hat gone but still brandishing his sword and calling his orders to his men his face as one caught in a flash of sunlight steady and fearless his words i could not hear but one saw the american cavalry still unbroken dismount throw themselves behind their horses and fire with steady aim into the mass of the mexicans we could see the mexicans in front of where we stood falling thick and fast in little huddled bundles of colour kicking the sand the man pete had gone down right in the foreground and was breathing out his soul before our eyes  well done i shouted go to it boys you can lick em yet hurrah for the united states look raymon look theyve shot down the crew of the machine guns see see the mexicans are turning to run at em boys theyre waving the american flag there it is in all the thick of the smoke hark theres the bugle call to mount again theyre going to charge again here they come  as the american cavalry came tearing forward the mexicans leaped from their places with gestures of mingled rage and terror as if about to break and run  the battle had it continued could have but one end  but at this moment we heard from the town behind us the long sustained note of a steam whistle blowing the hour of noon  in an instant the firing ceased  the battle stopped the mexicans picked themselves up off the ground and began brushing off the dust from their black velvet jackets the american cavalry reined in their horses dead pete came to life general villa and the american leader and a number of others strolled over towards the boss who stood beside the fence vociferating his comments  that wont do he was shouting that wont do where in blazes was that infernal sister of mercy miss jenkinson and he called to a tall girl whom i now noticed for the first time among the crowd wearing a sort of khaki costume and a short skirt and carrying a water bottle in a strap you never got into the picture at all i want you right in there among the horses under their feet  land sakes said the sister of mercy you aint no right to ask me to go in there among them horses and be trampled  aint you paid to be trampled said the manager angrily then as he caught sight of villa he broke off and said frank you boys done fine its going to be a good act all right but it aint just got the right amount of ginger in it yet well try her over once again anyway  now boys he continued calling out to the crowd with a voice like a megaphone this afternoon at threethirty hospital scene i only want the wounded the doctors and the sisters of mercy all the rest of youse is free till ten tomorrowfor the indian massacre everybody up for that  it was an hour or two later that i had my interview with villa in a back room of the little posada or inn of the town the general had removed his ferocious wig of straight black hair and substituted a check suit for his warlike costume he had washed the darker part of the paint off his facein fact he looked once again the same frank villa that i used to know when he kept his mexican cigar store in buffalo  well frank i said im afraid i came down here under a misunderstanding  looks like it said the general as he rolled a cigarette  and you wouldnt care to go back even for the offer that i am commissioned to makeyour old job back again and half the profits on a new cigar to be called the francesco villa  the general shook his head  it sounds good all right he said but this movingpicture business is better  i see i said i hadnt understood i thought there really was a revolution here in mexico  no said villa shaking his head been no revolution down here for yearsnot since diaz the picture companies came in and took the whole thing over they made us a fair offerso much a reel straight out and a royalty and let us divide up the territory as we liked the first film we done was the bombardment of vera cruz say that was a dandy did you see it  no i said  they had us all in that he continued i done an american marine lots of people think it all real when they see it  why i said nearly everybody does even the president  oh i guess he knows said villa but you see theres tons of money in it and its good for business and hes too decent a man to give it away say i heard the boy saying theres a war in europe i wonder what company got that up eh but i dont believe itll draw there aint the scenery for it that we have in mexico  alas murmured raymon our beautiful mexico to what is she fallen needing only water air light and soil to make her  come on raymon i said lets go home     xiv over the grape juice or the peacemakers  characters  mr w jennings bryan dr david starr jordan a philanthropist mr norman angell a lady pacifist a negro president an eminent divine the man on the street the general public and many others  war said the negro president of haiti is a sad spectacle it shames our polite civilisation  as he spoke he looked about him at the assembled company around the huge dinner table glittering with cut glass and white linen and brilliant with hothouse flowers  a sad spectacle he repeated rolling his big eyes in his black and yellow face that was melancholy with the broken pathos of the african race  the occasion was a notable one it was the banquet of the peacemakers conference of 1917 and the company gathered about the board was as notable as it was numerous  at the head of the table the genial mr jennings bryan presided as host his broad countenance beaming with amiability and a tall flagon of grape juice standing beside his hand a little further down the table one saw the benevolent head and placid physiognomy of mr norman angell bowed forward as if in deep calculation within earshot of mr bryan but not listening to him one recognised without the slightest difficulty dr david starr jordan the distinguished ichthyologist and director in chief of the worlds peace foundation while the bland features of a gentleman from china and the presence of a yellow delegate from the mosquito coast gave ample evidence that the company had been gathered together without reference to colour race religion education or other prejudices whatsoever  but it would be out of the question to indicate by name the whole of the notable assemblage indeed certain of the guests while carrying in their faces and attitudes something strangely and elusively familiar seemed in a sense to be nameless and to represent rather types and abstractions than actual personalities such was the case for instance with a female member of the company seated in a place of honour near the host whose demure garb and gentle countenance seemed to indicate her as a lady pacifist but denied all further identification the mild ecclesiastical features of a second guest so entirely christian in its expression as to be almost devoid of expression altogether marked him at once as an eminent divine but while puzzlingly suggestive of an actual and wellknown person seemed to elude exact recognition his accent when he presently spoke stamped him as british and his garb was that of the established church another guest appeared to answer to the general designation of capitalist or philanthropist and seemed from his prehensile grasp upon his knife and fork to typify the money power in front of this guest doubtless with a view of indicating his extreme wealth and the consideration in which he stood was placed a floral decoration representing a broken bank with the figure of a ruined depositor entwined among the debris  of these nameless guests two individuals alone from the very significance of their appearance from their plain dress unsuited to the occasion and from the puzzled expression of their faces seemed out of harmony with the galaxy of distinction which surrounded them they seemed to speak only to one another and even that somewhat after the fashion of an appreciative chorus to what the rest of the company was saying while the manner in which they rubbed their hands together and hung upon the words of the other speakers in humble expectancy seemed to imply that they were present in the hope of gathering rather than shedding light to these two humble and obsequious guests no attention whatever was paid though it was understood by those who knew that their names were the general public and the man on the street  a sad spectacle said the negro president and he sighed as he spoke one wonders if our civilisation if our moral standards themselves are slipping from us then half in reverie or as if overcome by the melancholy of his own thought he lifted a spoon from the table and slid it gently into the bosom of his faded uniform  put back that spoon called the lady pacifist sharply  pardon said the negro president humbly as he put it back the humiliation of generations of servitude was in his voice  come come exclaimed mr jennings bryan cheerfully try a little more of the grape juice  does it intoxicate asked the president  never answered mr bryan rest assured of that i can guarantee it the grape is picked in the dark it is then carried still in the dark to the testing room there every particle of alcohol is removed try it  thank you said the president i am no longer thirsty  will anybody have some more of the grape juice asked mr bryan running his eye along the ranks of the guests  no one spoke  will anybody have some more ground peanuts  no one moved  or does anybody want any more of the shredded tan bark no or will somebody have another spoonful of sunflower seeds  there was still no sign of assent  very well then said mr bryan the banquet as such is over and we now come to the more serious part of our business i need hardly tell you that we are here for a serious purpose we are here to do good that i know is enough to enlist the ardent sympathy of everybody present  there was a murmur of assent  personally said the lady pacifist i do nothing else  neither do i said the guest who has been designated the philanthropist whether i am producing oil or making steel or building motorcars  does he build motorcars whispered the humble person called the man in the street to his fellow the general public  all great philanthropists do things like that answered his friend they do it as a social service so as to benefit humanity any money they make is just an accident they dont really care about it a bit listen to him hes going to say so  indeed our business itself the philanthropist continued while his face lighted up with unselfish enthusiasm our business itself  hush hush said mr bryan gently we know  our business itself persisted the philanthropist is one great piece of philanthropy  tears gathered in his eyes  come come said mr bryan firmly we must get to business our friend here he continued turning to the company at large and indicating the negro president on his right has come to us in great distress his beautiful island of haiti is and has been for many years overwhelmed in civil war now he learns that not only haiti but also europe is engulfed in conflict he has heard that we are making proposals for ending the war indeed i may say are about to declare that the war in europe must stopi think i am right am i not my friends  there was a general chorus of assent  naturally then continued mr bryan our friend the president of haiti who is overwhelmed with grief at what has been happening in his island has come to us for help that is correct is it not  thats it gentlemen said the negro president in a voice of some emotion wiping the sleeve of his faded uniform across his eyes the situation is quite beyond my control in fact he added shaking his head pathetically as he relapsed into more natural speech dis hyah chile genln is clean done beat with it dey aint doin nuffin on the island but shootin burnin and killin somethin awful lawd a massy its just like a real civilised country all right now down in our island we coloured people is feeling just as bad as youse did when all them poor white folks was murdered on the lusitania  but the negro president had no sooner used the words murdered on the lusitania than a chorus of dissent and disapproval broke out all down the table  my dear sir my dear sir protested mr bryan pray moderate your language a little if you please murdered oh dear dear me how can we hope to advance the cause of peace if you insist on using such terms  aint it that wasnt it murder asked the president perplexed  we are all agreed here said the lady pacifist that it is far better to call it an incident we speak of the lusitania incident she added didactically just as one speaks of the arabic incident and the cavell incident and other episodes of the sort it makes it so much easier to forget  true quite true murmured the eminent divine and then one must remember that there are always two sides to everything there are two sides to murder we must not let ourselves forget that there is always the murderers point of view to consider  but by this time the negro president was obviously confused and out of his depth the conversation had reached a plane of civilisation which was beyond his reach  the genial mr bryan saw fit to come to his rescue  never mind said mr bryan soothingly our friends here will soon settle all your difficulties for you im going to ask them one after the other to advise you they will tell you the various means that they are about to apply to stop the war in europe and you may select any that you like for your use in haiti we charge you nothing for it except of course your fair share of the price of this grape juice and the shredded nuts  the president nodded  i am going to ask our friend on my rightand here mr bryan indicated the lady pacifistto speak first  there was a movement of general expectancy and the two obsequious guests at the foot of the table of whom mention has been made were seen to nudge one another and whisper isnt this splendid  you are not asking me to speak first merely because i am a woman asked the lady pacifist  oh no said mr bryon with charming tact  very good said the lady adjusting her glasses as for stopping the war i warn you as i have warned the whole world that it may be too late they should have called me in sooner that was the mistake if they had sent for me at once and had put my picture in the papers both in england and germany with the inscription the true woman of today i doubt if any of the men who looked at it would have felt that it was worth while to fight but as things are the only advice i can give is this everybody is wrong except me the germans are a very naughty people but the belgians are worse it was very very wicked of the germans to bombard the houses of the belgians but how naughty of the belgians to go and sit in their houses while they were bombarded it is to that that i attributewith my infallible sense of justicethe dreadful loss of life so you see the only conclusion that i can reach is that everybody is very naughty and that the only remedy would be to appoint me a committeeme and a few others though the others dont really matterto make a proper settlement i hope i make myself clear  the negro president shook his head and looked mystified  us coloured folks he said wouldnt quite understand that we done got the idea that sometimes theres such a thing as a quarrel that is right and just the presidents melancholy face lit up with animation and his voice rose to the sonorous vibration of the negro preacher we learn that out of the bible we coloured folkswe learn to smite the ungodly  pray pray said mr bryan soothingly dont introduce religion let me beg of you that would be fatal we peacemakers are all agreed that there must be no question of religion raised  exactly so murmured the eminent divine my own feelings exactly the name ofofthe deity should never be brought in it inflames people only a few weeks ago i was pained and grieved to the heart to hear a woman in one of our london streets raving that the german emperor was a murderer her child had been killed that night by a bomb from a zeppelin she had its body in a cloth hugged to her breast as she talkedthank heaven they keep these things out of the newspapersand she was calling down gods vengeance on the emperor most deplorable poor creature unable i suppose to realise the emperors exalted situation his splendid lineage the wonderful talent with which he can draw pictures of the apostles with one hand while he writes an appeal to his mohammedan comrades with the other i dined with him once he added in modest afterthought  i dined with him too said dr jordan i shall never forget the impression he made as he entered the room accompanied by his staff the emperor looked straight at me and said to one of his aides who is this this is dr jordan said the officer the emperor put out his hand so this is dr jordan he said i never witnessed such an exhibition of brain power in my life he had seized my name in a moment and held it for three seconds with all the tenaciousness of a hohenzollern  but may i continued the director of the worlds peace add a word to what has been said to make it still clearer to our friend i will try to make it as simple as one of my lectures in ichthyology i know of nothing simpler than that  everybody murmured assent the negro president put his hand to his ear  theology he said  ichthyology said dr jordan it is better but just listen to this war is waste it destroys the tissues it is exhausting and fatiguing and may in extreme cases lead to death  the learned gentleman sat back in his seat and took a refreshing drink of rain water from a glass beside him while a murmur of applause ran round the table it was known and recognised that the speaker had done more than any living man to establish the fact that war is dangerous that gunpowder if heated explodes that fire burns that fish swim and other great truths without which the work of the peace endowment would appear futile  and now said mr bryan looking about him with the air of a successful toastmaster i am going to ask our friend here to give us his views  renewed applause bore witness to the popularity of the philanthropist whom mr bryan had indicated with a wave of his hand  the philanthropist cleared his throat  in our business he began  mr bryan plucked him gently by the sleeve  never mind your business just now he whispered  the philanthropist bowed in assent and continued  i will come at once to the subject my own feeling is that the true way to end war is to try to spread abroad in all directions goodwill and brotherly love  hear hear cried the assembled company  and the great way to inspire brotherly love all round is to keep on getting richer and richer till you have so much money that every one loves you money gentlemen is a glorious thing  at this point mr norman angell who had remained silent hitherto raised his head from his chest and murmured drowsily  money money there isnt anything but money money is the only thing there is money and property property and money if you destroy it it is gone if you smash it it isnt there all the rest is a great illus  and with this he dozed off again into silence  our poor angell is asleep again said the lady pacifist  mr bryan shook his head  hes been that way ever since the war begansleeps all the time and keeps muttering that there isnt any war that people only imagine it in fact that it is all an illusion but i fear we are interrupting you he added turning to the philanthropist  i was just saying continued that gentleman that you can do anything with money you can stop a war with it if you have enough of it in ten minutes i dont care what kind of war it is or what the people are fighting for whether they are fighting for conquest or fighting for their homes and their children i can stop it stop it absolutely by my grip on money without firing a shot or incurring the slightest personal danger  the philanthropist spoke with the greatest emphasis reaching out his hand and clutching his fingers in the air  yes gentlemen he went on i am speaking here not of theories but of facts this is what i am doing and what i mean to do youve no idea how amenable people are especially poor people struggling people those with ties and responsibilities to the grip of money i went the other day to a man i know the head of a bank where i keep a little moneyjust a fraction of what i make gentlemen a mere nothing to me but everything to this man because he is still not rich and is only fighting his way up now i said to him you are english are you not yes sir he answered and i understand you mean to help along the loan to england with all the power of your bank yes he said i mean it and ill do it then ill tell you what i said you lend one penny or help to lend one penny to the people of england or the people of france and ill break you ill grind you into povertyyou and your wife and children and all that belongs to you  the philanthropist had spoken with so great an intensity that there was a deep stillness over the assembled company the negro president had straightened up in his seat and as he looked at the speaker there was something in his erect back and his stern face and the set of his faded uniform that somehow turned him african though he was into a soldier  sir he said with his eye riveted on the speakers face what happened to that banker man  the fool said the philanthropist he wouldnt hear he defied mehe said that there wasnt money enough in all my business to buy the soul of a single englishman i had his directors turn him from his bank that day and hes enlisted the scoundrel and is gone to the war but his wife and family are left behind they shall learn what the grip of the money power islearn it in misery and poverty  my good sir said the negro president slowly and impressively do you know why your plan of stopping war wouldnt work in haiti  no said the philanthropist  because our black people there would kill you whichever side they were on whatever they thought of the war they would take a man like you and lead you out into the town square and stand you up against the side of an adobe house and theyd shoot you come down to haiti if you doubt my words and try it  thank you said the philanthropist resuming his customary manner of undisturbed gentleness i dont think i will i dont think somehow that i could do business in haiti  the passage at arms between the negro president and the philanthropist had thrown a certain confusion into the hitherto agreeable gathering even the eminent divine was seen to be slowly shaking his head from side to side an extreme mark of excitement which he never permitted himself except under stress of passion the two humble guests at the foot of the table were visibly perturbed say i dont like that about the banker squeaked one of them that aint right eh what i dont like it  mr bryan was aware that the meeting was in danger of serious disorder he rapped loudly on the table for attention when he had at last obtained silence he spoke  i have kept my own views to the last he said because i cannot but feel that they possess a peculiar importance there is my dear friends every prospect that within a measurable distance of time i shall be able to put them into practice i am glad to be able to announce to you the practical certainty that four years from now i shall be president of the united states  at this announcement the entire company broke into spontaneous and heartfelt applause it had long been felt by all present that mr bryan was certain to be president of the united states if only he ran for the office often enough but that the glad moment had actually arrived seemed almost too good for belief  yes my friends continued the genial host i have just had a communication from my dear friend wilson in which he tells me that he himself will never contest the office again the presidency he says interfered too much with his private life in fact i am authorised to state in confidence that his wife forbids him to run  but my dear jennings interposed dr jordan thoughtfully what about mr hughes and colonel roosevelt  in that quarter my certainty in the matter is absolute i have calculated it out mathematically that i am bound to obtain in view of my known principles the entire german votewhich carries with it all the great breweries of the countrythe whole austrian vote all the hungarians of the sugar refineries the turks in fact my friends i am positive that roosevelt if he dares to run will carry nothing but the american vote  loud applause greeted this announcement  and now let me explain my plan which i believe is shared by a great number of sane and other pacifists in the country all the great nations of the world will be invited to form a single international force consisting of a fleet so powerful and so well equipped that no single nation will dare to bid it defiance  mr bryan looked about him with a glance of something like triumph the whole company and especially the negro president were now evidently interested say whispered the general public to his companion this sounds like the real thing eh what isnt he a peach of a thinker  what flag will your fleet fly asked the negro president  the flags of all nations said mr bryan  where will you get your sailors  from all the nations said mr bryan but the uniform will be all the same a plain white blouse with blue insertions and white duck trousers with the word peace stamped across the back of them in big letters this will help to impress the sailors with the almost sacred character of their functions  but what will the fleets functions be asked the president  whenever a quarrel arises explained mr bryan it will be submitted to a board who will be on this board in addition to myself i cannot as yet say but its of no consequence whenever a case is submitted to the board it will think it over for three years it will then announce its decisionif any after that if any one nation refuses to submit its ports will be bombarded by the peace fleet  rapturous expressions of approval greeted mr bryans explanation  but i dont understand said the negro president turning his puzzled face to mr bryan would some of these ships be british ships  oh certainly in view of the dominant size of the british navy about onequarter of all the ships would be british ships  and the sailors british sailors  oh yes said mr bryan except that they would be wearing international breechesa most important point  and if the board made up of all sorts of people were to give a decision against england then these shipsbritish ships with british sailorswould be sent to bombard england itself  exactly said mr bryan isnt it beautifully simple and to guarantee its working properly he continued just in case we have to use the fleet against england were going to ask admiral jellicoe himself to take command  the negro president slowly shook his head  marse bryan he said you notice what i say i know marse jellicoe i done seen him lots of times when he was just a lieutenant down in the harbour of port au prince if youse folks put up this proposition to marse

watered them very carefully  sunday good news just heard from princeton university i am to come back and everything will be forgiven and forgotten     timid thoughts on timely topics     xvi are the rich happy  let me admit at the outset that i write this essay without adequate material i have never known i have never seen any rich people very often i have thought that i had found them but it turned out that it was not so they were not rich at all they were quite poor they were hard up they were pushed for money they didnt know where to turn for ten thousand dollars  in all the cases that i have examined this same error has crept in i had often imagined from the fact of people keeping fifteen servants that they were rich i had supposed that because a woman rode down town in a limousine to buy a fiftydollar hat she must be well to do not at all all these people turn out on examination to be not rich they are cramped they say it themselves pinched i think is the word they use when i see a glittering group of eight people in a stage box at the opera i know that they are all pinched the fact that they ride home in a limousine has nothing to do with it  a friend of mine who has ten thousand dollars a year told me the other day with a sigh that he found it quite impossible to keep up with the rich on his income he couldnt do it a family that i know who have twenty thousand a year have told me the same thing they cant keep up with the rich there is no use trying a man that i respect very much who has an income of fifty thousand dollars a year from his law practice has told me with the greatest frankness that he finds it absolutely impossible to keep up with the rich he says it is better to face the brutal fact of being poor he says he can only give me a plain meal what he calls a home dinner it takes three men and two women to serve itand he begs me to put up with it  as far as i remember i have never met mr carnegie but i know that if i did he would tell me that he found it quite impossible to keep up with mr rockefeller no doubt mr rockefeller has the same feeling  on the other hand there are and there must be rich people somewhere i run across traces of them all the time the janitor in the building where i work has told me that he has a rich cousin in england who is in the southwestern railway and gets ten pounds a week he says the railway wouldnt know what to do without him in the same way the lady who washes at my house has a rich uncle he lives in winnipeg and owns his own house clear and has two girls at the high school  but these are only reported cases of richness i cannot vouch for them myself  when i speak therefore of rich people and discuss whether they are happy it is understood that i am merely drawing my conclusions from the people whom i see and know  my judgment is that the rich undergo cruel trials and bitter tragedies of which the poor know nothing  in the first place i find that the rich suffer perpetually from money troubles the poor sit snugly at home while sterling exchange falls ten points in a day do they care not a bit an adverse balance of trade washes over the nation like a flood who have to mop it up the rich call money rushes up to a hundred per cent and the poor can still sit and laugh at a ten cent moving picture show and forget it  but the rich are troubled by money all the time  i know a man for examplehis name is spuggwhose private bank account was overdrawn last month twenty thousand dollars he told me so at dinner at his club with apologies for feeling out of sorts he said it was bothering him he said he thought it rather unfair of his bank to have called his attention to it i could sympathise in a sort of way with his feelings my own account was overdrawn twenty cents at the time i knew that if the bank began calling in overdrafts it might be my turn next spugg said he supposed hed have to telephone his secretary in the morning to sell some bonds and cover it it seemed an awful thing to have to do poor people are never driven to this sort of thing i have known cases of their having to sell a little furniture perhaps but imagine having to sell the very bonds out of ones desk theres a bitterness about it that the poor man can never know  with this same man mr spugg i have often talked of the problem of wealth he is a selfmade man and he has told me again and again that the wealth he has accumulated is a mere burden to him he says that he was much happier when he had only the plain simple things of life often as i sit at dinner with him over a meal of nine courses he tells me how much he would prefer a plain bit of boiled pork with a little mashed turnip he says that if he had his way he would make his dinner out of a couple of sausages fried with a bit of bread i forgot what it is that stands in his way i have seen spugg put aside his glass of champagneor his glass after he had drunk his champagnewith an expression of something like contempt he says that he remembers a running creek at the back of his fathers farm where he used to lie at full length upon the grass and drink his fill champagne he says never tasted like that i have suggested that he should lie on his stomach on the floor of the club and drink a saucerful of soda water but he wont  i know well that my friend spugg would be glad to be rid of his wealth altogether if such a thing were possible till i understood about these things i always imagined that wealth could be given away it appears that it cannot it is a burden that one must carry wealth if one has enough of it becomes a form of social service one regards it as a means of doing good to the world of helping to brighten the lives of othersin a word a solemn trust spugg has often talked with me so long and so late on this topicthe duty of brightening the lives of othersthat the waiter who held blue flames for his cigarettes fell asleep against a door post and the chauffeur outside froze to the seat of his motor  spuggs wealth i say he regards as a solemn trust i have often asked him why he didnt give it for example to a college but he tells me that unfortunately he is not a college man i have called his attention to the need of further pensions for college professors after all that mr carnegie and others have done there are still thousands and thousands of old professors of thirtyfive and even forty working away day after day and getting nothing but what they earn themselves and with no provision beyond the age of eightyfive but mr spugg says that these men are the nations heroes their work is its own reward  but after all mr spuggs troublesfor he is a single man with no tiesare in a sense selfish it is perhaps in the homes or more properly in the residences of the rich that the great silent tragedies are being enacted every daytragedies of which the fortunate poor know and can know nothing  i saw such a case only a few nights ago at the house of the ashcroftfowlers where i was dining as we went in to dinner mrs ashcroftfowler said in a quiet aside to her husband has meadows spoken he shook his head rather gloomily and answered no he has said nothing yet i saw them exchange a glance of quiet sympathy and mutual help like people in trouble who love one another  they were old friends and my heart beat for them all through the dinner as meadowshe was their butlerpoured out the wine with each course i could feel that some great trouble was impending over my friends  after mrs ashcroftfowler had risen and left us and we were alone over our port wine i drew my chair near to fowlers and i said my dear fowler im an old friend and youll excuse me if i seem to be taking a liberty but i can see that you and your wife are in trouble  yes he said very sadly and quietly we are  excuse me i said tell mefor it makes a thing easier if one talks about itis it anything about meadows  yes he said it is about meadows  there was silence for a moment but i knew already what fowler was going to say i could feel it coming  meadows he said presently constraining himself to speak with as little emotion as possible is leaving us  poor old chap i said taking his hand  its hard isnt it he said franklin left last winterno fault of ours we did everything we could and now meadows  there was almost a sob in his voice  he hasnt spoken definitely as yet fowler went on but we know theres hardly any chance of his staying  does he give any reason i asked  nothing specific said fowler its just a sheer case of incompatibility meadows doesnt like us  he put his hand over his face and was silent  i left very quietly a little later without going up to the drawingroom a few days afterwards i heard that meadows had gone the ashcroftfowlers i am told are giving up in despair they are going to take a little suite of ten rooms and four baths in the grand palaver hotel and rough it there for the winter  yet one must not draw a picture of the rich in colours altogether gloomy there are cases among them of genuine lighthearted happiness  i have observed this is especially the case among those of the rich who have the good fortune to get ruined absolutely and completely ruined they may do this on the stock exchange or by banking or in a dozen other ways the business side of getting ruined is not difficult  once the rich are ruined they are as far as my observation goes all right they can then have anything they want  i saw this point illustrated again just recently i was walking with a friend of mine and a motor passed bearing a neatly dressed young man chatting gaily with a pretty woman my friend raised his hat and gave it a jaunty and cheery swing in the air as if to wave goodwill and happiness  poor old edward overjoy he said as the motor moved out of sight  whats wrong with him i asked  hadnt you heard said my friend hes ruinedabsolutely cleaned outnot a cent left  dear me i said thats awfully hard i suppose hell have to sell that beautiful motor  my friend shook his head  oh no he said hell hardly do that i dont think his wife would care to sell that  my friend was right the overjoys have not sold their motor neither have they sold their magnificent sandstone residence they are too much attached to it i believe to sell it some people thought they would have given up their box at the opera but it appears not they are too musical to care to do that meantime it is a matter of general notoriety that the overjoys are absolutely ruined in fact they havent a single cent you could buy overjoyso i am informedfor ten dollars  but i observe that he still wears a seallined coat worth at least five hundred     xvii humour as i see it  it is only fair that at the back of this book i should be allowed a few pages to myself to put down some things that i really think  until two weeks ago i might have taken my pen in hand to write about humour with the confident air of an acknowledged professional  but that time is past such claim as i had has been taken from me in fact i stand unmasked an english reviewer writing in a literary journal the very name of which is enough to put contradiction to sleep has said of my writing what is there after all in professor leacocks humour but a rather ingenious mixture of hyperbole and myosis  the man was right how he stumbled upon this trade secret i do not know but i am willing to admit since the truth is out that it has long been my custom in preparing an article of a humorous nature to go down to the cellar and mix up half a gallon of myosis with a pint of hyperbole if i want to give the article a decidedly literary character i find it well to put in about half a pint of paresis the whole thing is amazingly simple  but i only mention this by way of introduction and to dispel any idea that i am conceited enough to write about humour with the professional authority of ella wheeler wilcox writing about love or eva tanguay talking about dancing  all that i dare claim is that i have as much sense of humour as other people and oddly enough i notice that everybody else makes this same claim any man will admit if need be that his sight is not good or that he cannot swim or shoots badly with a rifle but to touch upon his sense of humour is to give him a mortal affront  no said a friend of mine the other day i never go to grand opera and then he added with an air of pride you see i have absolutely no ear for music  you dont say so i exclaimed  none he went on i cant tell one tune from another i dont know home sweet home from god save the king i cant tell whether a man is tuning a violin or playing a sonata  he seemed to get prouder and prouder over each item of his own deficiency he ended by saying that he had a dog at his house that had a far better ear for music than he had as soon as his wife or any visitor started to play the piano the dog always began to howlplaintively he saidas if it were hurt he himself never did this  when he had finished i made what i thought a harmless comment  i suppose i said that you find your sense of humour deficient in the same way the two generally go together  my friend was livid with rage in a moment  sense of humour he said my sense of humour me without a sense of humour why i suppose ive a keener sense of humour than any man or any two men in this city  from that he turned to bitter personal attack he said that my sense of humour seemed to have withered altogether  he left me still quivering with indignation  personally however i do not mind making the admission however damaging it may be that there are certain forms of socalled humour or at least fun which i am quite unable to appreciate chief among these is that ancient thing called the practical joke  you never knew mcgann did you a friend of mine asked me the other day  when i said i had never known mcgann he shook his head with a sigh and said  ah you should have known mcgann he had the greatest sense of humour of any man i ever knewalways full of jokes i remember one night at the boardinghouse where we were he stretched a string across the passageway and then rang the dinner bell one of the boarders broke his leg we nearly died laughing  dear me i said what a humorist did he often do things like that  oh yes he was at them all the time he used to put tar in the tomato soup and beeswax and tintacks on the chairs he was full of ideas they seemed to come to him without any trouble  mcgann i understand is dead i am not sorry for it indeed i think that for most of us the time has gone by when we can see the fun of putting tacks on chairs or thistles in beds or live snakes in peoples boots  to me it has always seemed that the very essence of good humour is that it must be without harm and without malice i admit that there is in all of us a certain vein of the old original demoniacal humour or joy in the misfortune of another which sticks to us like our original sin it ought not to be funny to see a man especially a fat and pompous man slip suddenly on a banana skin but it is when a skater on a pond who is describing graceful circles and showing off before the crowd breaks through the ice and gets a ducking everybody shouts with joy to the original savage the cream of the joke in such cases was found if the man who slipped broke his neck or the man who went through the ice never came up again i can imagine a group of prehistoric men standing round the icehole where he had disappeared and laughing till their sides split if there had been such a thing as a prehistoric newspaper the affair would have headed up amusing incident unknown gentleman breaks through ice and is drowned  but our sense of humour under civilisation has been weakened much of the fun of this sort of thing has been lost on us  children however still retain a large share of this primitive sense of enjoyment  i remember once watching two little boys making snowballs at the side of the street and getting ready a little store of them to use as they worked there came along an old man wearing a silk hat and belonging by appearance to the class of jolly old gentlemen when he saw the boys his gold spectacles gleamed with kindly enjoyment he began waving his arms and calling now then boys free shot at me free shot in his gaiety he had without noticing it edged himself over the sidewalk on to the street an express cart collided with him and knocked him over on his back in a heap of snow he lay there gasping and trying to get the snow off his face and spectacles the boys gathered up their snowballs and took a run toward him free shot they yelled soak him soak him  i repeat however that for me as i suppose for most of us it is a prime condition of humour that it must be without harm or malice nor should it convey incidentally any real picture of sorrow or suffering or death there is a great deal in the humour of scotland i admit its general merit which seems to me not being a scotchman to sin in this respect take this familiar story i quote it as something already known and not for the sake of telling it  a scotchman had a sisterinlawhis wifes sisterwith whom he could never agree he always objected to going anywhere with her and in spite of his wifes entreaties always refused to do so the wife was taken mortally ill and as she lay dying she whispered john yell drive janet with you to the funeral will ye no the scotchman after an internal struggle answered margaret ill do it for ye but itll spoil my day  whatever humour there may be in this is lost for me by the actual and vivid picture that it conjures upthe dying wife the darkened room and the last whispered request  no doubt the scotch see things differently that wonderful peoplewhom personally i cannot too much admirealways seem to me to prefer adversity to sunshine to welcome the prospect of a pretty general damnation and to live with grim cheerfulness within the very shadow of death alone among the nations they have converted the devil under such names as old hornyinto a familiar acquaintance not without a certain grim charm of his own no doubt also there enters into their humour something of the original barbaric attitude towards things for a primitive people who saw death often and at first hand and for whom the future world was a vivid reality that could be felt as it were in the midnight forest and heard in the roaring storm it was no doubt natural to turn the flank of terror by forcing a merry and jovial acquaintance with the unseen world such a practice as a wake and the merrymaking about the corpse carry us back to the twilight of the world with the poor savage in his bewildered misery pretending that his dead still lived our funeral with its black trappings and its elaborate ceremonies is the lineal descendant of a merrymaking our undertaker is by evolution a genial master of ceremonies keeping things lively at the deathdance thus have the ceremonies and the trappings of death been transformed in the course of ages till the forced gaiety is gone and the black hearse and the gloomy mutes betoken the cold dignity of our despair  but i fear this article is getting serious i must apologise  i was about to say when i wandered from the point that there is another form of humour which i am also quite unable to appreciate this is that particular form of story which may be called par excellence the english anecdote it always deals with persons of rank and birth and except for the exalted nature of the subject itself is as far as i can see absolutely pointless  this is the kind of thing that i mean  his grace the fourth duke of marlborough was noted for the openhanded hospitality which reigned at blenheim the family seat during his regime one day on going in to luncheon it was discovered that there were thirty guests present whereas the table only held covers for twentyone oh well said the duke not a whit abashed some of us will have to eat standing up everybody of course roared with laughter  my only wonder is that they didnt kill themselves with it a mere roar doesnt seem enough to do justice to such a story as this  the duke of wellington has been made the stormcentre of three generations of wit of this sort in fact the typical duke of wellington story has been reduced to a thin skeleton such as this  a young subaltern once met the duke of wellington coming out of westminster abbey good morning your grace he said rather a wet morning yes said the duke with a very rigid bow but it was a damn sight wetter sir on the morning of waterloo the young subaltern rightly rebuked hung his head  nor is it only the english who sin in regard to anecdotes  one can indeed make the sweeping assertion that the telling of stories as a mode of amusing others ought to be kept within strict limits few people realise how extremely difficult it is to tell a story so as to reproduce the real fun of itto get it over as the actors say the mere facts of a story seldom make it funny it needs the right words with every word in its proper place here and there perhaps once in a hundred times a story turns up which needs no telling the humour of it turns so completely on a sudden twist or incongruity in the denouement of it that no narrator however clumsy can altogether fumble it  take for example this wellknown instancea story which in one form or other everybody has heard  george grossmith the famous comedian was once badly run down and went to consult a doctor it happened that the doctor though like everybody else he had often seen grossmith on the stage had never seen him without his makeup and did not know him by sight he examined his patient looked at his tongue felt his pulse and tapped his lungs then he shook his head theres nothing wrong with you sir he said except that youre run down from overwork and worry you need rest and amusement take a night off and go and see george grossmith at the savoy thank you said the patient i am george grossmith  let the reader please observe that i have purposely told this story all wrongly just as wrongly as could be and yet there is something left of it will the reader kindly look back to the beginning of it and see for himself just how it ought to be narrated and what obvious error has been made if he has any particle of the artist in his makeup he will see at once that the story ought to begin  one day a very haggard and nervouslooking patient called at the house of a fashionable doctor etc etc  in other words the chief point of the joke lies in keeping it concealed till the moment when the patient says thank you i am george grossmith but the story is such a good one that it cannot be completely spoiled even when told wrongly this particular anecdote has been variously told of george grossmith coquelin joe jefferson john hare cyril maude and about sixty others and i have noticed that there is a certain type of man who on hearing this story about grossmith immediately tells it all back again putting in the name of somebody else and goes into new fits of laughter over it as if the change of name made it brand new  but few people i repeat realise the difficulty of reproducing a humorous or comic effect in its original spirit  i saw harry lauder last night said griggs a stock exchange friend of mine as we walked up town together the other day he came on to the stage in kilts here grigg started to chuckle and he had a slate under his arm here griggs began to laugh quite heartily and he said i always like to carry a slate with me of course he said it in scotch but i cant do the scotch the way he does it just in case there might be any figures id be wanting to put down by this time griggs was almost suffocated with laughterand he took a little bitof chalk out of his pocket and he said griggs was now almost hysterical i like to carry a wee bit chalk along because i find the slate is griggs was now faint with laughter the slate isisnot much good without the chalk  griggs had to stop with his hand to his side and lean against a lamppost i cant of course do the scotch the way harry lauder does it he repeated  exactly he couldnt do the scotch and he couldnt do the rich mellow voice of mr lauder and the face beaming with merriment and the spectacles glittering with amusement and he couldnt do the slate nor the wee bit chalkin fact he couldnt do any of it he ought merely to have said harry lauder and leaned up against a post and laughed till he had got over it  yet in spite of everything people insist on spoiling conversation by telling stories i know nothing more dreadful at a dinner table than one of these amateur raconteursexcept perhaps two of them after about three stories have been told there falls on the dinner table an uncomfortable silence in which everybody is aware that everybody else is trying hard to think of another story and is failing to find it there is no peace in the gathering again till some man of firm and quiet mind turns to his neighbour and says but after all there is no doubt that whether we like it or not prohibition is coming then everybody in his heart says thank heaven and the whole tableful are happy and contented again till one of the storytellers thinks of another and breaks loose  worst of all perhaps is the modest storyteller who is haunted by the idea that one has heard this story before he attacks you after this fashion  i heard a very good story the other day on the steamer going to bermudathen he pauses with a certain doubt in his facebut perhaps youve heard this  no no ive never been to bermuda go ahead  well this is a story that they tell about a man who went down to bermuda one winter to get cured of rheumatism but youve heard this  no no  well he had rheumatism pretty bad and he went to bermuda to get cured of it and so when he went into the hotel he said to the clerk at the deskbut perhaps you know this  no no go right ahead  well he said to the clerk i want a room that looks out over the seabut perhaps  now the sensible thing to do is to stop the narrator right at this point say to him quietly and firmly yes i have heard that story i always liked it ever since it came out in tit bits in 1878 and i read it every time i see it go on and tell it to me and ill sit back with my eyes closed and enjoy it  no doubt the storytelling habit owes much to the fact that ordinary people quite unconsciously rate humour very low i mean they underestimate the difficulty of making humour it would never occur to them that the thing is hard meritorious and dignified because the result is gay and light they think the process must be few people would realise that it is much harder to write one of owen seamans funny poems in punch than to write one of the archbishop of canterburys sermons mark twains huckleberry finn is a greater work than kants critique of pure reason and charles dickenss creation of mr pickwick did more for the elevation of the human racei say it in all seriousnessthan cardinal newmans lead kindly light amid the encircling gloom newman only cried out for light in the gloom of a sad world dickens gave it  but the deep background that lies behind and beyond what we call humour is revealed only to the few who by instinct or by effort have given thought to it the worlds humour in its best and greatest sense is perhaps the highest product of our civilisation one thinks here not of the mere spasmodic effects of the comic artist or the blackface expert of the vaudeville show but of the really great humour which once or twice in a generation at best illuminates and elevates our literature it is no longer dependent upon the mere trick and quibble of words or the odd and meaningless incongruities in things that strike us as funny its basis lies in the deeper contrasts offered by life itself the strange incongruity between our aspiration and our achievement the eager and fretful anxieties of today that fade into nothingness tomorrow the burning pain and the sharp sorrow that are softened in the gentle retrospect of time till as we look back upon the course that has been traversed we pass in view the panorama of our lives as people in old age may recall with mingled tears and smiles the angry quarrels of their childhood and here in its larger aspect humour is blended with pathos till the two are one and represent as they have in every age the mingled heritage of tears and laughter that is our lot on earth   end
