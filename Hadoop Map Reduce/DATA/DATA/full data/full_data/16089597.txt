16089597	green mansions  a romance of the tropical forest  by w h hudson     foreword  i take up pen for this foreword with the fear of one who knows that he cannot do justice to his subject and the trembling of one who would not for a good deal set down words unpleasing to the eye of him who wrote green mansions the purple land and all those other books which have meant so much to me for of all living authorsnow that tolstoi has gone i could least dispense with w h hudson why do i love his writing so i think because he is of living writers that i read the rarest spirit and has the clearest gift of conveying to me the nature of that spirit writers are to their readers little new worlds to be explored and each traveller in the realms of literature must needs have a favourite huntingground which in his good willor perhaps merely in his egoismhe would wish others to share with him  the great and abiding misfortunes of most of us writers are twofold we are as worlds rather common trampingground for our readers rather tame territory and as guides and dragomans thereto we are too superficial lacking clear intimacy of expression in factlike guide or dragomanwe cannot let folk into the real secrets or show them the spirit of the land  now hudson whether in a pure romance like this green mansions or in that romantic piece of realism the purple land or in books like idle days in patagonia afoot in england the lands end adventures among birds a shepherds life and all his other nomadic records of communings with men birds beasts and nature has a supreme gift of disclosing not only the thing he sees but the spirit of his vision without apparent effort he takes you with him into a rare free natural world and always you are refreshed stimulated enlarged by going there  he is of course a distinguished naturalist probably the most acute broadminded and understanding observer of nature living and this in an age of specialism which loves to put men into pigeonholes and label them has been a misfortune to the reading public who seeing the label naturalist pass on and take down the nearest novel hudson has indeed the gifts and knowledge of a naturalist but that is a mere fraction of his value and interest a really great writer such as this is no more to be circumscribed by a single word than america by the part of it called new york the expert knowledge which hudson has of nature gives to all his work backbone and surety of fibre and to his sense of beauty an intimate actuality but his real eminence and extraordinary attraction lie in his spirit and philosophy we feel from his writings that he is nearer to nature than other men and yet more truly civilized the competitive towny culture the queer uptodate commercial knowingness with which we are so busy coating ourselves simply will not stick to him a passage in his hampshire days describes him better than i can the blue sky the brown soil beneath the grass the trees the animals the wind and rain and stars are never strange to me for i am in and of and am one with them and my flesh and the soil are one and the heat in my blood and in the sunshine are one and the winds and the tempests and my passions are one i feel the strangeness only with regard to my fellow men especially in towns where they exist in conditions unnatural to me but congenial to them in such moments we sometimes feel a kinship with and are strangely drawn to the dead who were not as these the long long dead the men who knew not life in towns and felt no strangeness in sun and wind and rain this unspoiled unity with nature pervades all his writings they are remote from the fret and dust and pettiness of town life they are large direct free it is not quite simplicity for the mind of this writer is subtle and fastidious sensitive to each motion of natural and human life but his sensitiveness is somehow different from almost inimical to that of us others who sit indoors and dip our pens in shades of feeling hudsons fancy is akin to the flight of the birds that are his special lovesit never seems to have entered a house but since birth to have been roaming the air in rain and sun or visiting the trees and the grass i not only disbelieve utterly but intensely dislike the doctrine of metempsychosis which if i understand it aright seems the negation of the creative impulse an apotheosis of stalenessnothing quite new in the world never anything quite newnot even the soul of a baby and so i am not prepared to entertain the whim that a bird was one of his remote incarnations still in sweep of wing quickness of eye and natural sweet strength of song he is not unlike a superbirdwhich is a horrid image and that reminds me this after all is a foreword to green mansionsthe romance of the birdgirl rimaa story actual yet fantastic which immortalizes i think as passionate a love of all beautiful things as ever was in the heart of man somewhere hudson says the sense of the beautiful is gods best gift to the human soul so it is and to pass that gift on to others in such measure as herein is expressed must surely have been happiness to him who wrote green mansions in form and spirit the book is unique a simple romantic narrative transmuted by sheer glow of beauty into a prose poem without ever departing from its quality of a tale it symbolizes the yearning of the human soul for the attainment of perfect love and beauty in this lifethat impossible perfection which we must all learn to see fall from its high tree and be consumed in the flames as was rima the birdgirl but whose fine white ashes we gather that they may be mingled at last with our own when we too have been refined by the fire of deaths resignation the book is soaked through and through with a strange beauty i will not go on singing its praises or trying to make it understood because i have other words to say of its author  do we realize how far our town life and culture have got away from things that really matter how instead of making civilization our handmaid to freedom we have set her heel on our necks and under it bite dust all the time hudson whether he knows it or not is now the chief standardbearer of another faith thus he spake in the purple land ah yes we are all vainly seeking after happiness in the wrong way it was with us once and ours but we despised it for it was only the old common happiness which nature gives to all her children and we went away from it in search of another grander kind of happiness which some dreamerbacon or anotherassured us we should find we had only to conquer nature find out her secrets make her our obedient slave then the earth would be eden and every man adam and every woman eve we are still marching bravely on conquering nature but how weary and sad we are getting the old joy in life and gaiety of heart have vanished though we do sometimes pause for a few moments in our long forced march to watch the labours of some pale mechanician seeking after perpetual motion and indulge in a little dry cackling laugh at his expense and again for here the religion that languishes in crowded cities or steals shamefaced to hide itself in dim churches flourishes greatly filling the soul with a solemn joy face to face with nature on the vast hills at eventide who does not feel himself near to the unseen     out of his heart god shall not pass     his image stamped is on every grass  all hudsons books breathe this spirit of revolt against our new enslavement by towns and machinery and are true oases in an age so dreadfully resigned to the pale mechanician  but hudson is not as tolstoi was a conscious prophet his spirit is freer more willful whimsicalalmost perverseand far more steeped in love of beauty if you called him a prophet he would stamp his foot at youas he will at me if he reads these words but his voice is prophetic for all that crying in a wilderness out of which at the call will spring up roses here and there and the sweetsmelling grass i would that every man woman and child in england were made to read him and i would that you in america would take him to heart he is a tonic a deep refreshing drink with a strange and wonderful flavour he is a mine of new interests and ways of thought instinctively right as a simple narrator he is wellnigh unsurpassed as a stylist he has few if any living equals and in all his work there is an indefinable freedom from any thought of afterbenefiteven from the desire that we should read him he puts down what he sees and feels out of sheer love of the thing seen and the emotion felt the smell of the lamp has not touched a single page that he ever wrote that alone is a marvel to us who know that to write well even to write clearly is a wound business long to learn hard to learn and no gift of the angels style should not obtrude between a writer and his reader it should be servant not master to use words so true and simple that they oppose no obstacle to the flow of thought and feeling from mind to mind and yet by juxtaposition of wordsounds set up in the recipient continuing emotion or gratificationthis is the essence of style and hudsons writing has preeminently this double quality from almost any page of his books an example might be taken here is one no better than a thousand others a description of two little girls on a beach they were dressed in black frocks and scarlet blouses which set off their beautiful small dark faces their eyes sparkled like black diamonds and their loose hair was a wonder to see a black mist or cloud about their heads and necks composed of threads fine as gossamer blacker than jet and shining like spun glasshair that looked as if no comb or brush could ever tame its beautiful wildness and in spirit they were what they seemed such a wild joyous frolicsome spirit with such grace and fleetness one does not look for in human beings but only in birds or in some small birdlike volatile mammala squirrel or a spidermonkey of the tropical forest or the chinchilla of the desolate mountain slopes the swiftest wildest loveliest most airy and most vocal of small beauties or this as the quintessence of a sly remark after that mantel got on to his horse and rode away it was black and rainy but he had never needed moon or lantern to find what he sought by night whether his own house or a fat cowalso his own perhaps so one might go on quoting felicity for ever from this writer he seems to touch every string with fresh and uninked fingers and the secret of his power lies i suspect in the fact that his words life being more than all else to me   are so utterly true  i do not descant on his love for simple folk and simple things his championship of the weak and the revolt against the cagings and cruelties of life whether to men or birds or beasts that springs out of him as if against his will because having spoken of him as one with a vital philosophy or faith i dont wish to draw red herrings across the main trail of his worth to the world his work is a vision of natural beauty and of human life as it might be quickened and sweetened by the sun and the wind and the rain and by fellowship with all the other forms of lifethe truest vision now being given to us who are more in want of it than any generation has ever been a very great writer andto my thinkingthe most valuable our age possesses  john galsworthy  september 1915 manaton devon     green mansions     prologue  it is a cause of very great regret to me that this task has taken so much longer a time than i had expected for its completion it is now many monthsover a year in factsince i wrote to georgetown announcing my intention of publishing in a very few months the whole truth about mr abel hardly less could have been looked for from his nearest friend and i had hoped that the discussion in the newspapers would have ceased at all events until the appearance of the promised book it has not been so and at this distance from guiana i was not aware of how much conjectural matter was being printed week by week in the local press some of which must have been painful reading to mr abels friends a darkened chamber the existence of which had never been suspected in that familiar house in main street furnished only with an ebony stand on which stood a cinerary urn its surface ornamented with flower and leaf and thorn and winding through it all the figure of a serpent an inscription too of seven short words which no one could understand or rightly interpret and finally the disposal of the mysterious ashesthat was all there was relating to an untold chapter in a mans life for imagination to work on let us hope that now at last the romanceweaving will come to an end it was however but natural that the keenest curiosity should have been excited not only because of that peculiar and indescribable charm of the man which all recognized and which won all hearts but also because of that hidden chapterthat sojourn in the desert about which he preserved silence it was felt in a vague way by his intimates that he had met with unusual experiences which had profoundly affected him and changed the course of his life to me alone was the truth known and i must now tell briefly as possible how my great friendship and close intimacy with him came about  when in 1887 i arrived in georgetown to take up an appointment in a public office i found mr abel an old resident there a man of means and a favourite in society yet he was an alien a venezuelan one of that turbulent people on our border whom the colonists have always looked on as their natural enemies the story told to me was that about twelve years before that time he had arrived at georgetown from some remote district in the interior that he had journeyed alone on foot across half the continent to the coast and had first appeared among them a young stranger penniless in rags wasted almost to a skeleton by fever and misery of all kinds his face blackened by long exposure to sun and wind friendless with but little english it was a hard struggle for him to live but he managed somehow and eventually letters from caracas informed him that a considerable property of which he had been deprived was once more his own and he was also invited to return to his country to take his part in the government of the republic but mr abel though young had already outlived political passions and aspirations and apparently even the love of his country at all events he elected to stay where he washis enemies he would say smilingly were his best friendsand one of the first uses he made of his fortune was to buy that house in main street which was afterwards like a home to me  i must state here that my friends full name was abel guevez de argensola but in his early days in georgetown he was called by his christian name only and later he wished to be known simply as mr abel  i had no sooner made his acquaintance than i ceased to wonder at the esteem and even affection with which he a venezuelan was regarded in this british colony all knew and liked him and the reason of it was the personal charm of the man his kindly disposition his manner with women which pleased them and excited no mans jealousynot even the old hottempered planters with a very young and pretty and lightheaded wifehis love of little children of all wild creatures of nature and of whatsoever was furthest removed from the common material interests and concerns of a purely commercial community the things which excited other menpolitics sport and the price of crystalswere outside of his thoughts and when men had done with them for a season when like the tempest they had blown their fill in office and clubroom and house and wanted a change it was a relief to turn to mr abel and get him to discourse of his worldthe world of nature and of the spirit  it was all felt a good thing to have a mr abel in georgetown that it was indeed good for me i quickly discovered i had certainly not expected to meet in such a place with any person to share my tastesthat love of poetry which has been the chief passion and delight of my life but such a one i had found in mr abel it surprised me that he suckled on the literature of spain and a reader of only ten or twelve years of english literature possessed a knowledge of our modern poetry as intimate as my own and a love of it equally great this feeling brought us together and made us twothe nervous oliveskinned hispanoamerican of the tropics and the phlegmatic blueeyed saxon of the cold northone in spirit and more than brothers many were the daylight hours we spent together and tired the sun with talking many past counting the precious evenings in that restful house of his where i was an almost daily guest i had not looked for such happiness nor he often said had he a result of this intimacy was that the vague idea concerning his hidden past that some unusual experience had profoundly affected him and perhaps changed the whole course of his life did not diminish but on the contrary became accentuated and was often in my mind the change in him was almost painful to witness whenever our wandering talk touched on the subject of the aborigines and of the knowledge he had acquired of their character and languages when living or travelling among them all that made his conversation most engagingthe lively curious mind the wit the gaiety of spirit tinged with a tender melancholyappeared to fade out of it even the expression of his face would change becoming hard and set and he would deal you out facts in a dry mechanical way as if reading them in a book it grieved me to note this but i dropped no hint of such a feeling and would never have spoken about it but for a quarrel which came at last to make the one brief solitary break in that close friendship of years i got into a bad state of health and abel was not only much concerned about it but annoyed as if i had not treated him well by being ill and he would even say that i could get well if i wished to i did not take this seriously but one morning when calling to see me at the office he attacked me in a way that made me downright angry with him he told me that indolence and the use of stimulants was the cause of my bad health he spoke in a mocking way with a presence of not quite meaning it but the feeling could not be wholly disguised stung by his reproaches i blurted out that he had no right to talk to me even in fun in such a way yes he said getting serious he had the best rightthat of our friendship he would be no true friend if he kept his peace about such a matter then in my haste i retorted that to me the friendship between us did not seem so perfect and complete as it did to him one condition of friendship is that the partners in it should be known to each other he had had my whole life and mind open to him to read it as in a book his life was a closed and clasped volume to me  his face darkened and after a few moments silent reflection he got up and left me with a cold goodbye and without that handgrasp which had been customary between us  after his departure i had the feeling that a great loss a great calamity had befallen me but i was still smarting at his too candid criticism all the more because in my heart i acknowledged its truth and that night lying awake i repented of the cruel retort i had made and resolved to ask his forgiveness and leave it to him to determine the question of our future relations but he was beforehand with me and with the morning came a letter begging my forgiveness and asking me to go that evening to dine with him  we were alone and during dinner and afterwards when we sat smoking and sipping black coffee in the veranda we were unusually quiet even to gravity which caused the two whiteclad servants that waited on usthe brownfaced subtleeyed old hindu butler and an almost blueblack young guiana negroto direct many furtive glances at their masters face they were accustomed to see him in a more genial mood when he had a friend to dine to me the change in his manner was not surprising from the moment of seeing him i had divined that he had determined to open the shut and clasped volume of which i had spokenthat the time had now come for him to speak    chapter i  now that we are cool he said and regret that we hurt each other i am not sorry that it happened i deserved your reproach a hundred times i have wished to tell you the whole story of my travels and adventures among the savages and one of the reasons which prevented me was the fear that it would have an unfortunate effect on our friendship that was precious and i desired above everything to keep it but i must think no more about that now i must think only of how i am to tell you my story i will begin at a time when i was twentythree it was early in life to be in the thick of politics and in trouble to the extent of having to fly my country to save my liberty perhaps my life  every nation someone remarks has the government it deserves and venezuela certainly has the one it deserves and that suits it best we call it a republic not only because it is not one but also because a thing must have a name and to have a good name or a fine name is very convenientespecially when you want to borrow money if the venezuelans thinly distributed over an area of half a million square miles mostly illiterate peasants halfbreeds and indigenes were educated intelligent men zealous only for the public weal it would be possible for them to have a real republic they have instead a government by cliques tempered by revolution and a very good government it is in harmony with the physical conditions of the country and the national temperament now it happens that the educated men representing your higher classes are so few that there are not many persons unconnected by ties of blood or marriage with prominent members of the political groups to which they belong by this you will see how easy and almost inevitable it is that we should become accustomed to look on conspiracy and revolt against the regnant partythe men of another cliqueas only in the natural order of things in the event of failure such outbreaks are punished but they are not regarded as immoral on the contrary men of the highest intelligence and virtue among us are seen taking a leading part in these adventures whether such a condition of things is intrinsically wrong or not or would be wrong in some circumstances and is not wrong because inevitable in others i cannot pretend to decide and all this tiresome profusion is only to enable you to understand how ia young man of unblemished character not a soldier by profession not ambitious of political distinction wealthy for that country popular in society a lover of social pleasures of books of nature actuated as i believed by the highest motives allowed myself to be drawn very readily by friends and relations into a conspiracy to overthrow the government of the moment with the object of replacing it by more worthy men ourselves to wit  our adventure failed because the authorities got wind of the affair and matters were precipitated our leaders at the moment happened to be scattered over the countrysome were abroad and a few hotheaded men of the party who were in caracas just then and probably feared arrest struck a rash blow the president was attacked in the street and wounded but the attackers were seized and some of them shot on the following day when the news reached me i was at a distance from the capital staying with a friend on an estate he owned on the river quebrada honda in the state of guarico some fifteen to twenty miles from the town of zaraza my friend an officer in the army was a leader in the conspiracy and as i was the only son of a man who had been greatly hated by the minister of war it became necessary for us both to fly for our lives in the circumstances we could not look to be pardoned even on the score of youth  our first decision was to escape to the seacoast but as the risk of a journey to la guayra or any other port of embarkation on the north side of the country seemed too great we made our way in a contrary direction to the orinoco and downstream to angostura now when we had reached this comparatively safe breathingplacesafe at all events for the momenti changed my mind about leaving or attempting to leave the country since boyhood i had taken a very peculiar interest in that vast and almost unexplored territory we possess south of the orinoco with its countless unmapped rivers and trackless forests and in its savage inhabitants with their ancient customs and character unadulterated by contact with europeans to visit this primitive wilderness had been a cherished dream and i had to some extent even prepared myself for such an adventure by mastering more than one of the indian dialects of the northern states of venezuela and now finding myself on the south side of our great river with unlimited time at my disposal i determined to gratify this wish my companion took his departure towards the coast while i set about making preparations and hunting up information from those who had travelled in the interior to trade with the savages i decided eventually to go back upstream and penetrate to the interior in the western part of guayana and the amazonian territory bordering on colombia and brazil and to return to angostura in about six months time i had no fear of being arrested in the semiindependent and in most part savage region as the guayana authorities concerned themselves little enough about the political upheavals at caracas  the first five or six months i spent in guayana after leaving the city of refuge were eventful enough to satisfy a moderately adventurous spirit a complaisant government employee at angostura had provided me with a passport in which it was set down for few to read that my object in visiting the interior was to collect information concerning the native tribes the vegetable products of the country and other knowledge which would be of advantage to the republic and the authorities were requested to afford me protection and assist me in my pursuits i ascended the orinoco making occasional expeditions to the small christian settlements in the neighbourhood of the right bank also to the indian villages and travelling in this way seeing and learning much in about three months i reached the river metal during this period i amused myself by keeping a journal a record of personal adventures impressions of the country and people both semicivilized and savage and as my journal grew i began to think that on my return at some future time to caracas it might prove useful and interesting to the public and also procure me fame which thought proved pleasurable and a great incentive so that i began to observe things more narrowly and to study expression but the book was not to be  from the mouth of the meta i journeyed on intending to visit the settlement of atahapo where the great river guaviare with other rivers empties itself into the orinoco but i was not destined to reach it for at the small settlement of manapuri i fell ill of a low fever and here ended the first halfyear of my wanderings about which no more need be told  a more miserable place than manapuri for a man to be ill of a low fever in could not well be imagined the settlement composed of mean hovels with a few large structures of mud or plastered wattle thatched with palm leaves was surrounded by water marsh and forest the breedingplace of myriads of croaking frogs and of clouds of mosquitoes even to one in perfect health existence in such a place would have been a burden the inhabitants mustered about eighty or ninety mostly indians of that degenerate class frequently to be met with in small trading outposts the savages of guayana are great drinkers but not drunkards in our sense since their fermented liquors contain so little alcohol that inordinate quantities must be swallowed to produce intoxication in the settlements they prefer the white mans more potent poisons with the result that in a small place like manapuri one can see enacted as on a stage the last act in the great american tragedy to be succeeded doubtless by other and possibly greater tragedies my thoughts at that period of suffering were pessimistic in the extreme sometimes when the almost continuous rain held up for half a day i would manage to creep out a short distance but i was almost past making any exertion scarcely caring to live and taking absolutely no interest in the news from caracas which reached me at long intervals at the end of two months feeling a slight improvement in my health and with it a returning interest in life and its affairs it occurred to me to get out my diary and write a brief account of my sojourn at manapuri i had placed it for safety in a small deal box lent to me for the purpose by a venezuelan trader an old resident at the settlement by name pantaleoncalled by all don pantaone who openly kept half a dozen indian wives in his house and was noted for his dishonesty and greed but who had proved himself a good friend to me the box was in a corner of the wretched palmthatched hovel i inhabited but on taking it out i discovered that for several weeks the rain had been dripping on it and that the manuscript was reduced to a sodden pulp i flung it upon the floor with a curse and threw myself back on my bed with a groan  in that desponding state i was found by my friend panta who was constant in his visits at all hours and when in answer to his anxious inquiries i pointed to the pulpy mass on the mud floor he turned it over with his foot and then bursting into a loud laugh kicked it out remarking that he had mistaken the object for some unknown reptile that had crawled in out of the rain he affected to be astonished that i should regret its loss it was all a true narrative he exclaimed if i wished to write a book for the stayathomes to read i could easily invent a thousand lies far more entertaining than any real experiences he had come to me he said to propose something he had lived twenty years at that place and had got accustomed to the climate but it would not do for me to remain any longer if i wished to live i must go away at once to a different countryto the mountains where it was open and dry and if you want quinine when you are there he concluded smell the wind when it blows from the southwest and you will inhale it into your system fresh from the forest when i remarked despondingly that in my condition it would be impossible to quit manapuri he went on to say that a small party of indians was now in the settlement that they had come not only to trade but to visit one of their own tribe who was his wife purchased some years ago from her father and the money she cost me i have never regretted to this day said he for she is a good wife not jealous he added with a curse on all the others these indians came all the way from the queneveta mountains and were of the maquiritari tribe he panta and better still his good wife would interest them on my behalf and for a suitable reward they would take me by slow easy stages to their own country where i would be treated well and recover my health  this proposal after i had considered it well produced so good an effect on me that i not only gave a glad consent but on the following day i was able to get about and begin the preparations for my journey with some spirit  in about eight days i bade goodbye to my generous friend panta whom i regarded after having seen much of him as a kind of savage beast that had sprung on me not to rend but to rescue from death for we know that even cruel savage brutes and evil men have at times sweet beneficent impulses during which they act in a way contrary to their natures like passive agents of some higher power it was a continual pain to travel in my weak condition and the patience of my indians was severely taxed but they did not forsake me and at last the entire distance which i conjectured to be about sixtyfive leagues was accomplished and at the end i was actually stronger and better in every way than at the start from this time my progress towards complete recovery was rapid the air with or without any medicinal virtue blown from the cinchona trees in the faroff andean forest was tonic and when i took my walks on the hillside above the indian village or later when able to climb to the summits the world as seen from those wild queneveta mountains had a largeness and varied glory of scenery peculiarly refreshing and delightful to the soul  with the maquiritari tribe i passed some weeks and the sweet sensations of returning health made me happy for a time but such sensations seldom outlast convalescence i was no sooner well again than i began to feel a restless spirit stirring in me the monotony of savage life in this place became intolerable after my long listless period the reaction had come and i wished only for action adventureno matter how dangerous and for new scenes new faces new dialects in the end i conceived the idea of going on to the casiquiare river where i would find a few small settlements and perhaps obtain help from the authorities there which would enable me to reach the rio negro for it was now in my mind to follow that river to the amazons and so down to para and the atlantic coast  leaving the queneveta range i started with two of the indians as guides and travelling companions but their journey ended only halfway to the river i wished to reach and they left me with some friendly savages living on the chunapay a tributary of the cunucumana which flows to the orinoco here i had no choice but to wait until an opportunity of attaching myself to some party of travelling indians going southwest should arrive for by this time i had expended the whole of my small capital in ornaments and calico brought from manapuri so that i could no longer purchase any mans service and perhaps it will be as well to state at this point just what i possessed for some time i had worn nothing but sandals to protect my feet my garments consisted of a single suit and one flannel shirt which i washed frequently going shirtless while it was drying fortunately i had an excellent blue cloth cloak durable and handsome given to me by a friend at angostura whose prophecy on presenting it that it would outlast me very nearly came true it served as a covering by night and to keep a man warm and comfortable when travelling in cold and wet weather no better garment was ever made i had a revolver and metal cartridgebox in my broad leather belt also a good huntingknife with strong buckhorn handle and a heavy blade about nine inches long in the pocket of my cloak i had a pretty silver tinderbox and a matchboxto be mentioned again in this narrativeand one or two other trifling objects these i was determined to keep until they could be kept no longer  during the tedious interval of waiting on the chunapay i was told a flattering tale by the village indians which eventually caused me to abandon the proposed journey to the rio negro these indians wore necklets like nearly all the guayana savages but one i observed possessed a necklet unlike that of the others which greatly aroused my curiosity it was made of thirteen gold plates irregular in form about as broad as a mans thumbnail and linked together with fibres i was allowed to examine it and had no doubt that the pieces were of pure gold beaten flat by the savages when questioned about it they said it was originally obtained from the indians of parahuari and parahuari they further said was a mountainous country west of the orinoco every man and woman in that place they assured me had such a necklet this report inflamed my mind to such a degree that i could not rest by night or day for dreaming golden dreams and considering how to get to that rich district unknown to civilized men the indians gravely shook their heads when i tried to persuade them to take me they were far enough from the orinoco and parahuari was ten perhaps fifteen days journey further ona country unknown to them where they had no relations  in spite of difficulties and delays however and not without pain and some perilous adventures i succeeded at last in reaching the upper orinoco and eventually in crossing to the other side with my life in my hand i struggled on westward through an unknown difficult country from indian village to village where at any moment i might have been murdered with impunity for the sake of my few belongings it is hard for me to speak a good word for the guayana savages but i must now say this of them that they not only did me no harm when i was at their mercy during this long journey but they gave me shelter in their villages and fed me when i was hungry and helped me on my way when i could make no return you must not however run away with the idea that there is any sweetness in their disposition any humane or benevolent instincts such as are found among the civilized nations far from it i regard them now and fortunately for me i regarded them then when as i have said i was at their mercy as beasts of prey plus a cunning or low kind of intelligence vastly greater than that of the brute and for only morality that respect for the rights of other members of the same family or tribe without which even the rudest communities cannot hold together how then could i do this thing and dwell and travel freely without receiving harm among tribes that have no peace with and no kindly feelings towards the stranger in a district where the white man is rarely or never seen because i knew them so well without that knowledge always available and an extreme facility in acquiring new dialects which had increased by practice until it was almost like intuition i should have fared badly after leaving the maquiritari tribe as it was i had two or three very narrow escapes  to return from this digression i looked at last on the famous parahuari mountains which i was greatly surprised to find were after all nothing but hills and not very high ones this however did not impress me the very fact that parahuari possessed no imposing feature in its scenery seemed rather to prove that it must be rich in gold how else could its name and the fame of its treasures be familiar to people dwelling so far away as the cunucumana  but there was no gold i searched through the whole range which was about seven leagues long and visited the villages where i talked much with the indians interrogating them and they had no necklets of gold nor gold in any form nor had they ever heard of its presence in parahuari or in any other place known to them  the very last village where i spoke on the subject of my quest albeit now without hope was about a league from the western extremity of the range in the midst of a high broken country of forest and savannah and many swift streams near one of these called the curicay the village stood among low scattered treesa large building in which all the people numbering eighteen passed most of their time when not hunting with two smaller buildings attached to it the head or chief runi by name was about fifty years old a taciturn finely formed and somewhat dignified savage who was either of a sullen disposition or not well pleased at the intrusion of a white man and for a time i made no attempt to conciliate him what profit was there in it at all even that light mask which i had worn so long and with such good effect incommoded me now i would cast it aside and be myselfsilent and sullen as my barbarous host if any malignant purpose was taking form in his mind let it and let him do his worst for when failure first stares a man in the face it has so dark and repellent a look that not anything that can be added can make him more miserable nor has he any apprehension for weeks i had been searching with eager feverish eyes in every village in every rocky crevice in every noisy mountain streamlet for the glittering yellow dust i had travelled so far to find and now all my beautiful dreamsall the pleasure and power to behad vanished like a mere mirage on the savannah at noon  it was a day of despair which i spent in this place sitting all day indoors for it was raining hard immersed in my own gloomy thoughts pretending to doze in my seat and out of the narrow slits of my halfclosed eyes seeing the others also sitting or moving about like shadows or people in a dream and i cared nothing about them and wished not to seem friendly even for the sake of the food they might offer me by and by  towards evening the rain ceased and rising up i went out a short distance to the neighbouring stream where i sat on a stone and casting off my sandals laved my bruised feet in the cool running water the western half of the sky was blue again with that tender lucid blue seen after rain but the leaves still glittered with water and the wet trunks looked almost black under the green foliage the rare loveliness of the scene touched and lightened my heart away back in the east the hills of parahuari with the level sun full on them loomed with a strange glory against the grey rainy clouds drawing off on that side and their new mystic beauty almost made me forget how these same hills had wearied and hurt and mocked me on that side also to the north and south there was open forest but to the west a different prospect met the eye beyond the stream and the strip of verdure that fringed it and the few scattered dwarf trees growing near its banks spread a brown savannah sloping upwards to a long low rocky ridge beyond which rose a great solitary hill or rather mountain conical in form and clothed in forest almost to the summit this was the mountain ytaioa the chief landmark in that district as the sun went down over the ridge beyond the savannah the whole western sky changed to a delicate rose colour that had the appearance of rosecoloured smoke blown there by some far offwind and left suspendeda thin brilliant veil showing through it the distant sky beyond blue and ethereal flocks of birds a kind of troupial were flying past me overhead flock succeeding flock on their way to their roostingplace uttering as they flew a clear belllike chirp and there was something ethereal too in those drops of melodious sound which fell into my heart like raindrops falling into a pool to mix their fresh heavenly water with the water of earth  doubtless into the turbid tarn of my heart some sacred drops had fallenfrom the passing birds from that crimson disk which had now dropped below the horizon the darkening hills the rose and blue of infinite heaven from the whole visible circle and i felt purified and had a strange sense and apprehension of a secret innocence and spirituality in naturea prescience of some bourn incalculably distant perhaps to which we are all moving of a time when the heavenly rain shall have washed us clean from all spot and blemish this unexpected peace which i had found now seemed to me of infinitely greater value than that yellow metal i had missed finding with all its possibilities my wish now was to rest for a season at this spot so remote and lovely and peaceful where i had experienced such unusual feelings and such a blessed disillusionment  this was the end of my second period in guayana the first had been filled with that dream of a book to win me fame in my country perhaps even in europe the second from the time of leaving the queneveta mountains with the dream of boundless wealththe old dream of gold in this region that has drawn so many minds since the days of francisco pizarro but to remain i must propitiate runi sitting silent with gloomy brows over there indoors and he did not appear to me like one that might be won with words however flattering it was clear to me that the time had come to part with my one remaining valuable trinketthe tinderbox of chased silver  i returned to the house and going in seated myself on a log by the fire just opposite to my grim host who was smoking and appeared not to have moved since i left him i made myself a cigarette then drew out the tinderbox with its flint and steel attached to it by means of two small silver chains his eyes brightened a little as they curiously watched my movements and he pointed without speaking to the glowing coals of fire at my feet i shook my head and striking the steel sent out a brilliant spray of sparks then blew on the tinder and lit my cigarette  this done instead of returning the box to my pocket i passed the chain through the buttonhole of my cloak and let it dangle on my breast as an ornament when the cigarette was smoked i cleared my throat in the orthodox manner and fixed my eyes on runi who on his part made a slight movement to indicate that he was ready to listen to what i had to say  my speech was long lasting at least half an hour delivered in a profound silence it was chiefly occupied with an account of my wanderings in guayana and being little more than a catalogue of names of all the places i had visited and the tribes and chief or head men with whom i had come in contact i was able to speak continuously and so to hide my ignorance of a dialect which was still new to me the guayana savage judges a man for his staying powers to stand as motionless as a bronze statue for one or two hours watching for a bird to sit or lie still for half a day to endure pain not seldom selfinflicted without wincing and when delivering a speech to pour it out in a copious stream without pausing to take breath or hesitating over a wordto be able to do all this is to prove yourself a man an equal one to be respected and even made a friend of what i really wished to say to him was put in a few words at the conclusion of my wellnigh meaningless oration everywhere i said i had been the indians friend and i wished to be his friend to live with him at parahuari even as i had lived with other chiefs and heads of villages and families to be looked on by him as these others had looked on me not as a stranger or a white man but as a friend a brother an indian  i ceased speaking and there was a slight murmurous sound in the room as of wind long pent up in many lungs suddenly exhaled while runi still unmoved emitted a low grunt then i rose and detaching the silver ornament from my cloak presented it to him he accepted it not very graciously as a stranger to these people might have imagined but i was satisfied feeling sure that i had made a favourable impression after a little he handed the box to the person sitting next to him who examined it and passed it on to a third and in this way it went round and came back once more to runi then he called for a drink there happened to be a store of casserie in the house probably the women had been busy for some days past in making it little thinking that it was destined to be prematurely consumed a large jarful was produced runi politely quaffed the first cup i followed then the others and the women drank also a woman taking about one cupful to a mans three runi and i however drank the most for we had our positions as the two principal personages there to maintain tongues were loosened now for the alcohol small as the quantity contained in this mild liquor is had begun to tell on our brains i had not their pottleshaped stomach made to hold unlimited quantities of meat and drink but i was determined on this most important occasion not to deserve my hosts contemptto be compared perhaps to the small bird that delicately picks up six drops of water in its bill and is satisfied i would measure my strength against his and if necessary drink myself into a state of insensibility  at last i was scarcely able to stand on my legs but even the seasoned old savage was affected by this time in vino veritas said the ancients and the principle holds good where there is no vinum but only mild casserie runi now informed me that he had once known a white man that he was a bad man which had caused him to say that all white men were bad even as david still more sweepingly had proclaimed that all men were liars now he found that it was not so that i was a good man his friendliness increased with intoxication he presented me with a curious little tinderbox made from the conical tail of an armadillo hollowed out and provided with a wooden stopperthis to be used in place of the box i had deprived myself of he also furnished me with a grass hammock and had it hung up there and then so that i could lie down when inclined there was nothing he would not do for me and at last when many more cups had been emptied and a third or fourth jar brought out he began to unburthen his heart of its dark and dangerous secrets he shed tearsfor the man without at ear dwells not in the woods of guayana tears for those who had been treacherously slain long years ago for his father who had been killed by tripica the father of managa who was still above ground but let him and all his people beware of runi he had spilt their blood before he had fed the fox and vulture with their flesh and would never rest while managa lived with his people at uritaythe five hills of uritay which were two days journey from parahuari while thus talking of his old enemy he lashed himself into a kind of frenzy smiting his chest and gnashing his teeth and finally seizing a spear he buried its point deep into the clay floor only to wrench it out and strike it into the earth again and again to show how he would serve managa and any one of managas people he might meet withman woman or child then he staggered out from the door to flourish his spear and looking to the northwest he shouted aloud to managa to come and slay his people and burn down his house as he had so often threatened to do  let him come let managa come i cried staggering out after him i am your friend your brother i have no spear and no arrows but i have thisthis and here i drew out and flourished my revolver where is managa i continued where are the hills of uritay he pointed to a star low down in the southwest then i shouted let this bullet find managa sitting by the fire among his people and let him fall and pour out his blood on the ground and with that i discharged my pistol in the direction he had pointed to a scream of terror burst out from the women and children while runi at my side in an access of fierce delight and admiration turned and embraced me it was the first and last embrace i ever suffered from a naked male savage and although this did not seem a time for fastidious feelings to be hugged to his sweltering body was an unpleasant experience  more cups of casserie followed this outburst and at last unable to keep it up any longer i staggered to my hammock but being unable to get into it runi overflowing with kindness came to my assistance whereupon we fell and rolled together on the floor finally i was raised by the others and tumbled into my swinging bed and fell at once into a deep dreamless sleep from which i did not awake until after sunrise on the following morning    chapter ii  it is fortunate that casserie is manufactured by an extremely slow laborious process since the women who are the drinkmakers in the first place have to reduce the material cassava bread to a pulp by means of their own molars after which it is watered down and put away in troughs to ferment great is the diligence of these willing slaves but work how they will they can only satisfy their lords love of a big drink at long intervals such a function as that at which i had assisted is therefore the result of much patient mastication and silent fermentationthe delicate flower of a plant that has been a long time growing  having now established myself as one of the family at the cost of some disagreeable sensations and a pang or two of selfdisgust i resolved to let nothing further trouble me at parahuari but to live the easy careless life of the idle man joining in hunting and fishing expeditions when in the mood at other times enjoying existence in my own way apart from my fellows conversing with wild nature in that solitary place besides runi there were in our little community two oldish men his cousins i believe who had wives and grownup children another family consisted of piake runis nephew his brother kuakoabout whom there will be much to sayand a sister oalava piake had a wife and two children kuako was unmarried and about nineteen or twenty years old oalava was the youngest of the three last of all who should perhaps have been first was runis mother called clacla probably in imitation of the cry of some bird for in these latitudes a person is rarely perhaps never called by his or her real name which is a secret jealously preserved even from near relations i believe that clacla herself was the only living being who knew the name her parents had bestowed on her at birth she was a very old woman spare in figure brown as old sunbaked leather her face written over with innumerable wrinkles and her long coarse hair perfectly white yet she was exceedingly active and seemed to do more work than any other woman in the community more than that when the days toil was over and nothing remained for the others to do then claclas night work would begin and this was to talk all the others or at all events all the men to sleep she was like a selfregulating machine and punctually every evening when the door was closed and the night fire made up and every man in his hammock she would set herself going telling the most interminable stories until the last listener was fast asleep later in the night if any man woke with a snort or grunt off she would go again taking up the thread of the tale where she had dropped it  old clacla amused me very much by night and day and i seldom tired of watching her owlish countenance as she sat by the fire never allowing it to sink low for want of fuel always studying the pot when it was on to simmer and at the same time attending to the movements of the others about her ready at a moments notice to give assistance or to dart out on a stray chicken or refractory child  so much did she amuse me although without intending it that i thought it would be only fair in my turn to do something for her entertainment i was engaged one day in shaping a wooden foil with my knife whistling and singing snatches of old melodies at my work when all at once i caught sight of the ancient dame looking greatly delighted chuckling internally nodding her head and keeping time with her hands evidently she was able to appreciate a style of music superior to that of the aboriginals and forthwith i abandoned my foils for the time and set about the manufacture of a guitar which cost me much labour and brought out more ingenuity than i had ever thought myself capable of to reduce the wood to the right thinness then to bend and fasten it with wooden pegs and with gums to add the arm frets keys and finally the catgut stringsthose of another kind being out of the questionkept me busy for some days when completed it was a rude instrument scarcely tunable nevertheless when i smote the strings playing lively music or accompanied myself in singing i found that it was a great success and so was as much pleased with my own performance as if i had had the most perfect guitar ever made in old spain i also skipped about the floor strumstrumming at the same time instructing them in the most lively dances of the whites in which the feet must be as nimble as the players fingers it is true that these exhibitions were always witnessed by the adults with a profound gravity which would have disheartened a stranger to their ways they were a set of hollow bronze statues that looked at me but i knew that the living animals inside of them were tickled at my singing strumming and pirouetting clacla was however an exception and encouraged me not infrequently by emitting a sound half cackle and half screech by way of laughter for she had come to her second childhood or at all events had dropped the stolid mask which the young guayana savage in imitation of his elders adjusts to his face at about the age of twelve to wear it thereafter all his life long or only to drop it occasionally when very drunk the youngsters also openly manifested their pleasure although as a rule they try to restrain their feelings in the presence of grownup people and with them i became a greet favourite  by and by i returned to my foilmaking and gave them fencing lessons and sometimes invited two or three of the biggest boys to attack me simultaneously just to show how easily i could disarm and kill them this practice excited some interest in kuako who had a little more of curiosity and geniality and less of the puton dignity of the others and with him i became most intimate fencing with kuako was highly amusing no sooner was he in position foil in hand than all my instructions were thrown to the winds and he would charge and attack me in his own barbarous manner with the result that i would send his foil spinning a dozen yards away while he struck motionless would gaze after it in openmouthed astonishment  three weeks had passed by not unpleasantly when one morning i took it into my head to walk by myself across that somewhat sterile savannah west of the village and stream which ended as i have said in a long low stony ridge from the village there was nothing to attract the eye in that direction but i wished to get a better view of that great solitary hill or mountain of ytaioa and of the cloudlike summits beyond it in the distance from the stream the ground rose in a gradual slope and the highest part of the ridge for which i made was about two miles from the startingpointa parched brown plain with nothing growing on it but scattered tussocks of sere hairlike grass  when i reached the top and could see the country beyond i was agreeably disappointed at the discovery that the sterile ground extended only about a mile and a quarter on the further side and was succeeded by a foresta very inviting patch of woodland covering five or six square miles occupying a kind of oblong basin extending from the foot of ytaioa on the north to a low range of rocky hills on the south from the wooded basin long narrow strips of forest ran out in various directions like the arms of an octopus one pair embracing the slopes of ytaioa another much broader belt extending along a valley which cut through the ridge of hills on the south side at right angles and was lost to sight beyond far away in the west and south and north distant mountains appeared not in regular ranges but in groups or singly or looking like blue bankedup clouds on the horizon  glad at having discovered the existence of this forest so near home and wondering why my indian friends had never taken me to it nor ever went out on that side i set forth with a light heart to explore it for myself regretting only that i was without a proper weapon for procuring game the walk from the ridge over the savannah was easy as the barren stony ground sloped downwards the whole way the outer part of the wood on my side was very open composed in most part of dwarf trees that grow on stony soil and scattered thorny bushes bearing a yellow peashaped blossom presently i came to thicker wood where the trees were much taller and in greater variety and after this came another sterile strip like that on the edge of the wood where stone cropped out from the ground and nothing grew except the yellowflowered thorn bushes passing this sterile ribbon which seemed to extend to a considerable distance north and south and was fifty to a hundred yards wide the forest again became dense and the trees large with much undergrowth in places obstructing the view and making progress difficult  i spent several hours in this wild paradise which was so much more delightful than the extensive gloomier forests i had so often penetrated in guayana for here if the trees did not attain to such majestic proportions the variety of vegetable forms was even greater as far as i went it was nowhere dark under the trees and the number of lovely parasites everywhere illustrated the kindly influence of light and air even where the trees were largest the sunshine penetrated subdued by the foliage to exquisite greenishgolden tints filling the wide lower spaces with tender halflights and faint blueandgray shadows lying on my back and gazing up i felt reluctant to rise and renew my ramble for what a roof was that above my head roof i call it just as the poets in their poverty sometimes describe the infinite ethereal sky by that word but it was no more rooflike and hindering to the soaring spirit than the higher clouds that float in changing forms and tints and like the foliage chasten the intolerable noonday beams how far above me seemed that leafy cloudland into which i gazed nature we know first taught the architect to produce by long colonnades the illusion of distance but the lightexcluding roof prevents him from getting the same effect above here nature is unapproachable with her green airy canopy a sunimpregnated cloudcloud above cloud and though the highest may be unreached by the eye the beams yet filter through illuming the wide spaces beneathchamber succeeded by chamber each with its own special lights and shadows far above me but not nearly so far as it seemed the tender gloom of one such chamber or space is traversed now by a golden shaft of light falling through some break in the upper foliage giving a strange glory to everything it touchesprojecting leaves and beardlike tuft of moss and snaky bushrope and in the most open part of that most open space suspended on nothing to the eye the shaft reveals a tangle of shining silver threadsthe web of some large treespider these seemingly distant yet distinctly visible threads serve to remind me that the human artist is only able to get his horizontal distance by a monotonous reduplication of pillar and arch placed at regular intervals and that the least departure from this order would destroy the effect but nature produces her effects at random and seems only to increase the beautiful illusion by that infinite variety of decoration in which she revels binding tree to tree in a tangle of anacondalike lianas and dwindling down from these huge cables to airy webs and hairlike fibres that vibrate to the wind of the passing insects wing  thus in idleness with such thoughts for company i spent my time glad that no human being savage or civilized was with me it was better to be alone to listen to the monkeys that chattered without offending to watch them occupied with the unserious business of their lives with that luxuriant tropical nature its green clouds and illusive aerial spaces full of mystery they harmonized well in language appearance and motionsmountebank angels living their fantastic lives far above earth in a halfway heaven of their own  i saw more monkeys on that morning than i usually saw in the course of a weeks rambling and other animals were seen i particularly remember two accouries i startled that after rushing away a few yards stopped and stood peering back at me as if not knowing whether to regard me as friend or enemy birds too were strangely abundant and altogether this struck me as being the richest huntingground i had seen and it astonished me to think that the indians of the village did not appear to visit it  on my return in the afternoon i gave an enthusiastic account of my days ramble speaking not of the things that had moved my soul but only of those which move the guayana indians soulthe animal food he craves and which one would imagine nature would prefer him to do without so hard he finds it to wrest a sufficiency from her to my surprise they shook their heads and looked troubled at what i said and finally my host informed me that the wood i had been in was a dangerous place that if they went there to hunt a great injury would be done to them and he finished by advising me not to visit it again  i began to understand from their looks and the old mans vague words that their fear of the wood was superstitious if dangerous creatures had existed there tigers or camoodis or solitary murderous savagesthey would have said so but when i pressed them with questions they could only repeat that something bad existed in the place that animals were abundant there because no indian who valued his life dared venture into it i replied that unless they gave me some more definite information i should certainly go again and put myself in the way of the danger they feared  my reckless courage as they considered it surprised them but they had already begun to find out that their superstitions had no effect on me that i listened to them as to stories invented to amuse a child and for the moment they made no further attempt to dissuade me  next day i returned to the forest of evil report which had now a new and even greater charmthe fascination of the unknown and the mysterious still the warning i had received made me distrustful and cautious at first for i could not help thinking about it when we consider how much of their life is passed in the woods which become as familiar to them as the streets of our native town to us it seems almost incredible that these savages have a superstitious fear of all forests fearing them as much even in the bright light of day as a nervous child with memory filled with ghoststories fears a dark room but like the child in the dark room they fear the forest only when alone in it and for this reason always hunt in couples or parties what then prevented them from visiting this particular wood which offered so tempting a harvest the question troubled me not a little at the same time i was ashamed of the feeling and fought against it and in the end i made my way to the same sequestered spot where i had rested so long on my previous visit  in this place i witnessed a new thing and had a strange experience sitting on the ground in the shade of a large tree i began to hear a confused noise as of a coming tempest of wind mixed with shrill calls and cries nearer and nearer it came and at last a multitude of birds of many kinds but mostly small appeared in sight swarming through the trees some running on the trunks and larger branches others flitting through the foliage and many keeping on the wing now hovering and now darting this way or that they were all busily searching for and pursuing the insects moving on at the same time and in a very few minutes they had finished examining the trees near me and were gone but not satisfied with what i had witnessed i jumped up and rushed after the flock to keep it in sight all my caution and all recollection of what the indians had said was now forgot so great was my interest in this birdarmy but as they moved on without pause they quickly left me behind and presently my career was stopped by an impenetrable tangle of bushes vines and roots of large trees extending like huge cables along the ground in the midst of this leafy labyrinth i sat down on a projecting root to cool my blood before attempting to make my way back to my former position after that tempest of motion and confused noises the silence of the forest seemed very profound but before i had been resting many moments it was broken by a low strain of exquisite birdmelody wonderfully pure and expressive unlike any musical sound i had ever heard before it seemed to issue from a thick cluster of broad leaves of a creeper only a few yards from where i sat with my eyes fixed on this green hidingplace i waited with suspended breath for its repetition wondering whether any civilized being had ever listened to such a strain before surely not i thought else the fame of so divine a melody would long ago have been noised abroad i thought of the rialejo the celebrated organbird or flutebird and of the various ways in which hearers are affected by it to some its warbling is like the sound of a beautiful mysterious instrument while to others it seems like the singing of a blithehearted child with a highly melodious voice i had often heard and listened with delight to the singing of the rialejo in the guayana forests but this song or musical phrase was utterly unlike it in character it was pure more expressive softerso low that at a distance of forty yards i could hardly have heard it but its greatest charm was its resemblance to the human voicea voice purified and brightened to something almost angelic imagine then my impatience as i sat there straining my sense my deep disappointment when it was not repeated i rose at length very reluctantly and slowly began making my way back but when i had progressed about thirty yards again the sweet voice sounded just behind me and turning quickly i stood still and waited the same voice but not the same songnot the same phrase the notes were different more varied and rapidly enunciated as if the singer had been more excited the blood rushed to my heart as i listened my nerves tingled with a strange new delight the rapture produced by such music heightened by a sense of mystery before many moments i heard it again not rapid now but a soft warbling lower than at first infinitely sweet and tender sinking to lisping sounds that soon ceased to be audible the whole having lasted as long as it would take me to repeat a sentence of a dozen words this seemed the singers farewell to me for i waited and listened in vain to hear it repeated and after getting back to the startingpoint i sat for upwards of an hour still hoping to hear it once more  the weltering sun at length compelled me to quit the wood but not before i had resolved to return the next morning and seek for the spot where i had met with so enchanting an experience after crossing the sterile belt i have mentioned within the wood and just before i came to the open outer edge where the stunted trees and bushes die away on the border of the savannah what was my delight and astonishment at hearing the mysterious melody once more it seemed to issue from a clump of bushes close by but by this time i had come to the conclusion that there was a ventriloquism in this woodland voice which made it impossible for me to determine its exact direction of one thing i was however now quite convinced and that was that the singer had been following me all the time again and again as i stood there listening it sounded now so faint and apparently far off as to be scarcely audible then all at once it would ring out bright and clear within a few yards of me as if the shy little thing had suddenly grown bold but far or near the vocalist remained invisible and at length the tantalizing melody ceased altogether    chapter iii  i was not disappointed on my next visit to the forest nor on several succeeding visits and this seemed to show that if i was right in believing that these strange melodious utterances proceeded from one individual then the bird or being although still refusing to show itself was always on the watch for my appearance and followed me wherever i went this thought only served to increase my curiosity i was constantly pondering over the subject and at last concluded that it would be best to induce one of the indians to go with me to the wood on the chance of his being able to explain the mystery  one of the treasures i had managed to preserve in my sojourn with these children of nature who were always anxious to become possessors of my belongings was a small prettily fashioned metal matchbox opening with a spring remembering that kuako among others had looked at this trifle with covetous eyesthe covetous way in which they all looked at it had given it a fictitious value in my owni tried to bribe him with the offer of it to accompany me to my favourite haunt the brave young hunter refused again and again but on each occasion he offered to perform some other service or to give me something in exchange for the box at last i told him that i would give it to the first person who should accompany me and fearing that someone would be found valiant enough to win the prize he at length plucked up a spirit and on the next day seeing me going out for a walk he all at once offered to go with me he cunningly tried to get the box before startinghis cunning poor youth was not very deep i told him that the forest we were about to visit abounded with plants and birds unlike any i had seen elsewhere that i wished to learn their names and everything about them and that when i had got the required information the box would be hisnot sooner finally we started he as usual armed with his zabatana with which i imagined he would procure more game than usually fell to his little poisoned arrows when we reached the wood i could see that he was ill at ease nothing would persuade him to go into the deeper parts and even where it was very open and light he was constantly gazing into bushes and shadowy places as if expecting to see some frightful creature lying in wait for him this behaviour might have had a disquieting effect on me had i not been thoroughly convinced that his fears were purely superstitious and that there could be no dangerous animal in a spot i was accustomed to walk in every day my plan was to ramble about with an unconcerned air occasionally pointing out an uncommon tree or shrub or vine or calling his attention to a distant birdcry and asking the birds name in the hope that the mysterious voice would make itself heard and that he would be able to give me some explanation of it but for upwards of two hours we moved about hearing nothing except the usual bird voices and during all that time he never stirred a yard from my side nor made an attempt to capture anything at length we sat down under a tree in an open spot close to the border of the wood he sat down very reluctantly and seemed more troubled in his mind than ever keeping his eyes continually roving about while he listened intently to every sound the sounds were not few owing to the abundance of animal and especially of bird life in this favoured spot i began to question my companion as to some of the cries we heard there were notes and cries familiar to me as the crowing of the cockparrot screams and yelping of toucans the distant wailing calls of maam and duraquara and shrill laughterlike notes of the large treeclimber as it passed from tree to tree the quick whistle of cotingas and strange throbbing and thrilling sounds as of pygmies beating on metallic drums of the skulking pittathrushes and with these mingled other notes less well known one came from the treetops where it was perpetually wandering amid the foliage a low note repeated at intervals of a few seconds so thin and mournful and full of mystery that i half expected to hear that it proceeded from the restless ghost of some dead bird but no he only said it was uttered by a little birdtoo little presumably to have a name from the foliage of a neighbouring tree came a few tinkling chirps as of a small mandolin two or three strings of which had been carelessly struck by the player he said that it came from a small green frog that lived in trees and in this way my rude indianvexed perhaps at being asked such trivial questionsbrushed away the pretty fantasies my mind had woven in the woodland solitude for i often listened to this tinkling music and it had suggested the idea that the place was frequented by a tribe of fairylike troubadour monkeys and that if i could only be quicksighted enough i might one day be able to detect the minstrel sitting in a green tunic perhaps crosslegged on some high swaying bough carelessly touching his mandolin suspended from his neck by a yellow ribbon  by and by a bird came with low swift flight its great tail spread open fanwise and perched itself on an exposed bough not thirty yards from us it was all of a chestnutred colour longbodied in size like a big pigeon its actions showed that its curiosity had been greatly excited for it jerked from side to side eyeing us first with one eye then the other while its long tail rose and fell in a measured way  look kuako i said in a whisper there is a bird for you to kill  but he only shook his head still watchful  give me the blowpipe then i said with a laugh putting out my hand to take it but he refused to let me take it knowing that it would only be an arrow wasted if i attempted to shoot anything  as i persisted in telling him to kill the bird he at last bent his lips near me and said in a halfwhisper as if fearful of being overheard i can kill nothing here if i shot at the bird the daughter of the didi would catch the dart in her hand and throw it back and hit me here touching his breast just over his heart  i laughed again saying to myself with some amusement that kuako was not such a bad companion after allthat he was not without imagination but in spite of my laughter his words roused my interest and suggested the idea that the voice i was curious about had been heard by the indians and was as great a mystery to them as to me since not being like that of any creature known to them it would be attributed by their superstitious minds to one of the numerous demons or semihuman monsters inhabiting every forest stream and mountain and fear of it would drive them from the wood in this case judging from my companions words they had varied the form of the superstition somewhat inventing a daughter of a waterspirit to be afraid of my thought was that if their keen practiced eyes had never been able to see this flitting woodland creature with a musical soul it was not likely that i would succeed in my quest  i began to question him but he now appeared less inclined to talk and more frightened than ever and each time i attempted to speak he imposed silence with a quick gesture of alarm while he continued to stare about him with dilated eyes all at once he sprang to his feet as if overcome with terror and started running at full speed his fear infected me and springing up i followed as fast as i could but he was far ahead of me running for dear life and before i had gone forty yards my feet were caught in a creeper trailing along the surface and i measured my length on the ground the sudden violent shock almost took away my senses for a moment but when i jumped up and stared round to see no unspeakable monstercurupita or otherrushing on to slay and devour me there and then i began to feel ashamed of my cowardice and in the end i turned and walked back to the spot i had just quitted and sat down once more i even tried to hum a tune just to prove to myself that i had completely recovered from the panic caught from the miserable indian but it is never possible in such cases to get back ones serenity immediately and a vague suspicion continued to trouble me for a time after sitting there for half an hour or so listening to distant birdsounds i began to recover my old confidence and even to feel inclined to penetrate further into the wood all at once making me almost jump so sudden it was so much nearer and louder than i had ever heard it before the mysterious melody began unmistakably it was uttered by the same being heard on former occasions but today it was different in character the utterance was far more rapid with fewer silent intervals and it had none of the usual tenderness in it nor ever once sunk to that low whisperlike talking which had seemed to me as if the spirit of the wind had breathed its low sighs in syllables and speech now it was not only loud rapid and continuous but while still musical there was an incisiveness in it a sharp ring as of resentment which made it strike painfully on the sense  the impression of an intelligent unhuman being addressing me in anger took so firm a hold on my mind that the old fear returned and rising i began to walk rapidly away intending to escape from the wood the voice continued violently rating me as it seemed to my mind moving with me which caused me to accelerate my steps and very soon i would have broken into a run when its character began to change again there were pauses now intervals of silence long or short and after each one the voice came to my ear with a more subdued and dulcet soundmore of that melting flutelike quality it had possessed at other times and this softness of tone coupled with the talkinglike form of utterance gave me the idea of a being no longer incensed addressing me now in a peaceable spirit reasoning away my unworthy tremors and imploring me to remain with it in the wood strange as this voice without a body was and always productive of a slightly uncomfortable feeling on account of its mystery it seemed impossible to doubt that it came to me now in a spirit of pure friendliness and when i had recovered my composure i found a new delight in listening to itall the greater because of the fear so lately experienced and of its seeming intelligence for the third time i reseated myself on the same spot and at intervals the voice talked to me there for some time and to my fancy expressed satisfaction and pleasure at my presence but later without losing its friendly tone it changed again it seemed to move away and to be thrown back from a considerable distance and at long intervals it would approach me again with a new sound which i began to interpret as of command or entreaty was it i asked myself inviting me to follow and if i obeyed to what delightful discoveries or frightful dangers might it lead my curiosity together with the belief that the beingi called it being not bird nowwas friendly to me overcame all timidity and i rose and walked at random towards the interior of the wood very soon i had no doubt left that the being had desired me to follow for there was now a new note of gladness in its voice and it continued near me as i walked at intervals approaching me so closely as to set me staring into the surrounding shadowy places like poor scared kuako  on this occasion too i began to have a new fancy for fancy or illusion i was determined to regard it that some swiftfooted being was treading the ground near me that i occasionally caught the faint rustle of a light footstep and detected a motion in leaves and fronds and threadlike stems of creepers hanging near the surface as if some passing body had touched and made them tremble and once or twice that i even had a glimpse of a grey misty object moving at no great distance in the deeper shadows  led by this wandering tricksy being i came to a spot where the trees were very large and the damp dark ground almost free from undergrowth and here the voice ceased to be heard after patiently waiting and listening for some time i began to look about me with a slight feeling of apprehension it was still about two hours before sunset only in this place the shade of the vast trees made a perpetual twilight moreover it was strangely silent here the few birdcries that reached me coming from a long distance i had flattered myself that the voice had become to some extent intelligible to me its outburst of anger caused no doubt by my cowardly flight after the indian then its recovered friendliness which had induced me to return and finally its desire to be followed now that it had led me to this place of shadow and profound silence and had ceased to speak and to lead i could not help thinking that this was my goal that i had been brought to this spot with a purpose that in this wild and solitary retreat some tremendous adventure was about to befall me  as the silence continued unbroken there was time to dwell on this thought i gazed before me and listened intently scarcely breathing until the suspense became painfultoo painful at last and i turned and took a step with the idea of going back to the border of the wood when close by clear as a silver bell sounded the voice once more but only for a momenttwo or three syllables in response to my movement then it was silent again  once more i was standing still as if in obedience to a command in the same state of suspense and whether the change was real or only imagined i know not but the silence every minute grew more profound and the gloom deeper imaginary terrors began to assail me ancient fables of men allured by beautiful forms and melodious voices to destruction all at once acquired a fearful significance i recalled some of the indian beliefs especially that of the misshapen mandevouring monster who is said to beguile his victims into the dark forest by mimicking the human voicethe voice sometimes of a woman in distressor by singing some strange and beautiful melody i grew almost afraid to look round lest i should catch sight of him stealing towards me on his huge feet with toes pointing backwards his mouth snarling horribly to display his great green fangs it was distressing to have such fancies in this wild solitary spothateful to feel their power over me when i knew that they were nothing but fancies and creations of the savage mind but if these supernatural beings had no existence there were other monsters only too real in these woods which it would be dreadful to encounter alone and unarmed since against such adversaries a revolver would be as ineffectual as a popgun some huge camoodi able to crush my bones like brittle twigs in its constricting coils might lurk in these shadows and approach me stealthily unseen in its dark colour on the dark ground or some jaguar or black tiger might steal towards me masked by a bush or treetrunk to spring upon me unawares or worse still this way might suddenly come a pack of those swiftfooted unspeakably terrible huntingleopards from which every living thing in the forest flies with shrieks of consternation or else falls paralysed in their path to be instantly torn to pieces and devoured  a slight rustling sound in the foliage above me made me start and cast up my eyes high up where a pale gleam of tempered sunlight fell through the leaves a grotesque humanlike face black as ebony and adorned with a great red beard appeared staring down upon me in another moment it was gone it was only a large araguato or howling monkey but i was so unnerved that i could not get rid of the idea that it was something more than a monkey once more i moved and again the instant i moved my foot clear and keen and imperative sounded the voice it was no longer possible to doubt its meaning it commanded me to stand stillto waitto watchto listen had it cried listen do not move i could not have understood it better trying as the suspense was i now felt powerless to escape something very terrible i felt convinced was about to happen either to destroy or to release me from the spell that held me  and while i stood thus rooted to the ground the sweat standing in large drops on my forehead all at once close to me sounded a cry fine and clear at first and rising at the end to a shriek so loud piercing and unearthly in character that the blood seemed to freeze in my veins and a despairing cry to heaven escaped my lips then before that long shriek expired a mighty chorus of thunderous voices burst forth around me and in this awful tempest of sound i trembled like a leaf and the leaves on the trees were agitated as if by a high wind and the earth itself seemed to shake beneath my feet indescribably horrible were my sensations at that moment i was deafened and would possibly have been maddened had i not as by a miracle chanced to see a large araguato on a branch overhead roaring with open mouth and inflated throat and chest  it was simply a concert of howling monkeys that had so terrified me but my extreme fear was not strange in the circumstances since everything that had led up to the displaythe gloom and silence the period of suspense and my heated imaginationhad raised my mind to the highest degree of excitement and expectancy i had rightly conjectured no doubt that my unseen guide had led me to that spot for a purpose and the purpose had been to set me in the midst of a congregation of araguatos to enable me for the first time fully to appreciate their unparalleled vocal powers i had always heard them at a distance here they were gathered in scores possibly hundredsthe whole araguato population of the forest i should thinkclose to me and it may give some faint conception of the tremendous power and awful character of the sound thus produced by their combined voices when i say that this animalmiscalled howler in englishwould outroar the mightiest lion that ever woke the echoes of an african wilderness  this roaring concert which lasted three or four minutes having ended i lingered a few minutes longer on the spot and not hearing the voice again went back to the edge of the wood and then started on my way back to the village    chapter iv  perhaps i was not capable of thinking quite coherently on what had just happened until i was once more fairly outside of the forest shadowsout in that clear open daylight where things seem what they are and imagination like a juggler detected and laughed at hastily takes itself out of the way as i walked homewards i paused midway on the barren ridge to gaze back on the scene i had left and then the recent adventure began to take a semiludicrous aspect in my mind all that circumstance of preparation that mysterious prelude to something unheard of unimaginable surpassing all fables ancient and modern and all tragediesto end at last in a concert of howling monkeys certainly the concert was very grandindeed one of the most astounding in naturebut stilli sat down on a stone and laughed freely  the sun was sinking behind the forest its broad red disk still showing through the topmost leaves and the higher part of the foliage was of a luminous green like green flame throwing off flakes of quivering fiery light but lower down the trees were in profound shadow  i felt very lighthearted while i gazed on this scene for how pleasant it was just now to think of the strange experience i had passed throughto think that i had come safely out of it that no human eye had witnessed my weakness and that the mystery existed still to fascinate me for ludicrous as the denouement now looked the cause of all the voice itself was a thing to marvel at more than ever that it proceeded from an intelligent being i was firmly convinced and although too materialistic in my way of thinking to admit for a moment that it was a supernatural being i still felt that there was something more than i had at first imagined in kuakos speech about a daughter of the didi that the indians knew a great deal about the mysterious voice and had held it in great fear seemed evident but they were savages with ways that were not mine and however friendly they might be towards one of a superior race there was always in their relations with him a low cunning prompted partly by suspicion underlying their words and actions for the white man to put himself mentally on their level is not more impossible than for these aborigines to be perfectly open as children are towards the white whatever subject the stranger within their gates exhibits an interest in that they will be reticent about and their reticence which conceals itself under easily invented lies or an affected stupidity invariably increases with his desire for information it was plain to them that some very unusual interest took me to the wood consequently i could not expect that they would tell me anything they might know to enlighten me about the matter and i concluded that kuakos words about the daughter of the didi and what she would do if he blew an arrow at a bird had accidentally escaped him in a moment of excitement nothing therefore was to be gained by questioning them or at all events by telling them how much the subject attracted me and i had nothing to fear my independent investigations had made this much clear to me the voice might proceed from a very frolicsome and tricksy creature full of wild fantastic humours but nothing worse it was friendly to me i felt sure at the same time it might not be friendly towards the indians for on that day it had made itself heard only after my companion had taken flight and it had then seemed incensed against me possibly because the savage had been in my company  that was the result of my reflections on the days events when i returned to my entertainers roof and sat down among my friends to refresh myself with stewed fowl and fish from the household pot into which a hospitable woman invited me with a gesture to dip my fingers  kuako was lying in his hammock smoking i thinkcertainly not reading when i entered he lifted his head and stared at me probably surprised to see me alive unharmed and in a placid temper i laughed at the look and somewhat disconcerted he dropped his head down again after a minute or two i took the metal matchbox and tossed it on to his breast he clutched it and starting up stared at me in the utmost astonishment he could scarcely believe his good fortune for he had failed to carry out his part of the compact and had resigned himself to the loss of the coveted prize jumping down to the floor he held up the box triumphantly his joy overcoming the habitual stolid look while all the others gathered about him each trying to get the box into his own hands to admire it again notwithstanding that they had all seen it a dozen times before but it was kuakos now and not the strangers and therefore more nearly their own than formerly and must look different more beautiful with a brighter polish on the metal and that wonderful enamelled cock on the lidfigured in paris probably but just like a cock in guayana the pet bird which they no more think of killing and eating than we do our purring pussies and lemoncoloured canariesmust now look more strikingly valiant and cocklike than ever with its crimson comb and wattles burnished red hackles and dark green arching tailplumes but kuako while willing enough to have it admired and praised would not let it out of his hands and told them pompously that it was not theirs for them to handle but hiskuakosfor all time that he had won it by accompanying mevalorous man that he wasto that evil wood into which theytimid inferior creatures that they werewould never have ventured to set foot i am not translating his words but that was what he gave them to understand pretty plainly to my great amusement  after the excitement was over runi who had maintained a dignified calm made some roundabout remarks apparently with the object of eliciting an account of what i had seen and heard in the forest of evil fame i replied carelessly that i had seen a great many birds and monkeysmonkeys so tame that i might have procured one if i had had a blowpipe in spite of my never having practiced shooting with that weapon  it interested them to hear about the abundance and tameness of the monkeys although it was scarcely news but how tame they must have been when i the stranger not to the manner bornnot naked brownskinned lynxeyed and noiseless as an owl in his movementshad yet been able to look closely at them runi only remarked apropos of what i had told him that they could not go there to hunt then he asked me if i feared nothing  nothing i replied carelessly the things you fear hurt not the white man and are no more than this to me saying which i took up a little white woodash in my hand and blew it away with my breath and against other enemies i have this i added touching my revolver a brave speech just after that araguato episode but i did not make it without blushingmentally  he shook his head and said it was a poor weapon against some enemies alsotruly enoughthat it would procure no birds and monkeys for the stewpot  next morning my friend kuako taking his zabatana invited me to go out with him and i consented with some misgivings thinking he had overcome his superstitious fears and inflamed by my account of the abundance of game in the forest intended going there with me the previous days experience had made me think that it would be better in the future to go there alone but i was giving the poor youth more credit than he deserved it was far from his intention to face the terrible unknown again we went in a different direction and tramped for hours through woods where birds were scarce and only of the smaller kinds then my guide surprised me a second time by offering to teach me to use the zabatana this then was to be my reward for giving him the box i readily consented and with the long weapon awkward to carry in my hand and imitating the noiseless movements and cautious watchful manner of my companion i tried to imagine myself a simple guayana savage with no knowledge of that artificial social state to which i had been born dependent on my skill and little roll of poisondarts for a livelihood by an effort of the will i emptied myself of my life experience and knowledgeor as much of it as possibleand thought only of the generations of my dead imaginary progenitors who had ranged these woods back to the dim forgotten years before columbus and if the pleasure i had in the fancy was childish it made the day pass quickly enough kuako was constantly at my elbow to assist and give advice and many an arrow i blew from the long tube and hit no bird heaven knows what i hit for the arrows flew away on their wide and wild career to be seen no more except a few which my keeneyed comrade marked to their destination and managed to recover the result of our days hunting was a couple of birds which kuako not i shot and a small opossum his sharp eyes detected high up a tree lying coiled up on an old nest over the side of which the animal had incautiously allowed his snaky tail to dangle the number of darts i wasted must have been a rather serious loss to him but he did not seem troubled at it and made no remark  next day to my surprise he volunteered to give me a second lesson and we went out again on this occasion he had provided himself with a large bundle of darts butwise manthey were not poisoned and it therefore mattered little whether they were wasted or not i believe that on this day i made some little progress at all events my teacher remarked that before long i would be able to hit a bird this made me smile and answer that if he could place me within twenty yards of a bird not smaller than a small man i might manage to touch it with an arrow  this speech had a very unexpected and remarkable effect he stopped short in his walk stared at me wildly then grinned and finally burst into a roar of laughter which was no bad imitation of the howling monkeys performance and smote his naked thighs with tremendous energy at length recovering himself he asked whether a small woman was not the same as a small man and being answered in the affirmative went off into a second extravagant roar of laughter  thinking it was easy to tickle him while he continued in this mood i began making any number of feeble jokesfeeble but quite as good as the one which had provoked such outrageous merrimentfor it amused me to see him acting in this unusual way but they all failed of their effectthere was no hitting the bullseye a second time he would only stare vacantly at me then grunt like a peccarynot appreciativelyand walk on still at intervals he would go back to what i had said about hitting a very big bird and roar again as if this wonderful joke was not easily exhausted  again on the third day we were out together practicing at the birdsfrightening if not killing them but before noon finding that it was his intention to go to a distant spot where he expected to meet with larger game i left him and returned to the village the blowpipe practice had lost its novelty and i did not care to go on all day and every day with it more than that i was anxious after so long an interval to pay a visit to my wood as i began to call it in the hope of hearing that mysterious melody which i had grown to love and to miss when even a single day passed without it    chapter v  after making a hasty meal at the house i started full of pleasing anticipations for the wood for how pleasant a place it was to be in what a wild beauty and fragrance and melodiousness it possessed above all forests because of that mystery that drew me to it and it was mine truly and absolutelyas much mine as any portion of earths surface could belong to any manmine with all its products the precious woods and fruits and fragrant gums that would never be trafficked away its wild animals that man would never persecute nor would any jealous savage dispute my ownership or pretend that it was part of his huntingground as i crossed the savannah i played with this fancy but when i reached the ridgy eminence to look down once more on my new domain the fancy changed to a feeling so keen that it pierced to my heart and was like pain in its intensity causing tears to rush to my eyes and caring not in that solitude to disguise my feelings from myself and from the wide heaven that looked down and saw mefor this is the sweetest thing that solitude has for us that we are free in it and no convention holds usi dropped on my knees and kissed the stony ground then casting up my eyes thanked the author of my being for the gift of that wild forest those green mansions where i had found so great a happiness  elated with this strain of feeling i reached the wood not long after noon but no melodious voice gave me familiar and expected welcome nor did my invisible companion make itself heard at all on that day or at all events not in its usual birdlike warbling language but on this day i met with a curious little adventure and heard something very extraordinary very mysterious which i could not avoid connecting in my mind with the unseen warbler that so often followed me in my rambles  it was an exceedingly bright day without cloud but windy and finding myself in a rather open part of the wood near its border where the breeze could be felt i sat down to rest on the lower part of a large branch which was half broken but still remained attached to the trunk of the tree while resting its terminal twigs on the ground just before me where i sat grew a low widespreading plant covered with broad round polished leaves and the roundness stiffness and perfectly horizontal position of the upper leaves made them look like a collection of small platforms or round tabletops placed nearly on a level through the leaves to the height of a foot or more above them a slender dead stem protruded and from a twig at its summit depended a broken spiders web a minute dead leaf had become attached to one of the loose threads and threw its small but distinct shadow on the platform leaves below and as it trembled and swayed in the current of air the black spot trembled with it or flew swiftly over the bright green surfaces and was seldom at rest now as i sat looking down on the leaves and the small dancing shadow scarcely thinking of what i was looking at i noticed a small spider with a flat body and short legs creep cautiously out on to the upper surface of a leaf its pale red colour barred with velvet black first drew my attention to it for it was beautiful to the eye and presently i discovered that this was no webspinning sedentary spider but a wandering hunter that captured its prey like a cat by stealing on it concealed and making a rush or spring at the last the moving shadow had attracted it and as the sequel showed was mistaken for a fly running about over the leaves and flitting from leaf to leaf now began a series of wonderful manoeuvres on the spiders part with the object of circumventing the imaginary fly which seemed specially designed to meet this special case for certainly no insect had ever before behaved in quite so erratic a manner each time the shadow flew past the spider ran swiftly in the same direction hiding itself under the leaves always trying to get near without alarming its prey and then the shadow would go round and round in a small circle and some new strategic move on the part of the hunter would be called forth i became deeply interested in this curious scene i began to wish that the shadow would remain quiet for a moment or two so as to give the hunter a chance and at last i had my wish the shadow was almost motionless and the spider moving towards it yet seeming not to move and as it crept closer i fancied that i could almost see the little striped body quivering with excitement then came the final scene swift and straight as an arrow the hunter shot himself on to the flylike shadow then wiggled round and round evidently trying to take hold of his prey with fangs and claws and finding nothing under him he raised the fore part of his body vertically as if to stare about him in search of the delusive fly but the action may have simply expressed astonishment at this moment i was just on the point of giving free and loud vent to the laughter which i had been holding in when just behind me as if from some person who had been watching the scene over my shoulder and was as much amused as myself at its termination sounded a clear trill of merry laughter i started up and looked hastily around but no living creature was there the mass of loose foliage i stared into was agitated as if from a body having just pushed through it in a moment the leaves and fronds were motionless again still i could not be sure that a slight gust of wind had not shaken them but i was so convinced that i had heard close to me a real human laugh or sound of some living creature that exactly simulated a laugh that i carefully searched the ground about me expecting to find a being of some kind but i found nothing and going back to my seat on the hanging branch i remained seated for a considerable time at first only listening then pondering on the mystery of that sweet trill of laughter and finally i began to wonder whether i like the spider that chased the shadow had been deluded and had seemed to hear a sound that was not a sound  on the following day i was in the wood again and after a two or three hours ramble during which i heard nothing thinking it useless to haunt the known spots any longer i turned southwards and penetrated into a denser part of the forest where the undergrowth made progress difficult i was not afraid of losing myself the sun above and my sense of direction which was always good would enable me to return to the startingpoint  in this direction i had been pushing resolutely on for over half an hour finding it no easy matter to make my way without constantly deviating to this side or that from the course i wished to keep when i came to a much more open spot the trees were smaller and scantier here owing to the rocky nature of the ground which sloped rather rapidly down but it was moist and overgrown with mosses ferns creepers and low shrubs all of the liveliest green i could not see many yards ahead owing to the bushes and tall fern fronds but presently i began to hear a low continuous sound which when i had advanced twenty or thirty yards further i made out to be the gurgling of running water and at the same moment i made the discovery that my throat was parched and my palms tingling with heat i hurried on promising myself a cool draught when all at once above the soft dashing and gurgling of the water i caught yet another sounda low warbling note or succession of notes which might have been emitted by a bird but it startled me neverthelessbirdlike warbling sounds had come to mean so much to meand pausing i listened intently it was not repeated and finally treading with the utmost caution so as not to alarm the mysterious vocalist i crept on until coming to a greenheart with a quantity of feathery foliage of a shrub growing about its roots i saw that just beyond the tree the ground was more open still letting in the sunlight from above and that the channel of the stream i sought was in this open space about twenty yards from me although the water was still hidden from sight something else was there which i did see instantly my cautious advance was arrested i stood gazing with concentrated vision scarcely daring to breathe lest i should scare it away  it was a human beinga girl form reclining on the moss among the ferns and herbage near the roots of a small tree one arm was doubled behind her neck for her head to rest upon while the other arm was held extended before her the hand raised towards a small brown bird perched on a pendulous twig just beyond its reach she appeared to be playing with the bird possibly amusing herself by trying to entice it on to her hand and the hand appeared to tempt it greatly for it persistently hopped up and down turning rapidly about this way and that flirting its wings and tail and always appearing just on the point of dropping on to her finger from my position it was impossible to see her distinctly yet i dared not move i could make out that she was small not above four feet six or seven inches in height in figure slim with delicately shaped little hands and feet her feet were bare and her only garment was a slight chemiseshaped dress reaching below her knees of a whitishgray colour with a faint lustre as of a silky material her hair was very wonderful it was loose and abundant and seemed wavy or curly falling in a cloud on her shoulders and arms dark it appeared but the precise tint was indeterminable as was that of her skin which looked neither brown nor white all together near to me as she actually was there was a kind of mistiness in the figure which made it appear somewhat vague and distant and a greenish grey seemed the prevailing colour this tint i presently attributed to the effect of the sunlight falling on her through the green foliage for once for a moment she raised herself to reach her finger nearer to the bird and then a gleam of unsubdued sunlight fell on her hair and arm and the arm at that moment appeared of a pearly whiteness and the hair just where the light touched it had a strange lustre and play of iridescent colour  i had not been watching her more than three seconds before the bird with a sharp creaking little chirp flew up and away in sudden alarm at the same moment she turned and saw me through the light leafy screen but although catching sight of me thus suddenly she did not exhibit alarm like the bird only her eyes wide open with a surprised look in them remained immovably fixed on my face and then slowly imperceptiblyfor i did not notice the actual movement so gradual and smooth it was like the motion of a cloud of mist which changes its form and place yet to the eye seems not to have movedshe rose to her knees to her feet retired and with face still towards me and eyes fixed on mine finally disappeared going as if she had melted away into the verdure the leafage was there occupying the precise spot where she had been a moment beforethe feathery foliage of an acacia shrub and stems and broad arrowshaped leaves of an aquatic plant and slim drooping fern fronds and they were motionless and seemed not to have been touched by something passing through them she had gone yet i continued still bent almost double gazing fixedly at the spot where i had last seen her my mind in a strange condition possessed by sensations which were keenly felt and yet contradictory so vivid was the image left on my brain that she still seemed to be actually before my eyes and she was not there nor had been for it was a dream an illusion and no such being existed or could exist in this gross world and at the same time i knew that she had been therethat imagination was powerless to conjure up a form so exquisite  with the mental image i had to be satisfied for although i remained for some hours at that spot i saw her no more nor did i hear any familiar melodious sound for i was now convinced that in this wild solitary girl i had at length discovered the mysterious warbler that so often followed me in the wood at length seeing that it was growing late i took a drink from the stream and slowly and reluctantly made my way out of the forest and went home  early next day i was back in the wood full of delightful anticipations and had no sooner got well among the trees than a soft warbling sound reached my ears it was like that heard on the previous day just before catching sight of the girl among the ferns so soon thought i elated and with cautious steps i proceeded to explore the ground hoping again to catch her unawares but i saw nothing and only after beginning to doubt that i had heard anything unusual and had sat down to rest on a rock the sound was repeated soft and low as before very near and distinct nothing more was heard at this spot but an hour later in another place the same mysterious note sounded near me during my remaining time in the forest i was served many times in the same way and still nothing was seen nor was there any change in the voice  only when the day was near its end did i give up my quest feeling very keenly disappointed it then struck me that the cause of the elusive creatures behaviour was that she had been piqued at my discovery of her in one of her most secret hidingplaces in the heart of the wood and that it had pleased her to pay me out in this manner  on the next day there was no change she was there again evidently following me but always invisible and varied not from that one mocking note of yesterday which seemed to challenge me to find her a second time in the end i was vexed and resolved to be even with her by not visiting the wood for some time a display of indifference on my part would i hoped result in making her less coy in the future  next day firm in my new resolution i accompanied kuako and two others to a distant spot where they expected that the ripening fruit on a cashew tree would attract a large number of birds the fruit however proved still green so that we gathered none and killed few birds returning together kuako kept at my side and by and by falling behind our companions he complimented me on my good shooting although as usual i had only wasted the arrows i had blown  soon you will be able to hit he said hit a bird as big as a small woman and he laughed once more immoderately at the old joke at last growing confidential he said that i would soon possess a zabatana of my own with arrows in plenty he was going to make the arrows himself and his uncle otawinki who had a straight eye would make the tube i treated it all as a joke but he solemnly assured me that he meant it  next morning he asked me if i was going to the forest of evil fame and when i replied in the negative seemed surprised and very much to my surprise evidently disappointed he even tried to persuade me to go where before i had been earnestly recommended not to go until finding that i would not he took me with him to hunt in the woods by and by he returned to the same subject he could not understand why i would not go to that wood and asked me if i had begun to grow afraid  no not afraid i replied but i know the place well and am getting tired of it i had seen everything in itbirds and beastsand had heard all its strange noises  yes heard he said nodding his head knowingly but you have seen nothing strange your eyes are not good enough yet  i laughed contemptuously and answered that i had seen everything strange the wood contained including a strange young girl and i went on to describe her appearance and finished by asking if he thought a white man was frightened at the sight of a young girl  what i said astonished him then he seemed greatly pleased and growing still more confidential and generous than on the previous day he said that i would soon be a most important personage among them and greatly distinguish myself he did not like it when i laughed at all this and went on with great seriousness to speak of the unmade blowpipe that would be minespeaking of it as if it had been something very great equal to the gift of a large tract of land or the governorship of a province north of the orinoco and by and by he spoke of something else more wonderful even than the promise of a blowpipe with arrows galore and this was that young sister of his whose name was oalava a maid of about sixteen shy and silent and mildeyed rather lean and dirty not ugly nor yet prepossessing and this coppercoloured little drab of the wilderness he proposed to bestow in marriage on me anxious to pump him i managed to control my muscles and asked him what authority hea young nobody who had not yet risen to the dignity of buying a wife for himselfcould have to dispose of a sister in this offhand way he replied that there would be no difficulty that runi would give his consent as would also otawinki piake and other relations and last and least according to the matrimonial customs of these latitudes oalava herself would be ready to bestow her personqueyou worn figleafwise necklace of accouri teeth and allon so worthy a suitor as myself finally to make the prospect still more inviting he added that it would not be necessary for me to subject myself to any voluntary tortures to prove myself a man and fitted to enter into the purgatorial state of matrimony he was a great deal too considerate i said and with all the gravity i could command asked him what kind of torture he would recommend for meso valorous a personno torture he answered magnanimously but hekuakohad made up his mind as to the form of torture he meant to inflict some day on his own person he would prepare a large sack and into it put fireantsas many as that he exclaimed triumphantly stooping and filling his two hands with loose sand he would put them in the sack and then get into it himself naked and tie it tightly round his neck so as to show to all spectators that the hellish pain of innumerable venomous stings in his flesh could be endured without a groan and with an unmoved countenance the poor youth had not an original mind since this was one of the commonest forms of selftorture among the guayana tribes but the sudden wonderful animation with which he spoke of it the fiendish joy that illumined his usually stolid countenance sent a sudden disgust and horror through me but what a strange inverted kind of fiendishness is this which delights at the anticipation of torture inflicted on oneself and not on an enemy and towards others these savages are mild and peaceable no i could not believe in their mildness that was only on the surface when nothing occurred to rouse their savage cruel instincts i could have laughed at the whole matter but the exulting look on my companions face had made me sick of the subject and i wished not to talk any more about it  but he would talk stillthis fellow whose words as a rule i had to take out of his mouth with a fork as we say and still on the same subject he said that not one person in the village would expect to see me torture myself that after what i would do for them allafter delivering them from a great evilnothing further would be expected of me  i asked him to explain his meaning for it now began to appear plain that in everything he had said he had been leading up to some very important matter it would of course have been a great mistake to suppose that my savage was offering me a blowpipe and a marketable virgin sister from purely disinterested motives  in reply he went back to that still unforgotten joke about my being able eventually to hit a bird as big as a small woman with an arrow out of it all came when he went on to ask me if that mysterious girl i had seen in the wood was not of a size to suit me as a target when i had got my hand in with a little more practice that was the great work i was asked to do for themthat shy mysterious girl with the melodious wildbird voice was the evil being i was asked to slay with poisoned arrows this was why he now wished me to go often to the wood to become more and more familiar with her haunts and habits to overcome all shyness and suspicion in her and at the proper moment when it would be impossible to miss my mark to plant the fatal arrow the disgust he had inspired in me before when gloating over anticipated tortures was a weak and transient feeling to what i now experienced i turned on him in a sudden transport of rage and in a moment would have shattered on his head the blowpipe i was carrying in my hand but his astonished look as he turned to face me made me pause and prevented me from committing so fatal an indiscretion i could only grind my teeth and struggle to overcome an almost overpowering hatred and wrath finally i flung the tube down and bade him take it telling him that i would not touch it again if he offered me all the sisters of all the savages in guayana for wives  he continued gazing at me mute with astonishment and prudence suggested that it would be best to conceal as far as possible the violent animosity i had conceived against him i asked him somewhat scornfully if he believed that i should ever be able to hit anythingbird or human beingwith an arrow no i almost shouted so as to give vent to my feelings in some way and drawing my revolver this is the white mans weapon but he kills men with itmen who attempt to kill or injure himbut neither with this nor any other weapon does he murder innocent young girls treacherously after that we went on in silence for some time at length he said that the being i had seen in the wood and was not afraid of was no innocent young girl but a daughter of the didi an evil being and that so long as she continued to inhabit the wood they could not go there to hunt and even in other woods they constantly went in fear of meeting her too much disgusted to talk with him i went on in silence and when we reached the stream near the village i threw off my clothes and plunged into the water to cool my anger before going in to the others    chapter vi  thinking about the forest girl while lying awake that night i came to the conclusion that i had made it sufficiently plain to her how little her capricious behaviour had been relished and had therefore no need to punish myself more by keeping any longer out of my beloved green mansions accordingly next day after the heavy rain that fell during the morning hours had ceased i set forth about noon to visit the wood overhead the sky was clear again but there was no motion in the heavy sultry atmosphere while dark blue masses of bankedup clouds on the western horizon threatened a fresh downpour later in the day my mind was however now too greatly excited at the prospect of a possible encounter with the forest nymph to allow me to pay any heed to these ominous signs  i had passed through the first strip of wood and was in the succeeding stony sterile space when a gleam of brilliant colour close by on the ground caught my sight it was a snake lying on the bare earth had i kept on without noticing it i should most probably have trodden upon or dangerously near it viewing it closely i found that it was a coral snake famed as much for its beauty and singularity as for its deadly character it was about three feet long and very slim its ground colour a brilliant vermilion with broad jetblack rings at equal distances round its body each black ring or band divided by a narrow yellow strip in the middle the symmetrical pattern and vividly contrasted colours would have given it the appearance of an artificial snake made by some fanciful artist but for the gleam of life in its bright coils its fixed eyes too were living gems and from the point of its dangerous arrowy head the glistening tongue flickered ceaselessly as i stood a few yards away regarding it  i admire you greatly sir serpent i said or thought but it is dangerous say the military authorities to leave an enemy or possible enemy in the rear the person who does such a thing must be either a bad strategist or a genius and i am neither  retreating a few paces i found and picked up a stone about as big as a mans hand and hurled it at the dangerouslooking head with the intention of crushing it but the stone hit upon the rocky ground a little on one side of the mark and being soft flew into a hundred small fragments this roused the creatures anger and in a moment with raised head he was gliding swiftly towards me again i retreated not so slowly on this occasion and finding another stone i raised and was about to launch it when a sharp ringing cry issued from the bushes growing near and quickly following the sound forth stepped the forest girl no longer elusive and shy vaguely seen in the shadowy wood but boldly challenging attention exposed to the full power of the meridian sun which made her appear luminous and rich in colour beyond example seeing her thus all those emotions of fear and abhorrence invariably excited in us by the sight of an active venomous serpent in our path vanished instantly from my mind i could now only feel astonishment and admiration at the brilliant being as she advanced with swift easy undulating motion towards me or rather towards the serpent which was now between us moving more and more slowly as she came nearer the cause of this sudden wonderful boldness so unlike her former habit was unmistakable she had been watching my approach from some hidingplace among the bushes ready no doubt to lead me a dance through the wood with her mocking voice as on previous occasions when my attack on the serpent caused that outburst of wrath the torrent of ringing and to me inarticulate sounds in that unknown tongue her rapid gestures and above all her wideopen sparkling eyes and face aflame with colour made it impossible to mistake the nature of her feeling  in casting about for some term or figure of speech in which to describe the impression produced on me at that moment i think of waspish and better still avispadaliterally the same word in spanish not having precisely the same meaning nor ever applied contemptuouslyonly to reject both after a moments reflection yet i go back to the image of an irritated wasp as perhaps offering the best illustration of some large tropical wasp advancing angrily towards me as i have witnessed a hundred times not exactly flying but moving rapidly half running and half flying over the ground with loud and angry buzz the glistening wings open and agitated beautiful beyond most animated creatures in its sharp but graceful lines polished surface and varied brilliant colouring and that wrathfulness that fits it so well and seems to give it additional lustre  wonderstruck at the sight of her strange beauty and passion i forgot the advancing snake until she came to a stop at about five yards from me then to my horror i saw that it was beside her naked feet although no longer advancing the head was still raised high as if to strike but presently the spirit of anger appeared to die out of it the lifted head oscillating a little from side to side sunk down lower and lower to rest finally on the girls bare instep and lying there motionless the deadly thing had the appearance of a gaily coloured silken garter just dropped from her leg it was plain to see that she had no fear of it that she was one of those exceptional persons to be found it is said in all countries who possess some magnetic quality which has a soothing effect on even the most venomous and irritable reptiles  following the direction of my eyes she too glanced down but did not move her foot then she made her voice heard again still loud and sharp but the anger was not now so pronounced  do not fear i shall not harm it i said in the indian tongue  she took no notice of my speech and continued speaking with increasing resentment  i shook my head replying that her language was unknown to me then by means of signs i tried to make her understand that the creature was safe from further molestation she pointed indignantly at the stone in my hand which i had forgotten all about at once i threw it from me and instantly there was a change the resentment had vanished and a tender radiance lit her face like a smile  i advanced a little nearer addressing her once more in the indian tongue but my speech was evidently unintelligible to her as she stood now glancing at the snake lying at her feet now at me again i had recourse to signs and gestures pointing to the snake then to the stone i had cast away i endeavoured to convey to her that in the future i would for her sake be a friend to all venomous reptiles and that i wished her to have the same kindly feelings towards me as towards these creatures whether or not she understood me she showed no disposition to go into hiding again and continued silently regarding me with a look that seemed to express pleasure at finding herself at last thus suddenly brought face to face with me flattered at this i gradually drew nearer until at the last i was standing at her side gazing down with the utmost delight into that face which so greatly surpassed in loveliness all human faces i had ever seen or imagined  and yet to you my friend it probably will not seem that she was so beautiful since i have alas only the words we all use to paint commoner coarser things and no means to represent all the exquisite details all the delicate lights and shades and swift changes of colour and expression moreover is it not a fact that the strange or unheard of can never appear beautiful in a mere description because that which is most novel in it attracts too much attention and is given undue prominence in the picture and we miss that which would have taken away the effect of strangenessthe perfect balance of the parts and harmony of the whole for instance the blue eyes of the northerner would when first described to the blackeyed inhabitants of warm regions seem unbeautiful and a monstrosity because they would vividly see with the mental vision that unheardof blueness but not in the same vivid way the accompanying flesh and hair tints with which it harmonizes  think then less of the picture as i have to paint it in words than of the feeling its original inspired in me when looking closely for the first time on that rare loveliness trembling with delight i mentally cried oh why has nature maker of so many types and of innumerable individuals of each given to the world but one being like this  scarcely had the thought formed itself in my mind before i dismissed it as utterly incredible no this exquisite being was without doubt one of a distinct race which had existed in this littleknown corner of the continent for thousands of generations albeit now perhaps reduced to a small and dwindling remnant  her figure and features were singularly delicate but it was her colour that struck me most which indeed made her differ from all other human beings the colour of the skin would be almost impossible to describe so greatly did it vary with every change of moodand the moods were many and transientand with the angle on which the sunlight touched it and the degree of light  beneath the trees at a distance it had seemed a somewhat dim white or pale grey near in the strong sunshine it was not white but alabastrian semipellucid showing an underlying rose colour and at any point where the rays fell direct this colour was bright and luminous as we see in our fingers when held before a strong firelight but that part of her skin that remained in shadow appeared of a dimmer white and the underlying colour varied from dim rosy purple to dim blue with the skin the colour of the eyes harmonized perfectly at first when lit with anger they had appeared flamelike now the iris was of a peculiar soft or dim and tender red a shade sometimes seen in flowers but only when looked closely at could this delicate hue be discerned the pupils being large as in some grey eyes and the long dark shading lashes at a short distance made the whole eye appear dark think not then of the red flower exposed to the light and sun in conjunction with the vivid green of the foliage think only of such a hue in the halfhidden iris brilliant and moist with the eyes moisture deep with the eyes depth glorified by the outward look of a bright beautiful soul most variable of all in colour was the hair this being due to its extreme fineness and glossiness and to its elasticity which made it lie fleecy and loose on head shoulders and back a cloud with a brightness on its surface made by the freer outer hairs a fit setting and crown for a countenance of such rare changeful loveliness in the shade viewed closely the general colour appeared a slate deepening in places to purple but even in the shade the nimbus of free flossy hairs half veiled the darker tints with a downy pallor and at a distance of a few yards it gave the whole hair a vague misty appearance in the sunlight the colour varied more looking now dark sometimes intensely black now of a light uncertain hue with a play of iridescent colour on the loose surface as we see on the glossed plumage of some birds and at a short distance with the sun shining full on her head it sometimes looked white as a noonday cloud so changeful was it and ethereal in appearance with its cloud colours that all other human hair even of the most beautiful golden shades pale or red seemed heavy and dull and deadlooking by comparison  but more than form and colour and that enchanting variability was the look of intelligence which at the same time seemed complementary to and one with the allseeing allhearing alertness appearing in her face the alertness one remarks in a wild creature even when in repose and fearing nothing but seldom in man never perhaps in intellectual or studious man she was a wild solitary girl of the woods and did not understand the language of the country in which i had addressed her what inner or mind life could such a one have more than that of any wild animal existing in the same conditions yet looking at her face it was not possible to doubt its intelligence this union in her of two opposite qualities which with us cannot or do not exist together although so novel yet struck me as the girls principal charm why had nature not done this beforewhy in all others does the brightness of the mind dim that beautiful physical brightness which the wild animals have but enough for me that that which no man had ever looked for or hoped to find existed here that through that unfamiliar lustre of the wild life shone the spiritualizing light of mind that made us kin  these thoughts passed swiftly through my brain as i stood feasting my sight on her bright piquant face while she on her part gazed back into my eyes not only with fearless curiosity but with a look of recognition and pleasure at the encounter so unmistakably friendly that encouraged by it i took her arm in my hand moving at the same time a little nearer to her at that moment a swift startled expression came into her eyes she glanced down and up again into my face her lips trembled and slightly parted as she murmured some sorrowful sounds in a tone so low as to be only just audible  thinking she had become alarmed and was on the point of escaping out of my hands and fearing above all things to lose sight of her again so soon i slipped my arm around her slender body to detain her moving one foot at the same time to balance myself and at that moment i felt a slight blow and a sharp burning sensation shoot into my leg so sudden and intense that i dropped my arm at the same time uttering a cry of pain and recoiled one or two paces from her but she stirred not when i released her her eyes followed my movements then she glanced down at her feet i followed her look and figure to yourself my horror when i saw there the serpent i had so completely forgotten and which even that sting of sharp pain had not brought back to remembrance there it lay a coil of its own thrown round one of her ankles and its head raised nearly a foot high swaying slowly from side to side while the swift forked tongue flickered continuously thenonly theni knew what had happened and at the same time i understood the reason of that sudden look of alarm in her face the murmuring sounds she had uttered and the downward startled glance her fears had been solely for my safety and she had warned me too late too late in moving i had trodden on or touched the serpent with my foot and it had bitten me just above the ankle in a few moments i began to realize the horror of my position must i die must i die oh my god is there nothing that can save me i cried in my heart  she was still standing motionless in the same place her eyes wandered back from me to the snake gradually its swaying head was lowered again and the coil unwound from her ankle then it began to move away slowly at first and with the head a little raised then faster and in the end it glided out of sight gonebut it had left its venom in my bloodo cursed reptile  back from watching its retreat my eyes returned to her face now strangely clouded with trouble her eyes dropped before mine while the palms of her hands were pressed together and the fingers clasped and unclasped alternately how different she seemed now the brilliant face grown so pallid and vaguelooking but not only because this tragic end to our meeting had pierced her with pain that cloud in the west had grown up and now covered half the sky with vast lurid masses of vapour blotting out the sun and a great gloom had fallen on the earth  that sudden twilight and a long roll of approaching thunder reverberating from the hills increased my anguish and desperation death at that moment looked unutterably terrible the remembrance of all that made life dear pierced me to the coreall that nature was to me all the pleasures of sense and intellect the hopes i had cherishedall was revealed to me as by a flash of lightning bitterest of all was the thought that i must now bid everlasting farewell to this beautiful being i had found in the solitude this lustrous daughter of the didijust when i had won her from her shynessthat i must go away into the cursed blackness of death and never know the mystery of her life it was that which utterly unnerved me and made my legs tremble under me and brought great drops of sweat to my forehead until i thought that the venom was already doing its swift fatal work in my veins  with uncertain steps i moved to a stone a yard or two away and sat down upon it as i did so the hope came to me that this girl so intimate with nature might know of some antidote to save me touching my leg and using other signs i addressed her again in the indian language  the snake has bitten me i said what shall i do is there no leaf no root you know that would save me from death help me help me i cried in despair  my signs she probably understood if not my words but she made no reply and still she remained standing motionless twisting and untwisting her fingers and regarding me with a look of ineffable grief and compassion  alas it was vain to appeal to her she knew what had happened and what the result would most likely be and pitied but was powerless to help me then it occurred to me that if i could reach the indian village before the venom overpowered me something might be done to save me oh why had i tarried so long losing so many precious minutes large drops of rain were falling now and the gloom was deeper and the thunder almost continuous with a cry of anguish i started to my feet and was about to rush away towards the village when a dazzling flash of lightning made me pause for a moment when it vanished i turned a last look on the girl and her face was deathly pale and her hair looked blacker than night and as she looked she stretched out her arms towards me and uttered a low wailing cry goodbye for ever i murmured and turning once more from her rushed away like one crazed into the wood but in my confusion i had probably taken the wrong direction for instead of coming out in a few minutes into the open border of the forest and on to the savannah i found myself every moment getting deeper among the trees i stood still perplexed but could not shake off the conviction that i had started in the right direction eventually i resolved to keep on for a hundred yards or so and then if no opening appeared to turn back and retrace my steps but this was no easy matter i soon became entangled in a dense undergrowth which so confused me that at last i confessed despairingly to myself that for the first time in this wood i was hopelessly lost and in what terrible circumstances at intervals a flash of lightning would throw a vivid blue glare down into the interior of the wood and only serve to show that i had lost myself in a place where even at noon in cloudless weather progress would be most difficult and now the light would only last a moment to be followed by thick gloom and i could only tear blindly on bruising and lacerating my flesh at every step falling again and again only to struggle up and on again now high above the surface climbing over prostrate trees and branches now plunged to my middle in a pool or torrent of water  hopelessutterly hopeless seemed all my mad efforts and at each pause when i would stand exhausted gasping for breath my throbbing heart almost suffocating me a dull continuous teasing pain in my bitten leg served to remind me that i had but a little time left to existthat by delaying at first i had allowed my only chance of salvation to slip by  how long a time i spent fighting my way through this dense black wood i know not perhaps two or three hours only to me the hours seemed like years of prolonged agony at last all at once i found that i was free of the close undergrowth and walking on level ground but it was darker here darker than the darkest night and at length when the lightning came and flared down through the dense roof of foliage overhead i discovered that i was in a spot that had a strange look where the trees were very large and grew wide apart and with no undergrowth to impede progress beneath them here recovering breath i began to run and after a while found that i had left the large trees behind me and was now in a more open place with small trees and bushes and this made me hope for a while that i had at last reached the border of the forest but the hope proved vain once more i had to force my way through dense undergrowth and finally emerged on to a slope where it was open and i could once more see for some distance around me by such light as came through the thick pall of clouds trudging on to the summit of the slope i saw that there was open savannah country beyond and for a moment rejoiced that i had got free from the forest a few steps more and i was standing on the very edge of a bank a precipice not less than fifty feet deep i had never seen that bank before and therefore knew that i could not be on the right side of the forest but now my only hope was to get completely away from the trees and then to look for the village and i began following the bank in search of a descent no break occurred and presently i was stopped by a dense thicket of bushes i was about to retrace my steps when i noticed that a tall slender tree growing at the foot of the precipice its green top not more than a couple of yards below my feet seemed to offer a means of escape nerving myself with the thought that if i got crushed by the fall i should probably escape a lingering and far more painful death i dropped into the cloud of foliage beneath me and clutched desperately at the twigs as i fell for a moment i felt myself sustained but branch after branch gave way beneath my weight and then i only remember very dimly a swift flight through the air before losing consciousness    chapter vii  with the return of consciousness i at first had a vague impression that i was lying somewhere injured and incapable of motion that it was night and necessary for me to keep my eyes fast shut to prevent them from being blinded by almost continuous vivid flashes of lightning injured and sore all over but warm and drysurely dry nor was it lightning that dazzled but firelight i began to notice things little by little the fire was burning on a clay floor a few feet from where i was lying before it on a log of wood sat or crouched a human figure an old man with chin on breast and hands clasped before his drawnup knees only a small portion of his forehead and nose visible to me an indian i took him to be from his coarse lank grey hair and dark brown skin i was in a large hut falling at the sides to within two feet of the floor but there were no hammocks in it nor bows and spears and no skins not even under me for i was lying on straw mats i could hear the storm still raging outside the rush and splash of rain and at intervals the distant growl of thunder there was wind too i listened to it sobbing in the trees and occasionally a puff found its way in and blew up the white ashes at the old mans feet and shook the yellow flames like a flag i remembered now how the storm began the wild girl the snakebite my violent efforts to find a way out of the woods and finally that leap from the bank where recollection ended that i had not been killed by the venomous tooth nor the subsequent fearful fall seemed like a miracle to me and in that wild solitary place lying insensible in that awful storm and darkness i had been found by a fellow creaturea savage doubtless but a good samaritan all the samewho had rescued me from death i was bruised all over and did not attempt to move fearing the pain it would give me and i had a racking headache but these seemed trifling discomforts after such adventures and such perils i felt that i had recovered or was recovering from that venomous bite that i would live and not dielive to return to my country and the thought filled my heart to overflowing and tears of gratitude and happiness rose to my eyes  at such times a man experiences benevolent feelings and would willingly bestow some of that overplus of happiness on his fellows to lighten other hearts and this old man before me who was probably the instrument of my salvation began greatly to excite my interest and compassion for he seemed so poor in his old age and rags so solitary and dejected as he sat there with knees drawn up his great brown bare feet looking almost black by contrast with the white woodashes about them what could i do for him what could i say to cheer his spirits in that indian language which has few or no words to express kindly feelings unable to think of anything better to say i at length suddenly cried aloud smoke old man why do you not smoke it is good to smoke  he gave a mighty start and turning fixed his eyes on me then i saw that he was not a pure indian for although as brown as old leather he wore a beard and moustache a curious face had this old man which looked as if youth and age had made it a battlingground his forehead was smooth except for two parallel lines in the middle running its entire length dividing it in zones his arched eyebrows were black as ink and his small black eyes were bright and cunning like the eyes of some wild carnivorous animal in this part of his face youth had held its own especially in the eyes which looked young and lively but lower down age had conquered scribbling his skin all over with wrinkles while moustache and beard were white as thistledown aha the dead man is alive again he exclaimed with a chuckling laugh this in the indian tongue then in spanish he added but speak to me in the language you know best senor for if you are not a venezuelan call me an owl  and you old man said i  ah i was right why sir what i am is plainly written on my face surely you do not take me for a pagan i might be a black man from africa or an englishman but an indianthat no but a minute ago you had the goodness to invite me to smoke how sir can a poor man smoke who is without tobacco  without tobaccoin guayana  can you believe it but sir do not blame me if the beast that came one night and destroyed my plants when ripe for cutting had taken pumpkins and sweet potatoes instead it would have been better for him if curses have any effect and the plant grows slowly sirit is not an evil weed to come to maturity in a single day and as for other leaves in the forest i smoke them yes but there is no comfort to the lungs in such smoke  my tobaccopouch was full i said you will find it in my coat if i did not lose it  the saints forbid he exclaimed grandchildrima have you got a tobaccopouch with the other things give it to me  then i first noticed that another person was in the hut a slim young girl who had been seated against the wall on the other side of the fire partially hid by the shadows she had my leather belt with the revolver in its case and my huntingknife attached and the few articles i had had in my pockets on her lap taking up the pouch she handed it to him and he clutched it with a strange eagerness  i will give it back presently rima he said let me first smoke a cigaretteand then another  it seemed probable from this that the good old man had already been casting covetous eyes on my property and that his granddaughter had taken care of it for me but how the silent demure girl had kept it from him was a puzzle so intensely did he seem now to enjoy it drawing the smoke vigorously into his lungs and after keeping it ten or fifteen seconds there letting it fly out again from mouth and nose in blue jets and clouds his face softened visibly he became more and more genial and loquacious and asked me how i came to be in that solitary place i told him that i was staying with the indian runi his neighbour  but senor he said if it is not an impertinence how is it that a young man of so distinguished an appearance as yourself a venezuelan should be residing with these children of the devil  you love not your neighbours then  i know them sirhow should i love them he was rolling up his second or third cigarette by this time and i could not help noticing that he took a great deal more tobacco than he required in his fingers and that the surplus on each occasion was conveyed to some secret receptacle among his rags love them sir they are infidels and therefore the good christian must only hate them they are thievesthey will steal from you before your very face so devoid are they of all shame and also murderers gladly would they burn this poor thatch above my head and kill me and my poor grandchild who shares this solitary life with me if they had the courage but they are all arrant cowards and fear to approach mefear even to come into this wood you would laugh to hear what they are afraid ofa child would laugh to hear it  what do they fear i said for his words had excited my interest in a great degree  why sir would you believe it they fear this childmy granddaughter seated there before you a poor innocent girl of seventeen summers a christian who knows her catechism and would not harm the smallest thing that god has madeno not a fly which is not regarded on account of its smallness why sir it is due to her tender heart that you are safely sheltered here instead of being left out of doors in this tempestuous night  to herto this girl i returned in astonishment explain old man for i do not know how i was saved  today senor through your own heedlessness you were bitten by a venomous snake  yes that is true although i do not know how it came to your knowledge but why am i not a dead man thenhave you done something to save me from the effects of the poison  nothing what could i do so long after you were bitten when a man is bitten by a snake in a solitary place he is in gods hands he will live or die as god wills there is nothing to be done but surely sir you remember that my poor grandchild was with you in the wood when the snake bit you  a girl was therea strange girl i have seen and heard before when i have walked in the forest but not this girlsurely not this girl  no other said he carefully rolling up another cigarette  it is not possible i returned  ill would you have fared sir had she not been there for after being bitten you rushed away into the thickest part of the wood and went about in a circle like a demented person for heaven knows how long but she never left you she was always close to youyou might have touched her with your hand and at last some good angel who was watching you in order to stop your career made you mad altogether and caused you to jump over a precipice and lose your senses and you were no sooner on the ground than she was with youask me not how she got down and when she had propped you up against the bank she came for me fortunately the spot where you had fallen is nearnot five hundred yards from the door and i on my part was willing to assist her in saving you for i knew it was no indian that had fallen since she loves not that breed and they come not here it was not an easy task for you weigh senor but between us we brought you in  while he spoke the girl continued sitting in the same listless attitude as when i first observed her with eyes cast down and hands folded in her lap recalling that brilliant being in the wood that had protected the serpent from me and calmed its rage i found it hard to believe his words and still felt a little incredulous  rimathat is your name is it not i said will you come here and stand before me and let me look closely at you  si senor she meekly answered and removing the things from her lap she stood up then passing behind the old man came and stood before me her eyes still bent on the grounda picture of humility  she had the figure of the forest girl but wore now a scanty faded cotton garment while the loose cloud of hair was confined in two plaits and hung down her back the face also showed the same delicate lines but of the brilliant animation and variable colour and expression there appeared no trace gazing at her countenance as she stood there silent shy and spiritless before me the image of her brighter self came vividly to my mind and i could not recover from the astonishment i felt at such a contrast  have you ever observed a hummingbird moving about in an aerial dance among the flowersa living prismatic gem that changes its colour with every change of positionhow in turning it catches the sunshine on its burnished neck and gorges plumesgreen and gold and flamecoloured the beams changing to visible flakes as they fall dissolving into nothing to be succeeded by others and yet others in its exquisite form its changeful splendour its swift motions and intervals of aerial suspension it is a creature of such fairylike loveliness as to mock all description and have you seen this same fairylike creature suddenly perch itself on a twig in the shade its misty wings and fanlike tail folded the iridescent glory vanished looking like some common dullplumaged little bird sitting listless in a cage just so great was the difference in the girl as i had seen her in the forest and as she now appeared under the smoky roof in the firelight  after watching her for some moments i spoke rima there must be a good deal of strength in that frame of yours which looks so delicate will you raise me up a little  she went down on one knee and placing her arms round me assisted me to a sitting posture  thank you rimaoh misery i groaned is there a bone left unbroken in my poor body  nothing broken cried the old man clouds of smoke flying out with his words i have examined you welllegs arms ribs for this is how it was senor a thorny bush into which you fell saved you from being flattened on the stony ground but you are bruised sir black with bruises and there are more scratches of thorns on your skin than letters on a written page  a long thorn might have entered my brain i said from the way it pains feel my forehead rima is it very hot and dry  she did as i asked touching me lightly with her little cool hand no senor not hot but warm and moist she said  thank heaven for that i said poor girl and you followed me through the wood in all that terrible storm ah if i could lift my bruised arm i would take your hand to kiss it in gratitude for so great a service i owe you my life sweet rimawhat shall i do to repay so great a debt  the old man chuckled as if amused but the girl lifted not her eyes nor spoke  tell me sweet child i said for i cannot realize it yet was it really you that saved the serpents life when i would have killed itdid you stand by me in the wood with the serpent lying at your feet  yes senor came her gentle answer  and it was you i saw in the wood one day lying on the ground playing with a small bird  yes senor  and it was you that followed me so often among the trees calling to me yet always hiding so that i could never see you  yes senor  oh this is wonderful i exclaimed whereat the old man chuckled again  but tell me this my sweet girl i continued you never addressed me in spanish what strange musical language was it you spoke to me in  she shot a timid glance at my face and looked troubled at the question but made no reply  senor said the old man that is a question which you must excuse my child from answering not sir from want of will for she is docile and obedient though i say it but there is no answer beyond what i can tell you and this is sir that all creatures whether man or bird have the voice that god has given them and in some the voice is musical and in others not so  very well old man said i to myself there let the matter rest for the present but if i am destined to live and not die i shall not long remain satisfied with your too simple explanation  rima i said you must be fatigued it is thoughtless of me to keep you standing here so long  her face brightened a little and bending down she replied in a low voice i am not fatigued sir let me get you something to eat now  she moved quickly away to the fire and presently returned with an earthenware dish of roasted pumpkin and sweet potatoes and kneeling at my side fed me deftly with a small wooden spoon i did not feel grieved at the absence of meat and the stinging condiments the indians love nor did i even remark that there was no salt in the vegetables so much was i taken up with watching her beautiful delicate face while she ministered to me the exquisite fragrance of her breath was more to me than the most delicious viands could have been and it was a delight each time she raised the spoon to my mouth to catch a momentary glimpse of her eyes which now looked dark as wine when we lift the glass to see the ruby gleam of light within the purple but she never for a moment laid aside the silent meek constrained manner and when i remembered her bursting out in her brilliant wrath on me pouring forth that torrent of stinging invective in her mysterious language i was lost in wonder and admiration at the change in her and at her double personality having satisfied my wants she moved quietly away and raising a straw mat disappeared behind it into her own sleepingapartment which was divided off by a partition from the room i was in  the old mans sleepingplace was a wooden cot or stand on the opposite side of the room but he was in no hurry to sleep and after rima had left us put a fresh log on the blaze and lit another cigarette heaven knows how many he had smoked by this time he became very talkative and called to his side his two dogs which i had not noticed in the room before for me to see it amused me to hear their namessusio and goloso dirty and greedy they were surlylooking brutes with rough yellow hair and did not win my heart but according to his account they possessed all the usual canine virtues and he was still holding forth on the subject when i fell asleep    chapter viii  when morning came i was too stiff and sore to move and not until the following day was i able to creep out to sit in the shade of the trees my old host whose name was nuflo went off with his dogs leaving the girl to attend to my wants two or three times during the day she appeared to serve me with food and drink but she continued silent and constrained in manner as on the first evening of seeing her in the hut  late in the afternoon old nuflo returned but did not say where he had been and shortly afterwards rima reappeared demure as usual in her faded cotton dress her cloud of hair confined in two long plaits my curiosity was more excited than ever and i resolved to get to the bottom of the mystery of her life the girl had not shown herself responsive but now that nuflo was back i was treated to as much talk as i cared to hear he talked of many things only omitting those which i desired to hear about but his pet subject appeared to be the divine government of the worldgods politicsand its manifest imperfections or in other words the manifold abuses which from time to time had been allowed to creep into it the old man was pious but like many of his class in my country he permitted himself to indulge in very free criticisms of the powers above from the king of heaven down to the smallest saint whose name figures in the calendar  these things senor he said are not properly managed consider my position here am i compelled for my sins to inhabit this wilderness with my poor granddaughter  she is not your granddaughter i suddenly interrupted thinking to surprise him into an admission  but he took his time to answer senor we are never sure of anything in this world not absolutely sure thus it may come to pass that you will one day marry and that your wife will in due time present you with a sonone that will inherit your fortune and transmit your name to posterity and yet sir in this world you will never know to a certainty that he is your son  proceed with what you were saying i returned with some dignity  here we are he continued compelled to inhabit this land and do not meet with proper protection from the infidel now sir this is a crying evil and it is only becoming in one who has the true faith and is a loyal subject of the allpowerful to point out with due humility that he is growing very remiss in his affairs and is losing a good deal of his prestige and what senor is at the bottom of it favoritism we know that the supreme cannot himself be everywhere attending to each little tricktrack that arises in the worldmatters altogether beneath his notice and that he must like the president of venezuela or the emperor of brazil appoint menangels if you liketo conduct his affairs and watch over each district and it is manifest that for this country of guayana the proper person has not been appointed every evil is done and there is no remedy and the christian has no more consideration shown him than the infidel now senor in a town near the orinoco i once saw on a church the archangel michael made of stone and twice as tall as a man with one foot on a monster shaped like a cayman but with bats wings and a head and neck like a serpent into this monster he was thrusting his spear that is the kind of person that should be sent to rule these latitudesa person of firmness and resolution with strength in his wrist and yet it is probable that this very manthis st michaelis hanging about the palace twirling his thumbs waiting for an appointment while other weaker men andheaven forgive me for saying itnot above a bribe perhaps are sent out to rule over this province  on this string he would harp by the hour it was a lofty subject on which he had pondered much in his solitary life and he was glad of an opportunity of ventilating his grievance and expounding his views at first it was a pure pleasure to hear spanish again and the old man albeit ignorant of letters spoke well but this i may say is a common thing in our country where the peasants quickness of intelligence and poetic feeling often compensate for want of instruction his views also amused me although they were not novel but after a while i grew tired of listening yet i listened still agreeing with him and leading him on to let him have his fill of talk always hoping that he would come at last to speak of personal matters and give me an account of his history and of rimas origin but the hope proved vain not a word to enlighten me would he drop however cunningly i tempted him  so be it thought i but if you are cunning old man i shall be cunning tooand patient for all things come to him who waits  he was in no hurry to get rid of me on the contrary he more than hinted that i would be safer under his roof than with the indians at the same time apologizing for not giving me meat to eat  but why do you not have meat never have i seen animals so abundant and tame as in this wood before he could reply rima with a jug of water from the spring in her hand came in glancing at me he lifted his finger to signify that such a subject must not be discussed in her presence but as soon as she quitted the room he returned to it  senor he said have you forgotten your adventure with the snake know then that my grandchild would not live with me for one day longer if i were to lift my hand against any living creature for us senor every day is fastdayonly without the fish we have maize pumpkin cassava potatoes and these suffice and even of these cultivated fruits of the earth she eats but little in the house preferring certain wild berries and gums which are more to her taste and which she picks here and there in her rambles in the wood and i sir loving her as i do whatever my inclination may be shed no blood and eat no flesh  i looked at him with an incredulous smile  and your dogs old man  my dogs sir they would not pause or turn aside if a coatimundi crossed their pathan animal with a strong odour as a man is so is his dog have you not seen dogs eating grass sir even in venezuela where these sentiments do not prevail and when there is no meatwhen meat is forbiddenthese sagacious animals accustom themselves to a vegetable diet  i could not very well tell the old man that he was lying to methat would have been bad policyand so i passed it off i have no doubt that you are right i said i have heard that there are dogs in china that eat no meat but are themselves eaten by their owners after being fattened on rice i should not care to dine on one of your animals old man  he looked at them critically and replied certainly they are lean  i was thinking less of their leanness than of their smell i returned their odour when they approach me is not flowery but resembles that of other dogs which feed on flesh and have offended my too sensitive nostrils even in the drawingrooms of caracas it is not like the fragrance of cattle when they return from the pasture  every animal he replied gives out that odour which is peculiar to its kind an incontrovertible fact which left me nothing to say  when i had sufficiently recovered the suppleness of my limbs to walk with ease i went for a ramble in the wood in the hope that rima would accompany me and that out among the trees she would cast aside that artificial constraint and shyness which was her manner in the house  it fell out just as i had expected she accompanied me in the sense of being always near me or within earshot and her manner was now free and unconstrained as i could wish but little or nothing was gained by the change she was once more the tantalizing elusive mysterious creature i had first known through her wandering melodious voice the only difference was that the musical inarticulate sounds were now less often heard and that she was no longer afraid to show herself to me this for a short time was enough to make me happy since no lovelier being was ever looked upon nor one whose loveliness was less likely to lose its charm through being often seen  but to keep her near me or always in sight was i found impossible she would be free as the wind free as the butterfly going and coming at her wayward will and losing herself from sight a dozen times every hour to induce her to walk soberly at my side or sit down and enter into conversation with me seemed about as impracticable as to tame the fieryhearted little hummingbird that flashes into sight remains suspended motionless for a few seconds before your face then quick as lightning vanishes again  at length feeling convinced that she was most happy when she had me out following her in the wood that in spite of her birdlike wildness she had a tender human heart which was easily moved i determined to try to draw her closer by means of a little innocent stratagem going out in the morning after calling her several times to no purpose i began to assume a downcast manner as if suffering pain or depressed with grief and at last finding a convenient exposed root under a tree on a spot where the ground was dry and strewn with loose yellow sand i sat down and refused to go any further for she always wanted to lead me on and on and whenever i paused she would return to show herself or to chide or encourage me in her mysterious language all her pretty little arts were now practiced in vain with cheek resting on my hand i still sat  so my eyes fixed on that patch of yellow sand at my feet watching how the small particles glinted like diamond dust when the sunlight touched them a full hour passed in this way during which i encouraged myself by saying mentally this is a contest between us and the most patient and the strongest of will which should be the man must conquer and if i win on this occasion it will be easier for me in the futureeasier to discover those things which i am resolved to know and the girl must reveal to me since the old man has proved impracticable  meanwhile she came and went and came again and at last finding that i was not to be moved she approached and stood near me her face when i glanced at it had a somewhat troubled lookboth troubled and curious  come here rima i said and stay with me for a little whilei cannot follow you now  she took one or two hesitating steps then stood still again and at length slowly and reluctantly advanced to within a yard of me then i rose from my seat on the root so as to catch her face better and placed my hand against the rough bark of the tree  rima i said speaking in a low caressing tone will you stay with me here a little while and talk to me not in your language but in mine so that i may understand will you listen when i speak to you and answer me  her lips moved but made no sound she seemed strangely disquieted and shook back her loose hair and with her small toes moved the sparkling sand at her feet and once or twice her eyes glanced shyly at my face  rima you have not answered me i persisted will you not say yes  yes  where does your grandfather spend his day when he goes out with his dogs  she shook her head slightly but would not speak  have you no mother rima do you remember your mother  my mother my mother she exclaimed in a low voice but with a sudden wonderful animation bending a little nearer she continued oh she is dead her body is in the earth and turned to dust like that and she moved the loose sand with her foot her soul is up there where the stars and the angels are grandfather says but what is that to me i am heream i not i talk to her just the same everything i see i point out and tell her everything in the daytimein the woods when we are together and at night when i lie down i cross my arms on my breastso and say mother mother now you are in my arms let us go to sleep together sometimes i say oh why will you never answer me when i speak and speak mothermothermother  at the end her voice suddenly rose to a mournful cry then sunk and at the last repetition of the word died to a low whisper  ah poor rima she is dead and cannot speak to youcannot hear you talk to me rima i am living and can answer  but now the cloud which had suddenly lifted from her heart letting me see for a moment into its mysterious depthsits fancies so childlike and feelings so intensehad fallen again and my words brought no response except a return of that troubled look to her face  silent still i said talk to me then of your mother rima do you know that you will see her again some day  yes when i die that is what the priest said  the priest  yes at voado you know mother died there when i was smallit is so far away and there are thirteen houses by the side of the riverjust here and on this sidetrees trees  this was important i thought and would lead to the very knowledge i wished for so i pressed her to tell me more about the settlement she had named and of which i had never heard  everything have i told you she returned surprised that i did not know that she had exhausted the subject in those halfdozen words she had spoken  obliged to shift my ground i said at a venture tell me what do you ask of the virgin mother when you kneel before her picture your grandfather told me that you had a picture in your little room  you know flashed out her answer with something like resentment  it is all there in there waving her hand towards the hut out here in the wood it is all gonelike this and stooping quickly she raised a little yellow sand on her palm then let it run away through her fingers  thus she illustrated how all the matters she had been taught slipped from her mind when she was out of doors out of sight of the picture after an interval she added only mother is herealways with me  ah poor rima i said alone without a mother and only your old grandfather he is oldwhat will you do when he dies and flies away to the starry country where your mother is  she looked inquiringly at me then made answer in a low voice you are here  but when i go away  she was silent and not wishing to dwell on a subject that seemed to pain her i continued yes i am here now but you will not stay with me and talk freely will it always be the same if i remain with you why are you always so silent in the house so cold with your old grandfather so differentso full of life like a bird when you are alone in the woods rima speak to me am i no more to you than your old grandfather do you not like me to talk to you  she appeared strangely disturbed at my words oh you are not like him she suddenly replied sitting all day on a log by the fireall day all day goloso and susio lying beside himsleep sleep oh when i saw you in the wood i followed you and talked and talked still no answer why will you not come when i call to me then mocking my voice rima rima come here do this say that rima rima it is nothing nothingit is not you pointing to my mouth and then as if fearing that her meaning had not been made clear suddenly touching my lips with her finger why do you not answer mespeak to mespeak to me like this and turning a little more towards me and glancing at me with eyes that had all at once changed losing their clouded expression for one of exquisite tenderness from her lips came a succession of those mysterious sounds which had first attracted me to her swift and low and birdlike yet with something so much higher and more soulpenetrating than any birdmusic ah what feeling and fancies what quaint turns of expression unfamiliar to my mind were contained in those sweet wasted symbols i could never knownever come to her when she called or respond to her spirit to me they would always be inarticulate sounds affecting me like a tender spiritual musica language without words suggesting more than words to the soul  the mysterious speech died down to a lisping sound like the faint note of some small bird falling from a cloud of foliage on the topmost bough of a tree and at the same time that new light passed from her eyes and she half averted her face in a disappointed way  rima i said at length a new thought coming to my aid it is true that i am not here touching my lips as she had done and that my words are nothing but look into my eyes and you will see me thereall all that is in my heart  oh i know what i should see there she returned quickly  what would you seetell me  there is a little black ball in the middle of your eye i should see myself in it no bigger than that and she marked off about an eighth of her little fingernail there is a pool in the wood and i look down and see myself there that is better just as large as i amnot small and black like a small small fly and after saying this a little disdainfully she moved away from my side and out into the sunshine and then half turning towards me and glancing first at my face and then upwards she raised her hand to call my attention to something there  far up high as the tops of the tallest trees a great bluewinged butterfly was passing across the open space with loitering flight in a few moments it was gone over the trees then she turned once more to me with a little rippling sound of laughterthe first i had heard from her and called come come  i was glad enough to go with her then and for the next two hours we rambled together in the wood that is together in her way for though always near she contrived to keep out of my sight most of the time she was evidently now in a gay frolicsome temper again and again when i looked closely into some widespreading bush or peered behind a tree when her calling voice had sounded her rippling laughter would come to me from some other spot at length somewhere about the centre of the wood she led me to an immense mora tree growing almost isolated covering with its shade a large space of ground entirely free from undergrowth at this spot she all at once vanished from my side and after listening and watching some time in vain i sat down beside the giant trunk to wait for her very soon i heard a low warbling sound which seemed quite near  rima rima i called and instantly my call was repeated like an echo again and again i called and still the words flew back to me and i could not decide whether it was an echo or not then i gave up calling and presently the low warbling sound was repeated and i knew that rima was somewhere near me  rima where are you i called  rima where are you came the answer  you are behind the tree  you are behind the tree  i shall catch you rima and this time instead of repeating my words she answered oh no  i jumped up and ran round the tree feeling sure that i should find her it was about thirtyfive or forty feet in circumference and after going round two or three times i turned and ran the other way but failing to catch a glimpse of her i at last sat down again  rima rima sounded the mocking voice as soon as i had sat down where are you rima i shall catch you rima have you caught rima  no i have not caught her there is no rima now she has faded away like a rainbowlike a drop of dew in the sun i have lost her i shall go to sleep and stretching myself out at full length under the tree i remained quiet for two or three minutes then a slight rustling sound was heard and i looked eagerly round for her but the sound was overhead and caused by a great avalanche of leaves which began to descend on me from that vast leafy canopy above  ah little spidermonkeylittle green treesnakeyou are there but there was no seeing her in that immense aerial palace hung with dim drapery of green and coppercoloured leaves but how had she got there up the stupendous trunk even a monkey could not have climbed and there were no lianas dropping to earth from the wide horizontal branches that i could see but by and by looking further away i perceived that on one side the longest lower branches reached and mingled with the shorter boughs of the neighbouring trees while gazing up i heard her low rippling laugh and then caught sight of her as she ran along an exposed horizontal branch erect on her feet and my heart stood still with terror for she was fifty to sixty feet above the ground in another moment she vanished from sight in a cloud of foliage and i saw no more of her for about ten minutes when all at once she appeared at my side once more having come round the trunk of the mora her face had a bright pleased expression and showed no trace of fatigue or agitation  i caught her hand in mine it was a delicate shapely little hand soft as velvet and warma real human hand only now when i held it did she seem altogether like a human being and not a mocking spirit of the wood a daughter of the didi  do you like me to hold your hand rima  yes she replied with indifference  is it i  yes this time as if it was small satisfaction to make acquaintance with this purely physical part of me  having her so close gave me an opportunity of examining that light sheeny garment she wore always in the woods it felt soft and satiny to the touch and there was no seam nor hem in it that i could see but it was all in one piece like the cocoon of the caterpillar while i was feeling it on her shoulder and looking narrowly at it she glanced at me with a mocking laugh in her eyes  is it silk i asked then as she remained silent i continued where did you get this dress rima did you make it yourself tell me  she answered not in words but in response to my question a new look came into her face no longer restless and full of change in her expression she was now as immovable as an alabaster statue not a silken hair on her head trembled her eyes were wide open gazing fixedly before her and when i looked into them they seemed to see and yet not to see me they were like the clear brilliant eyes of a bird which reflect as in a miraculous mirror all the visible world but do not return our look and seem to see us merely as one of the thousand small details that make up the whole picture suddenly she darted out her hand like a flash making me start at the unexpected motion and quickly withdrawing it held up a finger before me from its tip a minute gossamer spider about twice the bigness of a pins head appeared suspended from a fine scarcely visible line three or four inches long  look she exclaimed with a bright glance at my face  the small spider she had captured anxious to be free was falling falling earthward but could not reach the surface leaning her shoulder a little forward she placed the fingertip against it but lightly scarcely touching and moving continuously with a motion rapid as that of a fluttering moths wing while the spider still paying out his line remained suspended rising and falling slightly at nearly the same distance from the ground after a few moments she cried drop down little spider her fingers motion ceased and the minute captive fell to lose itself on the shaded ground  do you not see she said to me pointing to her shoulder just where the fingertip had touched the garment a round shining spot appeared looking like a silver coin on the cloth but on touching it with my finger it seemed part of the original fabric only whiter and more shiny on the grey ground on account of the freshness of the web of which it had just been made  and so all this curious and pretty performance which seemed instinctive in its spontaneous quickness and dexterity was merely intended to show me how she made her garments out of the fine floating lines of small gossamer spiders  before i could express my surprise and admiration she cried again with startling suddenness look  a minute shadowy form darted by appearing like a dim line traced across the deep glossy more foliage then on the lighter green foliage further away she waved her hand in imitation of its swift curving flight then dropping it exclaimed goneoh little thing  what was it i asked for it might have been a bird a birdlike moth or a bee  did you not see and you asked me to look into your eyes  ah little squirrel sakawinki you remind me of that i said passing my arm round her waist and drawing her a little closer look into my eyes now and see if i am blind and if there is nothing in them except an image of rima like a small small fly  she shook her head and laughed a little mockingly but made no effort to escape from my arm  would you like me always to do what you wish rimato follow you in the woods when you say cometo chase you round the tree to catch you and lie down for you to throw leaves on me and to be glad when you are glad  oh yes  then let us make a compact i shall do everything to please you and you must promise to do everything to please me  tell me  little things rimanone so hard as chasing you round a tree only to have you stand or sit by me and talk will make me happy and to begin you must call me by my nameabel  is that your name oh not your real name abel abelwhat is that it says nothing i have called you by so many namestwenty thirtyand no answer  have you but dearest girl every person has a name one name he is called by your name for instance is rima is it not  rima only rimato you in the morning in the evening now in this place and in a little while where know i  in the night when you wake and it is dark dark and you see me all the same only rimaoh how strange  what else sweet girl your grandfather nuflo calls you rima  nuflo she spoke as if putting a question to herself is that an old man with two dogs that lives somewhere in the wood and then with sudden petulance and you ask me to talk to you  oh rima what can i say to you listen  no no she exclaimed quickly turning and putting her fingers on my mouth to stop my speech while a sudden merry look shone in her eyes you shall listen when i speak and do all i say and tell me what to do to please you with your eyeslet me look in your eyes that are not blind  she turned her face more towards me and with head a little thrown back and inclined to one side gazing now full into my eyes as i had wished her to do after a few moments she glanced away to the distant trees but i could see into those divine orbs and knew that she was not looking at any particular object all the evervarying expressionsinquisitive petulant troubled shy frolicsome had now vanished from the still face and the look was inward and full of a strange exquisite light as if some new happiness or hope had touched her spirit  sinking my voice to a whisper i said tell me what you have seen in my eyes rima  she murmured in reply something melodious and inarticulate then glanced at my face in a questioning way but only for a moment then her sweet eyes were again veiled under those drooping lashes  listen rima i said was that a hummingbird we saw a little while ago you are like that now dark a shadow in the shadow seen for an instant and thengone oh little thing and now in the sunshine standing still how beautifula thousand times more beautiful than the hummingbird listen rima you are like all beautiful things in the woodflower and bird and butterfly and green leaf and frond and little silkyhaired monkey high up in the trees when i look at you i see them allall and more a thousand times for i see rima herself and when i listen to rimas voice talking in a language i cannot understand i hear the wind whispering in the leaves the gurgling running water the bee among the flowers the organbird singing far far away in the shadows of the trees i hear them all and more for i hear rima do you understand me now is it i speaking to youhave i answered youhave i come to you  she glanced at me again her lips trembling her eyes now clouded with some secret trouble yes she replied in a whisper and then no it is not you and after a moment doubtfully is it you  but she did not wait to be answered in a moment she was gone round the more nor would she return again for all my calling    chapter ix  that afternoon with rima in the forest under the mora tree had proved so delightful that i was eager for more rambles and talks with her but the variable little witch had a great surprise in store for me all her wild natural gaiety had unaccountably gone out of her when i walked in the shade she was there but no longer as the blithe fantastic being bright as an angel innocent and affectionate as a child tricksy as a monkey that had played at hideandseek with me she was now my shy silent attendant only occasionally visible and appearing then like the mysterious maid i had found reclining among the ferns who had melted away mistlike from sight as i gazed when i called she would not now answer as formerly but in response would appear in sight as if to assure me that i had not been forsaken and after a few moments her grey shadowy form would once more vanish among the trees the hope that as her confidence increased and she grew accustomed to talk with me she would be brought to reveal the story of her life had to be abandoned at all events for the present i must after all get my information from nuflo or rest in ignorance the old man was out for the greater part of each day with his dogs and from these expeditions he brought back nothing that i could see but a few nuts and fruits some thin bark for his cigarettes and an occasional handful of haima gum to perfume the hut of an evening after i had wasted three days in vainly trying to overcome the girls now inexplicable shyness i resolved to give for a while my undivided attention to her grandfather to discover if possible where he went and how he spent his time  my new game of hideandseek with nuflo instead of with rima began on the following morning he was cunning so was i going out and concealing myself among the bushes i began to watch the hut that i could elude rimas keener eyes i doubted but that did not trouble me she was not in harmony with the old man and would do nothing to defeat my plan i had not been long in my hidingplace before he came out followed by his two dogs and going to some distance from the door he sat down on a log for some minutes he smoked then rose and after looking cautiously round slipped away among the trees i saw that he was going off in the direction of the low range of rocky hills south of the forest i knew that the forest did not extend far in that direction and thinking that i should be able to catch a sight of him on its borders i left the bushes and ran through the trees as fast as i could to get ahead of him coming to where the wood was very open i found that a barren plain beyond it a quarter of a mile wide separated it from the range of hills thinking that the old man might cross this open space i climbed into a tree to watch after some time he appeared walking rapidly among the trees the dogs at his heels but not going towards the open plain he had it seemed after arriving at the edge of the wood changed his direction and was going west still keeping in the shelter of the trees when he had been gone about five minutes i dropped to the ground and started in pursuit once more i caught sight of him through the trees and i kept him in sight for about twenty minutes longer then he came to a broad strip of dense wood which extended into and through the range of hills and here i quickly lost him hoping still to overtake him i pushed on but after struggling through the underwood for some distance and finding the forest growing more difficult as i progressed i at last gave him up turning eastward i got out of the wood to find myself at the foot of a steep rough hill one of the range which the wooded valley cut through at right angles it struck me that it would be a good plan to climb the hill to get a view of the forest belt in which i had lost the old man and after walking a short distance i found a spot which allowed of an ascent the summit of the hill was about three hundred feet above the surrounding level and did not take me long to reach it commanded a fair view and i now saw that the belt of wood beneath me extended right through the range and on the south side opened out into an extensive forest if that is your destination thought i old fox your secrets are safe from me  it was still early in the day and a slight breeze tempered the air and made it cool and pleasant on the hilltop after my exertions my scramble through the wood had fatigued me somewhat and resolving to spend some hours on that spot i looked round for a comfortable restingplace i soon found a shady spot on the west side of an upright block of stone where i could recline at ease on a bed of lichen here with shoulders resting against the rock i sat thinking of rima alone in her wood today with just a tinge of bitterness in my thoughts which made me hope that she would miss me as much as i missed her and in the end i fell asleep  when i woke it was past noon and the sun was shining directly on me standing up to gaze once more on the prospect i noticed a small wreath of white smoke issuing from a spot about the middle of the forest belt beneath me and i instantly divined that nuflo had made a fire at that place and i resolved to surprise him in his retreat when i got down to the base of the hill the smoke could no longer be seen but i had studied the spot well from above and had singled out a large clump of trees on the edge of the belt as a startingpoint and after a search of half an hour i succeeded in finding the old mans hidingplace first i saw smoke again through an opening in the trees then a small rude hut of sticks and palm leaves approaching cautiously i peered through a crack and discovered old nuflo engaged in smoking some meat over a fire and at the same time grilling some bones on the coals he had captured a coatimundi an animal somewhat larger than a tame tomcat with a long snout and long ringed tail one of the dogs was gnawing at the animals head and the tail and the feet were also lying on the floor among the old bones and rubbish that littered it stealing round i suddenly presented myself at the opening to his den when the dogs rose up with a growl and nuflo instantly leaped to his feet knife in hand  aha old man i cried with a laugh i have found you at one of your vegetarian repasts and your grasseating dogs as well  he was disconcerted and suspicious but when i explained that i had seen a smoke while on the hills where i had gone to search for a curious blue flower which grew in such places and had made my way to it to discover the cause he recovered confidence and invited me to join him at his dinner of roast meat  i was hungry by this time and not sorry to get animal food once more nevertheless i ate this meat with some disgust as it had a rank taste and smell and it was also unpleasant to have those evillooking dogs savagely gnawing at the animals head and feet at the same time  you see said the old hypocrite wiping the grease from his moustache this is what i am compelled to do in order to avoid giving offence my granddaughter is a strange being sir as you have perhaps observed  that reminds me i interrupted that i wish you to relate her history to me she is as you say strange and has speech and faculties unlike ours which shows that she comes of a different race  no no her faculties are not different from ours they are sharper that is all it pleases the allpowerful to give more to some than to others not all the fingers on the hand are alike you will find a man who will take up a guitar and make it speak while i  all that i understand i broke in again but her origin her historythat is what i wish to hear  and that sir is precisely what i am about to relate poor child she was left on my hands by her sainted mothermy daughter sirwho perished young now her birthplace where she was taught letters and the catechism by the priest was in an unhealthy situation it was hot and wetalways weta place suited to frogs rather than to human beings at length thinking that it would suit the child betterfor she was pale and weaklyto live in a drier atmosphere among mountains i brought her to this district for this senor and for all i have done for her i look for no reward here but to that place where my daughter has got her foot not sir on the threshold as you might think but well inside for after all it is to the authorities above in spite of some blots which we see in their administration that we must look for justice frankly sir this is the whole story of my granddaughters origin  ah yes i returned your story explains why she can call a wild bird to her hand and touch a venomous serpent with her bare foot and receive no harm  doubtless you are right said the old dissembler living alone in the wood she had only gods creatures to play and make friends with and wild animals i have heard it said know those who are friendly towards them  you treat her friends badly said i kicking the long tail of the coatimundi away with my foot and regretting that i had joined in his repast  senor you must consider that we are only what heaven made us when all this was formed he continued opening his arms wide to indicate the entire creation the person who concerned himself with this matter gave seeds and fruitless and nectar of flowers for the sustentation of his small birds but we have not their delicate appetites the more robust stomach which he gave to man cries out for meat do you understand but of all this friend not one word to rima  i laughed scornfully do you think me such a child old man as to believe that rima that little sprite does not know that you are an eater of flesh rima who is everywhere in the wood seeing all things even if i lift my hand against a serpent she herself unseen  but sir if you will pardon my presumption you are saying too much she does not come here and therefore cannot see that i eat meat in all that wood where she flourishes and sings where she is in her house and garden and mistress of the creatures even of the small butterfly with painted wings there sir i hunt no animal nor will my dogs chase any animal there that is what i meant when i said that if an animal should stumble against their legs they would lift up their noses and pass on without seeing it for in that wood there is one law the law that rima imposes and outside of it a different law  i am glad that you have told me this i replied the thought that rima might be near and unseen herself look in upon us feeding with the dogs and like dogs on flesh was one which greatly troubled my mind  he glanced at me in his usual quick cunning way  ah senor you have that feeling tooafter so short a time with us consider then what it must be for me unable to nourish myself on gums and fruitlets and that little sweetness made by wasps out of flowers when i am compelled to go far away and eat secretly to avoid giving offence  it was hard no doubt but i did not pity him secretly i could only feel anger against him for refusing to enlighten me while making such a presence of openness and i also felt disgusted with myself for having joined him in his rank repast but dissimulation was necessary and so after conversing a little more on indifferent topics and thanking him for his hospitality i left him alone to go on with his smoky task  on my way back to the lodge fearing that some taint of nuflos evilsmelling den and dinner might still cling to me i turned aside to where a streamlet in the wood widened and formed a deep pool to take a plunge in the water after drying myself in the air and thoroughly ventilating my garments by shaking and beating them i found an open shady spot in the wood and threw myself on the grass to wait for evening before returning to the house by that time the sweet warm air would have purified me besides i did not consider that i had sufficiently punished rima for her treatment of me she would be anxious for my safety perhaps even looking for me everywhere in the wood it was not much to make her suffer one day after she had made me miserable for three and perhaps when she discovered that i could exist without her society she would begin to treat me less capriciously  so ran my thoughts as i rested on the warm ground gazing up into the foliage green as young grass in the lower shady parts and above luminous with the bright sunlight and full of the murmuring sounds of insect life my every action word thought had my feeling for rima as a motive why i began to ask myself was rima so much to me it was easy to answer that question because nothing so exquisite had ever been created all the separate and fragmentary beauty and melody and graceful motion found scattered throughout nature were concentrated and harmoniously combined in her how various how luminous how divine she was a being for the mind to marvel at to admire continually finding some new grace and charm every hour every moment to add to the old and there was besides the fascinating mystery surrounding her origin to arouse and keep my interest in her continually active  that was the easy answer i returned to the question i had asked myself but i knew that there was another answera reason more powerful than the first and i could no longer thrust it back or hide its shining face with the dull leaden mask of mere intellectual curiosity because i loved her loved her as i had never loved before never could love any other being with a passion which had caught something of her own brilliance and intensity making a former passion look dim and commonplace in comparisona feeling known to everyone something old and worn out a weariness even to think of  from these reflections i was roused by the plaintive threesyllable call of an evening birda nightjar common in these woods and was surprised to find that the sun had set and the woods already shadowed with the twilight i started up and began hurriedly walking homewards thinking of rima and was consumed with impatience to see her and as i drew near to the house walking along a narrow path which i knew i suddenly met her face to face doubtless she had heard my approach and instead of shrinking out of the path and allowing me to pass on without seeing her as she would have done on the previous day she had sprung forward to meet me i was struck with wonder at the change in her as she came with a swift easy motion like a flying bird her hands outstretched as if to clasp mine her lips parted in a radiant welcoming smile her eyes sparkling with joy  i started forward to meet her but had no sooner touched her hands than her countenance changed and she shrunk back trembling as if the touch had chilled her warm blood and moving some feet away she stood with downcast eyes pale and sorrowful as she had seemed yesterday in vain i implored her to tell me the cause of this change and of the trouble she evidently felt her lips trembled as if with speech but she made no reply and only shrunk further away when i attempted to approach her and at length moving aside from the path she was lost to sight in the dusky leafage  i went on alone and sat outside for some time until old nuflo returned from his hunting and only after he had gone in and had made the fire burn up did rima make her appearance silent and constrained as ever    chapter x  on the following day rima continued in the same inexplicable humour and feeling my defeat keenly i determined once more to try the effect of absence on her and to remain away on this occasion for a longer period like old nuflo i was secret in going forth next morning waiting until the girl was out of the way then slipping off among the bushes into the deeper wood and finally quitting its shelter i set out across the savannah towards my old quarters great was my surprise on arriving at the village to find no person there at first i imagined that my disappearance in the forest of evil fame had caused them to abandon their home in a panic but on looking round i concluded that my friends had only gone on one of their periodical visits to some neighbouring village for when these indians visit their neighbours they do it in a very thorough manner they all go taking with them their entire stock of provisions their cooking utensils weapons hammocks and even their pet animals fortunately in this case they had not taken quite everything my hammock was there also one small pot some cassava bread purple potatoes and a few ears of maize i concluded that these had been left for me in the event of my return also that they had not been gone very many hours since a log of wood buried under the ashes of the hearth was still alight now as their absences from home usually last many days it was plain that i would have the big naked barnlike house to myself for as long as i thought proper to remain with little food to eat but the prospect did not disturb me and i resolved to amuse myself with music in vain i hunted for my guitar the indians had taken it to delight their friends by twanging its strings at odd moments during the last day or two i had been composing a simple melody in my brain fitting it to ancient words and now without an instrument to assist me i began softly singing to myself      muy mas clara que la luna     sola una     en el mundo vos nacistes  after music i made up the fire and parched an ear of maize for my dinner and while laboriously crunching the dry hard grain i thanked heaven for having bestowed on me such good molars finally i slung my hammock in its old corner and placing myself in it in my favourite oblique position my hands clasped behind my head one knee cocked up the other leg dangling down i resigned myself to idle thought i felt very happy how strange thought i with a little selfflattery that i accustomed to the agreeable society of intelligent men and charming women and of books should find such perfect contentment here but i congratulated myself too soon the profound silence began at length to oppress me it was not like the forest where one has wild birds for company where their cries albeit inarticulate have a meaning and give a charm to solitude even the sight and whispered sounds of green leaves and rushes trembling in the wind have for us something of intelligence and sympathy but i could not commune with mud walls and an earthen pot feeling my loneliness too acutely i began to regret that i had left rima then to feel remorse at the secrecy i had practiced even now while i inclined idly in my hammock she would be roaming the forest in search of me listening for my footsteps fearing perhaps that i had met with some accident where there was no person to succour me it was painful to think of her in this way of the pain i had doubtless given her by stealing off without a word of warning springing to the floor i flung out of the house and went down to the stream it was better there for now the greatest heat of the day was over and the weltering sun began to look large and red and rayless through the afternoon haze  i seated myself on a stone within a yard or two of the limpid water and now the sight of nature and the warm vital air and sunshine infected my spirit and made it possible for me to face the position calmly even hopefully the position was this for some days the idea had been present in my mind and was now fixed there that this desert was to be my permanent home the thought of going back to caracas that little paris in america with its old world vices its idle political passions its empty round of gaieties was unendurable i was changed and this changeso great so completewas proof that the old artificial life had not been and could not be the real one in harmony with my deeper and truer nature i deceived myself you will say as i have often myself said i had and i had not it is too long a question to discuss here but just then i felt that i had quitted the hot tainted atmosphere of the ballroom that the morning air of heaven refreshed and elevated me and was sweet to breathe friends and relations i had who were dear to me but i could forget them even as i could forget the splendid dreams which had been mine and the woman i had loved and who perhaps loved me in returni could forget her too a daughter of civilization and of that artificial life she could never experience such feelings as these and return to nature as i was doing for women though within narrow limits more plastic than men are yet without that larger adaptiveness which can take us back to the sources of life which they have left eternally behind better far better for both of us that she should wait through the long slow months growing sick at heart with hope deferred that seeing me no more she should weep my loss and be healed at last by time and find love and happiness again in the old way in the old place  and while i thus sat thinking sadly enough but not despondingly of past and present and future all at once on the warm still air came the resonant farreaching klingklang of the campanero from some leafy summit half a league away klingklang fell the sound again and often again at intervals affecting me strangely at that moment so belllike so like the great widetravelling sounds associated in our minds with christian worship and yet so unlike a bell yet not made of gross metal dug out of earth but of an ethereal sublimer material that floats impalpable and invisible in spacea vital bell suspended on nothing giving out sounds in harmony with the vastness of blue heaven the unsullied purity of nature the glory of the sun and conveying a mystic a higher message to the soul than the sounds that surge from tower and belfry  o mystic bellbird of the heavenly race of the swallow and dove the quetzal and the nightingale when the brutish savage and the brutish white man that slay thee one for food the other for the benefit of science shall have passed away live still live to tell thy message to the blameless spiritualized race that shall come after us to possess the earth not for a thousand years but for ever for how much shall thy voice be our clarified successors when even to my dull unpurged soul thou canst speak such high things and bring it a sense of an impersonal allcompromising one who is in me and i in him flesh of his flesh and soul of his soul  the sounds ceased but i was still in that exalted mood and like a person in a trance staring fixedly before me into the open wood of scattered dwarf trees on the other side of the stream when suddenly on the field of vision appeared a grotesque human figure moving towards me i started violently astonished and a little alarmed but in a very few moments i recognized the ancient clacla coming home with a large bundle of dry sticks on her shoulders bent almost double under the burden and still ignorant of my presence slowly she came down to the stream then cautiously made her way over the line of steppingstones by which it was crossed and only when within ten yards did the old creature catch sight of me sitting silent and motionless in her path with a sharp cry of amazement and terror she straightened herself up the bundle of sticks dropping to the ground and turned to run from me that at all events seemed her intention for her body was thrown forward and her head and arms working like those of a person going at full speed but her legs seemed paralysed and her feet remained planted on the same spot i burst out laughing whereat she twisted her neck until her wrinkled brown old face appeared over her shoulder staring at me this made me laugh again whereupon she straightened herself up once more and turned round to have a good look at me  come clacla i cried can you not see that i am a living man and no spirit i thought no one had remained behind to keep me company and give me food why are you not with the others  ah why she returned tragically and then deliberately turning from me and assuming a most unladylike attitude she slapped herself vigorously on the small of the back exclaiming because of my pain here  as she continued in that position with her back towards me for some time i laughed once more and begged her to explain  slowly she turned round and advanced cautiously towards me staring at me all the time finally still eyeing me suspiciously she related that the others had all gone on a visit to a distant village she starting with them that after going some distance a pain had attacked her in her hind quarters so sudden and acute that it had instantly brought her to a full stop and to illustrate how full the stop was she allowed herself to go down very unnecessarily with a flop to the ground but she no sooner touched the ground than up she started to her feet again with an alarmed look on her owlish face as if she had sat down on a stingingnettle  we thought you were dead she remarked still thinking that i might be a ghost after all  no still alive i said and so because you came to the ground with your pain they left you behind well never mind clacla we are two now and must try to be happy together  by this time she had recovered from her fear and began to feel highly pleased at my return only lamenting that she had no meat to give me she was anxious to hear my adventures and the reason of my long absence i had no wish to gratify her curiosity with the truth at all events knowing very well that with regard to the daughter of the didi her feelings were as purely savage and malignant as those of kuako but it was necessary to say something and fortifying myself with the good old spanish notion that lies told to the heathen are not recorded i related that a venomous serpent had bitten me after which a terrible thunderstorm had surprised me in the forest and night coming on prevented my escape from it then next day remembering that he who is bitten by a serpent dies and not wishing to distress my friends with the sight of my dissolution i elected to remain sitting there in the wood amusing myself by singing songs and smoking cigarettes and after several days and nights had gone by finding that i was not going to die after all and beginning to feel hungry i got up and came back  old clacla looked very serious shaking and nodding her head a great deal muttering to herself finally she gave it as her opinion that nothing ever would or could kill me but whether my story had been believed or not she only knew  i spent an amusing evening with my old savage hostess she had thrown off her ailments and pleased at having a companion in her dreary solitude she was goodtempered and talkative and much more inclined to laugh than when the others were present when she was on her dignity  we sat by the fire cooking such food as we had and talked and smoked then i sang her songs in spanish with that melody of my own      muy mas clara que la luna  and she rewarded me by emitting a barbarous chant in a shrill screechy voice and finally starting up i danced for her benefit polka mazurka and valse whistling and singing to my motions  more than once during the evening she tried to introduce serious subjects telling me that i must always live with them learn to shoot the birds and catch the fishes and have a wife and then she would speak of her granddaughter oalava whose virtues it was proper to mention but whose physical charms needed no description since they had never been concealed each time she got on this topic i cut her short vowing that if i ever married she only should be my wife she informed me that she was old and past her fruitful period that not much longer would she make cassava bread and blow the fire to a flame with her wheezy old bellows and talk the men to sleep at night but i stuck to it that she was young and beautiful that our descendants would be more numerous than the birds in the forest i went out to some bushes close by where i had noticed a passion plant in bloom and gathering a few splendid scarlet blossoms with their stems and leaves i brought them in and wove them into a garland for the old dames head then i pulled her up in spite of screams and struggles and waltzed her wildly to the other end of the room and back again to her seat beside the fire and as she sat there panting and grinning with laughter i knelt before her and with suitable passionate gestures declaimed again the old delicate lines sung by mena before columbus sailed the seas      muy mas clara que la luna     sola una     en el mundo vos nacistes     tan gentil que no vecistes     ni tavistes     competedora ninguna     desdi ninez en la cuna     cobrastes fama beldad con tanta graciosidad     que vos doto la fortuna  thinking of another all the time o poor old clacla knowing not what the jingle meant nor the secret of my wild happiness now when i recall you sitting there your old grey owlish head crowned with scarlet passion flowers flushed with firelight against the background of smokeblackened walls and rafters how the old undying sorrow comes back to me  thus our evening was spent merrily enough then we made up the fire with hard wood that would last all night and went to our hammocks but wakeful still the old dame glad and proud to be on duty once more religiously went to work to talk me to sleep but although i called out at intervals to encourage her to go on i did not attempt to follow the ancient tales she told which she had imbibed in childhood from other whiteheaded grandmothers long long turned to dust my own brain was busy thinking thinking thinking now of the woman i had once loved far away in venezuela waiting and weeping and sick with hope deferred now of rima wakeful and listening to the mysterious nightsounds of the forestlistening listening for my returning footsteps  next morning i began to waver in my resolution to remain absent from rima for some days and before evening my passion which i had now ceased to struggle against coupled with the thought that i had acted unkindly in leaving her that she would be a prey to anxiety overcame me and i was ready to return the old woman who had been suspiciously watching my movements rushed out after me as i left the house crying out that a storm was brewing that it was too late to go far and night would be full of danger i waved my hand in goodbye laughingly reminding her that i was proof against all perils little she cared what evil might befall me i thought but she loved not to be alone even for her low down as she was intellectually the solitary earthen pot had no mind stuff in it and could not be sent to sleep at night with the legends of long ago  by the time i reached the ridge i had discovered that she had prophesied truly for now an ominous change had come over nature a dull grey vapour had overspread the entire western half of the heavens down beyond the forest the sky looked black as ink and behind this blackness the sun had vanished it was too late to go back now i had been too long absent from rima and could only hope to reach nuflos lodge wet or dry before night closed round me in the forest  for some moments i stood still on the ridge struck by the somewhat weird aspect of the shadowed scene before methe long strip of dull uniform green with here and there a slender palm lifting its feathery crown above the other trees standing motionless in strange relief against the advancing blackness then i set out once more at a run taking advantage of the downward slope to get well on my way before the tempest should burst as i approached the wood there came a flash of lightning pale but covering the whole visible sky followed after a long interval by a distant roll of thunder which lasted several seconds and ended with a succession of deep throbs it was as if nature herself in supreme anguish and abandonment had cast herself prone on the earth and her great heart had throbbed audibly shaking the world with its beats no more thunder followed but the rain was coming down heavily now in huge drops that fell straight through the gloomy windless air in half a minute i was drenched to the skin but for a short time the rain seemed an advantage as the brightness of the falling water lessened the gloom turning the air from dark to lighter grey this subdued rainlight did not last long i had not been twenty minutes in the wood before a second and greater darkness fell on the earth accompanied by an even more copious downpour of water the sun had evidently gone down and the whole sky was now covered with one thick cloud becoming more nervous as the gloom increased i bent my steps more to the south so as to keep near the border and more open part of the wood probably i had already grown confused before deviating and turned the wrong way for instead of finding the forest easier it grew closer and more difficult as i advanced before many minutes the darkness so increased that i could no longer distinguish objects more than five feet from my eyes groping blindly along i became entangled in a dense undergrowth and after struggling and stumbling along for some distance in vain endeavours to get through it i came to a stand at last in sheer despair all sense of direction was now lost i was entombed in thick blacknessblackness of night and cloud and rain and of dripping foliage and network of branches bound with bush ropes and creepers in a wild tangle i had struggled into a hollow or hole as it were in the midst of that mass of vegetation where i could stand upright and turn round and round without touching anything but when i put out my hands they came into contact with vines and bushes to move from that spot seemed folly yet how dreadful to remain there standing on the sodden earth chilled with rain in that awful blackness in which the only luminous thing one could look to see would be the eyes shining with their own internal light of some savage beast of prey yet the danger the intense physical discomfort and the anguish of looking forward to a whole night spent in that situation stung my heart less than the thought of rimas anxiety and of the pain i had carelessly given by secretly leaving her  it was then with that pang in my heart that i was startled by hearing close by one of her own low warbled expressions there could be no mistake if the forest had been full of the sounds of animal life and songs of melodious birds her voice would have been instantly distinguished from all others how mysterious how infinitely tender it sounded in that awful blacknessso musical and exquisitely modulated so sorrowful yet piercing my heart with a sudden unutterable joy  rima rima i cried speak again is it you come to me here  again that low warbling sound or series of sounds seemingly from a distance of a few yards i was not disturbed at her not replying in spanish she had always spoken it somewhat reluctantly and only when at my side but when calling to me from some distance she would return instinctively to her own mysterious language and call to me as bird calls to bird i knew that she was inviting me to follow her but i refused to move  rima i cried again come to me here for i know not where to step and cannot move until you are at my side and i can feel your hand  there came no response and after some moments becoming alarmed i called to her again  then close by me in a low trembling voice she returned i am here  i put out my hand and touched something soft and wet it was her breast and moving my hand higher up i felt her hair hanging now and streaming with water she was trembling and i thought the rain had chilled her  rimapoor child how wet you are how strange to meet you in such a place tell me dear rima how did you find me  i was waitingwatchingall day i saw you coming across the savannah and followed at a distance through the wood  and i had treated you so unkindly ah my guardian angel my light in the darkness how i hate myself for giving you pain tell me sweet did you wish me to come back and live with you again she made no reply then running my fingers down her arm i took her hand in mine it was hot like the hand of one in a fever i raised it to my lips and then attempted to draw her to me but she slipped down and out of my arms to my feet i felt her there on her knees with head bowed low stooping and putting my arm round her body i drew her up and held her against my breast and felt her heart throbbing wildly with many endearing words i begged her to speak to me but her only reply was comecome as she slipped again out of my arms and holding my hand in hers guided me through the bushes  before long we came to an open path or glade where the darkness was not profound and releasing my hand she began walking rapidly before me always keeping at such a distance as just enabled me to distinguish her grey shadowy figure and with frequent doublings to follow the natural paths and openings which she knew so well in this way we kept on nearly to the end without exchanging a word and hearing no sound except the continuous rush of rain which to our accustomed ears had ceased to have the effect of sound and the various gurgling noises of innumerable runners all at once as we came to a more open place a strip of bright firelight appeared before us shining from the halfopen door of nuflos lodge she turned round as much as to say now you know where you are then hurried on leaving me to follow as best i could    chapter xi  there was a welcome change in the weather when i rose early next morning the sky was without cloud and had that purity in its colour and look of infinite distance seen only when the atmosphere is free from vapour the sun had not yet risen but old nuflo was already among the ashes on his hands and knees blowing the embers he had uncovered to a flame then rima appeared only to pass through the room with quick light tread to go out of the door without a word or even a glance at my face the old man after watching at the door for a few minutes turned and began eagerly questioning me about my adventures on the previous evening in reply i related to him how the girl had found me in the forest lost and unable to extricate myself from the tangled undergrowth  he rubbed his hands on his knees and chuckled happy for you senor he said that my granddaughter regards you with such friendly eyes otherwise you might have perished before morning once she was at your side no light whether of sun or moon or lantern was needed nor that small instrument which is said to guide a man aright in the desert even in the darkest nightlet him that can believe such a thing  yes happy for me i returned i am filled with remorse that it was all through my fault that the poor child was exposed to such weather  o senor he cried airily let not that distress you rain and wind and hot suns from which we seek shelter do not harm her she takes no cold and no fever with or without ague  after some further conversation i left him to steal away unobserved on his own account and set out for a ramble in the hope of encountering rima and winning her to talk to me  my quest did not succeed not a glimpse of her delicate shadowy form did i catch among the trees and not one note from her melodious lips came to gladden me at noon i returned to the house where i found food placed ready for me and knew that she had come there during my absence and had not been forgetful of my wants shall i thank you for this i said i ask you for heavenly nectar for the sustentation of the higher winged nature in me and you give me a boiled sweet potato toasted strips of sundried pumpkins and a handful of parched maize rima rima my woodland fairy my sweet saviour why do you yet fear me is it that love struggles in you with repugnance can you discern with clear spiritual eyes the grosser elements in me and hate them or has some false imagination made me appear all dark and evil but too late for your peace after the sweet sickness of love has infected you  but she was not there to answer me and so after a time i went forth again and seated myself listlessly on the root of an old tree not far from the house i had sat there a full hour when all at once rima appeared at my side bending forward she touched my hand but without glancing at my face come with me she said and turning moved swiftly towards the northern extremity of the forest she seemed to take it for granted that i would follow never casting a look behind nor pausing in her rapid walk but i was only too glad to obey and starting up was quickly after her she led me by easy ways familiar to her with many doublings to escape the undergrowth never speaking or pausing until we came out from the thick forest and i found myself for the first time at the foot of the great hill or mountain ytaioa glancing back for a few moments she waved a hand towards the summit and then at once began the ascent here too it seemed all familiar ground to her from below the sides had presented an exceedingly rugged appearancea wild confusion of huge jagged rocks mixed with a tangled vegetation of trees bushes and vines but following her in all her doublings it became easy enough although it fatigued me greatly owing to our rapid pace the hill was conical but i found that it had a flat topan oblong or pearshaped area almost level of a soft crumbly sandstone with a few blocks and boulders of a harder stone scattered aboutand no vegetation except the grey mountain lichen and a few serelooking dwarf shrubs  here rima at a distance of a few yards from me remained standing still for some minutes as if to give me time to recover my breath and i was right glad to sit down on a stone to rest finally she walked slowly to the centre of the level area which was about two acres in extent rising i followed her and climbing on to a huge block of stone began gazing at the wide prospect spread out before me the day was windless and bright with only a few white clouds floating at a great height above and casting travelling shadows over that wild broken country where forest marsh and savannah were only distinguishable by their different colours like the greys and greens and yellows on a map at a great distance the circle of the horizon was broken here and there by mountains but the hills in our neighbourhood were all beneath our feet  after gazing all round for some minutes i jumped down from my stand and leaning against the stone stood watching the girl waiting for her to speak i felt convinced that she had something of the very highest importance to herself to communicate and that only the pressing need of a confidant not nuflo had overcome her shyness of me and i determined to let her take her own time to say it in her own way for a while she continued silent her face averted but her little movements and the way she clasped and unclasped her fingers showed that she was anxious and her mind working suddenly half turning to me she began speaking eagerly and rapidly  do you see she said waving her hand to indicate the whole circuit of earth how large it is look pointing now to mountains in the west those are the vahanasone two threethe highesti can tell you their namesvahanachara chumi aranoa do you see that water it is a river called guaypero from the hills it comes down inaruna is their name and you can see them there in the southfar far and in this way she went on pointing out and naming all the mountains and rivers within sight then she suddenly dropped her hands to her sides and continued that is all because we can see no further but the world is larger than that other mountains other rivers have i not told you of voa on the river voa where i was born where mother died where the priest taught me years years ago all that you cannot see it is so far awayso far  i did not laugh at her simplicity nor did i smile or feel any inclination to smile on the contrary i only experienced a sympathy so keen that it was like pain while watching her clouded face so changeful in its expression yet in all changes so wistful i could not yet form any idea as to what she wished to communicate or to discover but seeing that she paused for a reply i answered the world is so large rima that we can only see a very small portion of it from any one spot look at this and with a stick i had used to aid me in my ascent i traced a circle six or seven inches in circumference on the soft stone and in its centre placed a small pebble this represents the mountain we are standing on i continued touching the pebble and this line encircling it encloses all of the earth we can see from the mountaintop do you understandthe line i have traced is the blue line of the horizon beyond which we cannot see and outside of this little circle is all the flat top of ytaioa representing the world consider then how small a portion of the world we can see from this spot  and do you know it all she returned excitedly all the world waving her hand to indicate the little stone plain all the mountains and rivers and forestsall the people in the world  that would be impossible rima consider how large it is  that does not matter come let us go togetherwe two and grandfatherand see all the world all the mountains and forests and know all the people  you do not know what you are saying rima you might as well say come let us go to the sun and find out everything in it  it is you who do not know what you are saying she retorted with brightening eyes which for a moment glanced full into mine we have no wings like birds to fly to the sun am i not able to walk on the earth and run can i not swim can i not climb every mountain  no you cannot you imagine that all the earth is like this little portion you see but it is not all the same there are great rivers which you cannot cross by swimming mountains you cannot climb forests you cannot penetratedark and inhabited by dangerous beasts and so vast that all this space your eyes look on is a mere speck of earth in comparison  she listened excitedly oh do you know all that she cried with a strangely brightening look and then half turning from me she added with sudden petulance yet only a minute ago you knew nothing of the worldbecause it is so large is anything to be gained by speaking to one who says such contrary things  i explained that i had not contradicted myself that she had not rightly interpreted my words i knew i said something about the principal features of the different countries of the world as for instance the largest mountain ranges and rivers and the cities also something but very little about the tribes of savage men she heard me with impatience which made me speak rapidly in very general terms and to simplify the matter i made the world stand for the continent we were in it seemed idle to go beyond that and her eagerness would not have allowed it  tell me all you know she said the moment i ceased speaking what is thereand thereand there pointing in various directions rivers and foreststhey are nothing to me the villages the tribes the people everywhere tell me for i must know it all  it would take long to tell rima  because you are so slow look how high the sun is speak speak what is there pointing to the north  all that country i said waving my hands from east to west is guayana and so large is it that you could go in this direction or in this travelling for months without seeing the end of guayana still it would be guayana rivers rivers rivers with forests between and other forests and rivers beyond and savage people nations and tribesguahibo aguaricoto ayano maco piaroa quiriquiripo tuparitoshall i name a hundred more it would be useless rima they are all savages and live widely scattered in the forests hunting with bow and arrow and the zabatana consider then how large guayana is  guayanaguayana do i not know all this is guayana but beyond and beyond and beyond is there no end to guayana  yes there northwards it ends at the orinoco a mighty river coming from mighty mountains compared with which ytaioa is like a stone on the ground on which we have sat down to rest you must know that guayana is only a portion a half of our country venezuela look i continued putting my hand round my shoulder to touch the middle of my back there is a groove running down my spine dividing my body into equal parts thus does the great orinoco divide venezuela and on one side of it is all guayana and on the other side the countries or provinces of cumana maturm barcelona bolivar guarico apure and many others i then gave a rapid description of the northern half of the country with its vast llanos covered with herds in one part its plantations of coffee rice and sugarcane in another and its chief towns last of all caracas the gay and opulent little paris in america  this seemed to weary her but the moment i ceased speaking and before i could well moisten my dry lips she demanded to know what came after caracasafter all venezuela  the oceanwater water water i replied  there are no people therein the water only fishes she remarked then suddenly continued why are you silentis venezuela then all the world  the task i had set myself to perform seemed only at its commencement yet thinking how to proceed with it my eyes roved over the level area we were standing on and it struck me that this little irregular plain broad at one end and almost pointed at the other roughly resembled the south american continent in its form  look rima i began here we are on this small pebbleytaioa and this line round it shuts us inwe cannot see beyond now let us imagine that we can see beyondthat we can see the whole flat mountaintop and that you know is the whole world now listen while i tell you of all the countries and principal mountains and rivers and cities of the world  the plan i had now fixed on involved a great deal of walking about and some hard work in moving and setting up stones and tracing boundary and other lines but it gave me pleasure for rima was close by all the time following me from place to place listening to all i said in silence but with keen interest at the broad end of the level summit i marked out venezuela showing by means of a long line how the orinoco divided it and also marking several of the greater streams flowing into it i also marked the sites of caracas and other large towns with stones and rejoiced that we are not like the europeans great citybuilders for the stones proved heavy to lift then followed colombia and ecuador on the west and successively bolivia peru chile ending at last in the south with patagonia a cold arid land bleak and desolate i marked the littoral cities as we progressed on that side where earth ends and the pacific ocean begins and infinitude  then in a sudden burst of inspiration i described the cordilleras to herthat worldlong stupendous chain its sea of titicaca and wintry desolate paramo where lie the ruins of tiahuanaco older than thebes i mentioned its principal citiesthose small inflamed or festering pimples that attract much attention from appearing on such a body quito callednot in irony but by its own peoplethe splendid and the magnificent so high above the earth as to appear but a little way removed from heavende quito al cielo as the saying is but of its sublime history its kings and conquerors haymar capac the mighty and huascar and atahualpa the unhappy not one word many wordshow inadequateof the summits white with everlasting snows above itabove this navel of the world above the earth the ocean the darkening tempest the condors flight flamebreathing cotopaxi whose wrathful mutterings are audible two hundred leagues away and chimborazo antisana sarata illimani aconcaguanames of mountains that affect us like the names of gods implacable pachacamac and viracocha whose everlasting granite thrones they are at the last i showed her cuzco the city of the sun and the highest dwellingplace of men on earth  i was carried away by so sublime a theme and remembering that i had no critical hearer i gave free reins to fancy forgetting for the moment that some undiscovered thought or feeling had prompted her questions and while i spoke of the mountains she hung on my words following me closely in my walk her countenance brilliant her frame quivering with excitement  there yet remained to be described all that unimaginable space east of the andes the riverswhat riversthe green plains that are like the seathe illimitable waste of water where there is no landand the forest region the very thought of the amazonian forest made my spirit droop if i could have snatched her up and placed her on the dome of chimborazo she would have looked on an area of ten thousand square miles of earth so vast is the horizon at that elevation and possibly her imagination would have been able to clothe it all with an unbroken forest yet how small a portion this would be of the stupendous wholeof a forest region equal in extent to the whole of europe all loveliness all grace all majesty are there but we cannot see cannot conceivecome away from this vast stage to be occupied in the distant future by millions and myriads of beings like us of upright form the nations that will be born when all the existing dominant races on the globe and the civilizations they represent have perished as utterly as those who sculptured the stones of old tiahuanacofrom this theatre of palms prepared for a drama unlike any which the immortals have yet witnessedi hurried away and then slowly conducted her along the atlantic coast listening to the thunder of its great waves and pausing at intervals to survey some maritime city  never probably since old father noah divided the earth among his sons had so grand a geographical discourse been delivered and having finished i sat down exhausted with my efforts and mopped my brow but glad that my huge task was over and satisfied that i had convinced her of the futility of her wish to see the world for herself  her excitement had passed away by now she was standing a little apart from me her eyes cast down and thoughtful at length she approached me and said waving her hand all round what is beyond the mountains over there beyond the cities on that sidebeyond the world  water only water did i not tell you i returned stoutly for i had of course sunk the isthmus of panama beneath the sea   water all round she persisted  yes  water and no beyond only wateralways water  i could no longer adhere to so gross a lie she was too intelligent and i loved her too much standing up i pointed to distant mountains and isolated peaks  look at those peaks i said it is like that with the worldthis world we are standing on beyond that great water that flows all round the world but far away so far that it would take months in a big boat to reach them there are islands some small others as large as this world but rima they are so far away so impossible to reach that it is useless to speak or to think of them they are to us like the sun and moon and stars to which we cannot fly and now sit down and rest by my side for you know everything  she glanced at me with troubled eyes  nothing do i knownothing have you told me did i not say that mountains and rivers and forests are nothing tell me about all the people in the world look there is cuzco over there a city like no other in the worlddid you not tell me so of the people nothing are they also different from all others in the world  i will tell you that if you will first answer me one question rima  she drew a little nearer curious to hear but was silent  promise that you will answer me i persisted and as she continued silent i added shall i not ask you then  say she murmured  why do you wish to know about the people of cuzco  she flashed a look at me then averted her face for some moments she stood hesitating then coming closer touched me on the shoulder and said softly turn away do not look at me  i obeyed and bending so close that i felt her warm breath on my neck she whispered are the people in cuzco like me would they understand methe things you cannot understand do you know  her tremulous voice betrayed her agitation and her words i imagined revealed the motive of her action in bringing me to the summit of ytaioa and of her desire to visit and know all the various peoples inhabiting the world she had begun to realize after knowing me her isolation and unlikeness to others and at the same time to dream that all human beings might not be unlike her and unable to understand her mysterious speech and to enter into her thoughts and feelings  i can answer that question rima i said ah no poor child there are none there like younot one not one of all therepriests soldiers merchants workmen white black red and mixed men and women old and young rich and poor ugly and beautifulnot one would understand the sweet language you speak  she said nothing and glancing round i discovered that she was walking away her fingers clasped before her her eyes cast down and looking profoundly dejected jumping up i hurried after her listen i said coming to her side do you know that there are others in the world like you who would understand your speech  oh do i not yesmother told me i was young when you died but o mother why did you not tell me more  but where  oh do you not think that i would go to them if i knewthat i would ask  does nuflo know  she shook her head walking dejectedly along  but have you asked him i persisted  have i not not oncenot a hundred times  suddenly she paused look she said now we are standing in guayana again and over there in brazil and up there towards the cordilleras it is unknown and there are people there come let us go and seek for my mothers people in that place with grandfather but not the dogs they would frighten the animals and betray us by barking to cruel men who would slay us with poisoned arrows  o rima can you not understand it is too far and your grandfather poor old man would die of weariness and hunger and old age in some strange forest  would he dieold grandfather then we could cover him up with palm leaves in the forest and leave him it would not be grandfather only his body that must turn to dust he would be awayaway where the stars are we should not die but go on and on and on  to continue the discussion seemed hopeless i was silent thinking of what i had heardthat there were others like her somewhere in that vast green world so much of it imperfectly known so many districts never yet explored by white men true it was strange that no report of such a race had reached the ears of any traveller yet here was rima herself at my side a living proof that such a race did exist nuflo probably knew more than he would say i had failed as we have seen to win the secret from him by fair means and could not have recourse to foulthe rack and thumbscrewto wring it from him to the indians she was only an object of superstitious feara daughter of the didiand to them nothing of her origin was known and she poor girl had only a vague remembrance of a few words heard in childhood from her mother and probably not rightly understood  while these thoughts had been passing through my mind rima had been standing silent by waiting perhaps for an answer to her last words then stooping she picked up a small pebble and tossed it three or four yards away  do you see where it fell she cried turning towards me that is on the border of guayanais it not let us go there first  rima how you distress me we cannot go there it is all a savage wilderness almost unknown to mena blank on the map  the mapspeak no word that i do not understand  in a very few words i explained my meaning even fewer would have sufficed so quick was her apprehension  if it is a blank she returned quickly then you know of nothing to stop usno river we cannot swim and no great mountains like those where quito is  but i happen to know rima for it has been related to me by old indians that of all places that is the most difficult of access there is a river there and although it is not on the map it would prove more impassable to us than the mighty orinoco and amazon it has vast malarious swamps on its borders overgrown with dense forest teeming with savage and venomous animals so that even the indians dare not venture near it and even before the river is reached there is a range of precipitous mountains called by the same namejust there where your pebble fellthe mountains of riolama  hardly had the name fallen from my lips before a change swift as lightning came over her countenance all doubt anxiety petulance hope and despondence and these in evervarying degrees chasing each other like shadows had vanished and she was instinct and burning with some new powerful emotion which had flashed into her soul  riolama riolama she repeated so rapidly and in a tone so sharp that it tingled in the brain that is the place i am seeking there was my mother foundthere are her people and mine therefore was i called riolamathat is my name  rima i returned astonished at her words  no no noriolama when i was a child and the priest baptized me he named me riolamathe place where my mother was found but it was long to say and they called me rima  suddenly she became still and then cried in a ringing voice  and he knew it all alongthat old manhe knew that riolama was nearonly there where the pebble fellthat we could go there  while speaking she turned towards her home pointing with raised hand her whole appearance now reminded me of that first meeting with her when the serpent bit me the soft red of her irides shone like fire her delicate skin seemed to glow with an intense rose colour and her frame trembled with her agitation so that her loose cloud of hair was in motion as if blown through by the wind  traitor traitor she cried still looking homewards and using quick passionate gestures it was all known to you and you deceived me all these years even to me rima you lied with your lips oh horrible was there ever such a scandal known in guayana come follow me let us go at once to riolama and without so much as casting a glance behind to see whether i followed or no she hurried away and in a couple of minutes disappeared from sight over the edge of the flat summit rima rima come back and listen to me oh you are mad come back come back  but she would not return or pause and listen and looking after her i saw her bounding down the rocky slope like some wild agile creature possessed of padded hoofs and an infallible instinct and before many minutes she vanished from sight among crabs and trees lower down  nuflo old man said i looking out towards his lodge are there no shooting pains in those old bones of yours to warn you in time of the tempest about to burst on your head  then i sat down to think    chapter xii  to follow impetuous birdlike rima in her descent of the hill would have been impossible nor had i any desire to be a witness of old nuflos discomfiture at the finish it was better to leave them to settle their quarrel themselves while i occupied myself in turning over these fresh facts in my mind to find out how they fitted into the speculative structure i had been building during the last two or three weeks but it soon struck me that it was getting late that the sun would be gone in a couple of hours and at once i began the descent it was not accomplished without some bruises and a good many scratches after a cold draught obtained by putting my lips to a black rock from which the water was trickling i set out on my walk home keeping near the western border of the forest for fear of losing myself i had covered about half the distance from the foot of the hill to nuflos lodge when the sun went down away on my left the evening uproar of the howling monkeys burst out and after three or four minutes ceased the after silence was pierced at intervals by screams of birds going to roost among the trees in the distance and by many minor sounds close at hand of small bird frog and insect the western sky was now like ambercoloured flame and against that immeasurably distant luminous background the near branches and clustered foliage looked black but on my left hand the vegetation still appeared of a uniform dusky green in a little while night would drown all colour and there would be no light but that of the wandering lanternfly always unwelcome to the belated walker in a lonely place since like the ignis fatuus it is confusing to the sight and sense of direction  with increasing anxiety i hastened on when all at once a low growl issuing from the bushes some yards ahead of me brought me to a stop in a moment the dogs susio and goloso rushed out from some hiding place furiously barking but they quickly recognized me and slunk back again relieved from fear i walked on for a short distance then it struck me that the old man must be about somewhere as the dogs scarcely ever stirred from his side turning back i went to the spot where they had appeared to me and there after a while i caught sight of a dim yellow form as one of the brutes rose up to look at me he had been lying on the ground by the side of a widespreading bush dead and dry but overgrown by a creeping plant which had completely covered its broad flat top like a piece of tapestry thrown over a table its slender terminal stems and leaves hanging over the edge like a deep fringe but the fringe did not reach to the ground and under the bush in its dark interior i caught sight of the other dog and after gazing in for some time i also discovered a black recumbent form which i took to be nuflo  what are you doing there old man i cried where is rimahave you not seen her come out  then he stirred himself slowly creeping out on all fours and finally getting free of the dead twigs and leaves he stood up and faced me he had a strange wild look his white beard all disordered moss and dead leaves clinging to it his eyes staring like an owls while his mouth opened and shut the teeth striking together audibly like an angry peccarys after silently glaring at me in this mad way for some moments he burst out cursed be the day when i first saw you man of caracas cursed be the serpent that bit you and had not sufficient power in its venom to kill ha you come from ytaioa where you talked with rima and you have now returned to the tigers den to mock that dangerous animal with the loss of its whelp fool if you did not wish the dogs to feed on your flesh it would have been better if you had taken your evening walk in some other direction  these raging words did not have the effect of alarming me in the least nor even of astonishing me very much albeit up till now the old man had always shown himself suave and respectful his attack did not seem quite spontaneous in spite of the wildness of his manner and the violence of his speech he appeared to be acting a part which he had rehearsed beforehand i was only angry and stepping forward i dealt him a very sharp rap with my knuckles on his chest moderate your language old man i said remember that you are addressing a superior  what do you say to me he screamed in a shrill broken voice accompanying his words with emphatic gestures do you think you are on the pavement of caracas here are no police to protect youhere we are alone in the desert where names and titles are nothing standing man to man  an old man to a young one i returned and in virtue of my youth i am your superior do you wish me to take you by the throat and shake your insolence out of you  what do you threaten me with violence he exclaimed throwing himself into a hostile attitude you the man i saved and sheltered and fed and treated like a son destroyer of my peace have you not injured me enough you have stolen my grandchilds heart from me with a thousand inventions you have driven her mad my child my angel rima my saviour with your lying tongue you have changed her into a demon to persecute me and you are not satisfied but must finish your evil work by inflicting blows on my worn body all all is lost to me take my life if you wish it for now it is worth nothing and i desire not to keep it and here he threw himself on his knees and tearing open his old ragged mantle presented his naked breast to me shoot shoot he screeched and if you have no weapon take my knife and plunge it into this sad heart and let me die and drawing his knife from its sheath he flung it down at my feet  all this performance only served to increase my anger and contempt but before i could make any reply i caught sight of a shadowy object at some distance moving towards ussomething grey and formless gliding swift and noiseless like some great lowflying owl among the trees it was rima and hardly had i seen her before she was with us facing old nuflo her whole frame quivering with passion her wideopen eyes appearing luminous in that dim light  you are here she cried in that quick ringing tone that was almost painful to the sense you thought to escape me to hide yourself from my eyes in the wood miserable do you not know that i have need of youthat i have not finished with you yet do you then wish to be scourged to riolama with thorny twigsto be dragged thither by the beard  he had been staring openmouthed at her still on his knees and holding his mantle open with his skinny hands rima rima have mercy on me he cried out piteously i cannot go to riolama it is so farso far and i am old and should meet my death oh rima child of the woman i saved from death have you no compassion i shall die i shall die  shall you die not until you have shown me the way to riolama and when i have seen riolama with my eyes then you may die and i shall be glad at your death and the children and the grandchildren and cousins and friends of all the animals you have slain and fed on shall know that you are dead and be glad at your death for you have deceived me with lies all these years even meand are not fit to live come now to riolama rise instantly i command you  instead of rising he suddenly put out his hand and snatched up the knife from the ground do you then wish me to die he cried shall you be glad at my death behold then i shall slay myself before your eyes by my own hand rima i am now about to perish striking the knife into my heart  while speaking he waved the knife in a tragic manner over his head but i made no movement i was convinced that he had no intention of taking his own lifethat he was still acting rima incapable of understanding such a thing took it differently  oh you are going to kill yourself she cried oh wicked man wait until you know what will happen to you after death all shall now be told to my mother hear my words then kill yourself  she also now dropped on to her knees and lifting her clasped hands and fixing her resentful sparkling eyes on the dim blue patch of heaven visible beyond the treetops began to speak rapidly in clear vibrating tones she was praying to her mother in heaven and while nuflo listened absorbed his mouth open his eyes fixed on her the hand that clutched the knife dropped to his side i also heard with the greatest wonder and admiration for she had been shy and reticent with me and now as if oblivious of my presence she was telling aloud the secrets of her inmost heart  o mother mother listen to me to rima your beloved child she began all these years i have been wickedly deceived by grandfathernuflothe old man that found you often have i spoken to him of riolama where you once were and your people are and he denied all knowledge of such a place sometimes he said that it was at an immense distance in a great wilderness full of serpents larger than the trunks of great trees and of evil spirits and savage men slayers of all strangers at other times he affirmed that no such place existed that it was a tale told by the indians such false things did he say to meto rima your child o mother can you believe such wickedness  then a stranger a white man from venezuela came into our woods this is the man that was bitten by a serpent and his name is abel only i do not call him by that name but by other names which i have told you but perhaps you did not listen or did not hear for i spoke softly and not as now on my knees solemnly for i must tell you o mother that after you died the priest at voa told me repeatedly that when i prayed whether to you or to any of the saints or to the mother of heaven i must speak as he had taught me if i wished to be heard and understood and that was most strange since you had taught me differently but you were living then at voa and now that you are in heaven perhaps you know better therefore listen to me now o mother and let nothing i say escape you  when this white man had been for some days with us a strange thing happened to me which made me different so that i was no longer rima although rima stillso strange was this thing and i often went to the pool to look at myself and see the change in me but nothing different could i see in the first place it came from his eyes passing into mine and filling me just as the lightning fills a cloud at sunset afterwards it was no longer from his eyes only but it came into me whenever i saw him even at a distance when i heard his voice and most of all when he touched me with his hand when he is out of my sight i cannot rest until i see him again and when i see him then i am glad yet in such fear and trouble that i hide myself from him o mother it could not be told for once when he caught me in his arms and compelled me to speak of it he did not understand yet there was need to tell it then it came to me that only to our people could it be told for they would understand and reply to me and tell me what to do in such a case  and now o mother this is what happened next i went to grandfather and first begged and then commanded him to take me to riolama but he would not obey nor give attention to what i said but whenever i spoke to him of it he rose up and hurried from me and when i followed he flung back a confused and angry reply saying in the same breath that it was so long since he had been to riolama that he had forgotten where it was and that no such place existed and which of his words were true and which false i knew not so that it would have been better if he had returned no answer at all and there was no help to be got from him and having thus failed and there being no other person to speak to except this stranger i determined to go to him and in his company seek through the whole world for my people this will surprise you o mother because of that fear which came on me in his presence causing me to hide from his sight but my wish was so great that for a time it overcame my fear so that i went to him as he sat alone in the wood sad because he could not see me and spoke to him and led him to the summit of ytaioa to show me all the countries of the world from the summit and you must also know that i tremble in his presence not because i fear him as i fear indians and cruel men for he has no evil in him and is beautiful to look at and his words are gentle and his desire is to be always with me so that he differs from all other men i have seen just as i differ from all women except from you only o sweet mother  on the mountaintop he marked out and named all the countries of the world the great mountains the rivers the plains the forests the cities and told me also of the peoples whites and savages but of our people nothing and beyond where the world ends there is water water water and when he spoke of that unknown part on the borders of guayana on the side of the cordilleras he named the mountains of riolama and in that way i first found out where my people are i then left him on ytaioa he refusing to follow me and ran to grandfather and taxed him with his falsehoods and he finding i knew all escaped from me into the woods where i have now found him once more talking with the stranger and now o mother seeing himself caught and unable to escape a second time he has taken up a knife to kill himself so as not to take me to riolama and he is only waiting until i finish speaking to you for i wish him to know what will happen to him after death therefore o mother listen well and do what i tell you when he has killed himself and has come into that place where you are see that he does not escape the punishment he merits watch well for his coming for he is full of cunning and deceit and will endeavor to hide himself from your eyes when you have recognized himan old man brown as an indian with a white beardpoint him out to the angels and say this is nuflo the bad man that lied to rima let them take him and singe his wings with fire so that he may not escape by flying and afterwards thrust him into some dark cavern under a mountain and place a great stone that a hundred men could not remove over its mouth and leave him there alone and in the dark for ever  having ended she rose quickly from her knees and at the same moment nuflo dropping the knife cast himself prostrate at her feet  rimamy child my child not that he cried out in a voice that was broken with terror he tried to take hold of her feet with his hands but she shrank from him with aversion still he kept on crawling after her like a disabled lizard abjectly imploring her to forgive him reminding her that he had saved from death the woman whose enmity had now been enlisted against him and declaring that he would do anything she commanded him and gladly perish in her service  it was a pitiable sight and moving quickly to her side i touched her on the shoulder and asked her to forgive him  the response came quickly enough turning to him once more she said i forgive you grandfather and now get up and take me to riolama  he rose but only to his knees but you have not told her he said recovering his natural voice although still anxious and jerking a thumb over his shoulder consider my child that i am old and shall doubtless perish on the way what would become of my soul in such a case for now you have told her everything and it will not be forgotten  she regarded him in silence for a few moments then moving a little way apart dropped on to her knees again and with raised hands and eyes fixed on the blue space above already sprinkled with stars prayed again  o mother listen to me for i have something fresh to say to you grandfather has not killed himself but has asked my forgiveness and has promised to obey me o mother i have forgiven him and he will now take me to riolama to our people therefore o mother if he dies on the way to riolama let nothing be done against him but remember only that i forgave him at the last and when he comes into that place where you are let him be well received for that is the wish of rima your child  as soon as this second petition was ended she was up again and engaged in an animated discussion with him urging him to take her without further delay to riolama while he now recovered from his fear urged that so important an undertaking required a great deal of thought and preparation that the journey would occupy about twenty days and unless he set out well provided with food he would starve before accomplishing half the distance and his death would leave her worse off than before he concluded by affirming that he could not start in less time than seven or eight days  for a while i listened with keen interest to this dispute and at length interposed once more on the old mans side the poor girl in her petition had unwittingly revealed to me the power i possessed and it was a pleasing experience to exercise it touching her shoulder again i assured her that seven or eight days was only a reasonable time in which to prepare for so long a journey she instantly yielded and after one glance at my face she moved swiftly away into the darker shadows leaving me alone with the old man  as we returned together through the now profoundly dark wood i explained to him how the subject of riolama had first come up during my conversation with rima and he then apologized for the violent language he had used to me this personal question disposed of he spoke of the pilgrimage before him and informed me in confidence that he intended preparing a quantity of smokedried meat and packing it in a bag with a layer of cassava bread dried pumpkin slips and such innocent trifles to conceal it from rimas keen sight and delicate nostrils finally he made a long rambling statement which i vainly imagined was intended to lead up to an account of rimas origin with something about her people at riolama but it led to nothing except an expression of opinion that the girl was afflicted with a maggot in the brain but that as she had interest with the powers above especially with her mother who was now a very important person among the celestials it was good policy to submit to her wishes turning to me doubtless to wink only i missed the sign owing to the darkness he added that it was a fine thing to have a friend at court with a little gratulatory chuckle he went on to say that for others it was necessary to obey all the ordinances of the church to contribute to its support hear mass confess from time to time and receive absolution consequently those who went out into the wilderness where there were no churches and no priests to absolve them did so at the risk of losing their souls but with him it was different he expected in the end to escape the fires of purgatory and go directly in all his uncleanness to heavena thing he remarked which happened to very few and he nuflo was no saint and had first become a dweller in the desert as a very young man in order to escape the penalty of his misdeeds  i could not resist the temptation of remarking here that to an unregenerate man the celestial country might turn out a somewhat uncongenial place for a residence he replied airily that he had considered the point and had no fear about the future that he was old and from all he had observed of the methods of government followed by those who ruled over earthly affairs from the sky he had formed a clear idea of that place and believed that even among so many glorified beings he would be able to meet with those who would prove companionable enough and would think no worse of him on account of his little blemishes  how he had first got this idea into his brain about rimas ability to make things smooth for him after death i cannot say probably it was the effect of the girls powerful personality and vivid faith acting on an ignorant and extremely superstitious mind while she was making that petition to her mother in heaven it did not seem in the least ridiculous to me i had felt no inclination to smile even when hearing all that about the old mans wings being singed to prevent his escape by flying her rapt look the intense conviction that vibrated in her ringing passionate tones the brilliant scorn with which she a hater of bloodshed one so tender towards all living things even the meanest bade him kill himself and only hear first how her vengeance would pursue his deceitful soul into other worlds the clearness with which she had related the facts of the case disclosing the inmost secrets of her heartall this had had a strange convincing effect on me listening to her i was no longer the enlightened the creedless man she herself was so near to the supernatural that it seemed brought near me indefinable feelings which had been latent in me stirred into life and following the direction of her divine lustrous eyes fixed on the blue sky above i seemed to see there another being like herself a rima glorified leaning her pale spiritual face to catch the winged words uttered by her child on earth and even now while hearing the old mans talk showing as it did a mind darkened with such gross delusions i was not yet altogether free from the strange effect of that prayer doubtless it was a delusion her mother was not really there above listening to the girls voice still in some mysterious way rima had become to me even as to superstitious old nuflo a being apart and sacred and this feeling seemed to mix with my passion to purify and exalt it and make it infinitely sweet and precious  after we had been silent for some time i said old man the result of the grand discussion you have had with rima is that you have agreed to take her to riolama but about my accompanying you not one word has been spoken by either of you  he stopped short to stare at me and although it was too dark to see his face i felt his astonishment senor he exclaimed we cannot go without you have you not heard my granddaughters wordsthat it is only because of you that she is about to undertake this crazy journey if you are not with us in this thing then senor here we must remain but what will rima say to that  very well i will go but only on one condition  what is it he asked with a sudden change of tone which warned me that he was becoming cautious again  that you tell me the whole story of rimas origin and how you came to be now living with her in this solitary place and who these people are she wishes to visit at riolama  ah senor it is a long story and sad but you shall hear it all you must hear it senor since you are now one of us and when i am no longer here to protect her then she will be yours and although you will never be able to do more than old nuflo for her perhaps she will be better pleased and you senor better able to exist innocently by her side without eating flesh since you will always have that rare flower to delight you but the story would take long to tell you shall hear it all as we journey to riolama what else will there be to talk about when we are walking that long distance and when we sit at night by the fire  no no old man i am not to be put off in that way i must hear it before i start  but he was determined to reserve the narrative until the journey and after some further argument i yielded the point    chapter xiii  that evening by the fire old nuflo lately so miserable now happy in his delusions was more than usually gay and loquacious he was like a child who by timely submission has escaped a threatened severe punishment but his lightness of heart was exceeded by mine and with the exception of one other yet to come that evening now shines in memory as the happiest my life has known for rimas sweet secret was known to me and her very ignorance of the meaning of the feeling she experienced which caused her to fly from me as from an enemy only served to make the thought of it more purely delightful  on this occasion she did not steal away like a timid mouse to her own apartment as her custom was but remained to give that one evening a special grace seated well away from the fire in that same shadowy corner where i had first seen her indoors when i had marvelled at her altered appearance from that corner she could see my face with the firelight full upon it she herself in shadow her eyes veiled by their drooping lashes sitting there the vivid consciousness of my happiness was like draughts of strong delicious wine and its effect was like wine imparting such freedom to fancy such fluency that again and again old nuflo applauded crying out that i was a poet and begging me to put it all into rhyme i could not do that to please him never having acquired the art of improvisationthat idle trick of making words jingle which men of nuflos class in my country so greatly admire yet it seemed to me on that evening that my feelings could be adequately expressed only in that sublimated language used by the finest minds in their inspired moments and accordingly i fell to reciting but not from any modern nor from the poets of the last century nor even from the greater seventeenth century i kept to the more ancient romances and ballads the sweet old verse that whether glad or sorrowful seems always natural and spontaneous as the song of a bird and so simple that even a child can understand it  it was late that night before all the romances i remembered or cared to recite were exhausted and not until then did rima come out of her shaded corner and steal silently away to her sleepingplace  although i had resolved to go with them and had set nuflos mind at rest on the point i was bent on getting the request from rimas own lips and the next morning the opportunity of seeing her alone presented itself after old nuflo had sneaked off with his dogs from the moment of his departure i kept a close watch on the house as one watches a bush in which a bird one wishes to see has concealed itself and out of which it may dart at any moment and escape unseen  at length she came forth and seeing me in the way would have slipped back into hiding for in spite of her boldness on the previous day she now seemed shyer than ever when i spoke to her  rima i said do you remember where we first talked together under a tree one morning when you spoke of your mother telling me that she was dead  yes  i am going now to that spot to wait for you i must speak to you again in that place about this journey to riolama as she kept silent i added will you promise to come to me there  she shook her head turning half away  have you forgotten our compact rima  no she returned and then suddenly coming near spoke in a low tone i will go there to please you and you must also do as i tell you  what do you wish rima  she came nearer still listen you must not look into my eyes you must not touch me with your hands  sweet rima i must hold your hand when i speak with you  no no no she murmured shrinking from me and finding that it must be as she wished i reluctantly agreed  before i had waited long she appeared at the trystingplace and stood before me as on a former occasion on that same spot of clean yellow sand clasping and unclasping her fingers troubled in mind even then only now her trouble was different and greater making her shyer and more reticent  rima your grandfather is going to take you to riolama do you wish me to go with you  oh do you not know that she returned with a swift glance at my face  how should i know  her eyes wandered away restlessly on ytaioa you told me a hundred things which i did not know she replied in a vague way wishing perhaps to imply that with so great a knowledge of geography it was strange i did not know everything even her most secret thoughts  tell me why must you go to riolama  you have heard to speak to my people  what will you say to them tell me  what you do not understand how tell you  i understand you when you speak in spanish  oh that is not speaking  last night you spoke to your mother in spanish did you not tell her everything  oh nonot then when i tell her everything i speak in another way in a low voicenot on my knees and praying at night and in the woods and when i am alone i tell her but perhaps she does not hear me she is not here but up thereso far she never answers but when i speak to my people they will answer me  then she turned away as if there was nothing more to be said  is this all i am to hear from you rimathese few words i exclaimed so much did you say to your grandfather so much to your dead mother but to me you say so little  she turned again and with eyes cast down replied  he deceived mei had to tell him that and then to pray to mother but to you that do not understand what can i say only that you are not like him and all those that i knew at voa it is so differentand the same you are you and i am i why is itdo you know  no yesi know but cannot tell you and if you find your people what will you doleave me to go to them must i go all the way to riolama only to lose you  where i am there you must be  why  do i not see it there she returned with a quick gesture to indicate that it appeared in my face  your sight is keen rimakeen as a birds mine is not so keen let me look once more into those beautiful wild eyes then perhaps i shall see in them as much as you see in mine  oh no no not that she murmured in distress drawing away from me then with a sudden flash of brilliant colour cried  have you forgotten the compactthe promise you made me  her words made me ashamed and i could not reply but the shame was as nothing in strength compared to the impulse i felt to clasp her beautiful body in my arms and cover her face with kisses sick with desire i turned away and sitting on a root of the tree covered my face with my hands  she came nearer i could see her shadow through my fingers then her face and wistful compassionate eyes  forgive me dear rima i said dropping my hands again i have tried so hard to please you in everything touch my face with your handonly that and i will go to riolama with you and obey you in all things  for a while she hesitated then stepped quickly aside so that i could not see her but i knew that she had not left me that she was standing just behind me and after waiting a moment longer i felt her fingers touching my skin softly trembling over my cheek as if a softwinged moth had fluttered against it then the slight aerial touch was gone and she too mothlike had vanished from my side  left alone in the wood i was not happy that fluttering flattering touch of her fingertips had been to me like spoken language and more eloquent than language yet the sweet assurance it conveyed had not given perfect satisfaction and when i asked myself why the gladness of the previous evening had forsaken mewhy i was infected with this new sadness when everything promised well for me i found that it was because my passion had greatly increased during the last few hours even during sleep it had been growing and could no longer be fed by merely dwelling in thought on the charms moral and physical of its object and by dreams of future fruition  i concluded that it would be best for rimas sake as well as my own to spend a few of the days before setting out on our journey with my indian friends who would be troubled at my long absence and accordingly next morning i bade goodbye to the old man promising to return in three or four days and then started without seeing rima who had quitted the house before her usual time after getting free of the woods on casting back my eyes i caught sight of the girl standing under an isolated tree watching me with that vague misty greenish appearance she so frequently had when seen in the light shade at a short distance  rima i cried hurrying back to speak to her but when i reached the spot she had vanished and after waiting some time seeing and hearing nothing to indicate that she was near me i resumed my walk half thinking that my imagination had deceived me  i found my indian friends home again and was not surprised to observe a distinct change in their manner towards me i had expected as much and considering that they must have known very well where and in whose company i had been spending my time it was not strange coming across the savannah that morning i had first begun to think seriously of the risk i was running but this thought only served to prepare me for a new condition of things for now to go back and appear before rima and thus prove myself to be a person not only capable of forgetting a promise occasionally but also of a weak vacillating mind was not to be thought of for a moment  i was receivednot welcomedquietly enough not a question not a word concerning my long absence fell from anyone it was as if a stranger had appeared among them one about whom they knew nothing and consequently regarded with suspicion if not actual hostility i affected not to notice the change and dipped my hand uninvited in the pot to satisfy my hunger and smoked and dozed away the sultry hours in my hammock then i got my guitar and spent the rest of the day over it tuning it touching the strings so softly with my fingertips that to a person four yards off the sound must have seemed like the murmur or buzz of an insects wings and to this scarcely audible accompaniment i murmured in an equally low tone a new song  in the evening when all were gathered under the roof and i had eaten again i took up the instrument once more furtively watched by all those halfclosed animal eyes and swept the strings loudly and sang aloud i sang an old simple spanish melody to which i had put words in their own languagea language with no words not in everyday use in which it is so difficult to express feelings out of and above the common what i had been constructing and practicing all the afternoon sotto voce was a kind of ballad an extremely simple tale of a poor indian living alone with his young family in a season of dearth how day after day he ranged the voiceless woods to return each evening with nothing but a few withered sour berries in his hand to find his lean largeeyed wife still nursing the fire that cooked nothing and his children crying for food showing their bones more plainly through their skins every day and how without anything miraculous anything wonderful happening that barrenness passed from earth and the garden once more yielded them pumpkin and maize and manioc the wild fruits ripened and the birds returned filling the forest with their cries and so their long hunger was satisfied and the children grew sleek and played and laughed in the sunshine and the wife no longer brooding over the empty pot wove a hammock of silk grass decorated with blueandscarlet feathers of the macaw and in that new hammock the indian rested long from his labours smoking endless cigars  when i at last concluded with a loud note of joy a long involuntary suspiration in the darkening room told me that i had been listened to with profound interest and although no word was spoken though i was still a stranger and under a cloud it was plain that the experiment had succeeded and that for the present the danger was averted  i went to my hammock and slept but without undressing next morning i missed my revolver and found that the holster containing it had been detached from the belt my knife had not been taken possibly because it was under me in the hammock while i slept in answer to my inquiries i was informed that runi had borrowed my weapon to take it with him to the forest where he had gone to hunt and that he would return it to me in the evening i affected to take it in good part although feeling secretly ill at ease later in the day i came to the conclusion that runi had had it in his mind to murder me that i had softened him by singing that indian story and that by taking possession of the revolver he showed that he now only meant to keep me a prisoner subsequent events confirmed me in this suspicion on his return he explained that he had gone out to seek for game in the woods and going without a companion he had taken my revolver to preserve him from dangersmeaning those of a supernatural kind and that he had had the misfortune to drop it among the bushes while in pursuit of some animal i answered hotly that he had not treated me like a friend that if he had asked me for the weapon it would have been lent to him that as he had taken it without permission he must pay me for it after some pondering he said that when he took it i was sleeping soundly also that it would not be lost he would take me to the place where he had dropped it when we could search together for it  he was in appearance more friendly towards me now even asking me to repeat my last evenings song and so we had that performance all over again to everybodys satisfaction but when morning came he was not inclined to go to the woods there was food enough in the house and the pistol would not be hurt by lying where it had fallen a day longer next day the same excuse still i disguised my impatience and suspicion of him and waited singing the ballad for the third time that evening then i was conducted to a wood about a league and a half away and we hunted for the lost pistol among the bushes i with little hope of finding it while he attended to the bird voices and frequently asked me to stand or lie still when a chance of something offered  the result of that wasted day was a determination on my part to escape from runi as soon as possible although at the risk of making a deadly enemy of him and of being compelled to go on that long journey to riolama with no better weapon than a huntingknife i had noticed while appearing not to do so that outside of the house i was followed or watched by one or other of the indians so that great circumspection was needed on the following day i attacked my host once more about the revolver telling him with wellacted indignation that if not found it must be paid for i went so far as to give a list of the articles i should require including a bow and arrows zabatana two spears and other things which i need not specify to set me up for life as a wild man in the woods of guayana i was going to add a wife but as i had already been offered one it did not appear to be necessary he seemed a little taken aback at the value i set upon my weapon and promised to go and look for it again then i begged that kuako in whose sharpness of sight i had great faith might accompany us he consented and named the next day but one for the expedition very well thought i tomorrow their suspicion will be less and my opportunity will come then taking up my rude instrument i gave them an old spanish song      desde aquel doloroso momento  but this kind of music had lost its charm for them and i was asked to give them the ballad they understood so well in which their interest seemed to increase with every repetition in spite of anxiety it amused me to see old clacla regarding me fixedly with owlish eyes and lips moving my tale had no wonderful things in it like hers of the olden time which she told only to send her hearers to sleep perhaps she had discovered by now that it was the strange honey of melody which made the coarse common cassava bread of everyday life in my story so pleasant to the palate i was quite prepared to receive a proposal to give her music and singing lessons and to bequeath a guitar to her in my last will and testament for in spite of her hoary hair and million wrinkles she more than any other savage i had met with seemed to have taken a draught from ponce de leons undiscovered fountain of eternal youth poor old witch  the following day was the sixth of my absence from rima and one of intense anxiety to me a feeling which i endeavoured to hide by playing with the children fighting our old comic stick fights and by strumming noisily on the guitar in the afternoon when it was hottest and all the men who happened to be indoors were lying in their hammocks i asked kuako to go with me to the stream to bathe he refusedi had counted on thatand earnestly advised me not to bathe in the pool i was accustomed to as some little caribe fishes had made their appearance there and would be sure to attack me i laughed at his idle tale and taking up my cloak swung out of the door whistling a lively air he knew that i always threw my cloak over my head and shoulders as a protection from the sun and stinging flies when coming out of the water and so his suspicion was not aroused and i was not followed the pool was about ten minutes walk from the house i arrived at it with palpitating heart and going round to its end where the stream was shallow sat down to rest for a few moments and take a few sips of cool water dipped up in my palm presently i rose crossed the stream and began running keeping among the low trees near the bank until a dry gully which extended for some distance across the savannah was reached by following its course the distance to be covered would be considerably increased but the shorter way would have exposed me to sight and made it more dangerous i had put forth too much speed at first and in a short time my exertions and the hot sun together with my intense excitement overcame me i dared not hope that my flight had not been observed i imagined that the indians unencumbered by any heavy weight were already close behind me and ready to launch their deadly spears at my back with a sob of rage and despair i fell prostrate on my face in the dry bed of the stream and for two or three minutes remained thus exhausted and unmanned my heart throbbing so violently that my whole frame was shaken if my enemies had come on me then disposed to kill me i could not have lifted a hand in defence of my life but minutes passed and they came not i rose and went on at a fast walk now and when the sheltering streamed ended i stooped among the sere dwarfed shrubs scattered about here and there on its southern side and now creeping and now running with an occasional pause to rest and look back i at last reached the dividing ridge at its southern extremity the rest of the way was over comparatively easy ground inclining downwards and with that glad green forest now full in sight and hope growing stronger every minute in my breast my knees ceased to tremble and i ran on again scarcely pausing until i had touched and lost myself in the welcome shadows    chapter xiv  ah that return to the forest where rima dwelt after so anxious day when the declining sun shone hotly still and the green woodland shadows were so grateful the coolness the sense of security allayed the fever and excitement i had suffered on the open savannah i walked leisurely pausing often to listen to some bird voice or to admire some rare insect or parasitic flower shining starlike in the shade there was a strangely delightful sensation in me i likened myself to a child that startled at something it had seen while out playing in the sun flies to its mother to feel her caressing hand on its cheek and forget its tremors and describing what i felt in that way i was a little ashamed and laughed at myself nevertheless the feeling was very sweet at that moment mother and nature seemed one and the same thing as i kept to the more open part of the wood on its southernmost border the red flame of the sinking sun was seen at intervals through the deep humid green of the higher foliage how every object it touched took from it a new wonderful glory at one spot high up where the foliage was scanty and slender bush ropes and moss depended like broken cordage from a dead limbjust there bathing itself in that glorygiving light i noticed a fluttering bird and stood still to watch its antics now it would cling head downwards to the slender twigs wings and tail open then righting itself it would flit from waving line to line dropping lower and lower and anon soar upwards a distance of twenty feet and alight to recommence the flitting and swaying and dropping towards the earth it was one of those birds that have a polished plumage and as it moved this way and that flirting its feathers they caught the beams and shone at moments like glass or burnished metal suddenly another bird of the same kind dropped down to it as if from the sky straight and swift as a falling stone and the first bird sprang up to meet the comer and after rapidly wheeling round each other for a moment they fled away in company screaming shrilly through the wood and were instantly lost to sight while their jubilant cries came back fainter and fainter at each repetition  i envied them not their wings at that moment earth did not seem fixed and solid beneath me nor i bound by gravity to it the faint floating clouds the blue infinite heaven itself seemed not more ethereal and free than i or the ground i walked on the low stony hills on my right hand of which i caught occasional glimpses through the trees looking now blue and delicate in the level rays were no more than the billowy projections on the moving cloud of earth the trees of unnumbered kindsgreat more cecropia and greenheart bush and fern and suspended lianas and tall palms balancing their feathery foliage on slender stemsall was but a fantastic mist embroidery covering the surface of that floating cloud on which my feet were set and which floated with me near the sun  the red evening flame had vanished from the summits of the trees the sun was setting the woods in shadow when i got to the end of my walk i did not approach the house on the side of the door yet by some means those within became aware of my presence for out they came in a great hurry rima leading the way nuflo behind her waving his arms and shouting but as i drew near the girl dropped behind and stood motionless regarding me her face pallid and showing strong excitement i could scarcely remove my eyes from her eloquent countenance i seemed to read in it relief and gladness mingled with surprise and something like vexation she was piqued perhaps that i had taken her by surprise that after much watching for me in the wood i had come through it undetected when she was indoors  happy the eyes that see you shouted the old man laughing boisterously  happy are mine that look on rima again i answered i have been long absent  longyou may say so returned nuflo we had given you up we said that alarmed at the thought of the journey to riolama you had abandoned us  we said exclaimed rima her pallid face suddenly flushing i spoke differently  yes i knowi know he said airily waving his hand you said that he was in danger that he was kept against his will from coming he is present nowlet him speak  she was right i said ah nuflo old man you have lived long and got much experience but not insightnot that inner vision that sees further than the eyes  no not thati know what you mean he answered then tossing his hand towards the sky he added the knowledge you speak of comes from there  the girl had been listening with keen interest glancing from one to the other what she spoke suddenly as if unable to keep silence do you think grandfather that she tells mewhen there is dangerwhen the rain will ceasewhen the wind will bloweverything do i not ask and listen lying awake at night she is always silent like the stars  then pointing to me with her finger she finished  he knows so many things who tells them to him  but distinguish rima you do not distinguish the great from the little he answered loftily we know a thousand things but they are things that any man with a forehead can learn the knowledge that comes from the blue is not like thatit is more important and miraculous is it not so senor he ended appealing to me  is it then left for me to decide said i addressing the girl  but though her face was towards me she refused to meet my look and was silent silent but not satisfied she doubted still and had perhaps caught something in my tone that strengthened her doubt  old nuflo understood the expression look at me rima he said drawing himself up i am old and he is youngdo i not know best i have spoken and have decided it  still that unconvinced expression and her face turned expectant to me  am i to decide i repeated  who then she said at last her voice scarcely more than a murmur yet there was reproach in the tone as if she had made a long speech and i had tyrannously driven her to it  thus then i decide said i to each of us as to every kind of animal even to small birds and insects and to every kind of plant there is given something peculiara fragrance a melody a special instinct an art a knowledge which no other has and to rima has been given this quickness of mind and power to divine distant things it is hers just as swiftness and grace and changeful brilliant colour are the hummingbirds therefore she need not that anyone dwelling in the blue should instruct her  the old man frowned and shook his head while she after one swift shy glance at my face and with something like a smile flitting over her delicate lips turned and reentered the house  i felt convinced from that parting look that she had understood me that my words had in some sort given her relief for strong as was her faith in the supernatural she appeared as ready to escape from it when a way of escape offered as from the limp cotton gown and constrained manner worn in the house the religion and cotton dress were evidently remains of her early training at the settlement of voa  old nuflo strange to say had proved better than his word instead of inventing new causes for delay as i had imagined would be the case he now informed me that his preparations for the journey were all but complete that he had only waited for my return to set out  rima soon left us in her customary way and then talking by the fire i gave an account of my detention by the indians and of the loss of my revolver which i thought very serious  you seem to think little of it i said observing that he took it very coolly yet i know not how i shall defend myself in case of an attack  i have no fear of an attack he answered it seems to me the same thing whether you have a revolver or many revolvers and carbines and swords or no revolverno weapon at all and for a very simple reason while rima is with us so long as we are on her business we are protected from above the angels senor will watch over us by day and night what need of weapons then except to procure food  why should not the angels provide us with food also said i  no no that is a different thing he returned that is a small and low thing a necessity common to all creatures which all know how to meet you would not expect an angel to drive away a cloud of mosquitoes or to remove a bushtick from your person no sir you may talk of natural gifts and try to make rima believe that she is what she is and knows what she knows because like a hummingbird or some plants with a peculiar fragrance she has been made so it is wrong senor and pardon me for saying it it ill becomes you to put such fables into her head  i answered with a smile she herself seems to doubt what you believe  but senor what can you expect from an ignorant girl like rima she knows nothing or very little and will not listen to reason if she would only remain quietly indoors with her hair braided and pray and read her catechism instead of running about after flowers and birds and butterflies and such unsubstantial things it would be better for both of us  in what way old man  why it is plain that if she would cultivate the acquaintance of the people that surround heri mean those that come to her from her sainted motherand are ready to do her bidding in everything she could make it more safe for us in this place for example there is runi and his people why should they remain living so near us as to be a constant danger when a pestilence of smallpox or some other fever might easily be sent to kill them off  and have you ever suggested such a thing to your grandchild  he looked surprised and grieved at the question yes many times senor he said i should have been a poor christian had i not mentioned it but when i speak of it she gives me a look and is gone and i see no more of her all day and when i see her she refuses even to answer meso perverse so foolish is she in her ignorance for as you can see for yourself she has no more sense or concern about what is most important than some little painted fly that flits about all day long without any object    chapter xv  the next day we were early at work nuflo had already gathered dried and conveyed to a place of concealment the greater portion of his garden produce he was determined to leave nothing to be taken by any wandering party of savages that might call at the house during our absence he had no fear of a visit from his neighbours they would not know he said that he and rima were out of the wood a few large earthen pots filled with shelled maize beans and sundried strips of pumpkin still remained to be disposed of taking up one of these vessels and asking me to follow with another he started off through the wood we went a distance of five or six hundred yards then made our way down a very steep incline close to the border of the forest on the western side arrived at the bottom we followed the bank a little further and i then found myself once more at the foot of the precipice over which i had desperately thrown myself on the stormy evening after the snake had bitten me nuflo stealing silently and softly before me through the bushes had observed a caution and secrecy in approaching this spot resembling that of a wise old hen when she visits her hidden nest to lay an egg and here was his nest his most secret treasurehouse which he had probably not revealed even to me without a sharp inward conflict notwithstanding that our fates were now linked together the lower portion of the bank was of rock and in it about ten or twelve feet above the ground but easily reached from below there was a natural cavity large enough to contain all his portable property here besides the foodstuff he had already stored a quantity of dried tobacco leaf his rude weapons cooking utensils ropes mats and other objects two or three more journeys were made for the remaining pots after which we adjusted a slab of sandstone to the opening which was fortunately narrow plastered up the crevices with clay and covered them over with moss to hide all traces of our work  towards evening after we had refreshed ourselves with a long siesta nuflo brought out from some other hidingplace two sacks one weighing about twenty pounds and containing smokedried meat also grease and gum for lightingpurposes and a few other small objects this was his load the other sack which was smaller and contained parched corn and raw beans was for me to carry  the old man cautious in all his movements always acting as if surrounded by invisible spies delayed setting out until an hour after dark then skirting the forest on its west side we left ytaioa on our right hand and after travelling over rough difficult ground with only the stars to light us we saw the waning moon rise not long before dawn our course had been a northeasterly one at first now it was due east with broad dry savannahs and patches of open forest as far as we could see before us it was weary walking on that first night and weary waiting on the first day when we sat in the shade during the long hot hours persecuted by small stinging flies but the days and nights that succeeded were far worse when the weather became bad with intense heat and frequent heavy falls of rain the one compensation i had looked for which would have outweighed all the extreme discomforts we suffered was denied me rima was no more to me or with me now than she had been during those wild days in her native woods when every bush and bole and tangled creeper or fern frond had joined in a conspiracy to keep her out of my sight it is true that at intervals in the daytime she was visible sometimes within speaking distance so that i could address a few words to her but there was no companionship and we were fellow travellers only like birds flying independently in the same direction not so widely separated but that they can occasionally hear and see each other the pilgrim in the desert is sometimes attended by a bird and the bird with its freer motions will often leave him a league behind and seem lost to him but only to return and show its form again for it has never lost sight nor recollection of the traveller toiling slowly over the surface rima kept us company in some such wild erratic way as that a word a sign from nuflo was enough for her to know the direction to takethe distant forest or still more distant mountain near which we should have to pass she would hasten on and be lost to our sight and when there was a forest in the way she would explore it resting in the shade and finding her own food but invariably she was before us at each resting or campingplace  indian villages were seen during the journey but only to be avoided and in like manner if we caught sight of indians travelling or camping at a distance we would alter our course or conceal ourselves to escape observation only on one occasion two days after setting out were we compelled to speak with strangers we were going round a hill and all at once came face to face with three persons travelling in an opposite directiontwo men and a woman and by a strange fatality rima at that moment happened to be with us we stood for some time talking to these people who were evidently surprised at our appearance and wished to learn who we were but nuflo who spoke their language like one of themselves was too cunning to give any true answer they on their side told us that they had been to visit a relative at chani the name of a river three days ahead of us and were now returning to their own village at bailabaila two days beyond parahuari after parting from them nuflo was much troubled in his mind for the rest of that day these people he said would probably rest at some parahuari village where they would be sure to give a description of us and so it might eventually come to the knowledge of our unneighbourly neighbour runi that we had left ytaioa  other incidents of our long and wearisome journey need not be related sitting under some shady tree during the sultry hours with rima only too far out of earshot or by the nightly fire the old man told me little by little and with much digression chiefly on sacred subjects the strange story of the girls origin  about seventeen years backnuflo had no sure method to compute time bywhen he was already verging on old age he was one of a company of nine men living a kind of roving life in the very part of guayana through which we were now travelling the others much younger than himself were all equally offenders against the laws of venezuela and fugitives from justice nuflo was the leader of this gang for it happened that he had passed a great portion of his life outside the pale of civilization and could talk the indian language and knew this part of guayana intimately but according to his own account he was not in harmony with them they were bold desperate men whose evil appetites had so far only been whetted by the crimes they had committed while he with passions worn out recalling his many bad acts and with a vivid conviction of the truth of all he had been taught in early lifefor nuflo was nothing if not religiouswas now grown timid and desirous only of making his peace with heaven this difference of disposition made him morose and quarrelsome with his companions and they would he said have murdered him without remorse if he had not been so useful to them their favourite plan was to hang about the neighbourhood of some small isolated settlement keeping a watch on it and when most of the male inhabitants were absent to swoop down on it and work their will now shortly after one of these raids it happened that a woman they had carried off becoming a burden to them was flung into a river to the alligators but when being dragged down to the waterside she cast up her eyes and in a loud voice cried to god to execute vengeance on her murderers nuflo affirmed that he took no part in this black deed nevertheless the womans dying appeal to heaven preyed on his mind he feared that it might have won a hearing and the person eventually commissioned to execute vengeanceafter the usual days of course might act on the principle of the old proverb tell me whom you are with and i will tell you what you areand punish the innocent himself to wit along with the guilty but while thus anxious about his spiritual interests he was not yet prepared to break with his companions he thought it best to temporize and succeeded in persuading them that it would be unsafe to attack another christian settlement for some time to come that in the interval they might find some pleasure if no great credit by turning their attention to the indians the infidels he said were gods natural enemies and fair game to the christian to make a long story short nuflos christian band after some successful adventures met with a reverse which reduced their number from nine to five flying from their enemies they sought safety at riolama an uninhabited place where they found it possible to exist for some weeks on game which was abundant and wild fruits  one day at noon while ascending a mountain at the southern extremity of the riolama range in order to get a view of the country beyond the summit nuflo and his companions discovered a cave and finding it dry without animal occupants and with a level floor they at once determined to make it their dwellingplace for a season wood for firing and water were to be had close by they were also well provided with smoked flesh of a tapir they had slaughtered a day or two before so that they could afford to rest for a time in so comfortable a shelter at a short distance from the cave they made a fire on the rock to toast some slices of meat for their dinner and while thus engaged all at once one of the men uttered a cry of astonishment and casting up his eyes nuflo beheld standing near and regarding them with surprise and fear inher wideopen eyes a woman of a most wonderful appearance the one slight garment she had on was silky and white as the snow on the summit of some great mountain but of the snow when the sinking sun touches and gives it some delicate changing colour which is like fire her dark hair was like a cloud from which her face looked out and her head was surrounded by an aureole like that of a saint in a picture only more beautiful for said nuflo a picture is a picture and the other was a reality which is finer seeing her he fell on his knees and crossed himself and all the time her eyes full of amazement and shining with such a strange splendour that he could not meet them were fixed on him and not on the others and he felt that she had come to save his soul in danger of perdition owing to his companionship with men who were at war with god and wholly bad  but at this moment his comrades recovering from their astonishment sprang to their feet and the heavenly woman vanished just behind where she had stood and not twelve yards from them there was a huge chasm in the mountain its jagged precipitous sides clothed with thorny bushes the men now cried out that she had made her escape that way and down after her they rushed pellmell  nuflo cried out after them that they had seen a saint and that some horrible thing would befall them if they allowed any evil thought to enter their hearts but they scoffed at his words and were soon far down out of hearing while he trembling with fear remained praying to the woman that had appeared to them and had looked with such strange eyes at him not to punish him for the sins of the others  before long the men returned disappointed and sullen for they had failed in their search for the woman and perhaps nuflos warning words had made them give up the chase too soon at all events they seemed ill at ease and made up their minds to abandon the cave in a short time they left the place to camp that night at a considerable distance from the mountain but they were not satisfied they had now recovered from their fear but not from the excitement of an evil passion and finally after comparing notes they came to the conclusion that they had missed a great prize through nuflos cowardice and when he reproved them they blasphemed all the saints in the calendar and even threatened him with violence fearing to remain longer in the company of such godless men he only waited until they slept then rose up cautiously helped himself to most of the provisions and made his escape devoutly hoping that after losing their guide they would all speedily perish  finding himself alone now and master of his own actions nuflo was in terrible distress for while his heart was in the utmost fear it yet urged him imperiously to go back to the mountain to seek again for that sacred being who had appeared to him and had been driven away by his brutal companions if he obeyed that inner voice he would be saved if he resisted it then there would be no hope for him and along with those who had cast the woman to the alligators he would be lost eternally finally on the following day he went back although not without fear and trembling and sat down on a stone just where he had sat toasting his tapir meat on the previous day but he waited in vain and at length that voice within him which he had so far obeyed began urging him to descend into the valleylike chasm down which the woman had escaped from his comrades and to seek for her there accordingly he rose and began cautiously and slowly climbing down over the broken jagged rocks and through a dense mass of thorny bushes and creepers at the bottom of the chasm a clear swift stream of water rushed with foam and noise along its rocky bed but before reaching it and when it was still twenty yards lower down he was startled by hearing a low moan among the bushes and looking about for the cause he found the wonderful womanhis saviour as he expressed it she was not now standing nor able to stand but half reclining among the rough stones one foot which she had sprained in that headlong flight down the ragged slope wedged immovably between the rocks and in this painful position she had remained a prisoner since noon on the previous day she now gazed on her visitor in silent consternation while he casting himself prostrate on the ground implored her forgiveness and begged to know her will but she made no reply and at length finding that she was powerless to move he concluded that though a saint and one of the beings that men worship she was also flesh and liable to accidents while sojourning on earth and perhaps he thought that accident which had befallen her had been specially designed by the powers above to prove him with great labour and not without causing her much pain he succeeded in extricating her from her position and then finding that the injured foot was half crushed and blue and swollen he took her up in his arms and carried her to the stream there making a cup of a broad green leaf he offered her water which she drank eagerly and he also laved her injured foot in the cold stream and bandaged it with fresh aquatic leaves finally he made her a soft bed of moss and dry grass and placed her on it that night he spent keeping watch over her at intervals applying fresh wet leaves to her foot as the old ones became dry and wilted from the heat of the inflammation  the effect of all he did was that the terror with which she regarded him gradually wore off and next day when she seemed to be recovering her strength he proposed by signs to remove her to the cave higher up where she would be sheltered in case of rain she appeared to understand him and allowed herself to be taken up in his arms and carried with much labour to the top of the chasm in the cave he made her a second couch and tended her assiduously he made a fire on the floor and kept it burning night and day and supplied her with water to drink and fresh leaves for her foot there was little more that he could do from the choicest and fattest bits of toasted tapir flesh he offered her she turned away with disgust a little cassava bread soaked in water she would take but seemed not to like it after a time fearing that she would starve he took to hunting after wild fruits edible bulbs and gums and on these small things she subsisted during the whole time of their sojourn together in the desert  the woman although lamed for life was now so far recovered as to be able to limp about without assistance and she spent a portion of each day out among the rocks and trees on the mountains nuflo at first feared that she would now leave him but before long he became convinced that she had no such intentions and yet she was profoundly unhappy he was accustomed to see her seated on a rock as if brooding over some secret grief her head bowed and great tears falling from halfclosed eyes  from the first he had conceived the idea that she was in the way of becoming a mother at no distant datean idea which seemed to accord badly with the suppositions as to the nature of this heavenly being he was privileged to minister to and so win salvation but he was now convinced of its truth and he imagined that in her condition he had discovered the cause of that sorrow and anxiety which preyed continually on her by means of that dumb language of signs which enabled them to converse together a little he made it known to her that at a great distance from the mountains there existed a place where there were beings like herself women and mothers of children who would comfort and tenderly care for her when she had understood she seemed pleased and willing to accompany him to that distant place and so it came to pass that they left their rocky shelter and the mountains of riolama far behind but for several days as they slowly journeyed over the plain she would pause at intervals in her limping walk to gaze back on those blue summits shedding abundant tears  fortunately the village voa on the river of the same name which was the nearest christian settlement to riolama whither his course was directed was well known to him he had lived there in former years and what was of great advantage the inhabitants were ignorant of his worst crimes or to put it in his own subtle way of the crimes committed by the men he had acted with great was the astonishment and curiosity of the people of voa when after many weeks travelling nuflo arrived at last with his companion but he was not going to tell the truth nor even the least particle of the truth to a gaping crowd of inferior persons for these ingenious lies only to the priest he told the whole story dwelling minutely on all he had done to rescue and protect her all of which was approved by the holy man whose first act was to baptize the woman for fear that she was not a christian let it be said to nuflos credit that he objected to this ceremony arguing that she could not be a saint with an aureole in token of her sainthood yet stand in need of being baptized by a priest a priesthe added with a little chuckle of malicious pleasurewho was often seen drunk who cheated at cards and was sometimes suspected of putting poison on his fightingcocks spur to make sure of the victory doubtless the priest had his faults but he was not without humanity and for the whole seven years of that unhappy strangers sojourn at voa he did everything in his power to make her existence tolerable some weeks after arriving she gave birth to a female child and then the priest insisted on naming it riolama in order he said to keep in remembrance the strange story of the mothers discovery at that place  rimas mother could not be taught to speak either spanish or indian and when she found that the mysterious and melodious sounds that fell from her own lips were understood by none she ceased to utter them and thereafter preserved an unbroken silence among the people she lived with but from the presence of others she shrank as if in disgust or fear excepting only nuflo and the priest whose kindly intentions she appeared to understand and appreciate so far her life in the village was silent and sorrowful with her child it was different and every day that was not wet taking the little thing by the hand she would limp painfully out into the forest and there sitting on the ground the two would commune with each other by the hour in their wonderful language  at length she began to grow perceptibly paler and feebler week by week day by day until she could no longer go out into the wood but sat or reclined panting for breath in the dull hot room waiting for death to release her at the same time little rima who had always appeared frail as if from sympathy now began to fade and look more shadowy so that it was expected she would not long survive her parent to the mother death came slowly but at last it seemed so near that nuflo and the priest were together at her side waiting to see the end it was then that little rima who had learnt from infancy to speak in spanish rose from the couch where her mother had been whispering to her and began with some difficulty to express what was in the dying womans mind her child she had said could not continue to live in that hot wet place but if taken away to a distance where there were mountains and a cooler air she would survive and grow strong again  hearing this old nuflo declared that the child should not perish that he himself would take her away to parahuari a distant place where there were mountains and dry plains and open woods that he would watch over her and care for her there as he had cared for her mother at riolama  when the substance of this speech had been made known by rima to the dying woman she suddenly rose up from her couch which she had not risen from for many days and stood erect on the floor her wasted face shining with joy then nuflo knew that gods angels had come for her and put out his arms to save her from falling and even while he held her that sudden glory went out from her face now of a dead white like burntout ashes and murmuring something soft and melodious her spirit passed away  once more nuflo became a wanderer now with the fragilelooking little rima for companion the sacred child who had inherited the position of his intercessor from a sacred mother the priest who had probably become infected with nuflos superstitions did not allow them to leave voa emptyhanded but gave the old man as much calico as would serve to buy hospitality and whatsoever he might require from the indians for many a day to come  at parahuari where they arrived safely at last they lived for some little time at one of the villages but the child had an instinctive aversion to all savages or possibly the feeling was derived from her mother for it had shown itself early at voa where she had refused to learn their language and this eventually led nuflo to go away and live apart from them in the forest by ytaioa where he made himself a house and garden the indians however continued friendly with him and visited him with frequency but when rima grew up developing into that mysterious woodland girl i found her they became suspicious and in the end regarded her with dangerously hostile feeling she poor child detested them because they were incessantly at war with the wild animals she loved her companions and having no fear of them for she did not know that they had it in their minds to turn their little poisonous arrows against herself she was constantly in the woods frustrating them and the animals in league with her seemed to understand her note of warning and hid themselves or took to flight at the approach of danger at length their hatred and fear grew to such a degree that they determined to make away with her and one day having matured a plan they went to the wood and spread themselves two and two about it the couples did not keep together but moved about or remained concealed at a distance of forty or fifty yards apart lest she should be missed two of the savages armed with blowpipes were near the border of the forest on the side nearest to the village and one of them observing a motion in the foliage of a tree ran swiftly and cautiously towards it to try and catch a glimpse of the enemy and he did see her no doubt as she was there watching both him and his companions and blew an arrow at her but even while in the act of blowing it he was himself struck by a dart that buried itself deep in his flesh just over the heart he ran some distance with the fatal barbed point in his flesh and met his comrade who had mistaken him for the girl and shot him the wounded man threw himself down to die and dying related that he had fired at the girl sitting up in a tree and that she had caught the arrow in her hand only to hurl it instantly back with such force and precision that it pierced his flesh just over the heart he had seen it all with his own eyes and his friend who had accidentally slain him believed his story and repeated it to the others rima had seen one indian shoot the other and when she told her grandfather he explained to her that it was an accident but he guessed why the arrow had been fired  from that day the indians hunted no more in the wood and at length one day nuflo meeting an indian who did not know him and with whom he had some talk heard the strange story of the arrow and that the mysterious girl who could not be shot was the offspring of an old man and a didi who had become enamoured of him that growing tired of her consort the didi had returned to her river leaving her halfhuman child to play her malicious pranks in the wood  this then was nuflos story told not in nuflos manner which was infinitely prolix and think not that it failed to move methat i failed to bless him for what he had done in spite of his selfish motives    chapter xvi  we were eighteen days travelling to riolama on the last two making little progress on account of continuous rain which made us miserable beyond description fortunately the dogs had found and nuflo had succeeded in killing a great anteater so that we were well supplied with excellent strengthgiving flesh we were among the riolama mountains at last and rima kept with us apparently expecting great things i expected nothing for reasons to be stated by and by my belief was that the only important thing that could happen to us would be starvation  the afternoon of the last day was spent in skirting the foot of a very long mountain crowned at its southern extremity with a huge rocky mass resembling the head of a stone sphinx above its long couchant body and at its highest part about a thousand feet above the surrounding level it was late in the day raining fast again yet the old man still toiled on contrary to his usual practice which was to spend the last daylight hours in gathering firewood and in constructing a shelter at length when we were nearly under the peak he began to ascend the rise in this place was gentle and the vegetation chiefly composed of dwarf thorn trees rooted in the clefts of the rock scarcely impeded our progress yet nuflo moved obliquely as if he found the ascent difficult pausing frequently to take breath and look round him then we came to a deep ravinelike cleft in the side of the mountain which became deeper and narrower above us but below it broadened out to a valley its steep sides as we looked down were clothed with dense thorny vegetation and from the bottom rose to our ears the dull sound of a hidden torrent along the border of this ravine nuflo began toiling upwards and finally brought us out upon a stony plateau on the mountainside here he paused and turning and regarding us with a look as of satisfied malice in his eyes remarked that we were at our journeys end and he trusted the sight of that barren mountainside would compensate us for all the discomforts we had suffered during the last eighteen days  i heard him with indifference i had already recognized the place from his own exact description of it and i now saw all that i had looked to seea big barren hill but rima what had she expected that her face wore that blank look of surprise and pain is this the place where mother appeared to you she suddenly cried the very placethis this then she added the cave where you tended herwhere is it  over there he said pointing across the plateau which was partially overgrown with dwarf trees and bushes and ended at a wall of rock almost vertical and about forty feet high  going to this precipice we saw no cave until nuflo had cut away two or three tangled bushes revealing an opening behind about half as high and twice as wide as the door of an ordinary dwellinghouse  the next thing was to make a torch and aided by its light we groped our way in and explored the interior the cave we found was about fifty feet long narrowing to a mere hole at the extremity but the anterior portion formed an oblong chamber very lofty with a dry floor leaving our torch burning we set to work cutting bushes to supply ourselves with wood enough to last us all night nuflo poor old man loved a big fire dearly a big fire and fat meat to eat the ranker its flavour the better he liked it were to him the greatest blessings that man could wish for in me also the prospect of a cheerful blaze put a new heart and i worked with a will in the rain which increased in the end to a blinding downpour  by the time i dragged my last load in nuflo had got his fire well alight and was heaping on wood in a most lavish way no fear of burning our house down tonight he remarked with a chucklethe first sound of that description he had emitted for a long time  after we had satisfied our hunger and had smoked one or two cigarettes the unaccustomed warmth and dryness and the firelight affected us with drowsiness and i had probably been nodding for some time but starting at last and opening my eyes i missed rima the old man appeared to be asleep although still in a sitting posture close to the fire i rose and hurried out drawing my cloak close around me to protect me from the rain but what was my surprise on emerging from the cave to feel a dry bracing wind in my face and to see the desert spread out for leagues before me in the brilliant white light of a full moon the rain had apparently long ceased and only a few thin white clouds appeared moving swiftly over the wide blue expanse of heaven it was a welcome change but the shock of surprise and pleasure was instantly succeeded by the maddening fear that rima was lost to me she was nowhere in sight beneath and running to the end of the little plateau to get free of the thorn trees i turned my eyes towards the summit and there at some distance above me caught sight of her standing motionless and gazing upwards i quickly made my way to her side calling to her as i approached but she only half turned to cast a look at me and did not reply  rima i said why have you come here are you actually thinking of climbing the mountain at this hour of the night yeswhy not she returned moving one or two steps from me  rimasweet rima will you listen to me  now oh nowhy do you ask that did i not listen to you in the wood before we started and you also promised to do what i wished see the rain is over and the moon shines brightly why should i wait perhaps from the summit i shall see my peoples country are we not near it now  oh rima what do you expect to see listenyou must listen for i know best from that summit you would see nothing but a vast dim desert mountain and forest mountain and forest where you might wander for years or until you perished of hunger or fever or were slain by some beast of prey or by savage men but oh rima never never never would you find your people for they exist not you have seen the false water of the mirage on the savannah when the sun shines bright and hot and if one were to follow it one would at last fall down and perish with never a cool drop to moisten ones parched lips and your hope rimathis hope to find your people which has brought you all the way to riolamais a mirage a delusion which will lead to destruction if you will not abandon it  she turned to face me with flashing eyes you know best she exclaimed you know best and tell me that never until this moment have you spoken falsely oh why have you said such things to menamed after this place riolama am i also like that false water you speak ofno divine rima no sweet rima my mother had she no mother no mothers mother i remember her at voa before she died and this hand seems reallike yours you have asked to hold it but it is not he that speaks to menot one that showed me the whole world on ytaioa ah you have wrapped yourself in a stolen cloak only you have left your old grey beard behind go back to the cave and look for it and leave me to seek my people alone  once more as on that day in the forest when she prevented me from killing the serpent and as on the occasion of her meeting with nuflo after we had been together on ytaioa she appeared transformed and instinct with intense resentmenta beautiful human wasp and every word a sting  rima i cried you are cruelly unjust to say such words to me if you know that i have never deceived you before give me a little credit now you are no delusionno mirage but rima like no other being on earth so perfectly truthful and pure i cannot be but rather than mislead you with falsehoods i would drop down and die on this rock and lose you and the sweet light that shines on us for ever  as she listened to my words spoken with passion she grew pale and clasped her hands what have i said what have i said she spoke in a low voice charged with pain and all at once she came nearer and with a low sobbing cry sank down at my feet uttering as on the occasion of finding me lost at night in the forest near her home tender sorrowful expressions in her own mysterious language but before i could take her in my arms she rose again quickly to her feet and moved away a little space from me  oh no no it cannot be that you know best she began again but i know that you have never sought to deceive me and now because i falsely accused you i cannot go there without youpointing to the summitbut must stand still and listen to all you have to say  you know rima that your grandfather has now told me your historyhow he found your mother at this place and took her to voa where you were born but of your mothers people he knows nothing and therefore he can now take you no further  ah you think that he says that now but he deceived me all these years and if he lied to me in the past can he not still lie affirming that he knows nothing of my people even as he affirmed that he knew not riolama  he tells lies and he tells truth rima and one can be distinguished from the other he spoke truthfully at last and brought us to this place beyond which he cannot lead you  you are right i must go alone  not so rima for where you go there we must go only you will lead and we follow believing only that our quest will end in disappointment if not in death  believe that and yet follow oh no why did he consent to lead me so far for nothing  do you forget that you compelled him you know what he believes and he is old and looks with fear at death remembering his evil deeds and is convinced that only through your intercession and your mothers he can escape from perdition consider rima he could not refuse to make you more angry and so deprive himself of his only hope  my words seemed to trouble her but very soon she spoke again with renewed animation if my people exist why must it be disappointment and perhaps death he does not know but she came to him heredid she not the others are not here but perhaps not far off come let us go to the summit together to see from it the desert beneath usmountain and forest mountain and forest somewhere there you said that i had knowledge of distant things and shall i not know which mountainwhich forest  alas no rima there is a limit to your farseeing and even if that faculty were as great as you imagine it would avail you nothing for there is no mountain no forest in whose shadow your people dwell  for a while she was silent but her eyes and clasping fingers were restless and showed her agitation she seemed to be searching in the depths of her mind for some argument to oppose to my assertions then in a low almost despondent voice with something of reproach in it she said have we come so far to go back again you were not nuflo to need my intercession yet you came too  where you are there i must beyou have said it yourself besides when we started i had some hope of finding your people now i know better having heard nuflos story now i know that your hope is a vain one  why why was she not found heremother where then are the others  yes she was found here alone you must remember all the things she spoke to you before she died did she ever speak to you of her peoplespeak of them as if they existed and would be glad to receive you among them some day  no why did she not speak of that do you knowcan you tell me  i can guess the reason rima it is very sadso sad that it is hard to tell it when nuflo tended her in the cave and was ready to worship her and do everything she wished and conversed with her by signs she showed no wish to return to her people and when he offered her in a way she understood to take her to a distant place where she would be among strange beings among others like nuflo she readily consented and painfully performed that long journey to voa would you rima have acted thuswould you have gone so far away from your beloved people never to return never to hear of them or speak to them again oh no you could not nor would she if her people had been in existence but she knew that she had survived them that some great calamity had fallen upon and destroyed them they were few in number perhaps and surrounded on every side by hostile tribes and had no weapons and made no war they had been preserved because they inhabited a place apart some deep valley perhaps guarded on all sides by lofty mountains and impenetrable forests and marshes but at last the cruel savages broke into this retreat and hunted them down destroying all except a few fugitives who escaped singly like your mother and fled away to hide in some distant solitude  the anxious expression on her face deepened as she listened to one of anguish and despair and then almost before i concluded she suddenly lifted her hands to her head uttering a low sobbing cry and would have fallen on the rock had i not caught her quickly in my arms once more in my armsagainst my breast her proper place but now all that bright life seemed gone out of her her head fell on my shoulder and there was no motion in her except at intervals a slight shudder in her frame accompanied by a low gasping sob in a little while the sobs ceased the eyes were closed the face still and deathly white and with a terrible anxiety in my heart i carried her down to the cave    chapter xvii  as i reentered the cave with my burden nuflo sat up and stared at me with a frightened look in his eyes throwing my cloak down i placed the girl on it and briefly related what had happened  he drew near to examine her then placed his hand on her heart deadshe is dead he exclaimed  my own anxiety changed to an irrational anger at his words old fool she has only fainted i returned get me some water quick  but the water failed to restore her and my anxiety deepened as i gazed on that white still face oh why had i told her that sad tragedy i had imagined with so little preparation alas i had succeeded too well in my purpose killing her vain hope and her at the same moment  the old man still bending over her spoke again no i will not believe that she is dead yet but sir if not dead then she is dying  i could have struck him down for his words she will die in my arms then i exclaimed thrusting him roughly aside and lifting her up with the cloak beneath her  and while i held her thus her head resting on my arm and gazed with unutterable anguish into her strangely white face insanely praying to heaven to restore her to me nuflo fell on his knees before her and with bowed head and hands clasped in supplication began to speak  rima grandchild he prayed his quivering voice betraying his agitation do not die just yet you must not dienot wholly dieuntil you have heard what i have to say to you i do not ask you to answer in wordsyou are past that and i am not unreasonable only when i finish make some signa sigh a movement of the eyelid a twitch of the lips even in the small corners of the mouth nothing more than that just to show that you have heard and i shall be satisfied remember all the years that i have been your protector and this long journey that i have taken on your account also all that i did for your sainted mother before she died at voa to become one of the most important of those who surround the queen of heaven and who when they wish for any favour have only to say half a word to get it and do not cast in oblivion that at the last i obeyed your wish and brought you safely to riolama it is true that in some small things i deceived you but that must not weigh with you because it is a small matter and not worthy of mention when you consider the claims i have on you in your hands rima i leave everything relying on the promise you made me and on my services only one word of caution remains to be added do not let the magnificence of the place you are now about to enter the new sights and colours and the noise of shouting and musical instruments and blowing of trumpets put these things out of your head nor must you begin to think meanly of yourself and be abashed when you find yourself surrounded by saints and angels for you are not less than they although it may not seem so at first when you see them in their bright clothes which they say shine like the sun i cannot ask you to tie a string round your finger i can only trust to your memory which was always good even about the smallest things and when you are asked as no doubt you will be to express a wish remember before everything to speak of your grandfather and his claims on you also on your angelic mother to whom you will present my humble remembrances  during this petition which in other circumstances would have moved me to laughter but now only irritated me a subtle change seemed to come to the apparently lifeless girl to make me hope the small hand in mine felt not so icy cold and though no faintest colour had come to the face its pallor had lost something of its deathly waxen appearance and now the compressed lips had relaxed a little and seemed ready to part i laid my fingertips on her heart and felt or imagined that i felt a faint fluttering and at last i became convinced that her heart was really beating  i turned my eyes on the old man still bending forward intently watching for the sign he had asked her to make my anger and disgust at his gross earthy egoism had vanished let us thank god old man i said the tears of joy half choking my utterance she livesshe is recovering from her fit  he drew back and on his knees with bowed head murmured a prayer of thanks to heaven  together we continued watching her face for half an hour longer i still holding her in my arms which could never grow weary of that sweet burden waiting for other surer signs of returning life and she seemed now like one that had fallen into a profound deathlike sleep which must end in death yet when i remembered her face as it had looked an hour ago i was confirmed in the belief that the progress to recovery so strangely slow was yet sure so slow so gradual was this passing from death to life that we had hardly ceased to fear when we noticed that the lips were parted or almost parted that they were no longer white and that under her pale transparent skin a faint bluishrosy colour was now visible and at length seeing that all danger was past and recovery so slow old nuflo withdrew once more to the fireside and stretching himself out on the sandy floor soon fell into a deep sleep  if he had not been lying there before me in the strong light of the glowing embers and dancing flames i could not have felt more alone with rimaalone amid those remote mountains in that secret cavern with lights and shadows dancing on its grey vault in that profound silence and solitude the mysterious loveliness of the still face i continued to gaze on its appearance of life without consciousness produced a strange feeling in me hard perhaps impossible to describe  once when clambering among the rough rocks overgrown with forest among the queneveta mountains i came on a single white flower which was new to me which i have never seen since after i had looked long at it and passed on the image of that perfect flower remained so persistently in my mind that on the following day i went again in the hope of seeing it still untouched by decay there was no change and on this occasion i spent a much longer time looking at it admiring the marvellous beauty of its form which seemed so greatly to exceed that of all other flowers it had thick petals and at first gave me the idea of an artificial flower cut by a divinely inspired artist from some unknown precious stone of the size of a large orange and whiter than milk and yet in spite of its opacity with a crystalline lustre on the surface next day i went again scarcely hoping to find it still unwithered it was fresh as if only just opened and after that i went often sometimes at intervals of several days and still no faintest sign of any change the clear exquisite lines still undimmed the purity and lustre as i had first seen it why i often asked does not this mystic forest flower fade and perish like others that first impression of its artificial appearance had soon left me it was indeed a flower and like other flowers had life and growth only with that transcendent beauty it had a different kind of life unconscious but higher perhaps immortal thus it would continue to bloom when i had looked my last on it wind and rain and sunlight would never stain never tinge its sacred purity the savage indian though he sees little to admire in a flower yet seeing this one would veil his face and turn back even the browsing beast crashing his way through the forest struck with its strange glory would swerve aside and pass on without harming it afterwards i heard from some indians to whom i described it that the flower i had discovered was called hata also that they had a superstition concerning ita strange belief they said that only one hata flower existed in the world that it bloomed in one spot for the space of a moon that on the disappearance of the moon in the sky the hata disappeared from its place only to reappear blooming in some other spot sometimes in some distant forest and they also said that whosoever discovered the hata flower in the forest would overcome all his enemies and obtain all his desires and finally outlive other men by many years but as i have said all this i heard afterwards and my halfsuperstitious feeling for the flower had grown up independently in my own mind a feeling like that was in me while i gazed on the face that had no motion no consciousness in it and yet had life a life of so high a kind as to match with its pure surpassing loveliness i could almost believe that like the forest flower in this state and aspect it would endure for ever endure and perhaps give of its own immortality to everything around itto me holding her in my arms and gazing fixedly on the pale face framed in its cloud of dark silken hair to the leaping flames that threw changing lights on the dim stony wall of rock to old nuflo and his two yellow dogs stretched out on the floor in eternal unawakening sleep  this feeling took such firm possession of my mind that it kept me for a time as motionless as the form i held in my arms i was only released from its power by noting still further changes in the face i watched a more distinct advance towards conscious life the faint colour which had scarcely been more than a suspicion of colour had deepened perceptibly the lids were lifted so as to show a gleam of the crystal orbs beneath the lips too were slightly parted  and at last bending lower down to feel her breath the beauty and sweetness of those lips could no longer be resisted and i touched them with mine having once tasted their sweetness and fragrance it was impossible to keep from touching them again and again she was not conscioushow could she be and not shrink from my caress yet there was a suspicion in my mind and drawing back i gazed into her face once more a strange new radiance had overspread it or was this only an illusive colour thrown on her skin by the red firelight i shaded her face with my open hand and saw that her pallor had really gone that the rosy flame on her cheeks was part of her life her lustrous eyes half open were gazing into mine oh surely consciousness had returned to her had she been sensible of those stolen kisses would she now shrink from another caress trembling i bent down and touched her lips again lightly but lingeringly and then again and when i drew back and looked at her face the rosy flame was brighter and the eyes more open still were looking into mine and gazing with those open conscious eyes it seemed to me that at last at last the shadow that had rested between us had vanished that we were united in perfect love and confidence and that speech was superfluous and when i spoke it was not without doubt and hesitation our bliss in those silent moments had been so complete what could speaking do but make it less  my love my life my sweet rima i know that you will understand me now as you did not before on that dark nightdo you remember it rimawhen i held you clasped to my breast in the wood how it pierced my heart with pain to speak plainly to you as i did on the mountain tonightto kill the hope that had sustained and brought you so far from home but now that anguish is over the shadow has gone out of those beautiful eyes that are looking at me it is because loving me knowing now what love is knowing too how much i love you that you no longer need to speak to any other living being of such things to tell it to show it to me is now enoughis it not so rima how strange it seemed at first when you shrank in fear from me but afterwards when you prayed aloud to your mother opening all the secrets of your heart i understood it in that lonely isolated life in the wood you had heard nothing of love of its power over the heart its infinite sweetness when it came to you at last it was a new inexplicable thing and filled you with misgivings and tumultuous thoughts so that you feared it and hid yourself from its cause such tremors would be felt if it had always been night with no light except that of the stars and the pale moon as we saw it a little while ago on the mountain and at last day dawned and a strange unheardof rose and purple flame kindled in the eastern sky foretelling the coming sun it would seem beautiful beyond anything that night had shown to you yet you would tremble and your heart beat fast at that strange sight you would wish to fly to those who might be able to tell you its meaning and whether the sweet things it prophesied would ever really come that is why you wished to find your people and came to riolama to seek them and when you knewwhen i cruelly told youthat they would never be found then you imagined that that strange feeling in your heart must remain a secret for ever and you could not endure the thought of your loneliness if you had not fainted so quickly then i should have told you what i must tell you now they are lost rimayour peoplebut i am with you and know what you feel even if you have no words to tell it but what need of words it shines in your eyes it burns like a flame in your face i can feel it in your hands do you not also see it in my faceall that i feel for you the love that makes me happy for this is love rima the flower and the melody of life the sweetest thing the sweet miracle that makes our two souls one  still resting in my arms as if glad to rest there still gazing into my face it was clear to me that she understood my every word and then with no trace of doubt or fear left i stooped again until my lips were on hers and when i drew back once more hardly knowing which bliss was greatestkissing her delicate mouth or gazing into her faceshe all at once put her arms about my neck and drew herself up until she sat on my knee  abelshall i call you abel nowand always she spoke still with her arms round my neck ah why did you let me come to riolama i would come i made him comeold grandfather sleeping there he does not count but youyou after you had heard my story and knew that it was all for nothing and all i wished to know was therein you oh how sweet it is but a little while ago what pain when i stood on the mountain when you talked to me and i knew that you knew best and tried and tried not to know at last i could try no more they were all dead like mother i had chased the false water on the savannah oh let me die too i said for i could not bear the pain and afterwards here in the cave i was like one asleep and when i woke i did not really wake it was like morning with the light teasing me to open my eyes and look at it not yet dear light a little while longer it is so sweet to lie still but it would not leave me and stayed teasing me still like a small shining green fly until because it teased me so i opened my lids just a little it was not morning but the firelight and i was in your arms not in my little bed your eyes looking looking into mine but i could see yours better i remembered everything then how you once asked me to look into your eyes i remembered so many thingsoh so many  how many things did you remember rima  listen abel do you ever lie on the dry moss and look straight up into a tree and count a thousand leaves  no sweetest that could not be done it is so many to count do you know how many a thousand are  oh do i not when a hummingbird flies close to my face and stops still in the air humming like a bee and then is gone in that short time i can count a hundred small round bright feathers on its throat that is only a hundred a thousand are more ten times looking up i count a thousand leaves then stop counting because there are thousands more behind the first and thousands more crowded together so that i cannot count them lying in your arms looking up into your face it was like that i could not count the things i remembered in the wood when you were there and before and long long ago at voa when i was a child with mother  tell me some of the things you remembered rima  yes oneonly one now when i was a child at voa mother was very lameyou know that whenever we went out away from the houses into the forest walking slowly slowly she would sit under a tree while i ran about playing and every time i came back to her i would find her so pale so sad cryingcrying that was when i would hide and come softly back so that she would not hear me coming oh mother why are you crying does your lame foot hurt you and one day she took me in her arms and told me truly why she cried  she ceased speaking but looked at me with a strange new light coming into her eyes  why did she cry my love  oh abel can you understandnowat last and putting her lips close to my ear she began to murmur soft melodious sounds that told me nothing then drawing back her head she looked again at me her eyes glistening with tears her lips half parted with a smile tender and wistful  ah poor child in spite of all that had been said all that had happened she had returned to the old delusion that i must understand her speech i could only return her look sorrowfully and in silence  her face became clouded with disappointment then she spoke again with something of pleading in her tone look we are not now apart i hiding in the wood you seeking but together saying the same things in your languageyours and now mine but before you came i knew nothing nothing for there was only grandfather to talk to a few words each day the same words if yours is mine mine must be yours oh do you not know that mine is better  yes better but alas rima i can never hope to understand your sweet speech much less to speak it the bird that only chirps and twitters can never sing like the organbird  crying she hid her face against my neck murmuring sadly between her sobs nevernever  how strange it seemed in that moment of joy such a passion of tears such despondent words  for some minutes i preserved a sorrowful silence realizing for the first time so far as it was possible to realize such a thing what my inability to understand her secret language meant to herthat finer language in which alone her swift thoughts and vivid emotions could be expressed easily and well as she seemed able to declare herself in my tongue i could well imagine that to her it would seem like the merest stammering as she had said to me once when i asked her to speak in spanish that is not speaking and so long as she could not commune with me in that better language which reflected her mind there would not be that perfect union of soul she so passionately desired  by and by as she grew calmer i sought to say something that would be consoling to both of us sweetest rima i spoke it is so sad that i can never hope to talk with you in your way but a greater love than this that is ours we could never feel and love will make us happy unutterably happy in spite of that one sadness and perhaps after a while you will be able to say all you wish in my language which is also yours as you said some time ago when we are back again in the beloved wood and talk once more under that tree where we first talked and under the old mora where you hid yourself and threw down leaves on me and where you caught the little spider to show me how you made yourself a dress you shall speak to me in your own sweet tongue and then try to say the same things in mine and in the end perhaps you will find that it is not so impossible as you think  she looked at me smiling again through her tears and shook her head a little  remember what i have heard that before your mother died you were able to tell nuflo and the priest what her wish was can you not in the same way tell me why she cried  i can tell you but it will not be telling you  i understand you can tell the bare facts i can imagine something more and the rest i must lose tell me rima  her face became troubled she glanced away and let her eyes wander round the dim firelit cavern then they returned to mine once more  look she said grandfather lying asleep by the fire so far away from usoh so far but if we were to go out from the cave and on and on to the great mountains where the city of the sun is and stood there at last in the midst of great crowds of people all looking at us talking to us it would be just the same they would be like the trees and rocks and animalsso far not with us nor we with them but we are everywhere alone together apartwe two it is love i know it now but i did not know it before because i had forgotten what she told me do you think i can tell you what she said when i asked her why she cried oh no only this she and another were like one always apart from the others then something camesomething came o abel was that the something you told me about on the mountain and the other was lost for ever and she was alone in the forests and mountains of the world oh why do we cry for what is lost why do we not quickly forget it and feel glad again now only do i know what you felt o sweet mother when you sat still and cried while i ran about and played and laughed o poor mother oh what pain and hiding her face against my neck she sobbed once more  to my eyes also love and sympathy brought the tears but in a little while the fond comforting words i spoke and my caresses recalled her from that sad past to the present then lying back as at first her head resting on my folded cloak her body partly supported by my encircling arm and partly by the rock we were leaning against her halfclosed eyes turned to mine expressed a tender assured happinessthe chastened gladness of sunshine after rain a soft delicious languor that was partly passionate with the passion etherealized  tell me rima i said bending down to her in all those troubled days with me in the woods had you no happy moments did not something in your heart tell you that it was sweet to love even before you knew what love meant  yes and onceo abel do you remember that night after returning from ytaioa when you sat so late talking by the firei in the shadow never stirring listening listening you by the fire with the light on your face saying so many strange things i was happy thenoh how happy it was black night and raining and i a plant growing in the dark feeling the sweet raindrops falling falling on my leaves oh it will be morning by and by and the sun will shine on my wet leaves and that made me glad till i trembled with happiness then suddenly the lightning would come so bright and i would tremble with fear and wish that it would be dark again that was when you looked at me sitting in the shadow and i could not take my eyes away quickly and could not meet yours so that i trembled with fear  and now there is no fearno shadow now you are perfectly happy  oh so happy if the way back to the wood was longer ten times and if the great mountains white with snow on their tops were between and the great dark forest and rivers wider than orinoco still i would go alone without fear because you would come after me to join me in the wood to be with me at last and always  but i should not let you go alone rimayour lonely days are over now  she opened her eyes wider and looked earnestly into my face i must go back alone abel she said before day comes i must leave you rest here with grandfather for a few days and nights then follow me  i heard her with astonishment it must not be rima i cried what let you leave menow you are mineto go all that distance through all that wild country where you might lose yourself and perish alone oh do not think of it  she listened regarding me with some slight trouble in her eyes but smiling a little at the same time her small hand moved up my arm and caressed my cheek then she drew my face down to hers until our lips met but when i looked at her eyes again i saw that she had not consented to my wish do i not know all the way now she spoke all the mountains rivers forestshow should i lose myself and i must return quickly not step by step walkingresting restingwalking stopping to cook and eat stopping to gather firewood to make a shelterso many things oh i shall be back in half the time and i have so much to do  what can you have to do loveeverything can be done when we are in the wood together  a bright smile with a touch of mockery in it flitted over her face as she replied oh must i tell you that there are things you cannot do look abel and she touched the slight garment she wore thinner now than at first and dulled by long exposure to sun and wind and rain  i could not command her and seemed powerless to persuade her but i had not done yet and proceeded to use every argument i could find to bring her round to my view and when i finished she put her arms around my neck and drew herself up once more o abel how happy i shall be she said taking no notice of all i had said think of me alone days and days in the wood waiting for you working all the time saying come quickly abel come slow abel o abel how long you are oh do not come until my work is finished and when it is finished and you arrive you shall find me but not at once first you will seek for me in the house then in the wood calling rima rima and she will be there listening hid in the trees wishing to be in your arms wishing for your lipsoh so glad yet fearing to show herself do you know why he told youdid he notthat when he first saw her she was standing before him all in whitea dress that was like snow on the mountaintops when the sun is setting and gives it rose and purple colour i shall be like that hidden among the trees saying am i differentnot like rima will he know mewill he love me just the same oh do i not know that you will be glad and love me and call me beautiful listen listen she suddenly exclaimed lifting her face  among the bushes not far from the caves mouth a small bird had broken out in song a clear tender melody soon taken up by other birds further away  it will soon be morning she said and then clasped her arms about me once more and held me in a long passionate embrace then slipping away from my arms and with one swift glance at the sleeping old man passed out of the cave  for a few moments i remained sitting not yet realizing that she had left me so suddenly and swiftly had she passed from my arms and my sight then recovering my faculties i started up and rushed out in hopes of overtaking her  it was not yet dawn but there was still some light from the full moon now somewhere behind the mountains running to the verge of the bushgrown plateau i explored the rocky slope beneath without seeing her form and then called rima rima  a soft warbling sound uttered by no bird came up from the shadowy bushes far below and in that direction i ran on then pausing called again the sweet sound was repeated once more but much lower down now and so faintly that i scarcely heard it and when i went on further and called again and again there was no reply and i knew that she had indeed gone on that long journey alone    chapter xviii  when nuflo at length opened his eyes he found me sitting alone and despondent by the fire just returned from my vain chase i had been caught in a heavy mist on the mountainside and was wet through as well as weighed down by fatigue and drowsiness consequent upon the previous days laborious march and my nightlong vigil yet i dared not think of rest she had gone from me and i could not have prevented it yet the thought that i had allowed her to slip out of my arms to go away alone on that long perilous journey was as intolerable as if i had consented to it  nuflo was at first startled to hear of her sudden departure but he laughed at my fears affirming that after having once been over the ground she could not lose herself that she would be in no danger from the indians as she would invariably see them at a distance and avoid them and that wild beasts serpents and other evil creatures would do her no harm the small amount of food she required to sustain life could be found anywhere furthermore her journey would not be interrupted by bad weather since rain and heat had no effect on her in the end he seemed pleased that she had left us saying that with rima in the wood the house and cultivated patch and hidden provisions and implements would be safe for no indian would venture to come where she was his confidence reassured me and casting myself down on the sandy floor of the cave i fell into a deep slumber which lasted until evening then i only woke to share a meal with the old man and sleep again until the following day  nuflo was not ready to start yet he was enamoured of the unaccustomed comforts of a dry sleepingplace and a fire blown about by no wind and into which fell no hissing raindrops not for two days more would he consent to set out on the return journey and if he could have persuaded me our stay at riolama would have lasted a week  we had fine weather at starting but before long it clouded and then for upwards of a fortnight we had it wet and stormy which so hindered us that it took us twentythree days to accomplish the return journey whereas the journey out had only taken eighteen the adventures we met with and the pains we suffered during this long march need not be related the rain made us miserable but we suffered more from hunger than from any other cause and on more than one occasion were reduced to the verge of starvation twice we were driven to beg for food at indian villages and as we had nothing to give in exchange for it we got very little it is possible to buy hospitality from the savage without fishhooks nails and calico but on this occasion i found myself without that impalpable medium of exchange which had been so great a help to me on my first journey to parahuari now i was weak and miserable and without cunning it is true that we could have exchanged the two dogs for cassava bread and corn but we should then have been worse off than ever and in the end the dogs saved us by an occasional capturean armadillo surprised in the open and seized before it could bury itself in the soil or an iguana opossum or labba traced by means of their keen sense of smell to its hidingplace then nuflo would rejoice and feast rewarding them with the skin bones and entrails but at length one of the dogs fell lame and nuflo who was very hungry made its lameness an excuse for dispatching it which he did apparently without compunction notwithstanding that the poor brute had served him well in its way he cut up and smokedried the flesh and the intolerable pangs of hunger compelled me to share the loathsome food with him we were not only indecent it seemed to me but cannibals to feed on the faithful servant that had been our butcher but what does it matter i argued with myself all flesh clean and unclean should be and is equally abhorrent to me and killing animals a kind of murder but now i find myself constrained to do this evil thing that good may come only to live i take it nowthis hateful strengthgiver that will enable me to reach rima and the purer better life that is to be  during all that time when we toiled onwards league after league in silence or sat silent by the nightly fire i thought of many things but the past with which i had definitely broken was little in my mind rima was still the source and centre of all my thoughts from her they rose and to her returned thinking hoping dreaming sustained me in those dark days and nights of pain and privation imagination was the bread that gave me strength the wine that exhilarated what sustained old nuflos mind i know not probably it was like a chrysalis dormant independent of sustenance the brightwinged image to be called at some future time to life by a great shouting of angelic hosts and noises of musical instruments slept secure coffined in that dull gross nature  the old beloved wood once more never did his native village in some mountain valley seem more beautiful to the switzer returning warworn from long voluntary exile than did that blue cloud on the horizonthe forest where rima dwelt my bride my beautifuland towering over it the dark cone of ytaioa now seem to my hungry eyes how near at lasthow near and yet the two or three intervening leagues to be traversed so slowly step by stephow vast the distance seemed even at far riolama when i set out on my return i scarcely seemed so far from my love this maddening impatience told on my strength which was small and hindered me i could not run nor even walk fast old nuflo slow and sober with no flame consuming his heart was more than my equal in the end and to keep up with him was all i could do at the finish he became silent and cautious first entering the belt of trees leading away through the low range of hills at the southern extremity of the wood for a mile or upwards we trudged on in the shade then i began to recognize familiar ground the old trees under which i had walked or sat and knew that a hundred yards further on there would be a first glimpse of the palmleaf thatch then all weakness forsook me with a low cry of passionate longing and joy i rushed on ahead but i strained my eyes in vain for a sight of that sweet shelter no patch of pale yellow colour appeared amidst the universal verdure of bushes creepers and treestrees beyond trees trees towering above trees  for some moments i could not realize it no i had surely made a mistake the house had not stood on that spot it would appear in sight a little further on i took a few uncertain steps onwards and then again stood still my brain reeling my heart swelling nigh to bursting with anguish i was still standing motionless with hand pressed to my breast when nuflo overtook me where is itthe house i stammered pointing with my hand all his stolidity seemed gone now he was trembling too his lips silently moving at length he spoke they have comethe children of hell have been here and have destroyed everything  rima what has become of rima i cried but without replying he walked on and i followed  the house we soon found had been burnt down not a stick remained where it had stood a heap of black ashes covered the groundnothing more but on looking round we could discover no sign of human beings having recently visited the spot a rank growth of grass and herbage now covered the once clear space surrounding the site of the dwelling and the ashheap looked as if it had been lying there for a month at least as to what had become of rima the old man could say no word he sat down on the ground overwhelmed at the calamity runis people had been there he could not doubt it and they would come again and he could only look for death at their hands the thought that rima had perished that she was lost was unendurable it could not be no doubt the indians tract come and destroyed the house during our absence but she had returned and they had gone away again to come no more she would be somewhere in the forest perhaps not far off impatiently waiting our return the old man stared at me while i spoke he appeared to be in a kind of stupor and made no reply and at last leaving him still sitting on the ground i went into the wood to look for rima  as i walked there occasionally stopping to peer into some shadowy glade or opening and to listen i was tempted again and again to call the name of her i sought aloud and still the fear that by so doing i might bring some hidden danger on myself perhaps on her made me silent a strange melancholy rested on the forest a quietude seldom broken by a distant birds cry how i asked myself should i ever find her in that wide forest while i moved about in that silent cautious way my only hope was that she would find me it occurred to me that the most likely place to seek her would be some of the old haunts known to us both where we had talked together i thought first of the mora tree where she had hidden herself from me and thither i directed my steps about this tree and within its shade i lingered for upwards of an hour and finally casting my eyes up into the great dim cloud of green and purple leaves i softly called rima rima if you have seen me and have concealed yourself from me in your hidingplace in mercy answer mein mercy come down to me now but rima answered not nor threw down any red glowing leaves to mock me only the wind high up whispered something low and sorrowful in the foliage and turning i wandered away at random into the deeper shadows  by and by i was startled by the long piercing cry of a wildfowl sounding strangely loud in the silence and no sooner was the air still again than it struck me that no bird had uttered that cry the indian is a good mimic of animal voices but practice had made me able to distinguish the true from the false birdnote for a minute or so i stood still at a loss what to do then moved on again with greater caution scarcely breathing straining my sight to pierce the shadowy depths all at once i gave a great start for directly before me on the projecting root in the deeper shade of a tree sat a dark motionless human form i stood still watching it for some time not yet knowing that it had seen me when all doubts were put to flight by the form rising and deliberately advancinga naked indian with a zabatana in his hand as he came up out of the deeper shade i recognized piake the surly elder brother of my friend kuako  it was a great shock to meet him in the wood but i had no time to reflect just then i only remembered that i had deeply offended him and his people that they probably looked on me as an enemy and would think little of taking my life it was too late to attempt to escape by flight i was spent with my long journey and the many privations i had suffered while he stood there in his full strength with a deadly weapon in his hand  nothing was left but to put a bold face on greet him in a friendly way and invent some plausible story to account for my action in secretly leaving the village  he was now standing still silently regarding me and glancing round i saw that he was not alone at a distance of about forty yards on my right hand two other dusky forms appeared watching me from the deep shade  piake i cried advancing three or four steps  you have returned he answered but without moving where from  riolama  he shook his head then asked where it was  twenty days towards the setting sun i said as he remained silent i added i heard that i could find gold in the mountains there an old man told me and we went to look for gold  what did you find  nothing  ah  and so our conversation appeared to be at an end but after a few moments my intense desire to discover whether the savages knew aught of rima or not made me hazard a question  do you live here in the forest now i asked  he shook his head and after a while said we come to kill animals  you are like me now i returned quickly you fear nothing  he looked distrustfully at me then came a little nearer and said you are very brave i should not have gone twenty days journey with no weapons and only an old man for companion what weapons did you have  i saw that he feared me and wished to make sure that i had it not in my power to do him some injury no weapon except my knife i replied with assumed carelessness with that i raised my cloak so as to let him see for himself turning my body round before him have you found my pistol i added  he shook his head but he appeared less suspicious now and came close up to me how do you get food where are you going he asked  i answered boldly food i am nearly starving i am going to the village to see if the women have got any meat in the pot and to tell runi all i have done since i left him  he looked at me keenly a little surprised at my confidence perhaps then said that he was also going back and would accompany me one of the other men now advanced blowpipe in hand to join us and leaving the wood we started to walk across the savannah  it was hateful to have to recross that savannah again to leave the woodland shadows where i had hoped to find rima but i was powerless i was a prisoner once more the lost captive recovered and not yet pardoned probably never to be pardoned only by means of my own cunning could i be saved and nuflo poor old man must take his chance  again and again as we tramped over the barren ground and when we climbed the ridge i was compelled to stand still to recover breath explaining to piake that i had been travelling day and night with no meat during the last three days so that i was exhausted this was an exaggeration but it was necessary to account in some way for the faintness i experienced during our walk caused less by fatigue and want of food than by anguish of mind  at intervals i talked to him asking after all the other members of the community by name at last thinking only of rima i asked him if any other person or persons besides his people came to the wood now or lived there  he said no once i said there was a daughter of the didi a girl you all feared is she there now  he looked at me with suspicion and then shook his head i dared not press him with more questions but after an interval he said plainly she is not there now  and i was forced to believe him for had rima been in the wood they would not have been there she was not there this much i had discovered had she then lost her way or perished on that long journey from riolama or had she returned only to fall into the hands of her cruel enemies my heart was heavy in me but if these devils in human shape knew more than they had told me i must i said hide my anxiety and wait patiently to find it out should they spare my life and if they spared me and had not spared that other sacred life interwoven with mine the time would come when they would find too late that they had taken to their bosom a worse devil than themselves    chapter xix  my arrival at the village created some excitement but i was plainly no longer regarded as a friend or one of the family runi was absent and i looked forward to his return with no little apprehension he would doubtless decide my fate kuako was also away the others sat or stood about the great room staring at me in silence i took no notice but merely asked for food then for my hammock which i hung up in the old place and lying down i fell into a doze runi made his appearance at dusk i rose and greeted him but he spoke no word and until he went to his hammock sat in sullen silence ignoring my presence  on the following day the crisis came we were once more gathered in the roomall but kuako and another of the men who had not yet returned from some expeditionand for the space of half an hour not a word was spoken by anyone something was expected even the children were strangely still and whenever one of the pet birds strayed in at the open door uttering a little plaintive note it was chased out again but without a sound at length runi straightened himself on his seat and fixed his eyes on me then cleared his throat and began a long harangue delivered in the loud monotonous singsong which i knew so well and which meant that the occasion was an important one and as is usual in such efforts the same thought and expressions were used again and again and yet again with dull angry insistence the orator of guayana to be impressive must be long however little he may have to say strange as it may seem i listened critically to him not without a feeling of scorn at his lower intelligence but i was easier in my mind now from the very fact of his addressing such a speech to me i was convinced that he wished not to take my life and would not do so if i could clear myself of the suspicion of treachery  i was a white man he said they were indians nevertheless they had treated me well they had fed me and sheltered me they had done a great deal for me they had taught me the use of the zabatana and had promised to make one for me asking for nothing in return they had also promised me a wife how had i treated them i had deserted them going away secretly to a distance leaving them in doubt as to my intentions how could they tell why i had gone and where they had an enemy managa was his name he and his people hated them i knew that he wished them evil i knew where to find him for they had told me that was what they thought when i suddenly left them now i returned to them saying that i had been to riolama he knew where riolama was although he had never been there it was so far why did i go to riolama it was a bad place there were indians there a few but they were not good indians like those of parahuari and would kill a white man had i gone there why had i gone there  he finished at last and it was my turn to speak but he had given me plenty of time and my reply was ready i have heard you i said your words are good words they are the words of a friend i am the white mans friend you say is he my friend he went away secretly saying no word why did he go without speaking to his friend who had treated him well has he been to my enemy managa perhaps he is a friend of my enemy where has he been i must now answer these things saying true words to my friend you are an indian i am a white man you do not know all the white mans thoughts these are the things i wish to tell you in the white mans country are two kinds of men there are the rich men who have all that a man can desirehouses made of stone full of fine things fine clothes fine weapons fine ornaments and they have horses cattle sheep dogseverything they desire because they have gold for with gold the white man buys everything the other kind of white men are the poor who have no gold and cannot buy or have anything they must work hard for the rich man for the little food he gives them and a rag to cover their nakedness and if he gives them shelter they have it if not they must lie down in the rain out of doors in my own country a hundred days from here i was the son of a great chief who had much gold and when he died it was all mine and i was rich but i had an enemy one worse than managa for he was rich and had many people and in a war his people overcame mine and he took my gold and all i possessed making me poor the indian kills his enemy but the white man takes his gold and that is worse than death then i said i have been a rich man and now i am poor and must work like a dog for some rich man for the sake of the little food he will throw me at the end of each day no i cannot do it i will go away and live with the indians so that those who have seen me a rich man shall never see me working like a dog for a master and cry out and mock at me for the indians are not like white men they have no gold they are not rich and poor all are alike one roof covers them from the rain and sun all have weapons which they make all kill birds in the forest and catch fish in the rivers and the women cook the meat and all eat from one pot and with the indians i will be an indian and hunt in the forest and eat with them and drink with them then i left my country and came here and lived with you runi and was well treated and now why did i go away this i have now to tell you after i had been here a certain time i went over there to the forest you wished me not to go because of an evil thing a daughter of the didi that lived there but i feared nothing and went there i met an old man who talked to me in the white mans language he had travelled and seen much and told me one strange thing on a mountain at riolama he told me that he had seen a great lump of gold as much as a man could carry and when i heard this i said with the gold i could return to my country and buy weapons for myself and all my people and go to war with my enemy and deprive him of all his possessions and serve him as he served me i asked the old man to take me to riolama and when he had consented i went away from here without saying a word so as not to be prevented it is far to riolama and i had no weapons but i feared nothing i said if i must fight i must fight and if i must be killed i must be killed but when i got to riolama i found no gold there was only a yellow stone which the old man had mistaken for gold it was yellow like gold but it would buy nothing therefore i came back to parahuari again to my friend and if he is angry with me still because i went away without informing him let him say go and seek elsewhere for a new friend for i am your friend no longer  i concluded thus boldly because i did not wish him to know that i had suspected him of harbouring any sinister designs or that i looked on our quarrel as a very serious one when i had finished speaking he emitted a sound which expressed neither approval nor disapproval but only the fact that he had heard me but i was satisfied his expression had undergone a favourable change it was less grim after a while he remarked with a peculiar twitching of the mouth which might have developed into a smile the white man will do much to get gold you walked twenty days to see a yellow stone that would buy nothing it was fortunate that he took this view of the case which was flattering to his indian nature and perhaps touched his sense of the ludicrous at all events he said nothing to discredit my story to which they had all listened with profound interest  from that time it seemed to be tacitly agreed to let bygones be bygones and i could see that as the dangerous feeling that had threatened my life diminished the old pleasure they had once found in my company returned but my feelings towards them did not change nor could they while that black and terrible suspicion concerning rima was in my heart i talked again freely with them as if there had been no break in the old friendly relations if they watched me furtively whenever i went out of doors i affected not to see it i set to work to repair my rude guitar which had been broken in my absence and studied to show them a cheerful countenance but when alone or in my hammock hidden from their eyes free to look into my own heart then i was conscious that something new and strange had come into my life that a new nature black and implacable had taken the place of the old and sometimes it was hard to conceal this fury that burnt in me sometimes i felt an impulse to spring like a tiger on one of the indians to hold him fast by the throat until the secret i wished to learn was forced from his lips then to dash his brains out against the stone but they were many and there was no choice but to be cautious and patient if i wished to outwit them with a cunning superior to their own  three days after my arrival at the village kuako returned with his companion i greeted him with affected warmth but was really pleased that he was back believing that if the indians knew anything of rima he among them all would be most likely to tell it  kuako appeared to have brought some important news which he discussed with runi and the others and on the following day i noticed that preparations for an expedition were in progress spears and bows and arrows were got ready but not blowpipes and i knew by this that the expedition would not be a hunting one having discovered so much also that only four men were going out i called kuako aside and begged him to let me go with them he seemed pleased at the proposal and at once repeated it to runi who considered for a little and then consented  by and by he said touching his bow you cannot fight with our weapons what will you do if we meet an enemy  i smiled and returned that i would not run away all i wished to show him was that his enemies were my enemies that i was ready to fight for my friend  he was pleased at my words and said no more and gave me no weapons next morning however when we set out before daylight i made the discovery that he was carrying my revolver fastened to his waist he had concealed it carefully under the one simple garment he wore but it bulged slightly and so the secret was betrayed i had never believed that he had lost it and i was convinced that he took it now with the object of putting it into my hands at the last moment in case of meeting with an enemy  from the village we travelled in a northwesterly direction and before noon camped in a grove of dwarf trees where we remained until the sun was low then continued our walk through a rather barren country at night we camped again beside a small stream only a few inches deep and after a meal of smoked meat and parched maize prepared to sleep till dawn on the next day  sitting by the fire i resolved to make a first attempt to discover from kuako anything concerning rima which might be known to him instead of lying down when the others did i remained seated my guardian also sittingno doubt waiting for me to lie down first presently i moved nearer to him and began a conversation in a low voice anxious not to rouse the attention of the other men  once you said that oalava would be given to me for a wife i began some day i shall want a wife  he nodded approval and remarked sententiously that the desire to possess a wife was common to all men  what has been left to me i said despondingly and spreading out my hands my pistol gone and did i not give runi the tinderbox and the little box with a cock painted on it to you i had no returnnot even the blowpipe how then can i get me a wife  he like the othersdullwitted savage that he washad come to the belief that i was incapable of the cunning and duplicity they practiced i could not see a green parrot sitting silent and motionless amidst the green foliage as they could i had not their preternatural keenness of sight and in like manner to deceive with lies and false seeming was their faculty and not mine he fell readily into the trap my return to practical subjects pleased him he bade me hope that oalava might yet be mine in spite of my poverty it was not always necessary to have things to get a wife to be able to maintain her was enough some day i would be like one of themselves able to kill animals and catch fish besides did not runi wish to keep me with them for other reasons but he could not keep me wifeless i could do much i could sing and make music i was brave and feared nothing i could teach the children to fight  he did not say however that i could teach anything to one of his years and attainments  i protested that he gave me too much praise that they were just as brave did they not show a courage equal to mine by going every day to hunt in that wood which was inhabited by the daughter of the didi  i came to this subject with fear and trembling but he took it quietly he shook his head and then all at once began to tell me how they first came to go there to hunt he said that a few days after i had secretly disappeared two men and a woman returning home from a distant place where they had been on a visit to a relation stopped at the village these travellers related that two days journey from ytaioa they had met three persons travelling in an opposite direction an old man with a white beard followed by two yellow dogs a young man in a big cloak and a strangelooking girl thus it came to be known that i had left the wood with the old man and the daughter of the didi it was great news to them for they did not believe that we had any intention of returning and at once they began to hunt in the wood and went there every day killing birds monkeys and other animals in numbers  his words had begun to excite me greatly but i studied to appear calm and only slightly interested so as to draw him on to say more  then we returned i said at last but only two of us and not together i left the old man on the road and she left us in riolama she went away from us into the mountainswho knows whither  but she came back he returned with a gleam of devilish satisfaction in his eyes that made the blood run cold in my veins  it was hard to dissemble still to tempt him to say something that would madden me no no i answered after considering his words she feared to return she went away to hide herself in the great mountains beyond riolama she could not come back  but she came back he persisted with that triumphant gleam in his eyes once more under my cloak my hand had clutched my knifehandle but i strove hard against the fierce almost maddening impulse to pluck it out and bury it quick as lightning in his accursed throat  he continued seven days before you returned we saw her in the wood we were always expecting watching always afraid and when hunting we were three and four together on that day i and three others saw her it was in an open place where the trees are big and wide apart we started up and chased her when she ran from us but feared to shoot and in one moment she climbed up into a small tree then like a monkey passed from its highest branches into a big tree we could not see her there but she was there in the big tree for there was no other tree nearno way of escape three of us sat down to watch and the other went back to the village he was long gone we were just going to leave the tree fearing that she would do us some injury when he came back and with him all the others men women and children they brought axes and knives then runi said let no one shoot an arrow into the tree thinking to hit her for the arrow would be caught in her hand and thrown back at him we must burn her in the tree there is no way to kill her except by fire then we went round and round looking up but could see nothing and someone said she has escaped flying like a bird from the tree but runi answered that fire would show so we cut down the small tree and lopped the branches off and heaped them round the big trunk then at a distance we cut down ten more small trees and afterwards further away ten more and then others and piled them all round tree after tree until the pile reached as far from the trunk as that and here he pointed to a bush forty to fifty yards from where we sat  the feeling with which i had listened to this recital had become intolerable the sweat ran from me in streams i shivered like a person in a fit of ague and clenched my teeth together to prevent them from rattling i must drink i said cutting him short and rising to my feet he also rose but did not follow me when with uncertain steps i made my way to the waterside which was ten or twelve yards away lying prostrate on my chest i took a long draught of clear cold water and held my face for a few moments in the current it sent a chill through me drying my wet skin and bracing me for the concluding part of the hideous narrative slowly i stepped back to the fireside and sat down again while he resumed his old place at my side  you burnt the tree down i said finish telling me now and let me sleepmy eyes are heavy  yes while the men cut and brought trees the women and children gathered dry stuff in the forest and brought it in their arms and piled it round then they set fire to it on all sides laughing and shouting burn burn daughter of the didi at length all the lower branches of the big tree were on fire and the trunk was on fire but above it was still green and we could see nothing but the flames went up higher and higher with a great noise and at last from the top of the tree out of the green leaves came a great cry like the cry of a bird abel abel and then looking we saw something fall through leaves and smoke and flame it fell like a great white bird killed with an arrow and falling to the earth and fell into the flames beneath and it was the daughter of the didi and she was burnt to ashes like a moth in the flames of a fire and no one has ever heard or seen her since  it was well for me that he spoke rapidly and finished quickly even before he had quite concluded i drew my cloak round my face and stretched myself out and i suppose that he at once followed my example but i had grown blind and deaf to outward things just then my heart no longer throbbed violently it fluttered and seemed to grow feebler and feebler in its action i remember that there was a dull rushing sound in my ears that i gasped for breath that my life seemed ebbing away after these horrible sensations had passed i remained quiet for about half an hour and during this time the picture of that last act in the hateful tragedy grew more and more distinct and vivid in my mind until i seemed to be actually gazing on it until my ears were filled with the hissing and crackling of the fire the exultant shouts of the savages and above all the last piercing cry of abel abel from the cloud of burning foliage i could not endure it longer and rose at last to my feet i glanced at kuako lying two or three yards away and he like the others was or appeared to be in a deep sleep he was lying on his back and his dark firelit face looked as still and unconscious as a face of stone now was my chance to escapeif to escape was my wish yes for i now possessed the coveted knowledge and nothing more was to be gained by keeping with my deadly enemies and now most fortunately for me they had brought me far on the road to that place of the five hills where managa livedmanaga whose name had been often in my mind since my return to parahuari glancing away from kuakos still stonelike face i caught sight of that pale solitary star which runi had pointed out to me low down in the northwestern sky when i had asked him where his enemy lived in that direction we had been travelling since leaving the village surely if i walked all night by tomorrow i could reach managas huntingground and be safe and think over what i had heard and on what i had to do  i moved softly away a few steps then thinking that it would be well to take a spear in my hand i turned back and was surprised and startled to notice that kuako had moved in the interval he had turned over on his side and his face was now towards me his eyes appeared closed but he might be only feigning sleep and i dared not go back to pick up the spear after a moments hesitation i moved on again and after a second glance back and seeing that he did not stir i waded cautiously across the stream walked softly twenty or thirty yards and then began to run at intervals i paused to listen for a moment and presently i heard a pattering sound as of footsteps coming swiftly after me i instantly concluded that kuako had been awake all the time watching my movements and that he was now following me i now put forth my whole speed and while thus running could distinguish no sound that he would miss me for it was very dark although with a starry sky above was my only hope for with no weapon except my knife my chances would be small indeed should he overtake me besides he had no doubt roused the others before starting and they would be close behind there were no bushes in that place to hide myself in and let them pass me and presently to make matters worse the character of the soil changed and i was running over level clayey ground so white with a salt efflorescence that a dark object moving on it would show conspicuously at a distance here i paused to look back and listen when distinctly came the sound of footsteps and the next moment i made out the vague form of an indian advancing at a rapid rate of speed and with his uplifted spear in his hand in the brief pause i had made he had advanced almost to within hurling distance of me and turning i sped on again throwing off my cloak to ease my flight the next time i looked back he was still in sight but not so near he had stopped to pick up my cloak which would be his now and this had given me a slight advantage i fled on and had continued running for a distance perhaps of fifty yards when an object rushed past me tearing through the flesh of my left arm close to the shoulder on its way and not knowing that i was not badly wounded nor how near my pursuer might be i turned in desperation to meet him and saw him not above twentyfive yards away running towards me with something bright in his hand it was kuako and after wounding me with his spear he was about to finish me with his knife o fortunate young savage after such a victory and with that noble blue cloth cloak for trophy and covering what fame and happiness will be yours a change swift as lightning had come over me a sudden exultation i was wounded but my right hand was sound and clutched a knife as good as his and we were on an equality i waited for him calmly all weakness grief despair had vanished all feelings except a terrible raging desire to spill his accursed blood and my brain was clear and my nerves like steel and i remembered with something like laughter our old amusing encounters with rapiers of wood ah that was only making believe and childish play this was reality could any white man deprived of his treacherous farkilling weapon meet the resolute savage face to face and foot to foot and equal him with the old primitive weapons poor youth this delusion will cost you dear it was scarcely an equal contest when he hurled himself against me with only his savage strength and courage to match my skill in a few moments he was lying at my feet pouring out his life blood on that white thirsty plain from his prostrate form i turned the wet red knife in my hand to meet the others still thinking that they were on the track and close at hand why had he stooped to pick up the cloak if they were not followingif he had not been afraid of losing it i turned only to receive their spears to die with my face to them nor was the thought of death terrible to me i could die calmly now after killing my first assailant but had i indeed killed him i asked hearing a sound like a groan escape from his lips quickly stooping i once more drove my weapon to the hilt in his prostrate form and when he exhaled a deep sigh and his frame quivered and the blood spurted afresh i experienced a feeling of savage joy and still no sound of hurrying footsteps came to my listening ears and no vague forms appeared in the darkness i concluded that he had either left them sleeping or that they had not followed in the right direction taking up the cloak i was about to walk on when i noticed the spear he had thrown at me lying where it had fallen some yards away and picking that up also i went on once more still keeping the guiding star before me    chapter xx  that good fight had been to me like a draught of wine and made me for a while oblivious of my loss and of the pain from my wound but the glow and feeling of exultation did not last the lacerated flesh smarted i was weak from loss of blood and oppressed with sensations of fatigue if my foes had appeared on the scene they would have made an easy conquest of me but they came not and i continued to walk on slowly and painfully pausing often to rest  at last recovering somewhat from my faint condition and losing all fear of being overtaken my sorrow revived in full force and thought returned to madden me  alas this bright being like no other in its divine brightness so long in the making now no more than a dead leaf a little dust lost and forgotten for everoh pitiless oh cruel  but i knew it all beforethis law of nature and of necessity against which all revolt is idle often had the remembrance of it filled me with ineffable melancholy only now it seemed cruel beyond all cruelty  not nature the instrument not the keen sword that cuts into the bleeding tissues but the hand that wields itthe unseen unknown something or person that manifests itself in the horrible workings of nature  did you know beloved at the last in that intolerable heat in that moment of supreme anguish that he is unlistening unhelpful as the stars that you cried not to him to me was your cry but your poor frail fellow creature was not there to save or failing that to cast himself into the flames and perish with you hating god  thus in my insufferable pain i spoke aloud alone in that solitary place a bleeding fugitive in the dark night looking up at the stars i cursed the author of my being and called on him to take back the abhorred gift of life  yet according to my philosophy how vain it was all my bitterness and hatred and defiance were as empty as ineffectual as utterly futile as are the supplications of the meek worshipper and no more than the whisper of a leaf the light whirr of an insects wing whether i loved him who was over all as when i thanked him on my knees for guiding me to where i had heard so sweet and mysterious a melody or hated and defied him as now it all came from himlove and hate good and evil  but i knowi knew thenthat in one thing my philosophy was false that it was not the whole truth that though my cries did not touch nor come near him they would yet hurt me and just as a prisoner maddened at his unjust fate beats against the stone walls of his cell until he falls back bruised and bleeding to the floor so did i wilfully bruise my own soul and knew that those wounds i gave myself would not heal  of that night the beginning of the blackest period of my life i shall say no more and over subsequent events i shall pass quickly  morning found me at a distance of many miles from the scene of my duel with the indian in a broken hilly country varied with savannah and open forest i was wellnigh spent with my long march and felt that unless food was obtained before many hours my situation would be indeed desperate with labour i managed to climb to the summit of a hill about three hundred feet high in order to survey the surrounding country and found that it was one of a group of five and conjectured that these were the five hills of uritay and that i was in the neighbourhood of managas village coming down i proceeded to the next hill which was higher and before reaching it came to a stream in a narrow valley dividing the hills and proceeding along its banks in search of a crossingplace i came full in sight of the settlement sought for as i approached people were seen moving hurriedly about and by the time i arrived walking slowly and painfully seven or eight men were standing before the village some with spears in their hands the women and children behind them all staring curiously at me drawing near i cried out in a somewhat feeble voice that i was seeking for managa whereupon a grayhaired man stepped forth spear in hand and replied that he was managa and demanded to know why i sought him i told him a part of my storyenough to show that i had a deadly feud with runi that i had escaped from him after killing one of his people  i was taken in and supplied with food my wound was examined and dressed and then i was permitted to lie down and sleep while managa with half a dozen of his people hurriedly started to visit the scene of my fight with kuako not only to verify my story but partly with the hope of meeting runi i did not see him again until the next morning when he informed me that he had found the spot where i had been overtaken that the dead man had been discovered by the others and carried back towards parahuari he had followed the trace for some distance and he was satisfied that runi had come thus far in the first place only with the intention of spying on him  my arrival and the strange tidings i had brought had thrown the village into a great commotion it was evident that from that time managa lived in constant apprehension of a sudden attack from his old enemy this gave me great satisfaction it was my study to keep the feeling alive and more than that to drop continual hints of his enemys secret murderous purpose until he was wrought up to a kind of frenzy of mingled fear and rage and being of a suspicious and somewhat truculent temper he one day all at once turned on me as the immediate cause of his miserable state suspecting perhaps that i only wished to make an instrument of him but i was strangely bold and careless of danger then and only mocked at his rage telling him proudly that i feared him not that runi his mortal enemy and mine feared not him but me that runi knew perfectly well where i had taken refuge and would not venture to make his meditated attack while i remained in his village but would wait for my departure kill me managa i cried smiting my chest as i stood facing him kill me and the result will be that he will come upon you unawares and murder you all as he has resolved to do sooner or later  after that speech he glared at me in silence then flung down the spear he had snatched up in his sudden rage and stalked out of the house and into the wood but before long he was back again seated in his old place brooding on my words with a face black as night  it is painful to recall that secret dark chapter of my lifethat period of moral insanity but i wish not to be a hypocrite conscious or unconscious to delude myself or another with this plea of insanity my mind was very clear just then past and present were clear to me the future clearest of all i could measure the extent of my action and speculate on its future effect and my sense of right or wrongof individual responsibilitywas more vivid than at any other period of my life can i even say that i was blinded by passion driven perhaps but certainly not blinded for no reaction or submission had followed on that furious revolt against the unknown being personal or not that is behind nature in whose existence i believed i was still in revolt i would hate him and show my hatred by being like him as he appears to us reflected in that mirror of nature had he given me good giftsthe sense of right and wrong and sweet humanity the beautiful sacred flower he had caused to grow in me i would crush ruthlessly its beauty and fragrance and grace would be dead for ever there was nothing evil nothing cruel and contrary to my nature that i would not be guilty of glorying in my guilt this was not the temper of a few days i remained for close upon two months at managas village never repenting nor desisting in my efforts to induce the indians to join me in that most barbarous adventure on which my heart was set  i succeeded in the end it would have been strange if i had not the horrible details need not be given managa did not wait for his enemy but fell on him unexpectedly an hour after nightfall in his own village if i had really been insane during those two months if some cloud had been on me some demoniacal force dragging me on the cloud and insanity vanished and the constraint was over in one moment when that hellish enterprise was completed it was the sight of an old woman lying where she had been struck down the fire of the blazing house lighting her wideopen glassy eyes and white hair dabbled in blood which suddenly as by a miracle wrought this change in my brain for they were all dead at last old and young all who had lighted the fire round that great green tree in which rima had taken refuge who had danced round the blaze shouting burn burn  at the moment my glance fell on that prostrate form i paused and stood still trembling like a person struck with a sudden pang in the heart who thinks that his last moment has come to him unawares after a while i slunk away out of the great circle of firelight into the thick darkness beyond instinctively i turned towards the forests across the savannahmy forest again and fled away from the noise and the sight of flames never pausing until i found myself within the black shadow of the trees into the deeper blackness of the interior i dared not venture on the border i paused to ask myself what i did there alone in the nighttime sitting down i covered my face with my hands as if to hide it more effectually than it could be hidden by night and the forest shadows what horrible thing what calamity that frightened my soul to think of had fallen on me the revulsion of feeling the unspeakable horror the remorse was more than i could bear i started up with a cry of anguish and would have slain myself to escape at that moment but nature is not always and utterly cruel and on this occasion she came to my aid consciousness forsook me and i lived not again until the light of early morning was in the east then found myself lying on the wet herbagewet with rain that had lately fallen my physical misery was now so great that it prevented me from dwelling on the scenes witnessed on the previous evening nature was again merciful in this i only remembered that it was necessary to hide myself in case the indians should be still in the neighbourhood and pay the wood a visit slowly and painfully i crept away into the forest and there sat for several hours scarcely thinking at all in a halfstupefied condition at noon the sun shone out and dried the wood i felt no hunger only a vague sense of bodily misery and with it the fear that if i left my hidingplace i might meet some human creature face to face this fear prevented me from stirring until the twilight came when i crept forth and made my way to the border of the forest to spend the night there whether sleep visited me during the dark hours or not i cannot say day and night my condition seemed the same i experienced only a dull sensation of utter misery which seemed in spirit and flesh alike an inability to think clearly or for more than a few moments consecutively about anything scenes in which i had been principal actor came and went as in a dream when the will slumbers now with devilish ingenuity and persistence i was working on managas mind now standing motionless in the forest listening for that sweet mysterious melody now staring aghast at old claclas wideopen glassy eyes and white hair dabbled in blood then suddenly in the cave at riolama i was fondly watching the slow return of life and colour to rimas still face  when morning came again i felt so weak that a vague fear of sinking down and dying of hunger at last roused me and sent me forth in quest of food i moved slowly and my eyes were dim to see but i knew so well where to seek for small morselssmall edible roots and leafstalks berries and drops of congealed gumthat it would have been strange in that rich forest if i had not been able to discover something to stay my famine it was little but it sufficed for the day once more nature was merciful to me for that diligent seeking among the concealing leaves left no interval for thought every chance morsel gave a momentary pleasure and as i prolonged my search my steps grew firmer the dimness passed from my eyes i was more forgetful of self more eager and like a wild animal with no thought or feeling beyond its immediate wants fatigued at the end i fell asleep as soon as darkness brought my busy rambles to a close and did not wake until another morning dawned  my hunger was extreme now the wailing notes of a pair of small birds persistently flitting round me or perched with gaping bills and wings trembling with agitation served to remind me that it was now breedingtime also that rima had taught me to find a small birds nest she found them only to delight her eyes with the sight but they would be food for me the crystal and yellow fluid in the gemlike white or blue or redspeckled shells would help to keep me alive all day i hunted listening to every note and cry watching the motions of every winged thing and found besides gums and fruits over a score of nests containing eggs mostly of small birds and although the labour was great and the scratches many i was well satisfied with the result  a few days later i found a supply of haima gum and eagerly began picking it from the tree not that it could be used but the thought of the brilliant light it gave was so strong in my mind that mechanically i gathered it all the possession of this gum when night closed round me again produced in me an intense longing for artificial light and warmth the darkness was harder than ever to endure i envied the fireflies their natural lights and ran about in the dusk to capture a few and hold them in the hollow of my two hands for the sake of their cold fitful flashes on the following day i wasted two or three hours trying to get fire in the primitive method with dry wood but failed and lost much time and suffered more than ever from hunger in consequence yet there was fire in everything even when i struck at hard wood with my knife sparks were emitted if i could only arrest those wonderful heat and lightgiving sparks and all at once as if i had just lighted upon some new wonderful truth it occurred to me that with my steel huntingknife and a piece of flint fire could be obtained immediately i set about preparing tinder with dry moss rotten wood and wild cotton and in a short time i had the wished fire and heaped wood dry and green on it to make it large i nursed it well and spent the night beside it and it also served to roast some huge white grubs which i had found in the rotten wood of a prostrate trunk the sight of these great grubs had formerly disgusted me but they tasted good to me now and stayed my hunger and that was all i looked for in my wild forest food  for a long time an undefined feeling prevented me from going near the site of nuflos burnt lodge i went there at last and the first thing i did was to go all round the fatal spot cautiously peering into the rank herbage as if i feared a lurking serpent and at length at some distance from the blackened heap i discovered a human skeleton and knew it to be nuflos in his day he had been a great armadillohunter and these quaint carrioneaters had no doubt revenged themselves by devouring his flesh when they found him deadkilled by the savages  having once returned to this spot of many memories i could not quit it again while my wild woodland life lasted here must i have my lair and being here i could not leave that mournful skeleton above ground with labour i excavated a pit to bury it careful not to cut or injure a broadleafed creeper that had begun to spread itself over the spot and after refilling the hole i drew the long trailing stems over the mound  sleep well old man said i when my work was done and these few words implying neither censure nor praise was all the burial service that old nuflo had from me  i then visited the spot where the old man assisted by me had concealed his provisions before starting for riolama and was pleased to find that it had not been discovered by the indians besides the store of tobacco leaf maize pumpkin potatoes and cassava bread and the cooking utensils i found among other things a choppera great acquisition since with it i would be able to cut down small palms and bamboos to make myself a hut  the possession of a supply of food left me time for many things time in the first place to make my own conditions doubtless after them there would be further progression on the old linesluxuries added to necessaries a healthful fruitful life of thought and action combined and at last a peaceful contemplative old age  i cleared away ashes and rubbish and marked out the very spot where rimas separate bower had been for my habitation which i intended to make small in five days it was finished then after lighting a fire i stretched myself out in my dry bed of moss and leaves with a feeling that was almost triumphant let the rain now fall in torrents putting out the fireflys lamp let the wind and thunder roar their loudest and the lightnings smite the earth with intolerable light frightening the poor monkeys in their wet leafy habitations little would i heed it all on my dry bed under my dry palmleaf thatch with glorious fire to keep me company and protect me from my ancient enemy darkness  from that first sleep under shelter i woke refreshed and was not driven by the cruel spur of hunger into the wet forest the wished time had come of rest from labour of leisure for thought resting here just where she had rested night by night clasping a visionary mother in her arms whispering tenderest words in a visionary ear i too now clasped her in my armsa visionary rima how different the nights had seemed when i was without shelter before i had rediscovered fire how had i endured it that strange ghostly gloom of the woods at nighttime full of innumerable strange shapes still and dark yet with something seen at times moving amidst them dark and vague and strange alsoan owl perhaps or bat or great winged moth or nightjar nor had i any choice then but to listen to the nightsounds of the forest and they were various as the daysounds and for every daysound from the faintest lisping and softest trill to the deep boomings and piercing cries there was an analogue always with something mysterious unreal in its tone something proper to the night they were ghostly sounds uttered by the ghosts of dead animals they were a hundred different things by turns but always with a meaning in them which i vainly strove to catchsomething to be interpreted only by a sleeping faculty in us lightly sleeping and now now on the very point of awaking  now the gloom and the mystery were shut out now i had that which stood in the place of pleasure to me and was more than pleasure it was a mournful rapture to lie awake now wishing not for sleep and oblivion hating the thought of daylight that would come at last to drown and scare away my vision to be with rima againmy lost rima recoveredmine mine at last no longer the old vexing doubt nowyou are you and i am iwhy is itthe question asked when our souls were near together like two raindrops side by side drawing irresistibly nearer ever nearer for now they had touched and were not two but one inseparable drop crystallized beyond change not to be disintegrated by time nor shattered by deaths blow nor resolved by any alchemy  i had other company besides this unfailing vision and the bright dancing fire that talked to me in its fantastic fire language it was my custom to secure the door well on retiring grief had perhaps chilled my blood for i suffered less from heat than from cold at this period and the fire seemed grateful all night long i was also anxious to exclude all small winged and creeping nightwanderers but to exclude them entirely proved impossible through a dozen invisible chinks they would find their way to me also some entered by day to lie concealed until after nightfall a monstrous hairy hermit spider found an asylum in a dusky corner of the hut under the thatch and day after day he was there all day long sitting close and motionless but at dark he invariably disappearedwho knows on what murderous errand his hue was a deep deadleaf yellow with a black and grey pattern borrowed from some wild cat and so large was he that his great outspread hairy legs radiating from the flat disk of his body would have covered a mans open hand it was easy to see him in my small interior often in the nighttime my eyes would stray to his corner never to encounter that strange hairy figure but daylight failed not to bring him he troubled me but now for rimas sake i could slay no living thing except from motives of hunger i had it in my mind to injure himto strike off one of his legs which would not be missed much as they were manyso as to make him go away and return no more to so inhospitable a place but courage failed me he might come stealthily back at night to plunge his long crooked farces into my throat poisoning my blood with fever and delirium and black death so i left him alone and glanced furtively and fearfully at him hoping that he had not divined any thoughts thus we lived on unsocially together more companionable but still in an uncomfortable way were the large crawling running insectscrickets beetles and others they were shapely and black and polished and ran about here and there on the floor just like intelligent little horseless carriages then they would pause with their immovable eyes fixed on me seeing or in some mysterious way divining my presence their pliant horns waving up and down like delicate instruments used to test the air centipedes and millipedes in dozens came too and were not welcome i feared not their venom but it was a weariness to see them for they seemed no living things but the vertebrae of snakes and eels and long slim fishes dead and desiccated made to move mechanically over walls and floor by means of some jugglery of nature i grew skilful at picking them up with a pair of pliant green twigs to thrust them into the outer darkness  one night a moth fluttered in and alighted on my hand as i sat by the fire causing me to hold my breath as i gazed on it its forewings were pale grey with shadings dark and light written all over in finest characters with some twilight mystery or legend but the round underwings were clear amberyellow veined like a leaf with red and purple veins a thing of such exquisite chaste beauty that the sight of it gave me a sudden shock of pleasure very soon it flew up circling about and finally lighted on the palmleaf thatch directly over the fire the heat i thought would soon drive it from the spot and rising i opened the door so that it might find its way out again into its own cool dark flowery world and standing by the open door i turned and addressed it o nightwanderer of the pale beautiful wings go forth and should you by chance meet her somewhere in the shadowy depths revisiting her old haunts be my messenger thus much had i spoken when the frail thing loosened its hold to fall without a flutter straight and swift into the white blaze beneath i sprang forward with a shriek and stood staring into the fire my whole frame trembling with a sudden terrible emotion even thus had rima fallenfallen from the great heightinto the flames that instantly consumed her beautiful flesh and bright spirit o cruel nature  a moth that perished in the flame an indistinct faint sound a dream in the night the semblance of a shadowy form moving mistlike in the twilight gloom of the forest would suddenly bring back a vivid memory the old anguish to break for a while the calm of that period it was calm then after the storm nevertheless my health deteriorated i ate little and slept little and grew thin and weak when i looked down on the dark glassy forest pool where rima would look no more to see herself so much better than in the small mirror of her lovers pupil it showed me a gaunt ragged man with a tangled mass of black hair falling over his shoulders the bones of his face showing through the deadlooking sunparched skin the sunken eyes with a gleam in them that was like insanity  to see this reflection had a strangely disturbing effect on me a torturing voice would whisper in my ear yes you are evidently going mad by and by you will rush howling through the forest only to drop down at last and die and no person will ever find and bury your bones old nuflo was more fortunate in that he perished first  a lying voice i retorted in sudden anger my faculties were never keener than now not a fruit can ripen but i find it if a small bird darts by with a feather or straw in its bill i mark its flight and it will be a lucky bird if i do not find its nest in the end could a savage born in the forest do more he would starve where i find food  ay yes there is nothing wonderful in that answered the voice the stranger from a cold country suffers less from the heat when days are hottest than the indian who knows no other climate but mark the result the stranger dies while the indian sweating and gasping for breath survives in like manner the lowminded savage cut off from all human fellowship keeps his faculties to the end while your finer brain proves your ruin  i cut from a tree a score of long blunt thorns tough and black as whalebone and drove them through a strip of wood in which i had burnt a row of holes to receive them and made myself a comb and combed out my long tangled hair to improve my appearance  it is not the tangled condition of your hair persisted the voice but your eyes so wild and strange in their expression that show the approach of madness make your locks as smooth as you like and add a garland of those scarlet starshaped blossoms hanging from the bush behind youcrown yourself as you crowned old claclabut the crazed look will remain just the same  and being no longer able to reply rage and desperation drove me to an act which only seemed to prove that the hateful voice had prophesied truly taking up a stone i hurled it down on the water to shatter the image i saw there as if it had been no faithful reflection of myself but a travesty cunningly made of enamelled clay or some other material and put there by some malicious enemy to mock me    chapter xxi  many days had passed since the hut was madehow many may not be known since i notched no stick and knotted no cordyet never in my rambles in the wood had i seen that desolate ashheap where the fire had done its work nor had i looked for it on the contrary my wish was never to see it and the fear of coming accidentally upon it made me keep to the old familiar paths but at length one night without thinking of rimas fearful end it all at once occurred to me that the hated savage whose blood i had shed on the white savannah might have only been practicing his natural deceit when he told me that most pitiful story if that were soif he had been prepared with a fictitious account of her death to meet my questionsthen rima might still exist lost perhaps wandering in some distant place exposed to perils day and night and unable to find her way back but living still living her heart on fire with the hope of reunion with me cautiously threading her way through the undergrowth of immeasurable forests spying out the distant villages and hiding herself from the sight of all men as she knew so well how to hide studying the outlines of distant mountains to recognize some familiar landmark at last and so find her way back to the old wood once more even now while i sat there idly musing she might be somewhere in the woodsomewhere near me but after so long an absence full of apprehension waiting in concealment for what tomorrows light might show  i started up and replenished the fire with trembling hands then set the door open to let the welcoming stream out into the wood but rima had done more going out into the black forest in the pitiless storm she had found and led me home could i do less i was quickly out in the shadows of the wood surely it was more than a mere hope that made my heart beat so wildly how could a sensation so strangely sudden so irresistible in its power possess me unless she were living and near can it be can it be that we shall meet again to look again into your divine eyesto hold you again in my arms at last i so changedso different but the old love remains and of all that has happened in your absence i shall tell you nothingnot one word all shall be forgotten nowsufferings madness crime remorse nothing shall ever vex you againnot nuflo who vexed you every day for he is dead nowmurdered only i shall not say thatand i have decently buried his poor old sinful bones we alone together in the woodour wood now the sweet old days again for i know that you would not have it different nor would i  thus i talked to myself mad with the thoughts of the joy that would soon be mine and at intervals i stood still and made the forest echo with my calls rima rima i called again and again and waited for some response and heard only the familiar nightsoundsvoices of insect and bird and tinkling treefrog and a low murmur in the topmost foliage moved by some light breath of wind unfelt below i was drenched with dew bruised and bleeding from falls in the dark and from rocks and thorns and rough branches but had felt nothing gradually the excitement burnt itself out i was hoarse with shouting and ready to drop down with fatigue and hope was dead and at length i crept back to my hut to cast myself on my grass bed and sink into a dull miserable desponding stupor  but on the following morning i was out once more determined to search the forest well since if no evidence of the great fire kuako had described to me existed it would still be possible to believe that he had lied to me and that rima lived i searched all day and found nothing but the area was large and to search it thoroughly would require several days  on the third day i discovered the fatal spot and knew that never again would i behold rima in the flesh that my last hope had indeed been a vain one there could be no mistake just such an open place as the indian had pictured to me was here with giant trees standing apart while one tree stood killed and blackened by fire surrounded by a huge heap sixty or seventy yards across of prostrate charred treetrunks and ashes here and there slender plants had sprung up through the ashes and the omnipresent smallleaved creepers were beginning to throw their pale green embroidery over the blackened trunks i looked long at the vast funeral tree that had a buttressed girth of not less than fifty feet and rose straight as a ships mast with its top about a hundred and fifty feet from the earth what a distance to fall through burning leaves and smoke like a white bird shot dead with a poisoned arrow swift and straight into that sea of flame below how cruel imagination was to turn that desolate ashheap in spite of feathery foliage and embroidery of creepers into roaring leaping flames againto bring those dead savages back men women and childreneven the little ones i had played withto set them yelling around me burn burn oh no this damnable spot must not be her last restingplace if the fire had not utterly consumed her bones as well as sweet tender flesh shrivelling her like a frail whitewinged moth into the finest white ashes mixed inseparably with the ashes of stems and leaves innumerable then whatever remained of her must be conveyed elsewhere to be with me to mingle with my ashes at last  having resolved to sift and examine the entire heap i at once set about my task if she had climbed into the central highest branch and had fallen straight then she would have dropped into the flames not far from the roots and so to begin i made a path to the trunk and when darkness overtook me i had worked all round the tree in a width of three to four yards without discovering any remains at noon on the following day i found the skeleton or at all events the larger bones rendered so fragile by the fierce heat they had been subjected to that they fell to pieces when handled but i was carefulhow carefulto save these last sacred relics all that was now left of rimakissing each white fragment as i lifted it and gathering them all in my old frayed cloak spread out to receive them and when i had recovered them all even to the smallest i took my treasure home  another storm had shaken my soul and had been succeeded by a second calm which was more complete and promised to be more enduring than the first but it was no lethargic calm my brain was more active than ever and by and by it found a work for my hands to do of such a character as to distinguish me from all other forest hermits fugitives from their fellows in that savage land the calcined bones i had rescued were kept in one of the big rudely shaped halfburnt earthen jars which nuflo had used for storing grain and other foodstuff it was of a woodash colour and after i had given up my search for the peculiar fine clay he had used in its manufacturefor it had been in my mind to make a more shapely funeral urn myselfi set to work to ornament its surface a portion of each day was given to this artistic labour and when the surface was covered with a pattern of thorny stems and a trailing creeper with curving leaf and twining tendril and pendent bud and blossom i gave it colour purples and black only were used obtained from the juices of some deeply coloured berries and when a tint or shade or line failed to satisfy me i erased it to do it again and this so often that i never completed my work i might in the proudly modest spirit of the old sculptors have inscribed on the vase the words abel was doing this for was not my ideal beautiful like theirs and the best that my art could do only an imperfect copya rude sketch a serpent was represented wound round the lower portion of the jar dullhued with a chain of irregular black spots or blotches extending along its body and if any person had curiously examined these spots he would have discovered that every other one was a rudely shaped letter and that the letters by being properly divided made the following words  sin vos y siu dios y mi  words that to some might seem wild even insane in their extravagance sung by some ancient forgotten poet or possibly the motto of some lovesick knighterrant whose passion was consumed to ashes long centuries ago but not wild nor insane to me dwelling alone on a vast stony plain in everlasting twilight where there was no motion nor any sound but all things even trees ferns and grasses were stone and in that place i had sat for many a thousand years drawn up and motionless with stony fingers clasped round my legs and forehead resting on my knees and there would i sit unmoving immovable for many a thousand years to comei no longer i in a universe where she was not and god was not  the days went by and to others grouped themselves into weeks and months to me they were only daysnot saturday sunday monday but nameless they were so many and their sum so great that all my previous life all the years i had existed before this solitary time now looked like a small island immeasurably far away scarcely discernible in the midst of that endless desolate waste of nameless days  my stock of provisions had been so long consumed that i had forgotten the flavour of pulse and maize and pumpkins and purple and sweet potatoes for nuflos cultivated patch had been destroyed by the savagesnot a stem not a root had they left and i like the sorrowful man that broods on his sorrow and the artist who thinks only of his art had been improvident and had consumed the seed without putting a portion into the ground only wild food and too little of that found with much seeking and got with many hurts birds screamed at and scolded me branches bruised and thorns scratched me and still worse were the angry clouds of waspish things no bigger than flies buzzbuzz stingsting a serpents tooth has failed to kill me little do i care for your small drops of fiery venom so that i get at the spoilgrubs and honey my white bread and purple wine once my soul hungered after knowledge i took delight in fine thoughts finely expressed i sought them carefully in printed books now only this vile bodily hunger this eager seeking for grubs and honey and ignoble war with little things  a bad hunter i proved after larger game bird and beast despised my snares which took me so many waking hours at night to invent so many daylight hours to make once seeing a troop of monkeys high up in the tall trees i followed and watched them for a long time thinking how royally i should feast if by some strange unheardof accident one were to fall disabled to the ground and be at my mercy but nothing impossible happened and i had no meat what meat did i ever have except an occasional fledgling killed in its cradle or a lizard or small treefrog detected in spite of its green colour among the foliage i would roast the little green minstrel on the coals why not why should he live to tinkle on his mandolin and clash his airy cymbals with no appreciative ear to listen once i had a different and strange kind of meat but the starved stomach is not squeamish i found a serpent coiled up in my way in a small glade and arming myself with a long stick i roused him from his siesta and slew him without mercy rima was not there to pluck the rage from my heart and save his evil life no coral snake this with slim tapering body ringed like a wasp with brilliant colour but thick and blunt with lurid scales blotched with black also a broad flat murderous head with stony icelike whityblue eyes cold enough to freeze a victims blood in its veins and make it sit still like some wideeyed creature carved in stone waiting for the sharp inevitable strokeso swift at last so long in coming o abominable flat head with icycold humanlike fiendlike eyes i shall cut you off and throw you away and away i flung it far enough in all conscience yet i walked home troubled with a fancy that somewhere somewhere down on the black wet soil where it had fallen through all that dense thorny tangle and millions of screening leaves the white lidless living eyes were following me still and would always be following me in all my goings and comings and windings about in the forest and what wonder for were we not alone together in this dreadful solitude i and the serpent eaters of the dust singled out and cursed above all cattle he would not have bitten me and ifaithless cannibalhad murdered him that cursed fancy would live on worming itself into every crevice of my mind the severed head would grow and grow in the nighttime to something monstrous at last the hellish white lidless eyes increasing to the size of two full moons murderer murderer they would say first a murderer of your own fellow creaturesthat was a small crime but god our enemy had made them in his image and he cursed you and we two were together alone and apartyou and i murderer you and i murderer  i tried to escape the tyrannous fancy by thinking of other things and by making light of it the starved bloodless brain i said has strange thoughts i fell to studying the dark thick blunt body in my hands i noticed that the livid rudely blotched scaly surface showed in some lights a lovely play of prismatic colours and growing poetical i said when the wild west wind broke up the rainbow on the flying grey cloud and scattered it over the earth a fragment doubtless fell on this reptile to give it that tender celestial tint for thus it is nature loves all her children and gives to each some beauty little or much only to me her hated stepchild she gives no beauty no grace but stay am i not wronging her did not rima beautiful above all things love me well said she not that i was beautiful  ah yes that was long ago spoke the voice that mocked me by the pool when i combed out my tangled hair long ago when the soul that looked from your eyes was not the accursed thing it is now now rima would start at the sight of them now she would fly in terror from their insane expression  o spiteful voice must you spoil even such appetite as i have for this forktongued spotty food you by day and rima by nightwhat shall i dowhat shall i do  for it had now come to this that the end of each day brought not sleep and dreams but waking visions night by night from my dry grass bed i beheld nuflo sitting in his old doubledup posture his big brown feet close to the white ashessitting silent and miserable i pitied him i owed him hospitality but it seemed intolerable that he should be there it was better to shut my eyes for then rimas arms would be round my neck the silky mist of her hair against my face her flowery breath mixing with my breath what a luminous face was hers even with closeshut eyes i could see it vividly the translucent skin showing the radiant rose beneath the lustrous eyes spiritual and passionate dark as purple wine under their dark lashes then my eyes would open wide no rima in my arms but over there a little way back from the fire just beyond where old nuflo had sat brooding a few minutes ago rima would be standing still and pale and unspeakably sad why does she come to me from the outside darkness to stand there talking to me yet never once lifting her mournful eyes to mine do not believe it abel no that was only a phantom of your brain the whatiwas that you remember so well for do you not see that when i come she fades away and is nothing not thatdo not ask it i know that i once refused to look into your eyes and afterwards in the cave at riolama i looked long and was happyunspeakably happy but nowoh you do not know what you ask you do not know the sorrow that has come into mine that if you once beheld it for very sorrow you would die and you must live but i will wait patiently and we shall be together in the end and see each other without disguise nothing shall divide us only wish not for it soon think not that death will ease your pain and seek it not austerities good works prayers they are not seen they are not heard they are lessthan nothing and there is no intercession i did not know it then but you knew it your life was your own you are not saved nor judged acquit yourselfundo that which you have done which heaven cannot undoand heaven will say no word nor will i you cannot abel you cannot that which you have done is done and yours must be the penalty and the sorrowyours and mineyours and mineyours and mine  this too was a phantom a rima of the mind one of the shapes the everchanging black vapours of remorse and insanity would take and all her mournful sentences were woven out of my own brain i was not so crazed as not to know it only a phantom an illusion yet more real than realityreal as my crime and vain remorse and death to come it was indeed rima returned to tell me that i that loved her had been more cruel to her than her cruellest enemies for they had but tortured and destroyed her body with fire while i had cast this shadow on her soulthis sorrow transcending all sorrows darker than death immitigable eternal  if i could only have faded gradually painlessly growing feebler in body and dimmer in my senses each day to sink at last into sleep but it could not be still the fever in my brain the mocking voice by day the phantoms by night and at last i became convinced that unless i quitted the forest before long death would come to me in some terrible shape but in the feeble condition i was now in and without any provisions to escape from the neighbourhood of parahuari was impossible seeing that it was necessary at starting to avoid the villages where the indians were of the same tribe as runi who would recognize me as the white man who was once his guest and afterwards his implacable enemy i must wait and in spite of a weakened body and a mind diseased struggle still to wrest a scanty subsistence from wild nature  one day i discovered an old prostrate tree buried under a thick growth of creeper and fern the wood of which was nearly or quite rotten as i proved by thrusting my knife to the heft in it no doubt it would contain grubsthose huge white woodborers which now formed an important item in my diet on the following day i returned to the spot with a chopper and a bundle of wedges to split the trunk up but had scarcely commenced operations when an animal startled at my blows rushed or rather wriggled from its hidingplace under the dead wood at a distance of a few yards from me it was a robust roundheaded shortlegged creature about as big as a goodsized cat and clothed in a thick greenishbrown fur the ground all about was covered with creepers binding the ferns bushes and old dead branches together and in this confused tangle the animal scrambled and tore with a great show of energy but really made very little progress and all at once it flashed into my mind that it was a slotha common animal but rarely seen on the groundwith no tree near to take refuge in the shock of joy this discovery produced was great enough to unnerve me and for some moments i stood trembling hardly able to breathe then recovering i hastened after it and stunned it with a blow from my chopper on its round head  poor sloth i said as i stood over it poor old lazybones did rima ever find you fast asleep in a tree hugging a branch as if you loved it and with her little hand pat your round humanlike head and laugh mockingly at the astonishment in your drowsy waking eyes and scold you tenderly for wearing your nails so long and for being so ugly lazybones your death is revenged oh to be out of this woodaway from this sacred placeto be anywhere where killing is not murder  then it came into my mind that i was now in possession of the supply of food which would enable me to quit the wood a noble capture as much to me as if a stray migratory mule had rambled into the wood and found me and i him now i would be my own mule patient and longsuffering and fargoing with naked feet hardened to hoofs and a pack of provender on my back to make me independent of the dry bitter grass on the sunburnt savannahs  part of that night and the next morning was spent in curing the flesh over a smoky fire of green wood and in manufacturing a rough sack to store it in for i had resolved to set out on my journey how safely to convey rimas treasured ashes was a subject of much thought and anxiety the clay vessel on which i had expended so much loving sorrowful labour had to be left being too large and heavy to carry eventually i put the fragments into a light sack and in order to avert suspicion from the people i would meet on the way above the ashes i packed a layer of roots and bulbs these i would say contained medicinal properties known to the white doctors to whom i would sell them on my arrival at a christian settlement and with the money buy myself clothes to start life afresh  on the morrow i would bid a last farewell to that forest of many memories and my journey would be eastwards over a wild savage land of mountains rivers and forests where every dozen miles would be like a hundred of europe but a land inhabited by tribes not unfriendly to the stranger and perhaps it would be my good fortune to meet with indians travelling east who would know the easiest routes and from time to time some compassionate voyager would let me share his woodskin and many leagues would be got over without weariness until some great river flowing through british or dutch guiana would be reached and so on and on by slow or swift stages with little to eat perhaps with much labour and pain in hot sun and in storm to the atlantic at last and towns inhabited by christian men  in the evening of that day after completing my preparations i supped on the remaining portions of the sloth not suitable for preservation roasting bits of fat on the coals and boiling the head and bones into a broth and after swallowing the liquid i crunched the bones and sucked the marrow feeding like some hungry carnivorous animal  glancing at the fragments scattered on the floor i remembered old nuflo and how i had surprised him at his feast of rank coatimundi in his secret retreat nuflo old neighbour said i how quiet you are under your green coverlet spangled just now with yellow flowers it is no sham sleep old man i know if any suspicion of these curious doings this feast of flesh on a spot once sacred could flit like a small moth into your mouldy hollow skull you would soon thrust out your old nose to sniff the savour of roasting fat once more  there was in me at that moment an inclination to laughter it came to nothing but affected me strangely like an impulse i had not experienced since boyhoodfamiliar yet novel after the goodnight to my neighbour i tumbled into my straw and slept soundly animallike no fancies and phantoms that night the lidless white implacable eyes of the serpents severed head were turned to dust at last no sudden dreamglare lighted up old claclas wrinkled dead face and white blooddabbled locks old nuflo stayed beneath his green coverlet nor did my mournful spiritbride come to me to make my heart faint at the thought of immortality  but when morning dawned again it was bitter to rise up and go away for ever from that spot where i had often talked with rimathe true and the visionary the sky was cloudless and the forest wet as if rain had fallen it was only a heavy dew and it made the foliage look pale and hoary in the early light and the light grew and a whispering wind sprung as i walked through the wood and the fastevaporating moisture was like a bloom on the feathery fronds and grass and rank herbage but on the higher foliage it was like a faint iridescent mista glory above the trees the everlasting beauty and freshness of nature was over all again as i had so often seen it with joy and adoration before grief and dreadful passions had dimmed my vision and now as i walked murmuring my last farewell my eyes grew dim again with the tears that gathered to them    chapter xxii  before that wellnigh hopeless journey to the coast was half over i became illso ill that anyone who had looked on me might well have imagined that i had come to the end of my pilgrimage that was what i feared for days i remained sunk in the deepest despondence then in a happy moment i remembered how after being bitten by the serpent when death had seemed near and inevitable i had madly rushed away through the forest in search of help and wandered lost for hours in the storm and darkness and in the end escaped death probably by means of these frantic exertions the recollection served to inspire me with a new desperate courage bidding goodbye to the indian village where the fever had smitten me i set out once more on that apparently hopeless adventure hopeless indeed it seemed to one in my weak condition my legs trembled under me when i walked while hot sun and pelting rain were like flame and stinging ice to my morbidly sensitive skin  for many days my sufferings were excessive so that i often wished myself back in that milder purgatory of the forest from which i had been so anxious to escape when i try to retrace my route on the map there occurs a break herea space on the chart where names of rivers and mountains call up no image to my mind although in a few cases they were names i seem to have heard in a troubled dream the impressions of nature received during that sick period are blurred or else so coloured and exaggerated by perpetual torturing anxiety mixed with halfdelirious nightfancies that i can only think of that country as an earthly inferno where i fought against every imaginable obstacle alternately sweating and freezing toiling as no man ever toiled before hot and cold cold and hot and no medium crystal waters green shadows under coverture of broad moist leaves and night with dewy fanning windsthese chilled but did not refresh me a region in which there was no sweet and pleasant thing where even the ita palm and mountain glory and airy epiphyte starring the woodland twilight with pendent blossoms had lost all grace and beauty where all brilliant colours in earth and heaven were like the unmitigated sun that blinded my sight and burnt my brain doubtless i met with help from the natives otherwise i do not see how i could have continued my journey yet in my dim mental picture of that period i see myself incessantly dogged by hostile savages they flit like ghosts through the dark forest they surround me and cut off all retreat until i burst through them escaping out of their very hands to fly over some wide naked savannah hearing their shrill pursuing yells behind me and feeling the sting of their poisoned arrows in my flesh  this i set down to the workings of remorse in a disordered mind and to clouds of venomous insects perpetually shrilling in my ears and stabbing me with their small fiery needles  not only was i pursued by phantom savages and pierced by phantom arrows but the creations of the indian imagination had now become as real to me as anything in nature i was persecuted by that superhuman maneating monster supposed to be the guardian of the forest in dark silent places he is lying in wait for me hearing my slow uncertain footsteps he starts up suddenly in my path outyelling the bearded aguaratos in the trees and i stand paralysed my blood curdled in my veins his huge hairy arms are round me his foul hot breath is on my skin he will tear my liver out with his great green teeth to satisfy his raging hunger ah no he cannot harm me for every ravening beast every coldblooded venomous thing and even the frightful curupita half brute and half devil that shared the forest with her loved and worshipped rima and that mournful burden i carried her ashes was a talisman to save me he has left me the semihuman monster uttering such wild lamentable cries as he hurries away into the deeper darker woods that horror changes to grief and i too lament rima for the first time a memory of all the mystic unimaginable grace and loveliness and joy that had vanished smites on my heart with such sudden intense pain that i cast myself prone on the earth and weep tears that are like drops of blood  where in the rude savage heart of guiana was this region where the natural obstacles and pain and hunger and thirst and everlasting weariness were terrible enough without the imaginary monsters and legions of phantoms that peopled it i cannot say nor can i conjecture how far i strayed north or south from my course i only know that marshes that were like sloughs of despond and barren and wet savannahs were crossed and forests that seemed infinite in extent and never to be got through and scores of rivers that boiled round the sharp rocks threatening to submerge or dash in pieces the frail bark canoeblack and frightful to look on as rivers in hell and nameless mountain after mountain to be toiled round or toiled over i may have seen roraima during that mentally clouded period i vaguely remember a farextending gigantic wall of stone that seemed to bar all further progressa rocky precipice rising to a stupendous height seen by moonlight with a huge sinuous rope of white mist suspended from its summit as if the guardian camoodi of the mountain had been a leaguelong spectral serpent which was now dropping its coils from the mighty stone table to frighten away the rash intruder  that spectral moonlight camoodi was one of many serpent fancies that troubled me there was another surpassing them all which attended me many days when the sun grew hot overhead and the way was over open savannah country i would see something moving on the ground at my side and always keeping abreast of me a small snake one or two feet long no not a small snake but a sinuous mark in the pattern on a huge serpents head five or six yards long always moving deliberately at my side if a cloud came over the sun or a fresh breeze sprang up gradually the outline of that awful head would fade and the welldefined pattern would resolve itself into the motlings on the earth but if the sun grew more and more hot and dazzling as the day progressed then the tremendous ophidian head would become increasingly real to my sight with glistening scales and symmetrical markings and i would walk carefully not to stumble against or touch it and when i cast my eyes behind me i could see no end to its great coils extending across the savannah even looking back from the summit of a high hill i could see it stretching leagues and leagues away through forests and rivers across wide plains valleys and mountains to lose itself at last in the infinite blue distance  how or when this monster left mewashed away by cold rains perhapsi do not know probably it only transformed itself into some new shape its long coils perhaps changing into those endless processions and multitudes of palefaced people i seem to remember having encountered in my devious wanderings i must have reached the shores of the undiscovered great white lake and passed through the long shining streets of manoa the mysterious city in the wilderness i see myself there the wide thoroughfare filled from end to end with people gaily dressed as if for some high festival all drawing aside to let the wretched pilgrim pass staring at his fever and faminewasted figure in its strange rags with its strange burden  a new ahasuerus cursed by inexpiable crime yet sustained by a great purpose  but ahasuerus prayed ever for death to come to him and ran to meet it while i fought against it with all my little strength only at intervals when the shadows seemed to lift and give me relief would i pray to death to spare me yet a little longer but when the shadows darkened again and hope seemed almost quenched in utter gloom then i would curse it and defy its power through it all i clung to the belief that my will would conquer that it would enable me to keep off the great enemy from my worn and suffering body until the wished goal was reached then only would i cease to fight and let death have its way there would have been comfort in this belief had it not been for that fevered imagination which corrupted everything that touched me and gave it some new hateful character for soon enough this conviction that the will would triumph grew to something monstrous a parent of monstrous fancies worst of all when i felt no actual pain but only unutterable weariness of body and soul when feet and legs were numb so that i knew not whether i trod on dry hot rock or in slime was the fancy that i was already dead so far as the body was concernedhad perhaps been dead for daysthat only the unconquerable will survived to compel the dead flesh to do its work  whether it really was willmore potent than the bark of barks and wiser than the physiciansor merely the vis medicatrix with which nature helps our weakness even when the will is suspended that saved me i cannot say but it is certain that i gradually recovered health physical and mental and finally reached the coast comparatively well although my mind was still in a gloomy desponding state when i first walked the streets of georgetown in rags halfstarved and penniless  but even when well long after the discovery that my flesh was not only alive but that it was of an exceedingly tough quality the idea born during the darkest period of my pilgrimage that die i must persisted in my mind i had lived through that which would have killed most menlived only to accomplish the one remaining purpose of my life now it was accomplished the sacred ashes brought so far with such infinite labour through so many and such great perils were safe and would mix with mine at last there was nothing more in life to make me love it or keep me prisoner in its weary chains this prospect of near death faded in time love of life returned and the earth had recovered its everlasting freshness and beauty only that feeling about rimas ashes did not fade or change and is as strong now as it was then say that it is morbidcall it superstition if you like but there it is the most powerful motive i have known always in all things to be taken into accounta philosophy of life to be made to fit it or take it as a symbol since that may come to be one with the thing symbolized in those darkest days in the forest i had her as a visitora rima of the mind whose words when she spoke reflected my despair yet even then i was not entirely without hope heaven itself she said could not undo that which i had done and she also said that if i forgave myself heaven would say no word nor would she that is my philosophy still prayers austerities good worksthey avail nothing and there is no intercession and outside of the soul there is no forgiveness in heaven or earth for sin nevertheless there is a way which every soul can find out for itselfeven the most rebellious the most darkened with crime and tormented by remorse in that way i have walked and selfforgiven and selfabsolved i know that if she were to return once more and appear to meeven here where her ashes arei know that her divine eyes would no longer refuse to look into mine since the sorrow which seemed eternal and would have slain me to see would not now be in them
