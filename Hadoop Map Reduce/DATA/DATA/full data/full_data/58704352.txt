burt company      publishers    new york       copyright 1883     by james elverson      ralph gurneys oil speculation      renewal granted to james otis kaler 1911     ralph gurneys oil speculation     chapter i  the chums   the puffing panting engine that dragged the long train of heavy cars into the busy little city of bradford in the state of pennsylvania one day last summer witnessed through its one white staring eye sometimes called the headlight many happy meetings between waiting and coming friends but none was more hearty than that between two college matesone who had graduated the year previous and the other who hoped to carry off the honors at the close of the next term  here at last exclaimed george harnett as he met his old chum with a hearty clasp of the hand in this case if the hope had been much longer deferred the heart would indeed have been sick  it was thoughtless in me old fellow not to have sent you word when i concluded to remain at home two days longer but the fact of the matter is that i did not think you would be at the depot to meet me but would let me hunt you up for i suppose you do have some kind of an office  yes laughed the young man i have an office but since my work just now is several miles from here i am seldom at home and was obliged to come for you or run the chance of having you spend a good portion of your vacation hunting for me  and are you sorry yet that you chose civil engineering for a profession  sorry not a bit of it up here there is more excitement to it than you are aware of and before you have finished your vacation you will say that the life of a civil engineer in the oil fields of pennsylvania is not by any means monotonous but come this way my team is here and while we are talking we may as well be riding for we have quite a little journey yet before us over roads so bad that you can form no idea of them by even the most vivid description  but i thought you lived here in bradford  i live where my work is my boy and since it happens just now to be out of town my home for the time being is in as old and comfortable a farmhouse as cityweary mortals could ask for  well i cant say that i shall be sorry to live in the countryfor awhile at least  sorry well i hardly think you will be when you learn what i have to offer you in the way of enjoyment i am locating some oilproducing lands in a valley where game is abundant where the fish prefer an artificial fly to a natural one and where the moonlighter revels with his harmlesslooking but decidedly dangerous nitroglycerine cartridge  what do you mean by moonlighter asked ralph as he seated himself in the mudbespattered carriage which george pointed out as his  a moonlighter is one who shoots an oil well regardless of patent rights or those owning them save when by chance he finds himself gathered in by the strong arm of the law  i thank you brother harnett for your decidedly clear explanation i almost fancy that i know as much about moonlighters now as when i asked the question which is saying a good deal for you very often contrive in explaining anything to leave one even more ignorant than when he consulted you  if you are willing to listen to as long and as dry a dissertation on oil wells in general and illegallyopened ones in particular as ever professor gardner favored us with on topics in which we were not much interested i will begin stopping now and then only to prevent my teeth from being shaken out of my head as we ride over this road  the two had hardly got out of the city and the thoroughly bad character of the road was already apparent riding over it was very much like sailing in a small boat on rough wateralways down by the head or up by the stern but seldom on an even keel  go on with the lecture said ralph and while i try to hold myself in the carriage i will listen  because of my friendship for you i will make it as brief as possible in the first place you must know that before oil is struck the operator finds either a rock formed of sand or of gravel this is the strata just above the deposit of petroleum  of course this must be bored through if possible and in the pebbly rock there is no trouble about it the drills will go through and the gravel will be forced to the surface without much difficulty but when the sandrock is met it clogs the drills making it almost impossible to bore through a heavy charge of nitroglycerine makes short work of this rock and out comes the oil  now this method of blasting in oil wells has been patented or at least the cases for the glycerine and the manner of exploding it has and the company which has its office in bradford use every effort to discover infringements of their patent like all owners of patent rights they charge an extra price for their wares and the result is that there are parties who will for a much smaller amount of money shoot a well and infringe the patent at the same time these people are called moonlighters and the risk they run of losing their lives or their liberty is to say the least very great the lecturehour has now been fully and i hope i may say profitably employed  if it profits one to learn of your friends the moonlighters then your lecture has been a success but how do you find excitement in anything they do surely they do not make public their unlawful doings  oh everything save the shooting of the well is done legally and with many even that is questionable the cases are to be tried and many believe that the owners of the patent have really no rights in the premises the owners or prospective owners of the land whereon the wells are to be sunk employ me to survey their tracts and by that means i frequently make the acquaintance of those people who for the almighty dollar will peril their lives driving around the country with nitroglycerine enough to blow an entire town up  let me trespass once more on you for dry detail and then i will learn anything else i may want to know from observation what is nitroglycerine  i will answer your question by quoting as nearly as i can from what i read the other day it is composed of      aqueous vapor      20 parts     carbonic acid      58        oxygen            35        nitrogen         185     until 1864 it found no practical application except as a homeopathic remedy for headache similar to those which it causes in that year alfred nobel a swede of hamburg began its manufacture on a large scale and though he sacrificed a brother to the terrible agent he had created he persevered until in its later and safer forms nitroglycerine has come into wide use and popularity it is a clear oily colorless odorless and slightly sweet liquid and can with safety only be poured into some running stream if one wishes to be rid of it through the pores of the skin or in the stomach even in small quantities this oil causes a terrible headache and colic while headaches also result from inhaling the gases of its combustion it has thirteen times the force of gunpowder exploding so much more suddenly than that agent does that in reality it is much more powerful and it is this same rapid explosive power that prevents it from being used in firearms  you would make a firstrate professor george said ralph laughing and you may refer to me in case you should desire to procure such a position now i think i am armed with sufficient knowledge to be able to meet your oily friends the moonlighters and have some idea of what they mean when they speak  if i am not mistaken we shall meet some of them very soon without trying hard but if we do not i will take you to one of their cabins as soon as we may both feel inclined to go  dont think that i have come here to spend my vacation simply with the idea that i am at liberty to make drafts at sight on your time replied ralph as an unusually rough portion of the road necessitated his exerting all his strength to prevent being thrown out of the wagon i intend to be of every possible assistance to you and when i cannot do that if you are still obliged to labor i will extract no small amount of enjoyment out of your farmhouse and its surroundings but at any time that you have a few hours to spare i will be only too well pleased to meet with any adventure from nitroglycerine blasts to the perils of troutfishing  by this time the conversation ceased owing to ralphs interest in the scenery around him and the curious combination of oiltanks and derricks with which the landscape was profusely dotted from bradford to sawyer the road winds along at the base of the hills through a lovely valley that seems entirely given over to machinery for the production and storage of oil on every hand are the tall unsightly constructions of timber that form the derricks looking not unlike enormous spiders as they stand on the sides of the mountains or in the ravines while the network of iron pipes through which the oil is forced by steampumps from the wells to jersey city are fitting webs for such spiders  huge iron tanks capable of holding from twenty to forty thousand barrels of oil dot the valley quite as thickly as do the blots of ink on a schoolboys first composition and form storage places for this strange product of earth when the supply is greater than the demand it is truly a singular scene and he who visits this portion of the country for the first time cannot rid himself of the impression that he has by some mysterious combination of circumstances been transported to some remote and unknown portion of the globe  george to whom this scene was perfectly familiar did not seem inclined to allow his friend to remain in silent wonder for he persisted in supplying him with a fund of dry detail which effectually prevented any indulgence of daydreams  although ralph would have preferred to gaze about him in silence george told him of the pipeline company who owned the greater portion of the huge iron receptacles for oil who also owned the network of iron pipes through which they forced the oil to the market at a charge of twentyfive cents per barrel  he also told him that this company connected the main line of pipes with each tank owned by the oil producers supplying a small steampump at each connection and at stated times drew off from private tanks the oil he even went into the particulars of the work explaining how each man could tell exactly the number of barrels the company had taken from his tank by measuring the depth of the oil before and after the drawingoff process  then he described how these huge receptacles were frequently struck by lightning setting fire to the inflammable liquid and causing consternation everywhere in the valley of the firing of solid shot into the base of the tanks to make a perforation that would allow the oil to run off and of the loss of property and danger of life attending such catastrophes  so much of dry detail or interesting particulars of the oil business had the young engineer to tell that he had hardly finished when the horses turned sharply into a narrow road over which the trees formed a perfect archway that led to just such a farmhouse as suggests by outside appearance all the good things and comforts of life  this is to be home to you for a while said george breaking off abruptly in his dissertation on the price and quality of oil in which ralph was not very much interested and i can safely guarantee it to be a place which you will be sorry to leave after once knowing it  it certainly does not seem to be a place around which anything exciting can be found thought ralph but since it was only rest from study he was in search of he was content with that which he saw     chapter ii  a new acquaintance   ralph gurney was one who thoroughly enjoyed everything in which pleasure could be found and even while george was caring for his horses of which he was very fond ralph had already begun a survey of the farm on which he was to spend his vacation  the cattle poultry horses dogs and even the cat had received some attention from him and he was on his way to the sheeppasture near by to make the acquaintance of the woolly members of the flock when the sharp ping of a bullet was heard as it whistled by his head while a second later the report of a rifle rang out sharply  there was something so entirely unexpected and so thoroughly startling in this mode of salutation in so peaceful a place that ralph leaped two or three feet in his fright and at the same time saw the hole in the brim of his hat which showed how near the deadly missile had come to him  almost any one would be alarmed at such a visitor even though he might have been expecting this attention and ralph came very near trembling with fear as he realized how narrow had been his escape from death  he looked quickly around to see who was using him as a target but no one was in sight the sheep had been quite as much startled by the report as he had by the proximity of the bullet therefore there was no reason to suspect that they had had anything to do with this decided frightening of the new boarder  ralph was on the point of calling out to george for an explanation of this apparently reckless shooting when a voice from amid a small clump of trees shouted  hold out your hat and i will put a bullet through the center of it  even if ralph had not been angry because of the danger he had been forced to run he would not have accepted any such cheerful invitation and instead of replying he looked carefully around in search of the speaker  hold out your hat and i will show you what i can do continued the voice while its owner persistently remained hidden  i dont know who you are said ralph speaking sharply but from what i have already seen of your reckless shooting i consider it to be some ones duty to teach you how to handle firearms  and you propose to do it eh was the question as a boy eighteen or nineteen years of age with a face that was the perfect picture of good humor walked out of the thicket on his shoulder he carried a rifle and in his left hand some partridges and a foxskin that was a nasty shave for you he continued in a halfapologetic tone but you see i hadnt any idea there was any one around farmer kenniston is down on the meadow and harnett went to town this morning so you see that by rights you ought not have been here  and because in your opinion i should have been somewhere else you concluded to send me away by the most certain and effectual method asked ralph having by no means subdued his anger although it was vanishing quite rapidly before the pleasant tone and face of the boy who had come so near killing him  well you see i didnt know you or any one else was within a mile of the place i had a charge left in my rifle and i wanted to see if i could knock a knot out of that second board in the barn just as i pulled the trigger you came from behind the shed and then i couldnt call the bullet back i am sorry that i startled you so and i was in hopes you would hold out your hat so that you could have seen how handy i am with a rifle which would have made you feel easier  i must confess that i cant understand how i could be soothed by any proof of your skill as a marksman replied ralph with a smile his anger now almost completely gone of course i know that you didnt intend to shoot so near me but in the future i advise you to empty your rifle before you come so near to a house  but i have wanted to put a bullet into that knot from the trees back there ever since i have been here and now lets see if i struck it fairly  as if he considered that he had made all necessary apologies for the shot which had startled ralph the boy started towards the barn and in another instant he was pointing triumphantly to the offending knot in the board which had been completely shattered by the bullet  there he cried harnett said i couldnt hit it from that dead pine tree and that even if i did succeed in hitting it i couldnt split it now well see what he has got to say to that  ralph had nothing to say as to the argument between his friend and the stranger and in the absence of anything else to say he asked  do you live here  i am living here just now and shall for some weeks longer i suppose you are ralph gurney whom harnett has been expecting i fancy  yes but if george has told you who i am in advance of my coming he has not been so liberal to me in regard to yourself  that probably arose from the fact that i am no one in particular while on the contrary you are to become one of the particularly bright and shining lights in the medical world i am only bob hubbard  who bob hubbard might be ralph had no idea but even though the young gentleman spoke of himself in such a deprecating way it was easy to see that he did not consider himself of slight consequence in the world he was a bright jovial generous looking boy with a certain air about him which made the shot fired so dangerously near ralph seem just such a reckless act as might be expected of him  do you like hunting and fishing he asked after he found that ralph was not disposed to say anything about the profession of medicine he had chosen and which george had evidently spoken of  indeed i do was the decided reply is there much sport around here  all you want i have only been out about two hours and i have got these he said as he held up his game and as for fishing you can catch trout until your arms acheproviding they bite rapidly enough  indeed replied ralph dryly i fancy i have seen as good almost anywhere do you go fishing very often  nearly every day  then if george has any business to attend to this afternoon suppose you and i see if the fish will bite fast enough to make our arms ache pulling them in  bob hesitated in what ralph thought a very peculiar way and said after a pause of some moments  id like to but i have an important engagement this afternoon and i hardly see how i can arrange it  there was certainly nothing singular in his not being at liberty to accept the proposition made so suddenly and ralph would have thought his refusal the most natural thing in the world had it not been for his evident embarrassment when none seemed reasonable however the young pleasureseeker attached no importance to what seemed like singular behavior on the part of this newlymade acquaintance and was about to make another proposition for a fishing excursion when harnett suddenly made his appearance  hello bob he cried youve been making the acquaintance of my chum have you  yes after a fashion i fired at that knot in the barn you said i couldnt hit from the pine tree and came near putting a bullet through his head but i hit the knot and whats more i split it  and here is a hole in the brim of my hat to prove that he did fire at it said ralph laughing as he held up his perforated hat to display the mark of the bullet  harnett looked with no small degree of alarm at the evidence of bobs shooting and said sternly  i think it is quite time that you became a trifle more careful with your firearms bob you have already had several narrow escapes and will end by killing some one if you dont stop shooting at every promising mark you see  im not half as careless as i might be said bob earnestly this is the first time that i have ever really come near hurting any one  what about the time when you came near hitting farmer kenniston and killed a lamb have you forgotten the untimely death of mrs kennistons favorite duck or your adventure with the red calf in the pasture  oh those dont countat least none except the lamb scrape are worth talking about harnett so dont read me one of your longwinded lectures and now that i have hit the knot in the barn i promise not to shoot at anything within half a mile of the place im going down to town for a while and when i get through with what i have on hand well make some arrangement to show your friend the oil region  as he spoke bob went into the stables and when the two friends were alone again george asked  well ralph how do you like what you have seen of the moonlighters not very ferocious eh  what do you mean i havent seen any moonlighters yet  indeed you have been talking for the last ten minutes with the most successful of them bob hubbard enjoys the rather questionable distinction of being the most noted one in this section of the country  ralph looked at his friend in speechless astonishment for several minutes this careless goodnatured boy was very far from being the famous moonlighter his fancy had conjured up and it is barely possible that he was disappointed at not having seen some more savage looking party for he had speculated considerably about these people who explode nitroglycerine in an illegal manner  if i am not mistaken continued harnett he is going to shoot a well tonight and i guess there will be no difficulty in getting his consent for you to be present wait here and i will talk with him  george hurried away toward the stables leaving ralph in a curious condition of mingled wonder and surprise that in this very peacefullooking place there could be found such an evident fund for adventure  the gaining of bobs consent for ralph to be present at the shooting of the well was not such a difficult matter judging from the very short time george found it necessary to talk with him when harnett came from the stable he told ralph that the necessary permission had been given and that they would start for the cabin of the moonlighters at once in order that none of the details of the work might be lost  while they were speaking bob drove out of the stable behind a pair of small gray horses which were so spirited that their driver could pay no attention to anything but them  ill see you again very soon he shouted and hardly had he uttered the words before he was tearing along the rough road at a rate of speed that threatened a rapid dissolution of the light carriage  if george had any business to attend to on that day he evidently made up his mind to neglect it for he began to make his arrangements for the journey with quite as much eagerness and zest as displayed by ralph  since it was by no means certain that the well would be opened that night owing to the vigilance of the owners of the torpedo patent george made preparations to remain away from farmer kennistons all night taking blankets food fishingtackle and rifles as if their excursion was to be one simply of a sporting nature  it wouldnt do for us to drive out to the moonlighters cabin as if we were going to see a well shot he said in reply to ralphs questions of what he proposed doing with rifles and fishingrods for if we were seen it would be quickly reported in town and bob would have the whole posse of roberts brothers force upon him now there would be nothing thought of our going out fishing which fully accounts for my preparations i have known bob to wait for a week before he dared explode a charge and i dont care to get mixed up in any encounter between these two sets of torpedo men  i dont want any harm to come to him through me replied ralph gleefully but i should not be at all sorry to see just a little excitement in the way of a chase of the moonlighters  there is every chance that you will be fully satisfied before you leave this portion of the country said george grimly and then as his horses were ready for the road once more he added get in and if nothing happens i will show you the cabin of the moonlighters in less than an hour     chapter iii  the cabin of the moonlighters   bob hubbard had been away from the kenniston farmhouse nearly half an hour when ralph and george left it but the latter was so well acquainted with the country that he did not need any guide to the cabin and could not have had one had he so desired for bob was far too cautious to be seen leading any one to his base of operations  it was well known by the owners of the torpedo patents that robert hubbard was the most skillful of all the moonlighters and whenever he was seen traveling toward any of the wells that were being bored he was followed but thanks to the fleetness of his horses he had never been seen at his work by any one who would inform on him  bob believed as did a great many that the firm holding the patent had no legal right to prevent any one from exploding nitroglycerine by the means of a percussion cap placed in the top of a tin shell or cartridge several cases were before the courts undecided and until a decision was reached the owners of the patent would do all in their power to prevent any one from interfering in the business which they proposed to make a monopoly therefore when bob went about his work he did so with quite as much mystery as if he had been engaged in some decidedly unlawful act  the ride from sawyer among the mountains was quite as rough a one as that from bradford and ralph found that he had about as much as he could attend to in keeping the guns fishingrods and himself in the carriage without attempting to carry on any extended conversation with his friend it was therefore almost in silence that the two rode along until george turned the horses abruptly from the main road into the woods saying as he did so  if i am not mistaken this path will lead us directly to bobs headquarters  he was not mistaken for before they had ridden a mile into the woods they emerged into a clearing in the midst of which stood a small loghouse and stable  instead of windows the hut had stout plank shutters which prevented any one from looking in even if they did prevent the occupants from gazing out and the door had more the appearance of having been made to resist an attack than simply to keep the wind or cold out  the stable was in keeping with the hut so far as an appearance of solidity went and as its one door was closely shut with no bars or locks on the outside one could fancy that when it was occupied a guard remained on the inside where the fastenings of the door evidently were  i guess we have got here too soon said ralph as george stopped the horses in front of the hut without any signs of life having been seen  there is a smoke from the chimney said george as he pointed to the clumsy affair of mud and sticks from which a thin blue curl of smoke could be dimly seen and if they are ready to let us in we shall soon see some one  the two sat patiently in the carriage several moments and at the end of that time the door of the hut was opened by a young man standing in the doorway to whom george said  well dick hasnt bob got here yet  yes hes here but we didnt open the door at first because we were not sure but that you had been followed then turning toward the barn the young man shouted come out here pete and take care of these horses  in response to this demand the stable door was opened as cautiously as if the man behind it feared a dozen were ready to pounce upon him and then much as if he were unfolding himself a tall negro came out leading the horses away without speaking almost before ralph and george had time to leap to the ground  get into the hut as quickly as possible george said to ralph and as the three entered the door was securely barred behind them with two heavy beams that would have resisted almost any ordinary force that might have been used against them  the hut boasted of but one room in which were to be seen piles of blankets that had evidently been used as beds cooking utensils provisions sheets of tin tools such as are used by tinsmiths and in fact as varied an assortment of goods as could well have been gathered into so small a compass  in one corner of the room the floor of earth had been excavated until a space about six feet square and four deep had been formed and into this excavation was packed a number of square tin cans which ralph felt certain contained that powerful agent nitroglycerine  bob was at work soldering together a long tin shell about six inches in diameter and fully ten feet long and he called out as his friends entered  come right in dont be afraid that you will be shot at for we drop all that kind of business here for fear we might all go up together this mr gurney is the moonlighters cabin and i am free to confess that it is not the most cheerful place in the world  i dont find as much fault with the cabin as i do with what you keep stored in those innocentlooking tin cans replied ralph as he seated himself on a pile of blankets at a respectful distance from the glycerine  oh thats harmless enough so long as you leave it alone replied bob carelessly and then as he resumed his work of soldering he asked did you see anything of jim as you came in  no where is he  out by the road somewhere we heard that our particular friends in town had got wind of the fact that we were going to put in a charge tonight so jim is doing guard duty outside leaving dick norton and i to do the tinkers work we expected to have gotten our shells all made in town but they are looking out so sharp for us just now that it was entirely too much of a risk to bring them out here  how did they learn that you were going to work tonight asked george  thats more than i can say unless old hoxie was fool enough to let it out that we were going to shoot his well for him replied bob working savagely with the soldering iron much as if he would have been pleased had he been using it on mr hoxies too ready tongue  do you anticipate much trouble asked ralph with just a shade of anxiety beginning to realize that it would not be the most pleasant thing in the world to commence his vacation by being arrested as a moonlighter  thats just what i cant say we may have it and we may not but theres one thing certain and that is that ill shoot that well if i dont get back to the kenniston farm for three months  i dont believe that they are even looking for us they think we went out of the business two weeks ago said dick norton as he in a very unworkmanlike manner attempted to aid bob you see jim is nervous and the least thing frightens him  something has startled him at all events exclaimed bob running to the door as a low quick whistle was heard from the outside  dick despite the rather contemptuous way in which he had spoken also appeared to think something serious had happened for he joined bob at the door looking very serious as both of them quickly unfastened the bars opening the door just as a young man ran in from the woods breathless and excited  what is it jim what has happened asked bob replacing the heavy bars instantly the newcomer was inside the building  newcombe and five men have just turned into the path coming down here as if they knew just what they should find  for a moment bob and dick were silent and ralph had an opportunity to ask george  who is newcombe  a man in the employ of the owners of the patent and one who has threatened several times to secure the arrest of bob  dicks first act after he fully realized what jim had said was to cover the fire at which they had been soldering with ashes in order to prevent any smoke from escaping through the chimney and by that time bob had recovered all his presence of mind  even if they have at last found the hut they will be puzzled to get into it or to get us out he said as he noted the fastenings of the windowshutters and uncovered a small aperture which served as a loophole through which everything that occurred outside could be seen  you ought to have warned pete said george not feeling remarkably well pleased at the chance of being besieged as a moonlighter but yet anxious that his friends should elude arrest where the cartridges and explosive fluid would be sufficient proof against them  there is no need of that replied bob he wouldnt show himself under any circumstances unless we called him and from the loft of the stable he can see all that is going on  ralph was the most uncomfortable of the party not being so familiar with the doings of the moonlighters nor acquainted with the general feeling of the public against them the idea of being thus hunted like a criminal was very repugnant to him  it was as if his companions were engaged in some crime instead of simply infringing a patent the legality of which had not been fully tested and if he could have had his choice he would have been miles away from that spot just then  there they come exclaimed bob from his post of observation and looking out for a moment ralph saw six men riding into the clearing directly toward the house  almost before he had time to regain his seat and just as bob held up his hand as a signal for silence a knock was heard at the door as if some one was pounding with the buttend of a whip  no one made any reply and it seemed to ralph as if he could hear the pulsations of his own heart so oppressive was the silence  again the summons was repeated and a gruff voice cried  open the door a moment i wish to speak with mr robert hubbard  then there was a long silence and seeing the look of anxiety on ralphs face george said in a low whisper  dont look so distressed my boy those men have got no more right to enter here than you have to go into another mans dwelling if they should succeed in getting in however they would find sufficient to prove that bob was about to infringe their patent but as it is they have no authority to do anything although bob will hardly get a chance to shoot the hoxie well tonight  thats just what i will do whispered bob who had heard georges remark i will put in that charge if they camp where they are all night  the men on the outside waited some moments in silence and then the request was repeated while at the same time footsteps could be heard as if some of them had gone toward the stable  they might easily batter in one of the windows said ralph as the pounding at the door was continued  they would hardly try that plan replied george with a meaning smile there are a hundred or two quarts of nitroglycerine stored here needing only the necessary concussion to explode them those men know quite as well as we do how unpleasant such liquid may become and i assure you that they will strike no very heavy blows on the building  it was a singular position for any one to be in and ralph was far from being comfortable in his mind as he awaited the result of this visit to the cabin of the moonlighters     chapter iv  a regular siege   ralph simply a visitor to the cabin of the moonlighters felt far more uncomfortable than did his hosts to whom alone there was any danger  as the party waited silently for any move by those outside ralph had plenty of time to review his own position and this review was far from pleasant or reassuring  in that section of the country the fact of being arrested as a moonlighter did not imply either disgrace or crime but in ralphs home where nothing was known of such an industry save when occasionally a newspaper item was read but not understood the news of his arrest while trying illegally to shoot a well would cause as much consternation and sorrow as if he had attempted to shoot a man it was far from being a pleasant beginning to his vacation and he would have been much better satisfied with himself if he had not made any attempt to penetrate the mysteries of the moonlighters dangerous calling  while these uncomfortable thoughts were presenting themselves to ralph bob hubbard was standing on a rudelyconstructed table in order that he might keep a watch upon newcombe and his men and from time to time he whispered to his companions of that which he saw  theyve got tired trying to find out anything at the stable and now theyre coming this way if we keep perfectly quiet they will begin soon to believe that no one is here and then very likely they will go away  it was in the highest degree necessary that these men should be thrown off the scent if possible and each one in the hut remained motionless as statues but as was shown a moment later their silence was fruitless owing to the defective construction of their furniture  now they are gathering close around the door continued bob from his post of observation and then fearing he might betray himself even through the loophole he began cautiously to descend  it was as if his very efforts to move without noise hastened the catastrophe he was trying to avert for as he started to lower himself from the table the entire structure gave way and he came to the floor with such a crash as could have been heard many yards away  there was no need of question as to whether bobs downfall had been heard by those outside for at the moment a low involuntary cry of triumph was heard which did not detract from the unfortunate moonlighters discomfiture had bob cried out his name he could not have proclaimed his presence any more plainly and as he disentangled himself from amid the wreck of the table his face spoke eloquently the anger he felt either at his own carelessness or the weakness of the table  its all up now said jim despondently there was a chance that they might get tired in time and go away but now they will stay here until they see us leave  well let them stay said bob savagely i have come here to get ready to shoot the hoxie well and ill do it before i go home again  perhaps you will and perhaps you wont said jim doubtingly but if my opinions worth anything you wont  bob made no reply to this but attacked the tin cartridges on which he had been working with an energy that told plainly of his determination although how it might be possible for him to do more than to get ready for the work no one could imagine he no longer tried to be silent but made so much bustle with his work that george said  what makes you so careless bob even if they did hear you when you fell there is no reason why you should advertise the fact that you are making cartridges  what difference does it make what they hear now asked bob not even looking up from his work as he spoke do you fancy that newcombe finding us here does not know just as well as we do what there is inside here if we remain quiet he will say to himself that we are all ready for the shot and only waiting for him to get out of the way before we let it off if we work he will know no more and we may as well take things comfortable  it isnt any use for us to try to do anything said dick disconsolately newcombe will stay right where he is until we go out and the best thing we can do is give the thing up for a while  yes interrupted jim lets go home and wait until we can give him the slip and get out again  ill do nothing of the kind replied bob doggedly i agreed to shoot hoxies well tonight and im going to do it  you cant without newcombes seeing you and you know that your arrest would follow as soon after that as he could get out a warrant said george thinking it was high time for him to interfere with advice they have never been able to get any proof against you yet and you dont want to give them the chance now just through spite  im not going to give them the chance said bob calmly i am going to take what i need out of this place while they are guarding it and without their seeing me if any of you fellows are afraid and want to go home you know how to get there but i am going to stay and do just as i have said  bob could have used no better argument if he had been anxious to have his companions remain with him than when he proposed they should go home if they were afraid much as ralph would have liked to he did not think of leaving when to do so was to be considered proof that he was afraid and he as well as the others settled themselves down to await the result of bobs plan whatever it might be  those on the outside however were not as contented in their waiting as they showed in a short time when newcombes voice could be heard addressing those whom he believed he had run to earth  say boys he cried you know very well that i shall stay here until you come out and the best thing you can do is to give the job up for a while for i promise you that you will get no chance to do the work this time  it was quite evident that mr newcombe had no more desire to remain outside of the hut on guard than ralph and george had to remain inside and that he was anxious to put a speedy end to what had every appearance of being a long job it was plain to be seen that he neither understood nor relished this singular behavior on the part of those whom he had no authority to arrest until they had committed some overt act and that he was anxious to bring the case to an issue at once  the others looked at bob expecting he would make some reply to the proposition but he made no sign that he had even heard what had been said he worked industriously at the long tin tubes neither speaking nor looking up  you know that i have got wind of what you are going to do tonight continued newcombe from the outside and you know that i shall stay right here until you leave so whats the use of acting so childishly about it come right out like men and begin the thing over at some other time  even ralph could understand that in his eagerness to be away mr newcombe was making a great mistake in thus pleading with those over whom he could have no control until after their work was done and dicks face lightened wonderfully as he began to hope the torpedo detective as newcombe was called might tire of his watching and go away  all the inmates of the hut appeared to share the same hope and jim at once began to replace the broken table with some empty boxes in order that he might have access to the loophole  what will be the result of all this ralph asked of george as the two seated themselves comfortably in one corner of the room where they would at the same time be out of bobs way and see all that was going on  that i cant say it may be fortyeight hours before bob gives up the scheme he has evidently formed and in the meanwhile here we are prisoners for we cannot ask to leave the hut until the others do it promises to be a tedious thing for us but you remember that you wished there might be some excitement other than the mere shooting of the well  yes replied ralph with a laugh i remember that i was foolish enough to make some such remark and i am in a fair way to get all i wanted  by this time jim had built up a shaky sort of a platform by which he was enabled to climb to the loophole and he at once gave the result of his outlook to his companions  they are unharnessing the horses he cried in a tone of disappointment for he had almost persuaded himself that they would leave the place at once newcombes team is directly in front and the other two are drawn up on either side about fifty yards from it they are preparing for a regular siege  which is the most fortunate thing for us that could have happened said bob contentedly  why i dont see how we can do anything when they are all ready to follow us the moment we show ourselves out of doors said dick  if you cant i can replied bob working leisurely at his cartridges and with as much precision as if the torpedo detectives were miles away  tell me what you intend to do  ill show you when everything is ready dick and not before you have said that we couldnt do anything while they were here therefore whatever my plan may be it is better than giving the whole thing up now if your fears will permit suppose you take hold and help me while jim watches our friends outside  it was as if dick understood for the first time that while they were bewailing their fate that newcombe should have found their hidingplace bob was working industriously at the task on hand and he began to help him at once which employment had the effect of dispelling his fears in a wonderful degree  three of the men are watching the house from the front while newcombe and the other two are going towards the stable said jim and then he added excitedly i believe that rascal pete is talking with them for they are standing there now looking up towards the roof as if they saw or heard some one  dick was disposed to leave his work at this startling announcement but bobs industry had a quieting effect upon him and he continued in his office of helper although with evident mental anxiety  now they have called one of the other men over and all four of them are going through the motions of a conversation now newcombe has taken some money out of his pocket and is holding it up in his hand  there was a moment of silence in the hut during which all the boys even including bob awaited in anxiety the result of this evident bribe and then jim said excitedly  pete has shown himself and is reaching out with the pitchfork for the money he is selling us to newcombe who will know now exactly what we were going to do     chapter v  bobs scheme   from what jim could see from the loophole there was every reason for the young moonlighters to believe that the negro pete whom they hired was betraying them to newcombe and each one felt more than uneasy when jim reported that the detective had fastened some money on one of the prongs of the hayfork but they were somewhat relieved when bob said  if you werent all a good deal frightened you would remember that pete hasnt been told where we were going he doesnt know anything more than newcombe himself does and if he can make a few dollars for nothing why let him  but what are they giving him money for asked jim who was even more disturbed by this apparent treachery on the part of their servant than were the others  for an answer to that question i shall be obliged to refer you to the worthy pete himself at all events the only harm he could do us would be to let newcombe know when we leave herein case he dont want to waitand that is just what i fancy pete himself wont know  as soon as the boys realized that pete had no secrets of theirs worth the purchasing they grew more easy in their minds and were inclined to look upon this giving of money by newcombe as a very good joke  jim had nothing of interest to report for nearly ten minutes after this during all of which time the detective and his men had been engaged in earnest conversation with the negro and then he announced that they were returning to their wagons  they had not unharnessed their horses but had slipped the bridles from them that they might make a dinner from the rich grass and yet be ready for a start at a moments notice  after their return to the front of the house one of the men drove away with one of the teams after having received some instructions from newcombe and as it was nearly dark the boys believed that the detective had sent for food since there was no longer any doubt about his having regularly besieged the house  all this time bob had continued his work assisted by dick and it was not until the setting sun had distorted the shadows of the trees into dark images of giants that he announced its completion  there he cried triumphantly as he laid the last tin tube by the side of the other two we are all ready and in two hours more we will start  in two hours newcombe and his men will be there just as they are now said jim rather impatiently for he thought bob was assuming to be able to do very much more than was possible  i suppose they will was the quiet reply and i should not be very much surprised if we should see them there twentyfour hours later  what is it you propose doing bob asked george who thoroughly tired of the inactivity as was ralph was only anxious to know when their irksome captivity would come to an end  ill tell you in the first place how far is hoxies well from here in a straight line  directly through the woods i suppose it is not more than half a mile i surveyed the next tract to it and i fancy that is about the distance  and if we should start from the back of the hut traveling in a straight line we should come to it  yes there would be no difficulty about that  then i propose that we simply go out through the back window unless newcombe has sufficient wits about him to station one of his men there we can by making two trips carry enough glycerine to shoot the well in good style and by midnight we should be all ready for the work  the plan was so simple and with so many elements of success about it that bobs audience testified to their appreciation of it by vigorous applause which must have mystified the worthy mr newcombe considerably  in an hour from now we can begin work ralph who might possibly have some compunctions about carrying a couple of cans of glycerine through the woods where to strike one against a tree might result in his immediate departure from the world shall carry the cartridges then there will be four of us each of whom can carry eight quarts two trips will give us sixtyfour quarts and that will be enough to start the oil from mr hoxies well if there is any there  bobs plan was quite as dangerous as it was simple to carry eight quarts of glycerine through the woods when a misstep might explode it was such a task as any one might well fear to undertake but the desire to leave the detective on a weary vigil while they pursued their work unmolested was such an inducement as caused each one even ralph to be anxious to try it  the night was not as favorable for the scheme as it might have been for the moon was nearly full and objects could be distinguished almost as readily as at noonday save when under the veil cast by the shadows  this moonlight bob thought would not interfere with their plan since from the back of the house to the forest was but a few yards and unless newcombe should station one of his men there the building would screen them from view  in case they got safely away from the house the light would aid them both in their journey through the woods and in their work after they arrived at the well  for some time the boys enjoyed thoroughly the anticipation of fooling mr newcombe and they might have continued to do so until it would have been too late to accomplish the work had not bob reminded them that they had no time to lose  then they made their preparations for the journey or flight whichever it might be called the long tin cartridges were tied together securely with wads of paper between to prevent them from rattling the cans of nitroglycerine were placed by the window where they could be gotten at readily and bob produced a threecornered piece of iron about four feet long which weighed twenty or thirty pounds  it will be quite an addition to your load but i fancy you will feel safer carrying it than you would one of the cans he said to ralph  what is it  and the tone in which the question was asked showed that the newcomer to the oil fields looked upon this carrying a useless piece of iron through the woods as very unnecessary work  thats the godevil replied bob and then as he saw that ralph did not understand he added it is to drop through the hole to explode the cartridges after they are placed in position  still ralph could not fully understand its importance but he stationed himself by the window resolved to carry the godevil and the cartridges any distance rather than take the chances of being obliged to burden himself with the dangerous oil which the others appeared to regard with so little fear  everything was in readiness for the start and bob clambered up to the peephole that he might be sure the enemy were yet in their position which was so favorable to the plans of the moonlighters  they are all there except the one who drove away some time ago andhere comes the other now he had been for food and they are pitching into it as if they were hungry now is our time to start they will be at their supper for the next half hour and by the end of that time we shall be ready to come back for a second load  bob looked once more to the fastenings of the doors and windows to be certain that they could not be loosened by any one from the outside and then he cautiously unbarred the window at the back of the house  knowing that the detective and all his force were in front he spent no time in looking around but leaping out was soon busily engaged in taking out the cans of glycerine which jim and dick handed him  less than ten minutes sufficed for this work and then each member of the party was out of doors ralph with the cartridges over his shoulder and the godevil under his arm while the others carried a can of the dangerous liquid in each hand  it had been decided that george being accustomed to traveling through the woods in straight lines by his work as engineer should lead the party as the one most likely to keep a direct course and ralph had decided that he would remain as far in the rear as possible for when he saw the boys swinging the terrible explosive around so carelessly he felt that the further away one could get from that party the safer they were  george was not as much at his ease as he might have been for he had not grown familiar with the explosive as the others had and he uttered many a word of caution when they came to those portions of the woods where the trees stood more thickly together  their progress was necessarily slow owing to the care they were obliged to use in walking but before mr newcombe and his friends had finished their supper the moonlighters were at mr hoxies well where they found their arrival had long been expected  mr hoxie could understand from the manner in which the moonlighters had come that they had run some risk of detection in getting there and when he learned that they were obliged to make a second trip for more glycerine he offered either to accompany them or send some of his men with them as they should prefer  bob refused all these offers of assistance however for he believed that it was owing to mr hoxies incautious remarks that the detectives had paid them a visit and he did not propose to run any more risks than were absolutely necessary  since four of them could carry all the glycerine needed to make up the charge and since ralph had such a wholesome fear of the dangerous compound bob insisted that ralph remain at the well while the others paid a second visit to the hut in the forest a proposition which ralph eagerly accepted for carrying nitroglycerine through the woods in the night was a task he was not at all anxious to perform  the return through the woods was made in a very short time the boys walking on at full speed until they were near the hut when the utmost caution was used by making quite a detour through the woods bob was able to get a full view of the watchful detectives all of whom were seated on the grass in front of the hut gazing at it so intently that there was no question that any suspicion had been aroused in their minds  before they had left the hut bob had placed the glycerine near the window so that it could be reached from the outside and after it was learned that the enemy were still in blissful ignorance but little time was lost in getting ready to return to mr hoxies well  perhaps the boys were no more careless in carrying the glycerine this second time than they were the first but they certainly walked faster and when they arrived at their destination they had been away such a short time that ralph could hardly believe they had been to the hut in the woods and back  everything was now in readiness for the important work and the question that troubled the young moonlighters was whether the worthy mr newcombe and his assistants would remain looking at the empty hut until the charge was exploded     chapter vi  torpedoing an oilwell   it is safe to say that ralph who was interested in the shooting of the well only as a spectator was the most nervous one of all that party who were about to show mr hoxie whether he had struck oil or not  bob set about the work with the air of one perfectly familiar with what he was doing and the others aided him whenever it was possible george alone remaining inactive since he considered himself entitled to a seat with the spectator  the well had of course been bored down as far as the bedrock leaving an opening from eight to ten inches in diameter and quite twelve hundred feet deep which was nearly filled with the water that had flowed in and the oil that had been poured in to give some slight resistance at the top of the cartridge  over this grim and weirdlooking in the moonlight rose the framework of the derrick formed of heavy timbers and apparently solid enough to resist any pressure that might be brought to bear upon it near by were scattered pieces of machinery tools and such debris as would naturally accumulate around a place of the kind  a large reel wound with heavy cord capable of sustaining a hundred pounds weight and with a shallow hook which would easily become detached when the pressure was removed was fastened at one of the uprights of the derrick while directly over the well was a block for the cord to pass through this was to be used to lower the cartridges into the well  after this portion of the work had been completedand all three of the moonlighters moved as rapidly as possible lest mr newcombe should put in an appearancethe task of filling the shells was begun the tops of the long tin tubes were removed and into these rather frail shells the glycerine was poured bob handling it as if it was no more dangerous than the petroleum they hoped to find  as fast as each tube or cartridge was filled it was lowered into the well by the stout wire bail that was fastened to the top and just under the cover was the hammer which would explode the percussion cap when struck these cartridges were pointed at the head and since the point of the second would rest on the top of the first and the third on the second the blow which exploded the first would naturally be communicated to the other two  it was in lowering these cartridges into the well that bob showed his first signs of caution in handling the explosive liquid for the least jar or concussion as the tin tubes were being let down into the well would have resulted in a premature explosion which might have had the most deplorable results  ralph seeing that at this point even bob was willing to admit that there might be some danger in the work he was doing proposed to george that they move a short distance further away lest there should be an accident and the reply he received was not well calculated to soothe his nervousness  if one of those tubes should explode on the surface here we should stand as good a chance of being killed a quarter of a mile away as here so we might just as well stay where we are  and ralph remained although he was far from feeling as comfortable as he would have felt at a more respectful distance  all ready now said bob as the last cartridge was lowered into position and the reel removed from the derrick now in order to honor harnetts guest i am going to allow him the distinction of exploding the charge  for a moment ralph thought of what an experience it would be to explode sixtyfour quarts of nitroglycerine and what an adventure would be his to relate when he returned to college therefore he marched boldly up to the well at the bottom of which was such a dangerous agent ready to do its work but when he saw the others seeking places of safety from the gases and possibly fragments that would follow the explosion and when he stood upon the platform of the derrick which afforded so insecure a foothold because of the oil upon it his courage failed him  it may be a big thing he said to bob to drop this piece of iron through the hole and be the remote cause of such a powerful effect but if when i attempt to get out of the way my foot should slip i should hardly be in a condition to care for glory i am greatly obliged to you for the proposed honor but think i had better decline it  just as you please my dear boy replied bob carelessly just find a good place where you can see her when she shoots and ill drop the godevil  ralph lost no time in obeying the young moonlighters instructions seeking a refuge near the corner of a small toolhouse to the windward of the well and about a hundred yards from it  look out for your mouth and nose just after the explosion cautioned george for the gases which will come first to the surface are very poisonous  all ready shouted bob as he looked around to see that every one was in a safe position and then approached the well with the godevil in his hands  there was an instants pause as the boy stood with the heavy iron poised over the aperture and then dropping it he sought shelter by the side of ralph and george  perfect silence reigned for what seemed a long time while the godevil was falling through twelve hundred feet of oil and water but the time was hardly more than a minute and then ralph who had expected to hear a deafening noise simply heard a crackling sound much as if two small firecrackers had been exploded it had not occurred to him that but little could be heard from such a distance beneath the surface  look out for the gases cried george  and as ralph covered his nose and mouth with his handkerchief he could see a black vapor almost like smoke arising from the mouth of the well  there is no oil there he said to himself as second after second went by and there was no appearance of anything save the gases of combustion he was almost as disappointed as mr hoxie would have been at finding a dry well for after all his tedious waiting he hoped to have been rewarded by seeing the shoot of the oil  he was rather surprised that bobs face showed no signs of disappointment for he surely must have wanted to see oil after his dangerous work but bob simply looked expectant with his gaze fixed on the mouth of the well and ralph turned again just in time to see a most wonderful sight  from out of the mouth of the well arose what appeared to be a solid column of greenish yellow rising slowly in the air like one of the pillars of aladdins palace as it was formed by the genii the top was rounded and the sides of this marvelous column held together only by some mighty force shone in the moonlight like a polished surface of marble while all the time it arose inch by inch without fret or check until the top wavered in the night wind then one or two drops could be seen rolling off from the summit and in an instant the entire appearance changed  with a mighty bound the oil leaped into the air tearing asunder the summit of the derrick as if it had been of veriest gossamer dashing the heavy timbers aside like feathers and spouting in the pale light drops as of molten gold  for a radius of twenty feet around the well the air seemed filled with this liquid gold that was coming from the very bowels of the earth  the oil poured out in torrents with a sharp hissing noise that told how great was the volume of gas imprisoned beneath the rock which was sending this oily deluge out and the question of the value of the well was decided  its good for two hundred barrels a day cried bob  and mr hoxie who would reap this rich harvest insisted that it would produce very much more than that  the damage done to the derrick was not heeded by the owner since the destructive agent was worth just so much money per barrel to him  after spouting to a height of fully two hundred feet for nearly ten minutes the volume of oil or rather of the gas that was forcing it to the surface appeared to be exhausted and lower and lower sank the torrent spreading out in a fanshape as it lessened until finally it ceased entirely  what is the matter asked ralph who fancied that oilwells flowed incessantly your twohundredbarrel well will hardly produce as much as you thought  indeed it will replied bob you dont think wells go on flowing like that all the time do you they have breathing spells like men they spout anywhere from five to fifteen minutes and then remain quiet about the same time or longer you see the gas in the reservoir of oil forces it to the surface the escape of the oil lessens the pressure under the rock and it remains inactive until sufficient gas has gathered again to force more up this well is as good a one as i have ever shot  then bob and his partners began to make their preparations for departure since for them to be found with their tools near a newlyopened well would have been almost as dangerous as to have been caught in the very act of shooting it  ralph would have been only too well pleased if he could have waited long enough to see the second spout but being a guest of the moonlighters he could not offer any objection to their movements and he also made ready for the journey back to the hut  bob had settled his business with mr hoxie which was simply to get the agreed amount for the work performed and was just getting the reel into shape to carry when the clatter of hoofs was heard far down the road  the detectives shouted mr hoxie as he started toward the toolhouse where in a very few seconds he would be counterfeiting the most profound slumber  the detectives shouted the workmen as they sought convenient places for hiding and the moonlighters were left to dispose of themselves as best they could  come this way cried bob as he caught up the reel which might be recognized as his regardless of how he carried it and dashed off into the woods at full speed followed by his partners and guests  it was a flight which would be presumptive guilt if they were overtaken but under the circumstances it was the only course the moonlighters could pursue     chapter vii  mr newcombes certainty   varied and many were ralphs thoughts as he followed his friends at full speed through the woods and none of them were complimentary to the business of the moonlighters he had hoped there would be some excitement attending the shooting of the well other than that incident to the regular work and he had every reason to be satisfied but he had seen a trifle more than was necessary to his comfort or happiness and this race through the woods was quite sufficient to take the last bit of romance from the business the work had been done but if those who had been heard on the road were the officers the chances were that they might succeed in finding sufficient proof as to who had done the job  ralph understood fully that by aiding the moonlighters even in the slight way he had he was for the time being one of them and this thought was far from reassuring without any reason other than to see the sport he had perhaps infringed the rights of those who were using every effort to protect them and what the result might be perplexed him in no slight degree  but one thing was certain and that was now that he had become involved with his new acquaintances to a certain extent it was necessary for him to continue with them until he could leave without either compromising himself or injuring them  of course every one believed that the noise made on the road immediately after the well was shot was occasioned by newcombes men who having discovered that the hut was empty had started at once for the probable scene of operations  under this belief bob dashed on toward the hut at full speed never thinking of making any investigations to learn whether they were correct in their surmises until when they were but a short distance from the clearing in the woods george called out  before we show ourselves it would be well to find out whether newcombe has really left  that would be only a waste of time objected jim for of course it was he whom we heard  i believe it was replied george but at the same time it is well to be sure it will only take a few moments longer and since ralph and i have got mixed up in this thing i insist that you find out whether any one is there before you attempt to go into the hut  bob thought as did both dick and jim that harnett was foolishly particular but since the young engineer was so decided about the matter he thought it best to do as he was requested  when therefore they arrived at the edge of the clearing the party waited within the shadow of the trees while bob stole cautiously around as before with no idea that he should see any one in front of the hut  while he was absent dick and jim were disposed to make sport of what they termed georges caution and this merriment caused so much noise that harnett found it necessary to remind them very sharply that both he and ralph without any interest other than curiosity in the matter and after they had been of no slight service might be obliged to pay dearly for the part they had taken in consideration of which the least that could be done would be to follow out this very reasonable request  after this the boys quieted down considerably and when bob returned they were thankful that they had done so  bob startled them all even george and ralph by the information that newcombe and his men were still on guard in front of the hut and that to all appearances they had not left the stations they were occupying when the party started out to shoot mr hoxies well  if this was the case who then was the party that had disturbed them at the completion of their work this was the question that agitated them decidedly and they were beginning a very animated discussion on the subject when george said  it can make no particular difference just at this moment who they were some one was coming probably other torpedo detectives and we ran away newcombe and his men are still here on guard now the most important thing for us to do is to get into the hut as quickly and silently as possible and if those others were detectives perhaps our friend mr newcombe will be able to swear that we have not been outside during the night  there could be no answer to such an argument as this save in action and each one started for the hut dick and jim feeling decidedly ashamed of the sport they had made of georges excess of caution  to enter the building silently was as easy as to leave it and in five minutes more the party were inside with the shutters of the back window carefully barred  then they gave way without restraint to their mirth at having accomplished their work while newcombe watched their hut for them and they might have continued at this amusing occupation during the remainder of the night if sounds from the outside had not told them that other visitors were arriving  now we shall find out who it was that disturbed us said bob gleefully as he clambered upon the improvised platform that he might see what was going on outside from the peephole  the boys believing as bob did that these newcomers were the same ones whose arrival at mr hoxies latelyopened well was the cause of their hasty flight awaited expectantly the result of bobs survey  three men are riding up said bob and now they are stopping their horses as newcombe goes toward them they all appear to be talking excitedly and every few seconds newcombe points this way now they are coming right toward the door  there was no longer any need for bob to describe the proceedings for the noise made by the carriage could be plainly heard by all as it came toward the house and in a very few moments even the conversation of the men could be distinguished  the well had just been shot as we got there one of the newcomers could be heard to say and you know that bob hubbard was to do the work you have allowed the boy to fool you newcombe and while you have been here he has been working at hoxies  but i tell you that i heard him in here early in the afternoon and the darkey told me his team was in the stable now how could he have gotten the glycerine or cartridges out of here while six of us have been on duty all the time  and from the tone of newcombes voice it was easy to understand that he was very angry with these colleagues of his for doubting his ability to watch three boys  are you certain it was bob whom you heard asked the first speaker he may have left some one here and been at hoxies before you arrived  i am certain there was some one here said newcombe speaking less decidedly than before and i would be willing to bet everything i own that it was bob hubbard  betting is a very bad way to settle disputes mr newcombe said bob laughingly shouting so that every one outside could hear his voice and i would advise you to give it up in the future but in this particular case you would win the money  there what did i tell you cried the detective to his visitors and it is very probable that just at that moment he looked upon bob as a true friend  yes bob is there said the man reluctantly but jim and dick were at the well  heres dick shouted that young gentleman and when you two want to hold an animated conversation about either one of us try not to start it at night nor so near the door of a sleepingroom as to disturb those who may need a little rest  and here is jim shouted that young moonlighter so now that you know we are here where brother newcombe has been watching for the last dozen hours suppose the whole posse of you drive back to bradford where you belong  for a moment there was a profound silence outside as if this last astute detective was too much surprised to be able to speak and then mr newcombe burst into an uncontrollable fit of triumphant laughter he knew that it was impossible for any number of boys to fool him and very likely he almost pitied his brotherdetective for being so simple  from the sounds the boys judged that the men were moving away from the hut and bob once more had access to the peephole as a point of observation  they are harnessing their horses now he said after he had looked out a few moments and i guess newcombe has convinced his friend that we must have been innocent of the shooting of hoxies well  the question among them now will be as to who the other moonlighters are laughed dick  and all of them found no little cause for merriment in the idea of newcombe and his friends pursuing these imaginary moonlighters  they have started for the stable again continued bob i suppose they want to make sure that there is no chance for us to get the horses out by any way other than the front door what muffs they are not to think how easy it would be for us to do just as we did they have walked entirely around the stable and are now coming back again  it was evident that mr newcombes friend needed some further proof to assure himself that it was not the boys whom he had disturbed for newcombe said as he came near the hut  bob i dont suppose you have any especial love for any of us but you know that what we are doing is all fair in the way of business and nothing as especially against you now just as a favor to me i want you to tell us what we have done since we came here  it was apparent to bob as it was to all in the hut that the question was asked simply to convince the newcomers that the boys could not have left the hut during the night and bob after having descended from his perch in order that his voice might not betray the fact that he had been on the lookout answered readily  i didnt know that you had been doing much of anything you paid pete for some information which could hardly have been worth the money and passed it up to him on the hayfork for he wouldnt open the door to you then you sent one of your party somewhere for food and since you had your supper you have amused us by sitting in front of the hut is that enough  plenty and thank you was the reply made in such a cheery tone that there was no question but that it had been sufficiently convincing  then bob scrambled upon his rather shaky perch once more in order to give full information to his companions of the movements of those outside  he reported from time to time as to what they were doing in the way getting their teams ready looking around the premises but without taking more than a casual glance at the rear of the house however and then he said  now they are getting into their wagons now they are driving out on the road and now he added as he leaped down with a loud shout they have disappeared to find the parties who shot the hoxie well perfectly content that we could have had no hand in the business since it is a certainty in newcombes mind that we have not left the hut since he drove up here hurrah for bob hubbards scheme and newcombes belief in his own ability as a detective     chapter viii  new quarters   until nearly daylight the boys remained awake laughing over newcombes credulity or congratulating each other on the success of that nights work and then bob who for half an hour had been studying some plan said  it isnt best for us to spend all our time laughing at newcombe or we may find out that hes smarter than we give him credit of being if we expect to shoot any more wells in this vicinity we must change our quarters for we can safely count on this being watched  what if it is cried dick their success having made him very bold wasnt it watched tonight and didnt we shoot the hoxie well in spite of them all  yes we fooled newcombe well but we might find it difficult to do so the second time then again all our work would not be as convenient to the hut as this was and if it had been necessary for us to get our horses out you must admit that newcombe had us very foul  and bob while he felt thoroughly elated by their victory did not want that his partners should come to believe that all difficulties could be surmounted as readily  but what do you mean about changing our quarters asked jim who looked upon their hut as something particularly convenient and well located  i mean that we have got to build another shanty somewhere if we cant find one readymade  nonsense theres no more use of our leaving this place than there is of our trying to fly said dick i aint afraid that newcombe will come here again very soon  but i know he will persisted bob just as soon as he suspects that we are about to do any work he will have so many men around here that we cant show our noses out of doors without being seen you think im right dont you harnett  well now see here replied george with a laugh i think ralph and i have had all the moonlighting that is good for us without going still further by aiding and abetting you with advice  but you can tell us what you think persisted bob  well i suppose i may venture that far after having participated in the shooting of the hoxie well i dont think that this place is safe for you any longer and if i was a member of this firm i should move everything from here as soon as possible  it was plain to be seen that dick and jim had great faith in harnetts advice on any subject for as soon as he had spoken all argument was at an end and after a brief pause dick asked  but where could we go  i think i know of a place as good as this about five miles up the valley where by working a couple of days we could fix things up as well as we have them here  then lets see to it at once said jim who thought if they were obliged to move the sooner the disagreeable job was over the better  im ready to start now if george and gurney will help us replied bob quietly  if we will help you echoed george you believe in using your friends for your benefit dont you  well in this case it seems as if you might be of great assistance to us and yet not do very much violence to your own feelings you know as well as i do that the chances are newcombe or his men are or will be scouring the country today for those who shot hoxies well now if dick jim and i start out alone and they see us driving about the country where we presumably have no business they will follow us and goodby to our chances of getting settled very soon but if you and gurney will take your fishingtackle pete and i will go with you in our double wagon and while he and i are attending to work i will show you as good trout fishing as you ever saw  it was a skillfullyprepared bait as he intended it should be for he knew that the two friends were fond of fishing and they knew that he was an authority on the subject of trout streams  at first george attempted to excuse himself on the score of having business to attend to but it was easy to see that he wanted to go and equally plain that ralph had forgotten all the unpleasant experiences of the night in his desire for sport  you see you wont be doing anything in the way of moonlighting said bob persuasively for you will honestly be going out fishing you need know nothing whatever about what pete and i are doing and since we have a supply of food sufficient to last at least two days longer you will have no better chance than this  whether george really had any work to which he should have attended or not he evidently put all consideration of everything save sport aside for he asked  well what do you think of it ralph  i think it is just as bob says we shant be doing anything but that which we have a perfect right to do and if you can remain away from your business so long i say lets go  bob waited only long enough to hear this decision and then he went at once to the stable where he ordered pete to harness his horses into the double wagon in which they carried their materials when out on professional business  the old negro did not hesitate to tell his employer all that newcombe had said to him the detective had offered him ten dollars if he would answer certain questions and understanding that he did not know anything which could compromise those who hired him had not thought it a breach of confidence to take the money  newcombe had asked who were in the hut and pete had told him for he knew the detective was quite as well informed as he was but when newcombe questioned him as to what the boys were about to do where or when they were going he was truly unable to give the desired information  this was all the detective had received for his expenditure of ten dollars and the old darkey chuckled greatly over the ease with which he had earned the money  when the team was ready dick and jim started out for the purpose of having their horses harnessed since they had no idea but that they were to accompany the expedition but such was not a portion of bobs plan  you must stay here and get the traps ready to be moved he said for if we should all go it would be quite as bad if we were seen as if we hadnt george and ralph with us besides your horses must be fresh for tonight for we will hitch them into the torpedo wagon and it is necessary that they should be able to get away from anything on the road in case newcombe should take it into his head to chase us  both the boys knew bob was right and much as they disliked remaining at the hut while the others were enjoying themselves fishing they quietly submitted to what could not be avoided  pete put a few tools into the wagon bob added enough in the way of eatables to last the party twentyfour hours and just as the sun was rising the real and pretended fishermen started  the road led directly back through sawyer and on the opposite side of the creek a fact which showed how necessary it was for bob to have some one with him who would give to the journey the semblance of sport rather than business  the horses were driven at a brisk trot despite the roughness of the roads and in less than an hour from the time of leaving the hut bob turned his horse into what apparently was the thick woods but in which a road that was hardly more than a path could just be discerned after the thicket by the side of the highway had been passed through  over logs stumps and brushwood bob drove with a calm disregard to the difficulties of the way or to the comfort of himself and his companions until a small hut or rather shanty was reached when he announced that they were at the end of their journey  well said george as he alighted from the wagon so far as being hidden from view goes this is a good place but i fancy it will be quite a different matter when you try to bring a load of glycerine here it would be a job that i should hesitate to undertake  we can make the road all right with a few hours work and then we will put up some kind of a shelter for a stable but just now fishing not a roadway for torpedo wagons is your aim and if you and ralph will follow right up on this path you will come to a stream from which you can catch as many trout as you want  taking a generous lunch with them and wishing bob success in his work george and ralph set out for a days fishing believing that their connection with the moonlighters was very nearly at an end  after leaving bob neither of the boys had very much to say about their adventure of the previous night for it had terminated so happily that it no longer worried them and the thought of the enjoyment they were to have drove everything else from their minds  the stream was as promising a one as the most ardent disciple of walton could have desired and but little time was spent after they arrived at its banks before they had made their first cast  the fish were as plenty as bob had promised and when the time came for their noonday lunch they had nearly full baskets of speckled beauties that would weigh from a quarter to threequarters of a pound each  during the forenoon they had fished up stream and when their lunch was finished they started down with the idea that they would reach the path they had started from just about the time bob would be ready to return to the other hut  on the way down there was no necessity that they should fish in company therefore each went along as he chose with the understanding that the one who reached the path first should wait for the other  ralph walked on ahead of george dropping his line at every promisinglooking place in the stream but meeting with very poor luck as compared with the forenoons work he only succeeded in catching four while returning when he had captured fully thirty on the way up and owing to the absence of fish or their disinclination to bite at his hook he arrived at the point from which he had started fully two hours before he had expected to be there  but early as he was he found bob impatiently awaiting his arrival and the moonlighters first inquiry was for the absent engineer  we agreed to fish leisurely down stream expecting to be here about sunset replied ralph i fancy he is meeting with better luck than i did and that it will be some time before he gets here  well we cant wait for him said bob quickly we have got everything so that we can move in tonight and i want to be off it wont do for me to show myself without at least one of you so we will send pete back here to wait for george and you and i will go on  but how shall i meet him asked ralph not by any means pleased at this idea of leaving his friend  thats easy enough to manage go back with me get harnetts team come back here behind us get him and drive home to kennistons you will be there by ten oclock and we shall see you at breakfast time  but i dont like to leave george for i promised him i would wait for him here  ah that will be all right for pete will explain matters to him  and as he spoke bob dragged ralph along regardless alike of his remonstrances or his struggles  on arriving at the shanty the old negro was given his instructions and without further delay the two started ralph feeling decidedly uncomfortable for it seemed to him that in some way he had no idea how he was being forced to take part in another of bobs schemes     chapter ix  the night drive of the torpedo wagon   bob was in such good spirits as he drove along toward the hut he was about to abandon that if ralph had been in the least degree suspicious he would have believed that it was a portion of the young moonlighters plan to separate him from his friend although if such an idea had presented itself to ralph he would have been at a loss to understand how such a separation could have affected bobs interest  had the young student been more acquainted with the work of the moonlighters however he would have understood that another wagon behind the one containing the tools and materials for wellshooting would aid very decidedly in allowing the first team to escape in case it was pursued  then again ralph did not know that it was against the laws of any town to convey nitroglycerine through its streets and that in thus moving his quarters bob not only ran the chance of being pursued by the torpedo detectives but also by the authorities of the town through which he must pass in order to get to his new camp  had george been with ralph the two would simply have driven back to the hut in the woods and from there to farmer kennistons home but in his absence it would be necessary for ralph to follow bob back in harnetts team for the purpose of taking his friend home  however earnestly the young student had resolved not to have anything more to do with the moonlighters either actively or as a spectator he was by chance and bobs scheming aiding them in a more active and more dangerous way than ever before  we shall come right back said bob in a reassuring tone as he saw how ill at ease ralph felt and george wont have any longer time to wait than will be pleasant because of his weariness  still i had much rather waited for him replied ralph  and then when it was too late he began to blame himself for not having insisted on staying behind as george proposed  it is much better this way because it will be a saving of time for him replied bob  and then he began to tell stories and make himself generally agreeable in order to allay any suspicions that might arise in his companions mind  in this bob was so far successful that when they arrived at the hut where jim and dick were waiting ralph had nearly forgotten his vexation at having left george and believed that no better fellow or more agreeable companion than bob hubbard could be found in all the oil region  dick and jim had not been idle while the others had been away and everything in the hut was made ready for immediate removal  bob told them briefly of the hidingplace he had found and then the work of loading the wagons was begun ralph noting with a slight feeling of resentment that georges team was to be loaded as well as the others  the torpedo wagon was already laden with its dangerous load and bob showed it to him as a new feature of the oil business which he had not seen in operation the night previous because of newcombes vigilance  to all outward appearance it was a longbodied box buggy with a much deeper seat than is usually seen and with a double set of finelytempered springs to prevent as much as possible any jolting of the load when the seat was turned over working on hinges placed in front the peculiar formation of the vehicle was seen that portion of the carriage usually covered by the seat was divided into sixteen compartments each padded over springs and formed with as much care as a jewel casket in each of these compartments was a can of nitroglycerine protected from any undueconcussion or jolting by the springs within as well as without  at each end on the left side of the wagon rose a slender iron rod fashioned at the top like the letter u which was used as a restingplace for the tin cartridges and rising high enough to be out of the way of the driver  there are one hundred and twentyeight quarts of glycerine in that little cart said bob as he gazed at it admiringly and if any one chooses to chase us through sawyer theyll take precious good care that they dont get very near you see the officers must keep up a show of activity in trying to prevent us from driving through the town but they are careful not to run us down too sharply  ralph had not the slightest idea of what bob meant when he spoke of officers in the town chasing them and would have asked for an explanation then had not the moonlighter hurried away to get the other teams ready  it was then dark and the boys were anxious to make the journey as quickly as possible for it was a task about which even they did not feel wholly at ease  in the carriage bob and ralph had just come in were packed the tools provisions sheettin and such material as made a heavy load while in georges buggy was the bedding and other light articles which made up a bulky load but one in which there was but little weight  after the three teams had been loaded the house locked and barred as carefully as if the inmates were yet within and the stable door secured by jim who barred it from the interior and then clambered out of the window in the loft bob called his two partners one side for a private consultation  without knowing why ralph felt decidedly uncomfortable at this secrecy it was true that he had no desire to be told all the details of this somewhat questionable business but it seemed to him as if he was in some way the subject of their conversationas if he had been and was again to be duped and bob was explaining the scheme to his partners  it was some time before the private portion of their consultation was over and then bob said sufficiently loud for ralph to hear much as if that had been all they were talking of  now remember we are to keep close together until we get through sawyer then if we are followed you are to give me a chance to get ahead and you will keep straight on until you tire them out if you drive all night ralph he added jim knows the road and you dont so i am going to let him drive for you  then bob got into the torpedowagon dick mounted the one that had come from the new camp jim and ralph clambered into georges team and in that order they started toward the highway bob driving leisurely as if to keep his horses fresh in case they were called upon for any unusual exertion  the orders bob had given aroused in ralphs mind now that it was too late to make any objection the suspicions that his pleasing manner had lulled he began to see why it was he had been hurried away before george came  the torpedowagon was the one that the authorities would attempt to capture if they saw it and georges team being in the rear would be the one that would most likely stand the brunt of the pursuit in case one was made the other two teams being ahead could turn from the road into the woods at a favorable opportunity while georges horses would lure the officers away from the telltale loads  ralph knew perfectly well that had harnett come from the stream at the same time he did his team would not have been used as a cover for he had no desire to implicate himself with the moonlighters even if they were his friends and would possibly have refused to act or allow his team to act any such part  but while all these ideas passed through ralphs mind he was not certain he was correct in his suppositions and it was so he thought not advisable for him to say anything until the time came when bobs plans were made apparent besides he hoped that the officers would not see them that there would be no necessity for flight and that georges horses would be restored to their owner fresh and in good condition  during the first two miles of their journey there was nothing to which the most careful person could have taken objection unless indeed it was the fact of riding behind a carriage loaded with nitroglycerine which was by no means a pleasant thing to do and then the little town of sawyer was reached  up to this time the horses had trotted slowly but on entering the town bob set the example of driving faster and all three teams were urged along at full speed  it surely seemed as if the moving of the moonlighters property was to be accomplished without difficulty for the outskirts of sawyer had nearly been passed before any sign was made that they had been observed and then the clattering of horses hoofs was heard at the same time that a voice cried  halt  the time had come when ralph was to learn whether bob was making a catspaw of him or not and the suspicions he had had fast became certainties  no reply was made by the moonlighters but the horses were urged to still greater speed and the race had begun  dont drive so fast said ralph believing the time had come for him to act in georges behalf  why not asked jim coolly theyll overhaul us if we dont put on all steam  and what if they do this is harnetts team and there is no reason why we should run away  what about all these things that are in here  there is nothing here but what we have a perfect right to carry and i know that george will be angry by running away from the officers with his team which is probably well known we seem to be doing something which we have no right to do said ralph sternly at the same time that he endeavored to get possession of the reins  look out dont make a fool of yourself cried jim sharply  and he urged the horses on until he had worked them up into such a state that it required all his strength to hold them  to have attempted to seize the reins then would simply have been to capsize the buggy for the road was so rough that the least deviation from the beaten track at the pace the horses were then going would have been fatal and ralph was obliged to acquiesce in the flight by remaining perfectly quiet  on the horses dashed as if bent on the destruction of the carriage behind could be heard the clatter of hoofs as the pursuers did their best to overtake the violators of the law and in the advance was the carriage with its deadly load that the least concussion would liberate in all its dreadful power     chapter x  the return   in the excitement of the flight and the sorrow caused by the thought of the injury which was being done his friend in which he was forced unwillingly to take part ralph almost entirely forgot the dangerous load in advance until an exclamation of triumph from jim caused him to look ahead when he discovered that bob was no longer in sight  ralph was almost certain that they had just passed the road that led to the new camp and equally positive that bob had driven in at that point but there was nothing to show that the torpedowagon had been driven in there and jim was too much occupied with his efforts to keep in advance of his pursuers to answer a question or even to speak  georges horses of whom he was so fond that he would never allow them to be forced to full speed were urged by both whip and word until they could no longer trot but were running madly on while the light carriage swayed from one side of the road to the other until it seemed certain it would be overturned  ralph was powerless to prevent such use of his friends property but he entered his protest against it by saying  this matter of using georges team to permit your own to escape is something on which i have not been consulted nor have i been permitted to say anything about it i think i understand why hubbard got me away from the stream before george came down and i say to you now as i shall say to both of your friends that it is a mean piece of business and one which i would do all in my power to prevent if it was possible for me to do so without running the risk of doing more harm than good  oh thats all right replied jim as he tried to urge the already nearlyexhausted horses to still greater exertions  but ralph had no idea as to what he meant by all right if he meant that there was no harm in driving at such a mad pace ralph was certain he was wrong and if he wished to convey the impression that harnett would not be angry the young student was equally certain he was mistaken  the sounds made by the pursuers seemed to be dying away in the distance as if the pace was too fast for them and as dick guided his team skillfully into the woods two miles beyond where bob had disappeared jim gave vent to another yell of triumph  the moonlighters property was safe and it only remained to be seen how much harnett was to suffer by the flight  the now thoroughly maddened horses were dashing along the rough road at a most reckless pace and ralph shuddered at the thought of what the result might be if they should meet any teams either coming or going but fortunately it was so late in the night that thus far they had seen no travelers and the only hope was that they would be equally successful until the wild flight was ended  on and on jim urged the horses with no signs of checking their speed until finally when it was no longer possible to hear any sounds from the rear ralph said  i dont hear any one behind and if you do not pull the horses up soon you will ruin them if indeed you have not done so already  as near as ralph could judge they were fully ten miles beyond the place where bob had left the road when jim began to quiet the frightened animals and before another mile had been traveled he had succeeded so far as to make them sober down to a walk  guiding them to one side of the road where it chanced to be very broad jim brought them to a full stop and ralph leaped out to examine them  the glossy coats of the beautiful animals were wet with perspiration and covered with foam until they looked like white horses marked with small patches of black their red dilating nostrils and heaving flanks told of the effect the mad pace had had upon them and they looked as if it would have been impossible for them to have run another mile  ralph even believed that they were already exhausted and that they were utterly ruined but jim treated his fears as childish being hardly willing to follow out the suggestions made  if they are not foundered already they will be unless we do something for them at once lets rub them down thoroughly and then start them back at a walk  jim objected to doing what he considered useless work and would have started the exhausted animals on the return at once if ralph had not assumed a tone that startled him  during the ride i held my peace because i could do no good but now i want you distinctly to understand that you will do as i say in regard to caring for these horses or there will be trouble between us i should not hesitate for a moment after what you have done to leave you here and drive back alone  you might not hesitate providing you could get me out of the carriage replied jim pertly but i might have something to say if you should attempt any interference  look here mr james lansel said ralph decidedly trying not to betray by his voice the anger he felt you will please understand now that i have interfered and that i shall do exactly what i say you will come out here and help me to care for these horses you have abused or i shall endeavor to prove to your entire satisfaction which one of us is master  while ralph had been speaking he had unfastened the traces of the horses and by the time he concluded one of the animals was clear from the carriage had he not done so it is extremely probable that jim might have tried to run away and leave him instead of being left as it was however he apparently did not think it either a pleasant or a safe operation to measure strength with a boy fresh from school and after a moments hesitation in a very sulky sort of way he alighted doing as ralph had commanded  the gallant little steeds were rubbed down well with dried grass ralph rinsed their mouths out as cleanly as possible with water from the side of the road but taking good care not to allow them any to drink and for an hour the two boysone through fear and the other because of his care for his friends propertydid all they could for the comfort of the animals  during all this time jim had not spoken once and ralph was quite content to let him sulk as much as he wished he felt as though jim and his partners had done him a grievous wrong in placing him in such a position as made it seem that he had aided in the abusing and temporary theft of georges horses and if the entire party of moonlighters chose to be angry with him he did not care  at the end of the hour ralph said to the still angry injured jim  we will harness them now and i will drive on the way back  you can do just as you please replied jim ive got nothing to do with it and i wash my hands of the whole affair  you may wash your hands of this portion of the affair as much as you please but youll take the full share of responsibility for having driven out here  jim made no reply which was a matter of but little moment so ralph thought but he assisted in harnessing the horses and when that was done he took his seat in the carriage like a martyr  ralph followed him and gathering up the reins he allowed the horses to choose their own gait going back a tenderness towards animals that jim looked upon with the most supreme contempt  as a matter of course their progress was very slow for the animals were so weary that they had no desire to go faster than a walk and still without speaking the two boys rode on occupying three hours in returning over the same distance they had come in one  to find in the night the place into which bob had driven was an extremely difficult task and more than once did ralph stop the horses by the side of the road calling vigorously to george in the belief that they had reached the new quarters of the moonlighters  it was not until after they had made four such mistakes that they heard georges voice in reply and then he and pete came out to lead the horses in through the thicket of bushes that screened the entrance of the road  ralph saw at once by the look on his friends face and the solicitude with which he examined his horses that bob had told the first portion of the story which had been more than displeasing to him  did you drive all the way ralph he asked  and his tone was far from being as friendly as usual  i had nothing whatever to do with the horses or the trip except to help rub them down when we stopped and to drive home replied ralph almost indignant that george should think even for a moment that he would have countenanced such a thing  harnett said no more then but busied himself in caring for the animals by unharnessing and feeding them  jim soon joined his partners in the hut and after he had gone george asked ralph for the particulars of the chase which were given minutely  after he had finished the story not without several interruptions from george he asked  how long are you going to stay here  only until morning i would have gone home tonight if the horses had not had such a long and hard drive but as it is we can do no better than to stay here a while and early in the morning we will say goodby to mr bob hubbard and his partners trying to get out of the trouble they have placed us in as cheaply as possible  why is there anything new asked ralph anxiously  nothing save this last scheme of bobs and that is quite enough i dont consider shooting wells as anything really illegal for i do not believe that the patent can be held but when it comes to violating a town ordinance by carrying a large quantity of nitroglycerine through it in the manner bob did i consider a great wrong has been done for it endangers the lives of every one living there we shall probably hear from it very soon for my team is well known in sawyer then again bob knew that such a thing would injure me seriously in my business i set myself up as civil engineer and thereby ask people to employ me that they will have every reason to refuse to do when they see me mixed up with bob hubbards mad actions  ralph had thought the matter serious enough before but now he understood from what george had said just how much trouble might grow out of it and all the anger he had felt during the ride was revived  i wish i had stopped the horses as i had a mind to do during the drive regardless of whether i smashed the carriage or not he said bitterly i felt that things were going wrong in some way when i first left here with bob but i didnt know in what way and what he said was so practical that i couldnt give a single good reason as to why i should not do as he said  im not blaming you ralph for i know as well as you do that it was not your fault it was a portion of one of bobs schemes and without caring how much he has injured us he is probably congratulating himself on its perfect success but come lets go and lie down for a little while and when we do get away from here in the morning we will be careful not to place ourselves where bob can use us again     chapter xi  the storm in the valley   judging from appearances when they entered the new cabin of the moonlighters ralph concluded that george had said some hard things to bob because of the part he had obliged him to play when the two went in to get the few hours of sleep they needed so sadly for they had been awake during all of the previous night no one spoke they were all having what ralph afterward described as a grand sulking match but neither one of their guests paid the slightest attention to their ill humor  it was then very late in the night and tired as each one was it was but a few moments before the camp was in a state of complete repose from which neither moonlighter engineer nor student awakened until the sun had been looking in upon them nearly an hour  if bob had been cross the previous evening his sleep had restored him to his usual good humor and he greeted ralph and george with the cheeriest of smiles  i say old fellow he began when harnett returned from making his toilet at the brookside i realize that we played you a dirty kind of a trick in using your team as we did last night but at the time i was so anxious to get everything over here all right that i did not stop to think about it of course i cant undo what has been done but if any money trouble comes to you because of last nights work neither you nor gurney shall lose a cent try to forget it wont you george shake hands with me and say that you will  very few could withstand bob hubbard when he spoke as he did then and harnetts anger began to vanish immediately his moonlighting friend spoke  well say no more about it bob and ill believe you wouldnt have done such a thing to me if you had taken time to think it over replied george as he shook hands not only with bob but with the other two  now gurney come right up and say that you bear no grudge against jim he knows that you were in the right when you insisted on having the horses cared for and he would have known it last night if he hadnt got excited as he always does when anything is up  jim came up with outstretched hand as bob spoke and in a few moments the party were friendly once more although the determination which ralph and george had formed relative to not visiting the moonlighters in their haunts again was still as strong as ever  with the provisions they had on hand and the fish that had been caught the day before pete served up such a breakfast as would have tempted an epicure and it may be imagined with what zest these hungry boys attacked it  bob and his party intended to remain where they were during that day at least for it would be necessary to do many things to the shanty before it would be even a secure hidingplace for their goods and although they urged that their visitors remain with them george was still firm in his determination to return to the kenniston farm as soon as he had finished breakfast  it was not until after bob had exhausted every other argument in vain that he said  i think it would be much better george if you should stay here today and give the people a chance to cool off in regard to last nights proceedings if you go through sawyer this morning they may make it disagreeable for you  that is one reason why i am determined to go at once if any trouble is to come of your drive i want it over as soon as possible and the sooner i show myself in sawyer the more satisfied i shall feel  but the chances are that the matter will drop through if you keep out of sight for a day or two persisted bob almost entreatingly  and i dont want it to drop through if they propose to make any trouble i prefer to meet them rather than wait around in the hope that it will be forgotten i am obliged to earn my living and from these people here for the time being therefore they will be doing me a very great favor if they find out exactly how far i am responsible for last nights work  it was useless to attempt to persuade george to do other than that which he had decided upon and bob recognized that fact he said nothing more against the departure of his guests but did all in his power to aid them in getting ready for the journey  the horses did not appear to be affected in the least by their hard drive on the previous night and this more than anything else caused george to feel less hard toward his friends the moonlighters  it was nine oclock in the morning before ralph and george were ready to set out and as they were starting bob called out  remember we shall stand whatever my drive may cost you and this evening we will meet you at home  there was a feeling of positive relief in ralphs heart when they drove out into the road the trees behind shutting out the moonlighters from view it was as if he had been suffering from some disagreeable nightmare and he would have been thankful it was ended if it was not for the awakening in the form of driving through sawyer liable to be arrested at any moment  george he asked at length do you really think that what was done last night will injure your business prospects  i feel so certain of it that i shall begin to make preparations to leave here as soon as i finish what i have on hand i certainly know that i would not employ a man who would deliberately assist in carrying a large quantity of glycerine through a town and at the same time drive in the most reckless manner  but you can prove that you were not with the party and that you knew nothing of what was being done  yes i can prove that if they give me the opportunity and i am now in the position of a man who longs most ardently to be arrested but yet who does not dare to appear too eager about it  i cant say that i want to be arrested said ralph dubiously for father and mother would think i had been doing something terrible but i would be perfectly willing to stand it if it would do you any good  it is about the only thing that can do me any good replied george decidedly and then he added quickly but we wont talk any more about it let us enjoy this ride thoroughly for we have just escaped from the moonlighters den i cant say however that our troubles are entirely over for by the looks of those black clouds we shall stand a chance of getting a drenching  it was as george had said the sky which had been cloudless when they started was now being obscured by black angrylooking clouds which threatened at any moment to break and pour their burden of water upon the parched earth  had they been riding where no shelter could be found both the boys would have been alarmed for there was every indication of a heavy shower but since there were houses along the road in which they could take shelter at almost any moment they rode on determined to get as near as possible to their destination before the storm burst  george urged the horses along hoping that they might reach the town of sawyer before the rain came but in this he was mistaken for before they had ridden five minutes from the time he first spoke the great drops that acted as avant couriers to the large body of water descended and the boys had just time to drive under a rude shed before the storm was upon them  a vivid flash of lightning followed immediately by a deafening peal of thunder was the prelude to as terrific a thunderstorm as the boys had ever seen and as the rain descended in what seemed to be sheets of water rather than drops the lightning flashed almost incessantly while the thunder roared until it seemed as if the very earth was shaken  even george had never passed a summer in this section of the country before and he knew no more than did ralph the destruction often caused by the electric current where so much inflammable material is stored  without a thought of the possible catastrophe that might occur they remained under their apology for a shelter through which the water poured in anything but tiny streams looking out at the majestic spectacle fearing only that the wind might throw the frail shed down upon them  look there cried ralph as an unusually brilliant flash was seen it almost appeared as if the lightning ran entirely around that oiltank i wonder if those are ever struck  it must make sad work if they are replied george thinking for the first time of such a possibility in that tank alone there must be fully thirtyfive thousand barrels of oil and the conflagration would be something terrible  he had hardly ceased speaking when there came a flash that almost blinded them as it descended directly on the top of a huge derrick crackling and hissing as it came and in what seemed to be the slightest possible fraction of time the air was filled with fragments of the heavy timbers while despite the pouring rain a sulphurous odor was perceptible  the derrick had been struck and its thousand fragments strewed the earth in every direction  how terrible cried ralph as he covered his face with is hands in affright for never before had he witnessed the terrific force of the lightnings bolt  george stood at the door of the shed restless regardless alike of the deluge of water that fell upon him and of the neighing and stamping of the frightened horses he was like one fascinated by the awful majesty of that which he saw everywhere around him  his gaze was directed toward the largest oil tank in the valley while it seemed as if some will stronger than his own impelled him to look at this enormous construction of iron filled with its easily ignited contents and as he thus stood awed into silence it seemed to him that the largest cloud was rent entirely asunder while from its very center a torrent of fire was poured on to the tank from which the flames appeared to leap to meet the shaft from heaven  in an instant the entire body of oil was a seething mass of flames while the very rain seemed to add to their fury one of the largest tanks in the valley had been struck and the destruction threatened every living thing that could not flee to the mountains from the river of fire that poured out over the shattered iron sides of the tank     chapter xii  the conflagration   the grandeur of the scene upon which george and ralph looked was indescribable the slightest detail of which once seen could never be forgotten  the lurid flames surmounted by the thick black smoke towered upward as if to meet the lightnings flash and then as the wind and rain beat it down for a moment the heavy clouds of smoke rolled down the valley like some funereal pall sent in advance of the death and destruction that was to come  what can we do cried ralph when the awe which the scene had brought with it gave place to fear for others and a desire to avert suffering and destruction  we can do nothing replied george in a low tone we do not even know how to fight the burning oil and are powerless to do anything at least until others shall come to direct the work  but we can surely give the alarm and arouse the people cried ralph as he attempted to rush out of the shed but was prevented by george  do you think there is any one within two miles of here who cannot see that blaze asked george as he pointed to the mountain of flame we can accomplish nothing therefore we will remain here quiet until those who are familiar with such scenes shall come  ralph recognized the common sense of georges suggestion even when it seemed impossible that he could remain idle and while the two stood outside the shed regardless of the furious rain waiting for those to come who could direct their labor they witnessed another scene fitting companion to the one already pictured  the lightning flashes were as vivid and rapid as ever save that the glare may have seemed a trifle less blinding because of the flames and there was no sign that the storm was decreasing suddenly even while it appeared as if a small whirlwind enveloped a derrick that stood on the hill on the opposite side of the valley another storm of fire descended from the sky wrapping the heavy timbers in flames without shattering them and flinging angry tongues of fire on nearly every timber in the towering pile  for a few moments this lofty beacon burned as if trying to outshine the larger conflagration and then as the heat grew more intense the small tank at its base became a receptacle for flames which overflowing poured an angry stream of fire down the side of the mountain igniting the various deposits of oil in its course  in an incredibly short space of time the valley which had but a few moments before been deluged with water was covered with flames and burning streams which the rain appeared to feed rather than extinguish  then as rapidly as they had come the stormclouds cleared away the rain ceased and the sun came out clear and hot but unable to send its rays through the impenetrable clouds of smoke which overhung the lowland and wrapped the hills with a sable shroud  others besides ralph and george had seen the first damage done by the lightning for living where such scenes were not infrequent they feared at each threatened storm just that catastrophe which had occurred and a small army of men were already on the scene by the time the two boys had recovered from the awe which had come upon them with this second danger that was pouring down upon the valley from the mountainside  it seemed a useless because impossible task to attempt to check the progress of or extinguish the burning oil and yet the assembled multitude attacked it with a will that seemed all the more heroic because of the wellnigh hopelessness of the labor  fastening the now thoroughly frightened horses so that they could not release themselves from the shed which was situated on ground sufficiently high to prevent the burning torrent from flowing around it ralph and george threw off their coats and vests preparatory to doing what they could to check the course of this servant of man now become master  quantities of shovels and pickaxes had been brought at the first alarm and armed with one of these ralph and george joined the others in throwing up embankments to check the course of the streams of burning oil in order to hold them confined until the liquid should be consumed  then women and children were aiding in the work for it was to save their homes from destruction that they labored and foremost among them ever was george struggling against the firefiend as if everything the world held dear to him was in danger of destruction  then came the call for volunteers to get the cannon which were nearly two miles away that solid shot might be fired into the tank to open a passage for the oil not yet ignited and ralph was the first to offer his services  he had already had some considerable experience in artillery practice and when george explained this to some of those who were directing the work ralph was gladly accepted to take charge of the guns  he was a gunner without any artillery but twice as many men as were necessary started at full speed toward the town and in a short time the only two cannon that could be procured without going to bradford were on the ground while ralph was hastily preparing the charges of powder  it may be thought that it would not require much skill to hit at short range such a large object as an oiltank capable of holding thirtyfive thousand barrels but since in order to send the ball through the iron plates it was necessary to hit it full at the place aimed for otherwise the projectile would glance off it can be seen that ralph was obliged to exhibit considerable skill  while this was being done the others were throwing up earthworks to divert the course of the blazing streams or to dam the oil in such places as it could burn without damage to other property and it can safely be imagined that but little time was spent in watching what the others were doing  after george had announced that ralph had had experience in the use of artillery pieces and after the cannon had been brought from the town he was left to superintend the work a sufficient number of men remaining near to follow his instructions  the day was a hot one and the heat from the fire together with that from the sun was almost insupportable but stripped of all clothing that could conveniently be cast aside each one continued at his selfimposed task of averting the threatened destruction from the town  each moment despite all that was being done the flames were creeping closer and closer to the town which seemed doomed and as the time passed every one saw how useless their efforts would be unless the iron tank could be pierced allowing a portion of the oil to run off before it could be ignited  many were the entreaties to ralph to hurry with his work but fully believing the old adage that haste makes waste he completed his operations with deliberation only hurrying when he could do so without running any risk of a failure  be quick ralph cried george as he came up smoke begrimed and bearing many traces of his severe work every moment is more than precious now and even after you begin you may have to fire several shots  i shall fire only one at each tank replied ralph calmly the pieces were dirty and rusty and it would have been a waste of both time and ammunition to have shot with them before they were cleaned i am ready now both pieces are loaded and you shall see both balls count  ralph had been working as near the blazing tanks as the heat would permit and as he finished speaking with george he shouted for those near by to stand back already had the weapons been aimed and with a blazing stick in his hand he stood ready to show either his skill or his ignorance  quickly the crowd separated knowing only too well the value of time and ralph applied the torch  the explosion was almost deadened by the roar of the flames and the sharp reports of the iron plates as they were broken by the heat but above all could be heard the crashing of the iron as the ball aimed perfectly true to the mark made its way into the oil allowing it to spout forth in torrents  hurrah hurrah burst from the crowd as they realized that the boy whose skill a moment before they had doubted had done that which would have required hours for them to do so successfully and then on every side arose the demand that another outlet be opened  ralph was perplexed for a moment since the other cannon was aimed at the smaller tank and he had believed that one opening would be sufficient  you will have to put another shot in cried george it will take too long for the oil to run out of that one hole  while the crowd were engaged in digging a ditch for the oil that ralphs shot had let out in order that it should not be set on fire by that which was already blazing the young student aimed the second cannon  again the word was passed for the people to stand back and a second ball was sent crashing into the tank with as true an aim as the first  then while all save those who were at work on the dam or helping at the cannon worked at ditches to carry off the unlighted oil ralph made ready for another volley  two perforations were made in the small tank and two more in the large one which admitted of such a discharge of the contents that all hands could hasten to the relief of those who were working at the dams  already was the day nearly spent and yet the firefiend was raging with fury hardly abated the trees had long since fallen before the fiery blast the derricks and buildings of the adjacent wells were consumed while inch by inch the oilfed fire crept nearer the town  george had paid no attention to his horses all this time in fact he had hardly thought of them until almost exhausted he was obliged to rest a few moments or be entirely overcome by the heat  then the recollection of his team in which he took so much pride came to him and he started towards the shed where he had left them  one glance back at the fiery torrent which even the children were trying to turn from the town and he realized how important was even one mans labor in this battle with the flames  a man on crutches was standing near him as he paused irresolutely and to him george said hurriedly  i left a pair of horses in a light carriage in that shed up yonder when the fire first broke out not even one man can be spared from here now and yet my team must be attended to crippled as you are you can be of no service here therefore if you will go there and get them and then drive them to some stable in town i will pay you well for your trouble  ill see that they are well taken care of and come back here to tell you where they are said the cripple as he started towards the shed  and george returned to the fight once more  had the men been working where it was cool by their very numbers they could have checked the advance of the flames but hot as it was fully half who entered the conflict were overpowered by the heat in a very short time or obliged to cease their exertions for a while as george had done therefore although fresh recruits were arriving each hour not onethird of all the force there could be counted upon as able workers  it was an hour after george had cared for his horses as he supposed that the cripple whom he had engaged to do the work approached where he was by the side of ralph strengthening the banks of the ditch that carried off the escaping oil  i went up to the shed shouted the man but there wasnt any horses there nor carriage either  where are they asked george in bewilderment  how should i know was the reply in an angry tone  and then before anything more could be said a shout almost of despair arose from those who were working nearer the town  the waste oil has caught fire  the oil which had been drawn off from the tanks through the perforations made by the cannon balls had been set on fire by the heat of the blazing stream by its side and the flames were moving rapidly toward the two other large tanks in the immediate vicinity     chapter xiii  a fruitless search   many conflagrations caused by the lightning striking an oiltank have been known since the discovery of petroleum but none had ever been so disastrous as the one of which the reader has had but an imperfect account  fortyfive thousand barrels of oil had been consumed or wasted up to the time as narrated in the previous chapter and fully as much more was now threatened by the overflow which had taken fire and was shooting forth flames most dangerously near the other two large tanks  at the first alarm the entire force present left whatever they were working at to combat the new danger when george and several of those who with him were directing the work saw at once the peril to which the town was exposed by this sudden abandonment of the labor which had been performed for the purpose of presenting an impassable barrier to the angry flames  it was impossible that the now nearly exhausted workers could prevent the flames from attacking the two tanks upon which they were sweeping and if vain labor was spent upon that quarter the enemy would beyond a doubt gain possession of the town  to keep the men from neglecting the safety of their homes to try uselessly to save property which could easily be replaced was absolutely necessary and the length of time required to persuade them to return to the work they had first been engaged in would decide the fate of the village  leaping directly in front of what had almost become an unreasoning mob george and ralph tried by their strength to resist the impulsive dash forward at the same time that they shouted at the full strength of their lungs the reason why the work nearer the town should not be neglected  for some moments it seemed as if they would be trampled under the feet of the frightened multitude and then their coolness won the victory over unreasoning fear as it always will whenever displayed  the people returned to the more important labor the moment they understood how fruitless would have been their work in the other direction and george aided them by his efforts and advice while ralph with a dozen assistants began a cannonading of the other two tanks that were just beginning to add their fuel to the fearful blaze  the breeze which caused by the heated air always springs up during a conflagration now rolled the thick black smoke first in one direction and then in another until those who had not already succumbed to the heat were nearly suffocated and it seemed impossible that any one could continue at his work  the sun had set although that fact was hardly noticed since for several hours the heavy smoke had veiled the scene as with the mantle of night through which the flames glowed and flashed luridly  in the struggle between the men and the flames first one and then the other gained a victory but neither had made any progress  ralph and his assistants had opened ventholes for the oil in the lastattacked tanks thereby preventing fully half the oil from combustion although it was entirely lost  the female portion of the workers had long since desisted from any effort to check the flames and had continued their work by preparing food for the laborers carrying it to them that they might not be obliged to spend any more time than was absolutely necessary in getting it  during all that long night the people worked in relays that each might have an opportunity for rest and when morning came the flames were wellnigh subduednot so much through the exertions of those who fought against them as because of the fact that there was nothing more remaining for them to feed upon  by that time a small body of watchers in order to see that the remaining flames did not overleap the boundaries set was all that was necessary at the place where ninety thousand barrels of oil had been consumed or wasted and for the first time since the thunderstorm had cleared away ralph and george felt that they were at liberty to go where they chose both were begrimed by the smoke until it would have puzzled their best friends to tell whether they were white men or negroes and both were in a very dilapidated condition so far as clothing was concerned  the garments they had cast off when the work of fighting fire was begun had been tossed about trampled on or scorched until they could no longer be called serviceable and halfclothed dirty and disreputablelooking generally as they were they started wearily for the town in search of rest and what was quite as important a bath  many times during the night had george thought about his missing horses but it was not until he was relieved from all care which the conflagration had caused that he began to grow seriously alarmed it did not seem possible that any one could have stolen them and he cheered himself with the thought that they had simply broken loose and run away or that some one living near by had cared for them  a visit to the shed where the team had been left dissipated this first supposition for there was every indication that the horses had been taken by some one since no broken harness was there to tell of flight and the door was carefully closed behind them showing an excess of precaution on the part of some one since both doors had been left wide open when george drove in  some one must have recognized them as yours and taken them away thinking they were not safe while the fire was raging so furiously said ralph after the survey of the shed was completed and george believed such was the case  at all events we will get a bath and borrow some clothes first then we can soon find out where they are said george  and in pursuance of this plan the boys started towards sawyer so weary that it seemed almost impossible for them to walk  it was not a difficult matter for two who had worked as hard and done as much service as george and ralph to get all they required at the town once they arrived there and the bath had revived them so much that both were in favor of finding the team at once in order that they might get what else they required at the kenniston farm  under ordinary circumstances they could have hired a team with which to search for their own but now with every one in that state of excitement or prostration which follows such scenes as the inhabitants of sawyer had just passed through it was almost impossible to find any one sufficiently calm to transact the most ordinary business  twice george made the attempt to hire a horse and then he gave up what promised to be a useless effort both he and ralph thinking it better to pursue their inquiries on foot than waste their time by trying to hire a team and being obliged to walk after all  they began the search by making inquiries in town of any one whom they met and by going to each stable or even barn looking in each place large enough to shelter the team but without seeing any signs of it whatever  then they started up the road in the direction from which they had just come and at the dwelling nearest the shed where the team had been left they heard the first tidings  the lady living in this house knew georges team and said that while the fire was at its height when she had come to her house for the purpose of getting food to carry to her husband she had seen two men drive toward sawyer in it the men were entire strangers to her she said and they were driving at full speed but whether that was due to the fear the horses had of the flames or to a liberal use of the whip she was unable to say she described the men as being young and well dressed and was quite positive that she had never seen them before  georges first thought was that his friends the moonlighters had taken the horses away as a favor to him and this belief was strengthened when on questioning the woman closely he learned that she did not know either jim or dick even by sight  they probably came down when they saw the smoke said george confidently to ralph and on finding the team here knowing we were at work have carried it to farmer kennistons  i should have thought they would have tried to find us first so as to let us know what they were going to do said ralph  in order to have found us they would have been obliged to meet some of the people here and they probably did not think that safe even though everyone had so much to attend to  but they would have left word with someone insisted ralph  that would have been as bad as to show themselves bob probably wants to make it appear that he hasnt even been in this section of the country and if any trouble comes of carrying the glycerine through the town he will insist that he hasnt been here  ralph was far from being as positive that they would find the horses at the kenniston farm as his friend was but he contented himself with waiting until it could be proven rather than to provoke an argument when it seemed that under any circumstances they had better return there  after some considerable difficulty the boys found a man who for a generous consideration would carry them to the farm in his wagon drawn by a slow methodicalmoving horse and they set out georges fears for the safety of his team entirely allayed and ralphs increasing each moment  in order to make sure that the horses had been driven toward the farm and not in the direction of jims home george made inquiries of all he met on the road as well as at several of the houses  quite a number of people had seen the team driven along at full speed by two young men and had noticed it particularly because they believed it had been sent to bradford to get assistance in extinguishing the fire  this continued news caused george to be positive that his horses were safe at the farm and in the rapid driving he recognized or thought he did jims presence for that young gentleman was always anxious to get over the road as fast as possible  but when they had arrived within a mile of farmer kennistons home they received information of the team which had the effect of arousing george from his dream of fancied security so far as his horses were concerned  a farmer who was well acquainted with all three of the moonlighters had seen the horses as they were driven past his home on the afternoon of the previous day and he was positive that neither bob jim nor dick was in the carriage the men were young well dressed and strangers so far as georges informant knew and he was certain that they had not been in sawyer nor in the vicinity any length of time  this aroused all of georges fears and it was with the greatest difficulty that he could restrain his impatience until the farmhouse was reached when the first question asked was as to whether the horses were there  farmer kenniston was surprised that such a question should be asked for he had seen the team going toward bradford the day previous and as it was in advance of him at the time he had no doubt but that it was george who was driving  that the horses had been stolen there could no longer be any doubt and how they could be recovered was just what neither of the boys could decide     chapter xiv  the pursuit   it was some time before the boys even with the aid of farmer kennistons not very valuable advice could decide upon what course to pursue for the recovery of the stolen property the plan which met with the most favor however was that they should take one of the farmers teams and follow in the direction the men had been seen to drive which was evidently through bradford by making inquiries on the road they might be able to track the thieves and overtake them although this seemed hardly probable because of the start of nearly twentyfour hours which the men had  if the trail led through bradford they could there notify the authorities and also telegraph to the different towns near by and if it did not it was decided that ralph should leave george going by himself to try to intercept the thieves by the aid of the electric current  farmer kennistons best horse which bytheway was not a very valuable animal was soon harnessed into a stout wagon and the boys set out having but little faith in the success of their journey  george had taken with him all the money he had which was a trifle over two hundred dollars since they might not only be gone a long while but it was quite possible that if they did recover the team they would be obliged to incur some heavy expenses  ralph had one hundred dollars which his father had given him for the necessary bills while on his vacation and this he offered to george in case he should need on the journey any more than he had thus the boys were as they believed amply provided with money and they intended to follow the thieves just as long as they could track them  on the road to bradford george met two men who had seen the team the day before and they drove into the town confident that the men they were in pursuit of had entered there the day previous  before trying to learn who had seen the horses george went directly to the chief of police told his story and was assured that before morning at least the direction in which the men had gone should be made known  under the officers direction telegrams were sent to different points where it was thought probable the thieves might go and so far as the boys were concerned nothing more could be done until the officers who had been sent out to find some news of the team during the time it had been in bradford should return  george was not by any means in the mood to remain idle while waiting for the policemens report for the loss of his team in which he had taken so much pride weighed heavily upon him instead of waiting in the police office for some news he insisted on going out to make inquiries on his own account and as a matter of course ralph accompanied him  it is an easy matter in the country to stop at each house and inquire if the occupants have seen a team pass but the boys found that such a system could hardly be pursued in the city since a gentleman might feel insulted if any one should stop him in the street to ask if he had seen a pair of horses attached to a light wagon pass there twentyfour hours before  this difficulty had not presented itself either to george or ralph until they were on the street ready to pursue their investigations and then they were sadly puzzled to know what to do  while they were standing irresolutely in front of the police quarters trying to make up their minds how they should proceed george was accosted by a rough but pleasantlooking old gentleman who appeared very glad to see him and at the same time acted as if he was in deep trouble about something  i am powerful glad to see yer mr harnett for i conclude that youve forgotten all about the promise you made to drive out an see us every time you had the chance  and im glad to see you mr simpson replied george as he introduced ralph to mr david simpson i have by no means forgotten my promise to call upon you for i spent too many happy hours while i was boarding with you when i was surveying the walters property to ever forget that i should like to go again i have been at work near farmer kennistons and have not had the time to pay you a visit but now that i shall have more leisure i will drive out some day and bring ralph with me  i would be powerful glad to see you mr harnett said the old man sadly but it wont be in the old home and the good lord only knows where the remainder of my old life will be spent  what do you mean mr simpson asked george in surprise for the sadness visible on the old mans face astonished him quite as much as the singular words did  it means mr harnett that ive lost the old place i was raised on and all for the lack of a little money you know that i helped poor tom set himself up in business by mortgaging the farm if the poor boy had lived he would have paid it all but jest when we thought he was gettin along so famously he died ive walked the streets of this town all day hopin i could find some one who would help me make up the balance i owe but the fire yesterday makes everybody feel poor i spose an i couldnt borrow a dollar so im goin home now to tell mother that weve got to leave the home where all our babies were born and where they all died  the old man could not prevent the tears from gathering in his eyes as he spoke and both the boys felt an uncomfortably hard lump rise in their throats as he finished  cant you persuade your creditor to give you longer time asked george  ive just come from his office where i begged harder of him than i ever begged of man before to take what money i had and wait a year longer but he wants my back pasture to piece on to his own and says he will foreclose tomorrow replied the old man  and then as if conscious that he was obtruding his own sorrows on one whom he had no right to burden with them he would have changed the conversation but george prevented him by asking  how much did you owe him mr simpson  well you see id kept the interest paid up reglar an it come to jest the face of the mortgage five hundred dollars id managed to scrape up two hundred an twentyfive an up to this mornin id reckoned on sellin the wood lot for enough to make up the balance but when the fire come yesterday the man who was to buy itsiah richhad lost so much that he couldnt take it  was you to sell him the woodlot for two hundred and seventyfive dollars  yes an i think it was well worth that i didnt really need it an if i could only have sold it id been all right but now the whole things got to go i dont care so much for myself but itll come powerful hard on the wife for she does set a store by the old place if it is roughlookin  george beckoned to ralph to step aside with him but there was no need of any consultation just then for the latter said quickly  i know what you mean george and here is all i have got  as he spoke ralph handed his friend the roll of bills which was to enable him to spend a long vacation and then turned away as if not wanting to embarrass the old gentleman by his presence  mr simpson said george as he added his own money to that which ralph had given him between the two of us we have got enough to buy your woodlot and here is the money pay the mortgage this afternoon and then you can make out a deed to these two names  george wrote his own and ralphs name on a slip of paper which he handed to the old man at the same time he gave him the money  but i cant take this mr harnett he said while at the same time his face showed how delighted he would be to keep it you and your friend dont want my woodlot an you only offer me this money because i have been tellin you of my troubles like a beggar an an old fool that i am take it back mr harnett an mother an i wont feel half so bad about goin away when weve once left  but suppose i tell you that we want to buy the land on a speculation said george with a smile there may be oil there and we may want to sink a well  you wouldnt buy that land if it was oil you were after one time i did think we might strike it but those as know told me there wasnt any there after theyd looked the property over replied the old man as with trembling hand he held the money toward george  well well buy the land anyway said the young engineer with a smile you have said that it was worth that amount of money and we may be able to sell it for more than we paid you even if there isnt any oil so have the deed made out and leave it for me at farmer kennistons  then before the old man could make any further reply george walked swiftly on followed by ralph and mr simpson was left to enjoy the generosity which enabled him still to retain the home that was made dear both to him and his wife by so many pleasant and at the same time sad recollections  well he said inquiringly when he and ralph had left mr simpson some distance behind wondering if the good fortune which had come to him was real or not  well repeated ralph laughing i suppose you mean to ask if i am sorry for what i have done not a bit of it for i can get father to give me money enough to pay for my ticket home while simply at the expense of a little enjoyment we have made that old man happy but how will it affect you george how can you search for your horses if you have no money  from the united funds we have twentythree dollars left and if that is not enough then the horses must remain lost for i would willingly have given them up rather than that mr simpson and his wife should have been turned homeless into the world  if you think that way then i think we have done a good thing and we certainly ought to feel that we are of considerably more importance in the world since we are landed proprietors but we must look at the property before i go home for i want to see it and now come with me where i can write a letter to father for the longer i stay now the more deeply in debt shall i be  youre not going to shorten your vacation because of lending this money ralph for you shall live with me and the only inconvenience you will suffer will be the lack of money to spend  ralph was not so certain that he would become a burden on george simply because he had expended some money in charity but just at that moment there was no need of discussing it and he proposed that they return to the police headquarters in order to find out if the detectives had learned anything about the team  greater good fortune awaited them here than they had thought possible for when they returned the officers furnished them with the complete description of the men and reported that they had indeed driven into bradford the afternoon before but during the night had returned by the same road they had come stating that they were going to babcock     chapter xv  the arrest   it was evident from the information brought by the police that the men who had stolen harnetts team had driven to bradford simply for the purpose of deceiving any one who might search for them and that they would push on into new york state where they might find a better opportunity of disposing of their illgotten property  under the circumstances there was nothing the boys could do save return by the road they had come and since it was necessary to do this it was as well that they should sleep that night in the kenniston farmhouse as in bradford where they would be obliged to spend some of their small store of money for lodging and breakfast  as soon therefore as they had received from the chief of police all the information he could impart they started toward home neither nearer nor further from the object of their search  all that they had done on the way down would have necessarily to be done over again in the hope of learning of the thieves on their return and no time was to be lost in this second search  of course if the men had started from bradford in the night there would be no use in inquiring for them anywhere between there and some distance from sawyer therefore the boys decided that they would sleep at the kenniston farm that night recommencing the pursuit at an early hour next morning  when they reached the farmhouse they found bob hubbard awaiting their arrival he had come there two hours before and when on asking for george he was told that the engineer had gone in search of his horses had told the farmer that while he did not intend to remain there during the night he would wait for georges arrival which he was certain would not be long delayed  not knowing bobs reason for expecting georges return when it seemed certain he would be away some time farmer kenniston was considerably mystified by his guests manner but the reason for his thus speaking was soon explained when at a late hour in the evening george and ralph did arrive  i knew you would come back tonight said bob as he rushed out to meet the friends whom he had not treated exactly as it would seem friendship demanded for i knew if you learned anything at all you would find it necessary to come back this way  why what do you know asked george quickly  when i tell you that i knew your team had been stolen even before you did you must admit that i know something about it replied bob feeling fully how important he was just then  dont be longwinded now bob said george sharply for you know how anxious i am  ill tell you all i know and i think i may be able to make amends for the trick we played upon you in using your team the other night unless you think it was because of that that you had your horses where they could be stolen  tell me what you have heard of my team exclaimed george impatiently  jack roberts told me this afternoon that he saw two fellows in your carriage about midnight and that they stopped all night or at least the remainder of it in the woods just above our camp i went up there with him about five oclock and it didnt seem as if they could have been gone more than an hour before we got there  did you find out which way they went  as near as could be told by the tracks they kept straight on toward babcock  thats where they said they were going said ralph excitedly delighted at this confirmation of the policemans story  from the looks of the place where they stayed last night i should say that they dont know very much about camping out continued bob they just hitched the horses to a tree and laid down on the ground with a few boughs under them instead of putting up a shelter which wouldnt have taken ten minutes i found pieces of newspaper in which had been food scattered around so i fancy their arrangements for the journey were made very hurriedly and incompletely i dont think they had hay or grain for the horses for i couldnt find any signs of either  it was evident that bob had examined the ground thoroughly in expectation of a chase and as he gave what was really valuable information gathered simply from a desire to aid his friend george was perfectly willing to forgive him for any and everything he had ever done against him  then we wont stop here tonight said the owner of the stolen horses hurriedly if they left there this afternoon we may stand a chance of overtaking them tonight you neednt take the horse out mr kenniston for we will start right off again  do you think there is any chance of overtaking your horses even if they havent had any grain with this poor old nag of the farmers whose greatest speed has been shown in front of a plow  and bob laughed gleefully at the idea  it is the best horse i can get just now said george fretfully for he could not see anything very comical in the fact of being thus hampered in the pursuit  theres where you are mistaken my dear boy replied bob in his old lofty way my horses are as fast and im inclined to think a little faster than yours when jack told me what he had seen i thought there was a chance to pay off old scores so i harnessed into the light double wagon put in some blankets and come here while i have been waiting for you i have got a goodsized lunch from mrs kenniston a bag of grain from the farmer and now we are ready to start even if we drive to the lake  bob you are a good fellow exclaimed george as he grasped the moonlighter by the hand and made a mental vow that he would never speak harshly to him again  while they had been talking farmer kenniston had backed bobs horses out of the shed where their master had left them that the journey might be commenced as quickly as possible and the boys got into the wagon at once george and ralph on the back seat and bob in front  that the chase would be an exciting one in case they should get within sight of the thieves was shown by the way bobs horses started off and for the first time since he was convinced of his loss george began to have some hopes of regaining his property  there is one danger in our chasing those fellows in the night said bob after they had started and as to whether you will take the risk you must decide they will probably spend this night as they did last nightin the woods of course we could not see in the dark if an oxcart had driven into the woods and we run every chance of driving past them then again if we wait until morning we are just so much further behind now what will you do  i hardly know replied george after considerable thought what is your advice  well and bob spoke like one who has already decided the matter in his own mind my idea is that they wont stop this side of babcock and i am certain they wont stop in the town so i think we shall be safe to drive as far as there the chances are that the thieves will drive through the town in the night and stop in the first likely place they come to on the other side we can start in the morning again about as early as they can  then that is what we will do said george satisfied that bob had deliberated upon this plan until he was convinced it was the best that could be done  do you believe we shall catch them asked ralph speaking for the first time since he had met bob  catch them echoed the moonlighter i wish i was as sure of striking a thousandbarrel well as i am that we shall be interviewing the young gentlemen before tomorrow night  but if bobs hopes of striking a big well had been dependent upon catching the thieves before the next night he would never have made a success in the oil region save as a moonlighter  there is our woodlot said george as he pointed to a grove on the opposite side of the creek near which a very old and a very dilapidated house could be seen  bob was curious of course to know what george meant and after the story had been told him he said  it was a big thing for you to do boys and simpson probably appreciates it as much as any man could but i tell you for a fact that you will get your reward for that good deed sooner than you expect theres oil in that same woodlot and ive sort of reckoned on buying it myself some day if i had known how simpson was fixed it would have been mine before now for two hundred and seventyfive dollars is cheap for ten acres even if there is nothing there but rocks  but simpson says he has had oil men examine the place and theres nothing there said george half believing bob had some good reason for speaking as he did  yes he had a lot of old fogies there who couldnt tell the difference between oil and a tallow candle they walked around ten minutes collected twentyfive dollars from the old man and then walked away simpson was probably paying ten per cent to old massie for ive heard he was the one who held the mortgage and if he could have got half the amount loaned dont you suppose he would have waited any length of time if he hadnt seen a chance to make more massie knows the oil is there as well as i do and the old miser thought he was going to get the whole farm for his five hundred dollars why the old fellow would choke both of you boys if he could get hold of you just now  bob laughed long and loud at the way in which the moneylender had overreached himself and it is hard to say just how long his merriment would have lasted since it received a sudden check  they were then just entering the town of sawyer and a man had stepped into the road as if to speak to the party seizing one of the horses by the bridle as they approached him to make sure of being heard  hello whats the matter now asked bob who had not noticed the man and was surprised at the sudden stopping of his team  i wished to speak with you for a moment said the man as he fumbled in his pocket with his disengaged hand and then as he produced some papers he said i arrest you mr robert hubbard and you mr george harnett for violating a town ordinance by carrying nitroglycerine through the streets  george had said he hoped he would be arrested in order that he might show he had not been guilty of such a violation but when he expressed the wish he could have had no idea that the arrest would be made just at the moment when in order to recover his team it was necessary for him to be free     chapter xvi  pleading for liberty   this arrest coming just when it did was a complete surprise to george he had hoped a few hours before that it would come in order that he might have an opportunity of showing that he was innocent of that which was charged against him simply because his team had been the one the officers had chased but to be deprived of his liberty now when every moment was precious seemed to be doubly disastrous  to be prevented from chasing the thieves when he was at last on the track of them was to lose his horses beyond any probable chance of recovery while to have fortyeight hours of liberty just then was as he thought almost a guarantee that he could recover his stolen team  bob was even more excited by the arrest than george he had the pleasing thought that he was guilty of the offense charged added to the disappointment at not being able to aid his friend in recovering the property which he was the remote cause of being lost  he knew as well as did george that at the worst they would only be fined for violating the town ordinance but it was the loss of time just then that made the matter a serious one and he resolved to do his best to secure their liberty for a short while longer at all events  i wont say anything about myself said bob with a laugh for i dont suppose my reputation as a steady young man is firstclass but you mr constable as well as nearly every one in sawyer know harnett and you know he will keep his word while he was helping extinguish the fire yesterday his pair of horses and carriage were stolen we have just got on the track of the thieves and if we are obliged to remain here now there will be no chance of recovering the property now if you will give us our liberty harnett will give you his word that we will return here at any time you shall set  that is hardly a regular way of doing business mr hubbard said the man with a smile that showed he had no hard feelings against those whom he was obliged to arrest and if it was your word alone that i was asked to take i am afraid i should be obliged to refuse im doubtful as to whether i ought to even consider the matter  of course you ought said bob quickly now if we should be convicted the penalty is only a fine and we can leave you as much money as would be required to pay those as security that we will return  i suppose in that case and if mr harnett promises that both you and he will come here a week from today i might take the risk of any accident that would prevent you from appearing  now thats what i call acting squarely said bob in a satisfied way and george asked  how much money will be necessary to satisfy you that we will appear for trial  well i dont suppose the fines will be over fifty dollars so if you leave that amount with me you can keep on in search of the thieves whom i hope you will catch  ralphs heart which had been very light when he saw that there was a chance they might continue their journey sank again when the officer mentioned the amount of security he demanded for he knew that the united funds of his and georges fell far short of the sum and what little they had would be actually necessary for their expenses on the road  how much money have you got bob asked george speaking in a low determined tone that told plainly how anxious he was to be in pursuit once more and of the sacrifice he would be willing to make in order to be released from the meshes of the law even if it was only for a few days  i cant say exactly but ill promise you it isnt very much replied bob carelessly as if he did not think the amount of any great importance  and after rummaging in all his pockets he succeeded in producing one very raggedlooking twentydollar bill  thats the size of my fortune he said as he handed the money to george as if the matter was already ended  george had twentythree dollars all of which he would undoubtedly need before he returned but willing to run any risk rather than be longer delayed he said to the officer  it happens very unfortunately but we have not got fifty dollars between us if you will take my solemn promise that both bob and myself will meet you here a week from today and also that i will report to you on our return together with this forty dollars you will be doing us a favor which shall not be forgotten  the man hesitated for a moment and bob said impatiently  oh take the money and let us go you have got really more than the fine will amount to for i promise you that harnett can prove by us all that he had nothing to do with violating the ordinance i simply got possession of his team to deceive you  i shall be here when the case is called said george quietly for i am very anxious to show that i had nothing whatever to do with the matter so please let us get on  well i guess theres no trouble about it and i dont believe any one will blame me for accommodating you in view of all the circumstances said the officer as he stepped back from the wagon in order that they might drive on i hope you will succeed in getting your team mr harnett goodnight gentlemen  goodnight cried bob as he started the horses with a jerk that nearly threw his passengers from their seats  and in another instant they were riding at full speed in the direction of babcock  i hardly know what we had better do said george thoughtfully here we are starting out on what may be a long journey with only three dollars in our pockets and i am not sure but that we ought to go back to town to try to get some more  that would never do replied bob decidedly if we should do that we could not get to babcock tonight and that we must do if we expect to catch the thieves we have got food and grain enough to last a day and a half or two days and we can rough it in the woods as the men we are chasing are doing  george would have preferred decidedly to be able to go to a hotel at night rather than to camp in the woods but bob and ralph were only too well pleased at the idea of living a gipsy life therefore it was decided to keep on or more properly speaking since no one made any objection to the plan bob continued to urge the horses on in the direction the thieves were supposed to have gone  the night was not so dark but that they could drive a good pace but had it been daylight there is no question but that bobs horses would have shown considerably better speed for their driver was anxious to reach babcock early in order that the animals might have as long a rest as possible before starting on their journey next day which would likely be a hard one  bob sang laughed and acted generally as if he was in the best of spirits while ralph joined in with him for he enjoyed this nightdrive immensely but george remained silent his great desire to get on faster causing the speed at which they were traveling to seem very slow  it was some time past midnight when they arrived at babcock and much as they liked to camp out both ralph and bob would have been better satisfied just then if they could have remained all night at the hotel for they were so tired that sleeping in the open air had not as many charms for them as usual  heres where we would have stopped if we had not been obliged to give up all our money said bob as they drove past the hotel but now that we are nothing more nor less than threedollar paupers we shall be obliged to do as the thieves are probably doingmake up our bed under the greenwood or some other kind of a tree  it might be worse said george who was beginning to recover some of his cheerfulness as his companions lost theirs and we will stop at the next clump of trees  there will be no doubt about our finding accommodations laughed bob unless our friends who are the cause of this excursion have engaged all the promisinglooking groves  above half a mile from the town the road ran through a piece of dense woods which shut out even the faint rays of the moon and bob stopped the horses while george and ralph explored as well as possible in the darkness for a chance to make a camp  a small open space surrounded by bushes about ten yards from the road was the best place they could find and preparations for the night began at once  the horses were unharnessed and the carriage backed in among the trees where it would not be seen by any one who might pass during the night  the horses were fastened to a couple of trees where they could feed without danger of getting their halters entangled among the bushes and each was given a generous supply of grain  among other things which bob had placed into the carriage while waiting at the kenniston farm was a waterpail and with this on his arm he started out in search of water for the horses while george and ralph attended to the making of what could only be an apology for a camp  the blankets cushions and rug were taken from the carriage and were spread on the ground over a small pile of brush for the boys were too tired to make any elaborate arrangements for the night  the carriage cushions formed the pillow to this one bed which was to serve for all three and with the rug and one blanket under them and the other blanket over them george thought they would get along very comfortably  bob was not long in finding plenty of water for the horses and when he returned with it after it was decided to go supperless to bed in order to save the provisions all three lay down on the hastilyimprovised bed little dreaming that they were within but a few rods of those whom they were pursuing     chapter xvii  near neighbors   as may be imagined the sleep which visited the three boys was not as profound as it would have been had they been in bed at kenniston farm in the first place the bed of brush which had seemed so soft when they first lay down seemed suddenly to have developed a great number of hard places while the ends of the boughs which had seemed so small when they were cut apparently increased in size after they had served as a bed for an hour  many times during the night did bob get up to see if the horses were all right and while he would not admit that the bed had anything to do with his wakefulness he knew as well as did his companions that when sleeping at home he hardly opened his eyes once during the entire night  it was at a very early hour therefore that the boys were up and ready to continue the chase as a matter of course after having gone to bed supperless they were ready for a hearty breakfast and since they would have plenty of time to eat it before sunrise they at once made preparations for breaking their fast  thanks to the cooked food they had with them these preparations did not consume very much time since they were only obliged to take the paper packages from the carriage and eat such portions of mrs kennistons samples of cookery as they desired  bob gave his horses food and water before he satisfied his own hunger and just as he finished this work he cried as he held his hand up warningly  hark what was that  the boys listened intently several moments but nothing could be heard save the rustling of the leaves as they were moved back and forth by the morning breeze or the twitter of birds as they started out in search of breakfast and george said with a laugh  this is the first time i ever knew you to betray any caution my dear boy and you should be commended for it but just now i think it is thrown away for i hardly believe there is any one within half a mile of us who is awake so early  i thought i heard some one coming through the bushes replied bob as he began a vigorous attack on the food but i guess it was nothing but the wind  five minutes passed during which each one was so busy with his breakfast that he had no time for conversation and then george motioned his companions to be silent the warning was useless for all had heard a sound in the bushes as if some heavy body was moving through the underbrush and all paused to listen  there was evidently some person or animal near by and moving directly away from them but it seemed so reasonable to suppose that it was a cow or some other domestic animal who had slept out of doors all night that it was some moments before any one of the three thought of learning the cause of the noise  even though they had every reason to believe that those whom they were pursuing would spend the night as they had spent it each one of that party was so certain the thieves were a long distance away that the thought that it might be those they were in pursuit of which were making the noise never occurred to them  it was not until some time after the sounds had died away that george realized how important it was that he should know what had caused them and then he started up at once dashing through the underbrush toward the direction from which the noise had come  ralph and bob started impulsively to follow him and then the latter said as he pulled his companion back  one is enough to find the cow for that is probably what we have been hearing and we might as well be eating our breakfast while he is hunting  ralph thought as did bob that they had no occasion to disturb themselves simply at a rustling of leaves in the woods and he willingly followed his companions suggestion  but before either of them could begin their breakfast again a loud shout was heard from george which caused them to start to their feet in dismay for they understood that something serious had caused it  harness the horses quickly george shouted again  and without trying to understand the reason for this peremptory command bob and ralph sprang toward the animals  it was not an order that could be obeyed very quickly owing to the lack of facilities in their stable  the horses were quietly eating their breakfast the harness was hanging on a tree some distance away and the carriage had been pulled into the woods so far that it would require at least ten minutes before it could be gotten on to the road  bob began to harness one horse while ralph attended to the other and while they were thus employed george came out of the woods in a very excited condition  we have been camping within five rods of the thieves he cried the noise we heard was probably made by the horses as they led them out into the road and i got there just in time to see them drive away  haste surely made waste then for all the party were so excited by what they had seen and heard and so anxious to start in pursuit quickly that they retarded their own progress by the bungling manner in which they went to work  ralph in his eagerness got the harness so mixed up that he was obliged to undo all he had done and begin all over again before he could accomplish anything while bob searched five minutes for the bridle which in the first excitement he had flung some distance from him among the bushes  so far as coolness and presence of mind was concerned george was no better off than his companions he attempted to pull the carriage into the road and got it so fastened among the small trees that ralph was obliged to come to his assistance lifting it bodily out before it could be extricated  in this confused way of doing things fully ten minutes of time was wasted and the thieves had a start of nearly twenty minutes before their pursuers were ready for the chase  it was useless for them now to reproach themselves with carelessness in not examining the woods when they first awoke as they should have done since they knew the thieves would spend the night in some such place and quite as useless to complain because they did not attempt to discover the cause of the noise when they first heard it had they done either one of these things which it seemed the most inexperienced in this kind of work would have done they would have discovered the team and had it then in their possession  as it was however they could only try to atone for their carelessness by being more cautious in the future which each mentally resolved to be as he clambered into the carriage as soon as the horses were harnessed this time george sat on the front seat with bob where he could more readily leap from the wagon if necessary  bob started his horses at full speed and george was satisfied that there would be no necessity of urging him to drive faster for he held his steeds well in hand requiring of them the best possible gait  they have got quite a start of us bob said after they had been on the road a few moments and while ralph was regretting the absence of a comb which would enable him to feel so much more comfortable but i do not think your horses have had any grain since they stole them and if that is so i dont think we shall have any trouble in overtaking them within an hour  perhaps if bob had spoken exactly as he thought he would have insisted that his horses were so much faster that the twenty minutes advantage which the thieves had could be more than compensated for in speed but just then he refrained from saying anything which might make his troubled friend feel uncomfortable or disagreeable  did you see the place where they slept last night ralph asked of george for as yet he had not told them of what he had seen when he ran through the woods  yes i came right upon it when i first left you they had made a sort of hut of boughs near a clearing in which i should judge the horses had been feeding the instant i saw the camp and so near ours that a stone could have been thrown from one to the other i thought it had been made by the thieves and i ran at full speed for the road following a trail that looked as if a carriage had but just passed that way i got out of the woods just as they turned the bend in the road and simply had the satisfaction of seeing my team driven away at a gallop when if i had done what almost any child would have thought of doing it would have been in my possession  could you see the men  no the top of the carriage was up and i could see no one they were probably looking out through the window and saw me for if they stayed so near us since we stopped last night they must know who we are and will try to escape even if they kill the horses  im not so sure that they could have known who we were said bob for i have been trying to think if we said anything about the team or what we were there for and i do not believe we did  if the men whom they were pursuing did not know that this party who had encamped so near them were the ones in search of the team it would be a great point in favor of our boys for the others would not be likely to push their horses so hard therefore each one tried to recall the conversation and the result of this thought relieved georges mind somewhat for no one could remember that a thing had been said which might betray their errand  the road over which they were traveling was a good one and the horses were urged along by bob at a lively rate save on ascending ground when they were allowed to choose their own pace in order that they might not become blown  at no one place owing to the trees on each side could they see very far ahead on the road which prevented them from knowing whether they were gaining on the fugitives or not although bob firmly believed they were for his horses had never shown better speed nor been more in the humor for traveling  we shall be on our way home in less than two hours he said triumphantly as the horses dashed down a long hill at a pace that would be hard to beat and then as they began the ascent of the next hill all their hopes were dashed  during the last ten minutes it had seemed to ralph that the easyrunning carriage dragged and as the horses neared the top of the hill he discovered the trouble  the hind axle is heated he shouted and the wheel no longer turns  it surely seemed as if everything was conspiring in favor of the thieves for the pursuers were now seriously crippled by a hot box     chapter xviii  in a trap   it seemed so impossible to bob that such a misfortune could overtake them just when success appeared certain that he could not believe what ralph had said was true until he had jumped out and examined the axle  there was no doubt then but that they would be delayed for a long time for the axle was already so hot that it was smoking and they had neither oil nor water with which to cool it  in the valley or ravine through which they had just ridden there was no stream and the only thing which could be done was to look for one further ahead since they had passed the last house fully three miles behind  its no use crying about it said bob with an assumption of cheerfulness he was far from feeling for here we are and the sooner we mend matters the sooner we shall be riding on again  but what can we do asked ralph feeling thoroughly discouraged at this accident which however quickly it might be repaired would give the thieves a chance of making good their escape even if we had a whole ocean of water you havent got any oil after the axle is cool nor even a wrench with which to take the wheel off  one of us must walk on ahead until he comes to some house where oil and a wrench can be borrowed bob must drive his horses on at a walk and halt at the first water he sees its an unlucky accident for us and it seems strange that it should have happened just when it did  it isnt so very strange said bob as he started his team along at a walk and as usual its all my fault when we moved the other day we left our oil behind in the stable and i knew the wagon needed oiling when i got down to kennistons i was just going to do it when you drove up and then like an idiot i forgot it  it would do no good to discuss the causes of the accident after it had occurred the only question was as to how the damage could be repaired and after that was decided to set about doing it at once  i will go on ahead for the oil said ralph starting out at a run as he spoke and in few moments he was lost to view as he disappeared behind the trees where the road made a decided curve  bob and george walked while the horses dragged the carriage with its one useless wheel and in this fashion the boys who a few moments before had believed that in two hours they would have overtaken the thieves and recovered the property continued on their journey as sad and dispirited as before they had been happy and confident  if this hadnt happened said bob bitterly we should have caught the men before noon but now it is an open question as to whether they wont get away  it will be strange if they dont escape and georges voice sounded no more cheerful than did bobs for even if they were not sure who their neighbors were last night they must have been suspicious and will do all they can to throw us off the scent but there he added with a shrug of the shoulder indicative of resolution whats the use of mourning over what cant be helped all we can say or do wont change matters and we might as well look cheerful as cry  i know that replied bob with a grimace but when a fellow is disabled in the woods and probably two or three miles from any house the most appropriate thing is to cry even if the tears dont do any good  at this moment as if in answer to bobs assertion that they were probably a long distance from any house and very much to their surprise ralph was seen coming down the road waving his hands triumphantly  what is the matter cried george not daring to believe that ralph had already seen a house  theres a farmhouse just around the bend here with everything we need in the stable shouted ralph while he was yet some distance away i told the owner that we had a hot axle and were anxious to get on as quickly as possible and he says we can borrow one of his wagons or take anything we need to fix ours  it is needless to say how delighted george and bob were by the information ralph had brought instead of losing nearly the whole of that day as they had feared they should by walking several miles before finding a stable they could repair damages in a comparatively short time and could perhaps yet overtake the men before night  hurrah shouted bob as he urged his horses into a trot the party running behind  and in a few moments they were in the stableyard of a large farm where the proprietor was awaiting their arrival ready to lend them any assistance in his power  both he as well as they knew exactly what to do for this outgrowth of carelessness and pail after pail of water was dashed on to the hub of the wheel to cool it off even while he was yet repeating his offer to loan them one of his wagons if they were in a hurry to be on their journey again  leaving bob and ralph to continue the coldwater application since not more than two could work at a time advantageously george went with the farmer to see what sort of a vehicle they could borrow in exchange for their own  he returned very shortly however with the word that he thought it best for them to get their own carriage into working order since those belonging to the farmer were all so heavy that they would probably gain in speed if they waited for their own more than they would lose in time  this decision was about what bob had expected and he continued his work which had not been delayed during georges absence until it was thought that they could remove the wheel  it was a hard and quite a long job but it was accomplished finally and then when the iron was nearly cold a plentiful amount of oil was applied the other wheels were lubricated and the boys were ready to continue their journey again having lost by this accident not more than an hours time  you are all right now said the farmer after he had positively refused to take any payment for his own time or for the use of his tools an i reckon the waiting here wont make much of any difference to you  it wouldnt have been of any account if we hadnt been chasing a pair of horses of mine that were stolen at sawyer we were close behind them and should have overtaken them by this time if it hadnt been for this delay  what is the color of your horses asked the man evincing such a sudden interest that it seemed certain he knew something about the missing property  a pair of small dark chestnut horses in a box buggy driven by two young men replied bob quickly confident that they were about to hear some good news and answering all possible questions at once in order that they might not be delayed any longer than necessary  then it is fortunate for you that you had trouble which made you stop here or else you would have gone on and missed them replied the man speaking slowly as if there was no possible reason why the boys should hurry on in pursuit  when did you see them asked george hurriedly tell us at once so that we neednt lose any more time  theres no need for you to rush drawled the man much as if he enjoyed keeping the boys in suspense for if you stay right where you are you will see them theyve got to come back this way sure  the boys looked around as if they expected to see the thieves pop out from some hidingplace near by and after waiting a moment to enjoy the effect his words had produced the farmer asked as he pointed nearly opposite the house to where a road branched off from the highway leading apparently into the woods  do you see that road and then as if realizing how useless such a question was when the road was so well defined he continued waal i reckon that the same team you are huntin after was driv up that road about an hour or so ago it was a small pair of dark chestnut hosses an good ones with a fancy buggy an two young fellers drivin  where does that road lead to asked bob excitedly  thats the joke of it said the farmer with a laugh it dont lead nowhere cept inter my woodlot an thats what made me notice ther team so perticularly cause i couldnt make out what they wanted up there i tell you what it is boys youve got your hossthieves in a trap an you kin pull em out whenever you want to  are you sure that there isnt any way out of that cant they strike the main road by driving across some field asked george  waal ive driv over that road as many as forty times every year for the last thirty haulin down wood an i wouldnt undertake to git a wheelbarrer out any other way than i went in you kin stay here an ketch em when they come out or go in after emtheyll be there     chapter xix  close quarters   it hardly seemed possible to the boys that after the mishap which it seemed would give the thieves all the time they needed to make good their escape they could be so near to them that their capture seemed certain  but the farmer insisted that there was no outlet to the road that a team answering to the description of the one george had lost had been driven in there and that it had not come out therefore there could be no question but that they had the thieves in a trap as the farmer had said and all that was necessary was to go and get them or the team  at first they were about to start out without any plan whatever intent only on getting the horses as quickly as possible but george realized in time that secure as the thieves appeared to be against escape all might be changed by too much precipitation  if they should rush in recklessly the men might get past them by concealing the team in the bushes until they had passed that particular point and then the road would be clear before them unless the farmer could succeed in stopping them  it was necessary therefore that in going up this road which they were told was about two miles long they should not only see where the thieves had gone in but where it would be possible for them to come out in case they should succeed in making a detour through the woods  the farmer after listening to the discussion which the boys were having suggested that they block up the road near its entrance with his heavy carts and then if the thieves should get past them they would be obliged to leave the team at the obstruction in order to make good their own escape  this suggestion was so good that they followed it at once bob using his horses to haul a hayrack a heavy oxcart and two dumpcarts into the road about two hundred yards from the highway overturning and wedging them in in such a way that a passage through could not be made in less than half an hour  the farmer having work that forenoon which kept him near the house promised to keep a sharp lookout while the boys went after the team and to give the alarm in case the men should come down towards the barricade  then all the preparations having been completed there was nothing to prevent them from going into the trap the thieves had voluntarily entered  bob thought they ought to have weapons in case the men should attempt to fight for the possession of their illgotten booty but george refused to consider the idea even for a moment he had no thought that the men would do anything of the kind and even though he was going after his own property he was not willing to go in such a way as might endanger the life of any one  if you want any weapons take a good stout club he said and i think you will find even that unnecessary for as soon as the men see us they will do their best to get away  bob was by no means satisfied to start up the road unarmed but since it was georges property they were in search of he thought his orders should be obeyed even though the attempt should be unsuccessful because of it  if i was in your place i should make sure of the men as well as the team the farmer called out as they started for theres a good many more horsethieves in the country than are needed an its doin a good turn to honest people to put em where they cant run off other peoples property  george made no reply but at the same time he did not propose to make an amateur detective of himself unless the men should attempt to prevent him from taking his own and then he would have no hesitation about causing their arrest  there was no difficulty in following the track of the carriage for there had been so little travel on the road that the impress of the wheels was distinctly seen and there could be no question but that it would be an easy matter to see where it was taken into the woods in case the men should attempt to hide  i guess we had our labor for nothing in blocking up the road said bob as they walked along for there is no chance of our passing the team so long as we can see the tracks as plain as this  we certainly didnt hurt ourselves piling up the carts and the time was well spent if only for the sake of the precaution said george and then stopping suddenly after they had walked nearly a mile he pointed to a second track which led directly into the woods a few yards ahead of them they have been to the end of the road and come back he whispered perhaps they have just turned in here after hearing us  for a moment the three boys stood looking at the trail made by those they had been so anxious to meet and then george said in a low tone  we mustnt lose any time here and when we do start it must be quickly we will follow this track in and keep right on in it for we shall either find the team now in the bushes or else the men will have done as i fearedpassed us while we were on the road  there was still a chance that the men might get away with the team if they had succeeded in reaching the road in the rear of the boys for it might be possible for them to clear away the obstructions near the main road before the boys could run a mile unless the farmer could prevent them  george dashed into the bushes followed closely by ralph and bob and before they had gone very far it was evident to all that the men were trying to do just as george had suggested  the track made by the carriage could be followed very readily and there was no longer any question after the boys had run a hundred yards but that they were traveling in a half circle the end of which would be at the road  come on as fast as you can shouted george when he thus saw his suspicions verified and regardless of whether he was followed or not he dashed ahead at full speed perfectly satisfied that when he saw his team again it would be at the barricade  when he reached the road up which they had just come the second track of wheels could be seen and he half expected to hear the farmers warning cry forgetting for the time that any ordinary pair of lungs could hardly be heard a mile away  close behind george came ralph and bob both excited by the thought that there was yet a possibility the men might escape with the team and both running as fast as they could  theyve come this way shouted george and now it only remains to be seen whether we can get there in time  there was no need to say anything to urge either of the boys on to greater speed for they were making every effort and george himself was really the one who would be left behind if the race was continued very long  bent only on reaching a given point as quickly as possible the boys paid no attention to anything else save getting over the ground rapidly and the farmers voice rang out long and loud before they realized that they heard it  hello hellooo helloooo was the cry  and when finally the boys did hear it they understood by the tone that there was urgent reason for them to make haste for now beyond a doubt the thieves were trying hard to remove the barricade  panting almost breathless but not realizing how nearly exhausted they were the boys rushed on intent only on noting the way that they might lose no time or vantage by a misstep until they emerged from the woods at a point where they could see that which was causing such an outcry from the farmer who was taking quite as much interest in the saving of their property as he would have done in his own  george could see his team halted in front of the barricade they had piled up with so much and what at the time bob had thought useless labor while the men were straining every nerve to remove it the farmer standing at a safe distance screaming at the top of his voice even though he must have seen the boys coming towards him as rapidly as they could run  already had the two men succeeded in removing the two dumpcarts and were now at work upon the hayrack with every prospect of pulling it sufficiently out of the way to admit of their driving past but when they saw the three boys coming down the road they evidently concluded that they had worked quite as long as was safe for they began to look out for their own welfare instead of trying longer to get away with the team  after one look at the boys probably to make sure they were the same ones whom they had seen coming up the road the thieves ceased their efforts to move the hayrack and sought safety in flight running down the road towards babcock instead of trying to escape in the opposite direction  the farmer who was anxious that all horsethieves should be placed beyond the possibility of carrying on their business at once started in pursuit probably without thought as to how he could make prisoners of two men whom he had not dared to grapple with when they were trying to tear down the barrier which prevented them from getting away with their booty  george who still continued to lead the party stopped when he reached the side of the carriage he had gained possession of his team once more and he was content     chapter xx  a souvenir of the thieves   even had they been so disposed neither bob nor ralph could have joined the farmer in the pursuit of the men because by the time they arrived at the carriage they were so nearly exhausted that it would have been a matter of impossibility for them to run fifty yards further whatever the inducement  all three stood by the side of the recovered property panting and breathless but watching eagerly the unequal race where the two men could run a trifle more than twice as fast as their pursuer  the farmer seeing how sadly he was being distanced looked behind for an instant to see if any of the boys were going to aid him and then seeing that they had all halted gave up the contest by hobbling back to his stable looking quite as red in the face and panting quite as hard as if he had run a thousand yards instead of twenty  if youd only followed me we could have caught em all he said in a halfreproachful tone as he came up to the boys  i dont believe you could have overtaken them if all of us had been close at your heels replied george speaking with considerable difficulty because of the shortness of his breath but as a matter of fact i dont think we could have followed those men even if the team itself had been ours only in consideration of our catching them you see we have run a mile at full speed and were about used up  wall its a pity to let em go for theyll be lookin round for some other team now theyve lost yourn an jest as likely as not ill be the one thatll have to furnish it for em said the farmer mournfully as he fanned himself vigorously with his broadbrimmed straw hat but ive seen them chaps before im pretty sure i blieve theyre the same ones that was nosin round here four or five weeks ago lookin for oil signs over my pasture  oh well hope not exclaimed bob with a laugh for the sake of those who are really engaged in the oil business well hope they do not number horsethieves among them  but im sure theyre the same ones persisted the farmer an they talked as if they knowed all about the business  as soon as the boys had recovered somewhat from the effects of their exertions they began to think of returning and bob started to get his team which had been left in the stableyard when an exclamation from george caused him to pause  the obstructions had not been cleared away from the road and harnett was fastening his horses to the fence in order to help remove that which had been of so much service in stopping the flight of the horsethieves when some papers in the buggy arrested his attention  taking them up carelessly he glanced over two or three quickly when something caught his eye which caused the cry of surprise that had stopped bob  they were oil prospectors after a fashion said george and if they knew what they professed to they have left us a valuable souvenir  a souvenir repeated bob what have they doneleft an empty pocketbook  it may prove to be quite as valueless as one and probably will but it looks queer for it is made out in proper form and only verifies what bob said last night  what i said last night repeated bob now thoroughly mystified in mercy to me tell me what you mean and dont stand there mooning away like that  well said george who had glanced over the contents of the particular paper which had caused him so much surprise listen to me in the first place here is what i should judge to be an accurate survey of the woodlot ralph and i bought of simpson it states the price for which the land was mortgaged and the probable price for which it could be bonded or purchased here is a description of the entire property and here is given the exact spot by measurement where they have found satisfactory evidences of oil it would be singular if in helping mr simpson we had helped ourselves and still more singular that we should learn of it through those who stole my team and put us to so much trouble  the only thing singular about it would be that there wasnt any oil there replied bob quickly ive looked over that place some and i know its there but other people havent seen fit to believe me when i said so  we didnt say whether we doubted you or not said ralph who was inclined to believe fully the information contained in the paper george had found when you made the statement we said nothing one way nor the other  then why were you surprised when you found the same thing written there asked bob somewhat sulkily as he pointed to the paper george held  we were surprised to find it in the possession of such men replied harnett with a laugh and perhaps also a little surprised to learn that we could have put so much faith in any one of your assertions but now with such eminent authority on the subject i am anxious to get back and look at the land for myself  what are the other papers asked bob  they refer to land near simpsons which the men have examined and reported upon carefully but without finding so many favorable evidences that a well should be sunk what puzzles me is how these men could be oil prospectors and at the same time steal a team  i think that is simple enough said bob carelessly they were probably prospecting on their own account expecting to sell their information after they obtained it they hadnt any capital of their own but when they saw a fine team alone in a shed at a time when there was a terrible fire raging they thought they could steal it without running any risk if they had got away with your horses they could have raised money enough on them to buy the simpson property and once they struck oil they would become honest men  thats nigh enough to the truth of it said the farmer solemnly and all the party agreed to accept that as the explanation of what otherwise would have seemed very singular  all three of the boys were now more than anxious to return to sawyer that they might learn whether the statement contained in the paper they had found was true or not  considerable labor had to be done however in the way of clearing the farmers carts from the road and all the boys went to work at once while the owner sat on a rock near by bemoaning his misfortune in not having caught the thieves and in not having signs of oil on his woodlot  by the time the boys had replaced his carts as they had found them he came out of his sorrow sufficiently to invite them to remain to dinner and he urged the invitation so strongly that they concluded to accept it especially since the horses more particularly georges needed dinner even more than they did  it was a real country dinner they sat down to in the farmhouse half an hour later while the horses stood before mangers in which was a plentiful supply of grain and the boys did full justice to it eating until their hostess could have no cause for complaining that her food had not been duly appreciated  during dinner mr folsom the host learned that george and bob were indirectly concerned in the oil business and also heard some of the moonlighters wonderful stories as to the famous wells he had discovered when others had said there was no oil in the vicinity this was sufficient to revive all the farmers hopes which had been slumbering for a while that he might be one of the lucky ones who are made rich by the discovery of oil on their lands and he urged the boys to remain with him several days or at least long enough to locate a well on his farm  it seemed all in vain for the boys to urge that they did not know enough about prospecting to make a thorough examination of the farmers lands or if they did that it would be impossible for them to remain because of business  the old gentleman insisted so strongly basing his claims to receive them as guests on what he had done to aid them in recovering georges property that they were obliged to promise that they would return very soon and examine as far as they were able his entire farm which he was now very certain was situated directly on the oilbelt even though wells had been sunk near him unsuccessfully  it was quite late in the afternoon when the boys did finally succeed in getting away from the too hospitably inclined farmer and then they started down the road leisurely for they had a long journey before them if they expected to reach the kenniston farm that night  bob rode alone and in advance while ralph rode with george the two teams driving along side by side whenever the width of the road would permit in order that the occupants might talk over and over again the prospects of finding oil on the simpson woodlot  and this conversation was continued by ralph and george when bob was obliged to drive ahead both very much excited about it and both building aircastles on the strength of the idea even until the weary horses trotted up the lane to the kenniston farmhouse     chapter xxi  prospecting   it was not until a late hour on the morning after the boys arrived at the kenniston farm after their pursuit of the horsethieves that any one of the three made their appearance and even then they would not have gotten up so early as they did had not jim and dick paid them a visit for the purpose of hearing the particulars of the chase  bobs partners paid no attention to farmer kenniston when he proposed that they wait until the boys should awaken since the chances were that they needed a considerable amount of sleep but insisted on paying a visit to their partner in bed which effectually prevented him from enjoying another morning nap  when ralph and george made their appearance half an hour later bob had told his friends all the particulars of the chase including the finding of the report on the simpson property and the moonlighters were quite as much excited about it as if they had been the owners of the land they insisted that george and ralph should verify the truth of the statement at once and without waiting for an invitation proposed to accompany them  just then owing to the unusual vigilance of the torpedo detective the moonlighters business was virtually at a standstill and they had plenty of spare time in which to prospect for oil or to prove the truth of the statement that had so singularly come into georges possession  both the owners of the simpson woodlot would have much preferred to make their investigations alone but since they could give no good reason as to why the boys should not be allowed to accompany them nor none as to why the work should not be begun at once they were obliged once more to start out with the moonlighters  during the ride home the night before george and ralph had discussed the question of what they should do in case oil was found on the property and they both felt that in such case they should consider that mr simpson still had a claim upon the land even though they had paid him all he had said he considered it worth  they would have willingly loaned him the money to pay off the mortgage if it could have been done as well but that they thought at the time he would not accept and george had purchased the woodlot now however if it should be found that the land was very valuable neither of the boys thought it right that they should reap the entire benefit although they were legally entitled to do so  they had feared that by advancing the money to pay for the land they would be seriously hampered in the search for the horses and when they were obliged to give up the small amount which they had left to the constable at sawyer it seemed certain that they would travel under many disadvantages but this very lack of money had aided them if they had had sufficient to pay for their lodging at the hotel at babcock the chances are that bob would have remembered that the carriage needed oiling they would not have been able to follow the men so closely next morning nor would they have stopped at mr folsoms the only place where they could have learned of the whereabouts of those whom they were pursuing  the purchase of this land made as it was in pure charity had been a great advantage to them and if it should prove a valuable piece of property they intended that mr simpson should be equally benefited  the title deeds had been left with farmer kenniston while the boys were away and there could be no question as to their proprietorship  the only thing now was to learn whether there really was any oil on the land and this they were about to do although it would have pleased them much more if they were to go alone rather than in company with the moonlighters who had caused them so much trouble  jim and dick had their own team and bob proposed to use his horses in the double wagon so that in case he wanted to return home before george and ralph did he could do so and they could get mr simpson to bring them down  since this was to be a regular prospecting trip which might necessitate their remaining out of doors all night blankets and provisions were packed into the wagon as before while in addition george carried his surveyors instruments that he might be able to locate exactly the spot marked on the paper in case they should have any difficulty in finding it  on starting out george insisted that they should first drive through sawyer in order that he might report to the constable as he had promised and although the moonlighters did not fancy paying this visit they were obliged to do so if they wanted to accompany the fortunate owners of the simpson woodlot on their prospecting trip  there was no difficulty in finding the man who had arrested them on the night when time was of so much value to them and by the reception which he gave george it was easy to see that he had changed his mind somewhat regarding his guilt or had heard of the valuable assistance he had rendered during the conflagration  i will report to you at the time appointed said george after he had told the story of finding his horses and then i shall have no difficulty in proving that i knew nothing whatever about the transportation of the glycerine  and i believe that you will not mr harnett replied the officer since it is uncertain as to whether the case will be heard on the day set you need not take the trouble to come here until i send you word but i should like to see mr hubbard once in a while for he is so apt to fly off from one point to another that i shall never feel really certain of him until he appears  now see what it is to have a bad name said bob with a grimace i ought to be trusted as entirely as george is and yet i am not dont worry mr constable i will be here in time for the examination and i will also call upon you whenever i am in town  then bob drove on toward the simpson place jim and dick having preceded the others for they had no desire to meet a constable even in a friendly way  mr simpson was at home when the boys arrived at his farm and the reception which both he and his wife gave ralph and george was something to be remembered with pleasure by them for many a day  had he been allowed to do so he would have placed everything he owned at the disposal of the two who had so generously aided him to keep the home he loved so well but george stopped the show of gratitude which was really becoming embarrassing by saying  you will please us more mr simpson by saying nothing about what we did for we are likely to be repaid in a very substantial way and if we are you will get more for your woodlot than you ever dreamed of  is it something in regard to those two men who just left here asked mr simpson not in the least surprised by what george had said  what men do you mean  there were two here when you first came in sight but they left at once on account of some business as i understood they told me that they wanted to buy my woodlot and when i said that i had already sold it they offered to show good signs of oil if they could be paid for the prospecting they had done  george ralph and bob looked at each other in surprise it seemed certain that mr simpsons visitors must have been the men who had stolen the team and yet it was hardly reasonable to suppose that they would venture back there so soon after having committed the crime  can you describe them mr simpson asked george feeling ill at ease because of the coming of these strangers and yet not understanding why he did so  i cant say i can replied the old man slowly for you see i haint much of a hand at that sort of thing an i didnt look at em sharp enough it seems to me that they were youngish not much older than you an they looked as if they had been havin a pretty hard tramp  what time did they come here  about an hour ago they said they had jest come from babcock an got mother to give em some breakfast  it dont seem as if there could be any question but that they are the same ones said george speaking slowly to his companions and looking worried i cant tell why but it troubles me to have them come back here  dont be foolish george said bob speaking rather sharply what harm can they do you besides if they should go to cutting up any capers it would be the easiest thing in the world to have them arrested for stealing your team and i fancy that would settle them  the boys had come believing they should surprise mr simpson by telling him there was a chance that oil might be found on the land he had sold so cheaply but instead of doing so the old man had startled them considerably  well said george after a short pause we are going to leave our teams here with you mr simpson while we start out prospecting the woodlot we believe those men who have just left are the ones who stole my team and if you still feel that you would like to do me a favor you will keep a sharp lookout over the stable while we are gone for i do not think they would hesitate to steal it again if they got the chance  mr simpson promised to remain within sight of the stabledoor all the time the boys were away and as proof that he was able to defend the horses against any number of men he brought out an old army musket minus almost everything save the stock which he held carefully and timidly in his hands thereby causing his wife no little fear  if we should find oil mr simpson said ralph lingering behind after the others had started george and i have agreed that you shall own an equal share of the lot with us  then he hurried away joining the others quickly in order that he might not hear the old gentlemans thanks or expostulations  george as well as bob believed they could find the place where the men claimed to have seen signs of oil without any difficulty and they started out on what proved to be a vain search for after they had walked several hours they were no wiser than when they started  it was plainly of no use to search in this way and george started back to the house for his instruments that he might locate the spot from the directions on the paper which he still held in his hand  the boys glad of a rest waited for his return until after he had been absent nearly an hour when he could easily walk the distance in twenty minutes bob and ralph started in search of him leaving jim and dick there in case he should return  mr simpson both astonished and alarmed them by saying that george had not been to the house since he first left it and then they began a hurried search which resulted in nothing they called him by name started jim and dick out even to the remote portions of the lot but without success  strange as it seemed it was nevertheless true that george had mysteriously disappeared     chapter xxii  a cruel deed   when the boys met in the woodlot at the spot where george had left them after they had made the first hurried survey of the place consternation was imprinted on every face they knew that harnett would not voluntarily have gone away without telling them and an undefined but a very great fear took possession of them  each looked at the other as if fearing to speak that which was in his mind and yet all were conscious that whatever was done to find their missing friend should be done at once  it seemed so improbable that anything could have happened to him there without their knowing it that no one ventured to put his suspicions into words and each waited for the other to speak  it can do no good for us to stand here said ralph after he had waited some time for a suggestion from bob george is either not here or else some accident has happened which prevents him from answering if he had been here and as he was when he left us he must have heard us when we called now what shall we do  all three of the moonlighters stood looking at him in silent dismay they were bewildered by the sudden disappearance and ralph understood that whatever steps were taken toward finding george must be directed by him for his companions seemed incapable even of connected thought  in the first place he said lets make a thorough search of the woodlot beginning from this point and working toward the house in the direction he disappeared if we dont find him here we will try to make up our minds what to do  there was no dissenting voice raised against this proposition and ralph began the search by directing the boys to stand in a row about ten feet apart and then walk straight down to the fence carefully examining every place in which george could have hidden  in this way a lane at least forty feet wide was examined thoroughly and as nothing was found by the time they reached the fence the line was formed again ten feet further on the march continuing until they reached a point abreast of the one they had started from  no one spoke during this search for it seemed as though they were hunting for the lifeless body of their friend and when again they arrived at the fence they ranged along in a new line silently afraid almost to look at the ground because of that which they might see  and at least a portion of their fears were to be realized for as they walked along on this third sad journey they first found a place where the bushes and ferns had been trampled down as if some desperate struggle had taken place and then a few feet further on almost hidden in a pile of brushwood they saw that for which they sought  it was the body of george looking as if all life had departed the face beaten by cruel blows until it was nearly unrecognizable the clothing torn and lying still as death  even then no one spoke no cry of alarm or of astonishment was given for this was what they had been expecting to find during all the search  neither of the moonlighters had recovered from their first bewilderment and as if this show of helplessness on the part of his companions nerved him up ralph still preserved his presence of mind  kneeling down by the apparently lifeless body ralph unfastened or tore apart the clothing until he could lay his hand over his friends heart after an instants silence during which it seemed to each boy that he could hear the pulsations of his own heart ralph said in a hard unnatural voice which no one would have recognized as his  he is not dead for i can feel his heart beat feebly one of you go for a physician while the others help me carry him to the house  you take my horses and drive first to sawyer and then to bradford for three or four of the best doctors you can find and drive faster than you ever drove before said bob to jim  the latter finding actual relief in having something definite to do started off at full speed towards the farmhouse while ralph began to make a rude kind of a litter  two fencerails with limbs of trees laid across them the whole covered by the coats and vests of the boys was the best that could be improvised in a short time and on this george was laid as tenderly as possible  it seemed to all the boys as if he must be reviving somewhat for they fancied they could see him breathe as they moved him and bob was certain he had lifted one of his hands as if to touch his head  it was a mournful procession they formed as they moved slowly towards the farmhouse ralph and bob carrying the litter while dick stood ready to help them whenever he might be needed  at the fence they were met by both mr and mrs simpson who had of course learned the sad news from jim and had hurried out with almost as much sorrow in their hearts as if he had been a son of theirs for they had learned to love george even before he had been the means of saving their homestead to them  thanks to the help which the old people were able to give the wounded boy was carried much more quickly and easily along and in a short time which seemed very long to the anxious ones he was lying on a bed in the farmhouse  every effort was made to revive him as soon as he was placed in a comfortable position on the bed in the room sweetscented with herbs and with such success that in a short time there was a movement of the eyelids followed by a low moan which though piteous was welcomed by the boys gladly for it told of life  from the time they had found him stricken down by some murderous hand ralph had noticed that george still held tightly clutched in his left hand a piece of paper  he had hoped from the first that it might afford some clue to the murderous assailants and had tried to remove it but without success  now however when it seemed as if consciousness was returning the hands unclasped from what had probably been a clutch at those who had attacked him and the paper fell to the floor  the first physician whom jim had found entered at this moment and picking the paper up ralph held it until he should hear the medical mans decision  he was disappointed in getting this very speedily however for the physician began a long and careful examination of the injured boy in which he was assisted by the second doctor who arrived ten minutes later  george was in good hands now and since they could do nothing to aid him ralph beckoned to bob to leave the room for he was anxious to learn what was contained in the paper and wished that some one should share the secret with him  this is what george had in his hand when we found him he said when they were out of the house and i think it will perhaps explain who it was who tried to murder him  bob stood breathlessly waiting for ralph to open the paper which was crumpled tightly up in that almost death clutch and as he saw it he uttered a cry of surprise and anger  it was a fragment of the description of the woodlot which had been found in the carriage when the thieves left it  those men have done this cried bob as he clenched his hands in impotent ragethe ones whom george would not help catch after they had stolen his team they knew he had this paper and when they saw him they either tried simply to get possession of it george resisting or at the first attempted to kill him  they cant be very far from here said ralph as if wondering what other crime they would attempt to commit before they left  no and they shant get very far either ill send dick over to sawyer for the officers and if it is possible well have those fellows where they cant do any more mischief  dick was only too willing to go when he heard what bob had to tell him and in the team he had driven over in he started at nearly as rapid a pace as jim had  very shortly after he had gone jim returned the first physician was from bradford and he had met him on the road while the second he had found in sawyer having gone there to visit a patient both were said to be very skillful and jim had sensibly concluded that there was no necessity of getting any more  to him the boys told of the discovery they had made regarding the scrap of paper and had they followed his advice they would have started in search of the villains then and there without waiting the tardy movements of the officers  but both ralph and bob thought their place just then was with their friend rather than searching for those who had assaulted him and they persuaded dick to forego his idea of making a personal search for the men  it was not long that the boys were in suspense as to the report of the physicians for hardly had they finished discussing the discovery they had made as to who had done the cruel deed when one of the medical gentlemen came from georges room  unless he said there were internal injuries of which they were then unable to learn georges condition was not one of imminent danger that he had been severely injured there could be no doubt but there was every reason to believe that he would recover unless some more serious wound than those already found had been given  he had not recovered consciousness yet and there was hardly any chance that he would for some time while the physician barely intimated that it was possible owing to the wounds on his head that he might never fully recover his mental powers  it was just such a report as medical men often makeone which leaves the anxious ones in quite as much suspense as before and neither ralph nor bob was just certain whether it was favorable to their friend or not     chapter xxiii  the town ordinance   the news which dick carried to sawyer was sufficient to create a great excitement in that naturally quiet little town in addition to what looked like an attempted murder was the fact that george harnett whom they had all respected before the conflagration and admired after it was the intended victim  there was no need for dick to urge that officers be sent to try to effect the capture of the scoundrels for almost before he had finished telling the story a large party of citizens started in search of the men determined that they should answer for their crime  therefore when dick returned it was with so large a following that the physicians rushed out in the greatest haste to insist on their keeping at a respectful distance from the house lest the noise might affect their patient  bob and his partners were anxious to join in the search and urged ralph to accompany them since he could do no good to george by remaining but he refused to leave his friend even though he could not aid him and the party started without him a look of determination on their faces that boded no good to the professed oil prospectors in case they should be caught  during all of that night ralph remained with george listening to his delirious ravings as he supposed he was still battling for his life with the men and just at daybreak bob returned alone the search had been even more successful than any of the party had dared to hope for when they set out for the men had been captured in the woods about four miles from the place where the assault had been made and in the pocket of one of them was the paper from which one corner had been left in georges hand  they had evidently believed that they would be securely hidden in the woods for they had built a camp and were in it asleep when they were found  bob had been one of the first to rush in upon them and seeing him the men had shown fight but the sight of the crowd behind him prevented any serious demonstrations and after that their only fear had been that some one would attempt to do them an injury a fear for which at one time it seemed as if there were very good grounds  when the prisoners had been carried back to sawyer bob had left the party in order to report their success to ralph as well as to learn georges condition  until harnetts friends could be informed of his situation ralph and bob were looked upon as the only ones having a right to dictate as to what should be done for him and ralph was anxious to have the course they should pursue decided with this in view he had a long discussion with bob as to what should be done and the result of it was that he started at once for bradford to telegraph to georges mother and to hire a nurse to take care of him  mrs harnett georges mother lived in maine and it would necessarily be quite a long time before she could reach her son even if she got the telegram as soon as it was sent therefore it was important that a nurse should be procured at least until she could arrive and decide what should be done with the patient  after this was done ralph started to return not wanting to be away any longer from his friend than possible and as he neared sawyer he met the officer who had arrested george and bob for violation of the town ordinance  where is mr hubbard asked the officer after ralph had given him all the particulars of georges condition  he is now at mr simpsons waiting there until i shall get back  is he particularly needed there  oh no as for the matter of that neither one of us will be actually needed after this forenoon for i have just been to bradford to engage a nurse for george until his mother shall get here why did you ask  well you see before this assault was committed it was decided to call the case one of carrying glycerine through the town today now it has been decided in view of the service harnett rendered at the conflagration to drop the case against him and only proceed against hubbard but if his presence was necessary to harnett we could postpone it easily enough  but george would feel very badly if the case against him was dropped said ralph earnestly before the arrest was made his only hope was that it would be made so that he might prove he had nothing to do with it isnt it possible to proceed against him even if he isnt there  and what if it is asked the officer with a smile  if it is i would urge you to call the case against george at the same time as that against bob for i know beyond a doubt that he will be proven not guilty  ill see what can be done and if you and hubbard can leave come over about two oclock this afternoon  we will be there replied ralph  and then he drove on rejoiced at the thought that even while his friend was sick he could remove one cause of trouble from him  when bob was told of the interview ralph had had he was by no means so well pleased that the case was to be opened so soon  why didnt you tell the officer that i couldnt be spared from georges side for a moment he asked that would have settled it for just now every one is sympathizing with him  in the first place it wouldnt have been true replied ralph and then again if it has got to come the sooner its over the better i should think  bob made a wry face over the matter for he had hoped that in the excitement caused by the attack on george both the cases would be dropped and since there could be no doubt about his conviction that would have been the most pleasant way out of it so far as he was concerned  ralph used all the arguments he could think of to persuade bob to look at the matter in a philosophical light and it was not until he urged the satisfaction it would give george when he recovered to know that he was cleared of the charge that bob would even admit that he was willing to go although he knew he must do so  as soon as the professional nurse arrived and began her duties bob and ralph harnessed the formers team and started first for the moonlighters hut where jim had said he would be that day for the purpose of getting him to testify in georges behalf  this young moonlighter was quite as averse to appearing at court as his partner had been for he feared the charge might be altered to include him but ralph persuaded him that such would hardly be probable at the same time that he urged him to accompany them for georges sake  on arriving at sawyer it was found that the authorities were willing to call georges case in consideration of the fact that his innocence could be easily proven and the trial began  of course with bob jim and ralph to testify in georges behalf there was no doubt as to his innocence in the matter and quite as naturally the testimony which cleared one convicted the other for bob had told the story exactly as the matter had happened  george was found not guilty and public opinion being in favor just then of any of the friends of the injured man bob was let off with a reprimand and a fine of ten dollars  bob was in high glee over this easy settlement of the matter as was ralph and when the constable handed them the forty dollars which he had taken as security for their appearance the young moonlighter insisted on presenting him with five dollars of his twenty as a token of his appreciation  during the ride back to the simpson farm and jim accompanied them in order to remain there overnight in case he should be needed bob unfolded a scheme which he declared he had been maturing for some time although ralph insisted that it had only occurred to him after his fortunate escape from the clutches of the law  we shall have no business for two or three weeks at least he said and while george is so sick there is really nothing we can do for him now i propose that you and i find the signs of oil that those fellows claim to have found and when george gets well the work will be all done for him  but can we do it asked ralph thinking that he would be of but little service since his knowledge of the oil business was confined to what he had seen of the moonlighters operations  of course we can i have done a good deal of prospecting and except that i couldnt find the place they describe by measurements i can do the work better than george for he has had no experience whatever  i am willing to do it if i can said ralph for surely we can be doing no harm in trying to prove whether the property is valuable or not  no harm of course there wouldnt be any cried bob growing enthusiastic over his scheme and if we do find things as plain as i believe we shall there will be no trouble in borrowing money enough to sink the well at once so that when george gets out we could surprise him with a little oil property that would make his eyes stick out  ralph felt almost as if he was losing his breath at the size bobs scheme was assuming and he said faintly  oh we wouldnt do that  indeed but we would and i reckon harnett wouldnt feel very badly about it either  if you were sure of striking oil im not sure but that father would advance the necessary money to do it he said falling in at once with bobs scheme he was so dazzled by it  that would be all the better cried bob excitedly and i tell you what it is gurney if i dont show you a fivehundredbarrel well in that same woodlot you shall have my head for a football  ralph was hardly in need of such a plaything but bobs scheme had so excited him that when he did finally succeed in getting to sleep that night it was only to dream of wonderful wells spouting wonderfully pure oil     chapter xxiv  bobs industry   bob hubbard was not one to give up anything he had once decided upon without a trial and when he told ralph that between them they would find the oil and sink the well before george recovered he intended to do it if it was within the range of possibilities  very many operators in the oil region looked upon bob as one of the best prospectors there and while they fully understood his reckless manner and agreed that it could not be said that he was strictly truthful they had the most perfect confidence in his reports on land  therefore it was no vain boast when bob said that if there were good signs of oil on the simpson woodlot he could easily borrow money enough to sink a well for almost any one of the capitalists of bradford would have been willing to make the loan upon his representations  this woodlot of simpsons had attracted bobs attention some time before as the reader already knows and despite the assertions of some oil prospectors to the contrary he had always maintained that a good paying well would be found there  it had been his intention to buy the land but he had neglected to do so as he was in the habit of neglecting his own business until it was too late but he would be satisfied to prove that he had been correct in his views by striking oil there even if he was opening the property for some one else and just then he saw the opportunity of doing a favor for his friend at the same time that he proved the truth of his own statements  on the morning after he had spoken of his scheme to ralph he was up some time before the sun was even though he had watched by georges side until midnight and was only waiting for the professional nurse to relieve ralph from his duty of watcher before beginning the work he had proposed to do  during the night it had seemed as if george had recovered consciousness for a few moments although he had not spoken and the physician who had remained at the farmhouse was called to the patients side  this brief revival of consciousness to be followed immediately by a fever was what the medical man had predicted and he then said that george would appear to be very much worse in the morning but that it was the turning of the fever which would show whether he was ever to regain the full possession of all his faculties  therefore when the morning came and george in a high fever seemed to be very near death his friends were much less alarmed for his safety than they would have been had the change not been expected  it was unfortunate that he could not have been removed to the kenniston farm where he would have been nearer medical aid in case he should need it suddenly but he could not have been taken where he would have received more tender or devoted care then he did from mr simpson and his wife  the only possible aid which either ralph or bob could have given after they had relieved the nurse of the care of watching during the night would have been in case they were needed to go to town for anything which the patient might require except for that they might as well be out prospecting as remaining at the farmhouse  therefore in order that they might both be away and feel perfectly at ease bob had arranged with dick to come over and remain during the day with jim to act as messenger in case there was any necessity for it  bobs horses were there and after breakfast when jim had arrived and the nurse had resumed her duties there was really nothing to prevent them from going where they pleased  much as he wanted to go with bob ralph was uncertain as to whether he should leave his friend until after he had spoken with the physician regarding it and then learning that he could be of no possible assistance by remaining he announced that he was ready to begin the work of prospecting again which had been brought to such a sad end the day previous  bob started out excited by the thought of what they would accomplish and so intent upon his scheme that he rattled on with explanations of how this or that might be accomplished until ralph began to look upon sinking an oil well as mere childs play and quite convinced that it could easily be done even without capital  both the boys were satisfied that there were no signs of oil in such localities as they had examined the day previous therefore there was no occasion for them to do that work over again and bob began his labors by starting through the woodlot in an entirely different direction which brought them to a small stream or marsh which ran directly across the land  the watercourse if such it could be called was nearly dried up but bob showed every signs of delight at finding it so easily and said to ralph as he began to wade along its course regardless alike of wet feet or mudplashed clothing  here is where we shall find the first signs if there is any oil around here follow me and sing out when you see any greasylooking water in these little pools  it is quite probable that ralph would have waded in streams which were almost entirely covered with oil and yet never have sung out once for he was at a loss to know how oilcovered water should look but before they had traveled twenty yards bob said excitedly  why dont you say something i thought you would like to be the first one to discover signs on your own land so i have held my tongue for the last five minutes expecting to hear you shout  but what shall i say asked ralph in surprise i havent seen any oil yet  well youre a fine prospector you are and bob looked at his companion as if in the most perfect amazement that he did not understand fully the business which he had had no experience in what do you call that and bob pointed to the waterpools that were covered with something which showed different colors not unlike a soapbubble  ive seen that queerlooking water for some time replied ralph innocently but that isnt oil  you may think so said bob with a laugh but you let some of these oil operators from bradford see that and then it would do your heart good to hear them offer you big prices for the land thats oil my boy and it shows up as plain as the nose on your face well follow this swale up until we find where the oil ceases and then ill show you a place where you can sink a well without a possibility of losing any money by the operation  ralph was now quite as eager and excited as his companion was and the two splashed on through the mud and water feeling much as goldseekers do when they believe they are following up the leads to that precious metal  up the marshy land they walked until they were very nearly in the center of the lot and then bob stopped with a gesture of satisfaction  at this point the difference in the water was very marked the line of oil as it oozed out from a little bank showing clearly while above the water was pure  theres one thing certain said bob triumphantly as he stood upon the spongelike bank which afforded him so much satisfaction to see those who have laughed at me because i insisted that the oil belt extended in this direction would feel kind of foolish if they could see this wouldnt they  but is it what you might call a good showing asked ralph still incredulous that this land which they had purchased only through charity for mr simpson should prove so valuable  it seemed to him that bob must be mistaken or those living in the vicinity would have discovered it some time before  well i should say it was a good showing cried bob excitedly why gurney there isnt one well out of twenty that are sunk which looms up like this it will yield a thousand barrels if it yields a pint  the only question then as to whether it was really valuable property it would seem was whether it would yield the pint and if one could judge from bobs face there was no doubt about that  he was radiantly triumphantnot that he had discovered the oil for others had done that before him but that his views on the location of the oil belt had proved correct and he was determined that by his efforts the supply should be made to yield even though he could have no pecuniary interest in the matter  well sink the well here and ill begin the work this very afternoon he said but first we must go back to the house and well mark our way so that therell be no difficulty about finding the spot again  then bob started toward the farmhouse walking rapidly as if his feet could hardly be made to keep pace with his thoughts and breaking off the tops of the bushes to mark the way  but how are you going to work without money asked ralph almost doubting if his companion was quite right in his mind  do you think that a sight of that place isnt as good as a big bank account why we only need about three thousand dollars to do it all  threethousanddollars echoed ralph  thats all you write to your father tell him what we have found and ask him to send the money right on said bob in a matteroffact tone  and do you suppose he would send such an amount of money simply for the asking  and ralphs doubts in regard to the moonlighters sanity increased each moment  it dont make much difference whether he does or not was the careless reply i can get everything we need to go to work with on the strength of that showing and i tell you that well have that well flowing just as soon as possible but you write to your father ask him to come on and see what we have got and after he has talked with those who are in the business here he wont hesitate about the money  yes i can do that said ralph slowly but doubting very much whether he could accomplish anything by it but it will take three or four days at least before we can hear from him  that dont make any difference for it wont delay us im going to start right out to buy the engine and by the time we hear from him we shall be at work  by this time they were at the stable and bob began harnessing his horses in proof of what he said  i wouldnt do that expostulated ralph it may not be as good as you think it is and you may get into an awful lot of trouble about it  look here gurney said bob impressively theres oil thereplenty of itand i know what im about you just let me alone and by the time harnett is able to understand anything ill be ready to prove to him that both he and you are rich all through your charitable idea of buying simpsons woodlot     chapter xxv  the work begun   after deciding in his own mind that he would sink a well in the place he had found taking the work and debts upon himself when it was all to be for the pecuniary advantage of his friend bob was not one to lose any time  as soon as he got back to the house and could harness his horses he had started for bradford to make arrangements for the purchase on credit of such machinery as was needed and all this had been done so quickly that jim and dick were not aware he had returned from prospecting until they saw him driving away  as a matter of course they questioned ralph as to why their partner had left so hurriedly and his reply excited them wonderfully  he told them of what bob had found and then he realized how good the evidences of oil were for the boys were in a perfect fever of delight as he explained what they had seen then he told them of what he thought was a mad scheme on bobs part his intention to begin sinking a well even before he had any money to carry on the work and instead of being surprised at their partners rashness as he had expected they would be they seemed to think it a very natural course for him to pursue  they had quite as wild an attack as bob had had and although ralph was surprised at it then he soon grew accustomed to such phases of the oil fever after he had seen more of the business  jim and dick insisted on going out to see what their partner had discovered not satisfied with ralphs description and while they were gone he tried to convince himself that this possibility of his becoming rich even before he had been obliged to struggle with the world was true and not a dream  he was sitting on the woodpile arguing to himself as to whether bob might not be mistaken when mr simpson came out of the house with the report that george was sleeping and he decided to tell him the news to see if he would be as confident as the others  but before he could speak jim and dick came up panting but triumphant  thats the biggest thing i ever saw said jim as he wiped the perspiration from his face and then turning to mr simpson he added that woodlot is worth about a thousand times as much as you got for it  eh whats that asked the old man with his hand to his ear as if distrustful that it had performed its duty correctly  why bob has found the oil  yes added dick and it shows up better than anything i ever saw around here  it is true mr simpson said ralph as the old man still looked incredulous bob found signs of oil this morning which he says are wonderfully good i dont wonder that you cant believe it for i havent succeeded yet and i was with bob when he found it  oil on the woodlot repeated mr simpson in a dazed sort of way  yes sir and tanks of it replied jim  i am more glad than i can say replied the old man fervently for now you and mr harnett will be rewarded for your generosity to an old man whom you hardly knew or cared for it was not to be that i should have it and it wouldnt have done me much good if i had for mother an i are most ready to leave this world an we havent a child or a chick to be gladdened by the money why mr gurney im as pleased for you as if it was all mine  and mr simpson shook the boy by the hand in a hearty way that left no doubt of the truth of what he said  but if there is oil there mr simpson you own as much as george and i do for we settled on that yesterday  no no and the old man shook his head decidedly when i sold the land i believed i was getting the full value for it and you didnt care whether it was worth what you paid or not what you bought is yours and theres no gainsaying that i suspected there was somethin moren wood on that land when i went to pay massie the money for when he found that i had the full amount he offered to pay me my price for the woodlot and when i told him id sold it he offered to give me the whole mortgage just for that piece of land  there exclaimed ralph as if mr simpson had just told him something which it was to his advantage to hear now you can see why we should give you onethird of the land if you had come to us then and told us that you had a better offer for it we should have been only too well pleased to give it up now if what bob says is true you shall still own a third of the lot  mr simpson shook his head to show he would not permit of such generosity and ralph did not care to discuss the matter any further for he and george had already decided what to do  if what bob says is true cried jim why theres no question about it for there the oil is where you can see it for yourself  still it may not turn out as he expects objected ralph as if determined not to believe in his good fortune and the moonlighters really angry at such obstinacy refused to argue with him any longer  they insisted that mr simpson should go with them to see the fortune that had been his without his being aware of the fact and while they were away bob returned  he had two men with him who appeared as intent on business as bob did for all three walked past ralph without speaking going directly into the woodlot  during fully an hour ralph sat on the woodpile wondering if it could be possible that he was wrong in refusing to believe what all the others seemed so certain of and then bob and the men came back accompanied by mr simpson and the two moonlighters all looking as if they could hardly contain themselves because of joy  we will start the engine and lumber right up here mr hubbard said one of the men as he passed ralph and you can send for what you want with the understanding that the owners of the land will ratify all your bargains  well as for that you can judge for yourselves so far as one of the owners is concerned the other is not able to transact any business said bob turning suddenly toward ralph and greatly to that young gentlemans surprise saying gentlemen this is mr ralph gurney who owns onehalf the property as mr simpson has told you  you are a very fortunate young man said the gentleman who had been speaking with bob you authorize mr hubbard to act for you i suppose  yes sir replied ralph too much dazed to know exactly what he was saying  there what did i tell you cried bob as jim drove away with the men in order to bring the team back they will supply everything we need to open the well and simply because they have seen what you did not think was of very much account i have hired the men to build the derrick and before you go to bed tonight you will have seen the work begun on your oil well  but bob asked ralph in a tone that was almost piteous and which sounded so comical under the circumstances that even mr simpson laughed heartily at it do they think the same about it that you do  well you heard what was said about supplying anything we needed and people dont say such things even up this way unless they mean them now we shall need some considerable money and i advise you to write to your father telling him of what you own and asking him to come on here prepared to help you if he wont do it i can get all the money we need but we shall have to pay considerable for the use of it  ralph made no objection nor advanced any further argument he was in that condition of mind when he was not capable of any resistance and he obeyed bobs orders as meekly as if there was no way by which he could refuse  ralphs letter was by no means one of such glowing description as bob would have written it was a plain statement of facts begun by an account of how he and george came to buy the property of the chase for the thieves when they had their first intimation of the value of the property of the accident to george of bobs discovery and lastly of the opinion of the bradford merchants who were ready to supply on credit everything which was necessary for the opening of the well  when the letter was read to bob in its entirety he did not disapprove of it nor was he very much pleased all he ventured to say was  it is lucky for you gurney that the oil showed up so plainly that those who know a gold dollar when they see it were not so frightened about giving credit as you are about stating facts  then dick was sent to sawyer to post the letter and while he was away the workmen whom bob had engaged had arrived  ralph went with him when he directed them to clear away for the erection of the derrick and enginehouse and by the time the first load of lumber had arrived he had begun to feel the effects of the oil fever  the preparations going on everywhere around the comments of the workmen as they saw the show of oil the ringing blows of axes and shouts of the teamsters all lent an air of realism to bobs words which ralph had failed to see or feel before  it was for him even though it had been against his wishes that all these men were working and for him would accrue the profits if indeed there were any  bob had been as good as his word before ralph went to bed that night he had seen the work begun and already was he beginning to feel that perhaps all bobs predictions might be verified     chapter xxvi  drilling an oil well   there was no material change in georges condition on the morning after work had been begun on the oil well the physicians declared that he was getting along as well as could be hoped for and the nurse gave it as her opinion that he would recover much sooner than any one had believed therefore the boys were not troubled about their friend more than might be expected  on this day work was begun on the derrick and as may be imagined all the boys were on the spot to see it ralphs belief in the success of the venture growing stronger and stronger as the framework arose in the air  on the third day georges mother arrived and the boys were thus relieved of all responsibility so far as the care of their friend was concerned  it was on the evening of the same day that mrs harnett came that ralphs father arrived  after receiving his sons letter he had thought the matter of sufficient importance somewhat to ralphs surprise to warrant his paying a visit to the oil fields and had written to ralph to meet him at bradford  despite the fact that bob could borrow on the strength of the property as much money as he needed to carry on the work he was very anxious to convince mr gurney of the value of his scheme and on the day when that gentleman was to arrive insisted that ralph should go to bradford with him early in the afternoon in order that he might be able to arrange with the gentlemen of whom they were purchasing their supplies to meet mr gurney and tell him exactly what they thought of the proposed well  thanks to bobs activity mr gurney was able to see all those who had inspected the property on that same evening and was considerably surprised by these interviews  after receiving ralphs letter he had thought that possibly the boys might have a site for a well which would pay to open and he had come on believing that it was not a matter of very great importance  when he had been introduced to bob and had heard that young gentlemans flowery description of the vast amount of wealth which was only waiting to be brought to the surface of the earth he was disposed to look upon it as a visionary scheme the value of which only existed in the moonlighters mind  bob had been accustomed to have his statements received in that same way and for that reason had arranged for mr gurney to meet those whose judgment he could fully rely upon  these gentlemen assured him that the well promised to be a rich one that the signs of oil were remarkably good and that they had no hesitation in agreeing with bob as they had done to supply anything which might be needed to open the well  thus even before he had seen the property mr gurney believed that his son was in a fair way to enrich himself through his deed of charity  in the present crowded condition of the simpson farmhouse mr gurney could find no accommodations for living there and since he was to remain in bradford the boys had made their arrangements to remain there also over night in order that they might take him out to the oilwell early in the morning  on the following day mr gurney drove out to look at the property he saw that the work was well under way and heard sufficient from the workmen to convince him of the fact that every one who had seen the place believed a well would yield plentifully  mr gurneys business would not permit of his remaining in the oil region but one day and when ralph drove him to the depot that night he gave him formal permission to draw on him at sight for all necessary expenses  after this had it been possible bob would have hurried the work still faster along but he had already urged matters on as fast as possible and all he could do was to insist on ralph jim and dick doing as much work as one of the laborers he setting the example  the days went on all too short for the work that each one wanted to see done and wearily for the invalid who was beginning slowly to recover the fever had abated and with the doctors permission the boys had an interview with their friend who had descended within the shadows of the valley of death  on the night when the derrick was completed the engine placed and housed and the drills in position ready for work bob and ralph had a long and heated discussion as to whether george should be told of what was being done  bob insisted that he should know nothing about it until the day on which they struck oil while ralph argued that if it was such a certainty that oil would be found george should be allowed to share in the pleasure of digging for it  already had the young engineer begun to worry about the loss his business would sustain because of his illness and although he had not spoken of it ralph fancied he could see that he was also troubled about the expense which he must necessarily be under  all this ralph argued would be taken from georges mind if he was told of what was being done and after a long discussion bob agreed that the important news should be told on the following day provided the physician agreed that the patient would not suffer from the excitement  on the following morning all the boys were at the proposed well before any of the workmen arrived in order that they might see the drills enter the ground and by the time that important ceremony was over it was time for the physician to make his morning call  when he did come ralph told him just what he thought george had on his mind in the way of trouble and then stated what it was he proposed doing in case there was no objection to it  not the slightest objection my boy said the medical gentleman heartily good news seldom kills and from what i learn it is only that which you have to tell i think as you do that it will benefit the patient and you have my permission to unfold your budget of news after i have dressed his wounds  half an hour later the doctor had left the house and ralph and bob entered the invalids room as they had every morning since he had been able to recognize them  in reply to their usual inquiry as to how he felt george said gloomily  i should feel all right if i only had a little more strength it is hard to know that i shall have to lie here a long time simply waiting to get strong and all the business i had succeeded in getting done by some one else but perhaps i couldnt have kept what i had after that scrape about the glycerine  all that is settled george said ralph i persuaded them to call your case the next day after you were hurt when bobs case came on he and jim and i told the story exactly as it was and you were acquitted while he was fined ten dollars i should have told you before but that we were afraid of exciting you  such excitement would do me good rather than harm said george with a smile for i have worried about that every day i have been here  then i will give you more of the same sort only better replied ralph with a meaning look at bob the day after you were hurt we hunted for the oil and bob found it just  i should say we did find it interrupted bob excitedly and despite ralphs warning looks it is the richest spot you ever saw and theres a thousandbarrel well there if theres a drop  george opened his eyes wide with astonishment and then closing them wearily he said  im willing to take your word for it that you found signs of oil but i would rather hear what some one else thought as to the size of the well  you shall hear cried bob growing more excited and forgetting all caution i brought dodd and mapleson out here and after they had looked at it they said they were willing to advance everything for the opening then we commenced work  you commenced work cried george attempting to raise himself in the bed and falling back from sheer exhaustion  yes george said ralph as he motioned bob to remain quiet every one said wed be sure to strike oil and bob has started it for you he had nothing to do for a while and he wanted to surprise you i sent for father and after he had talked with some of the men he told us we might draw on him for what money we needed  george lay perfectly still and looked at ralph as if he could not believe that which he heard and bob forgetting himself again cried out  the derricks already built the engines up and we commenced drilling this morning i tell you what it is harnett before youre able to get around again well have a thousandbarrel well flowing that you can call your own and as for engineering why you neednt worry your head about that any more for youll have all the money you want     chapter xxvii  the harnett   it surely seemed as if the good news which ralph and bob had imparted to him was all that was needed to cause georges rapid improvement from the day when they had told him of what they had done and were doing his recovery was so rapid that at the end of a week he was sufficiently strong to sit up a short time each day and the physician predicted that in another week he would be able to take a walk out of doors  meantime the work at the well had progressed most favorably there had been no serious breakages no vexatious delays no trouble of any important character in fact the workmen expressed it as their conviction that it would be a lucky well because of the singular freedom from accidents with which the entire work had been attended bob was in the highest possible state of excitement all the time each morning he anticipated that they would have some trouble which would delay them when he was anxious to have the work completed as soon as possible and each night after matters had gone on smoothly he held forth to george and ralph of the wonderful luck they had had which must be taken as an augury of that which was to come  ralph divided his time equally between george and the scene of operations in the early morning he would walk out to the well stay there an hour and then return to report progress continuing his alternate visits to the well and the invalid until george knew as much of what was going on as if he had superintended it  now every oil well is christened with some name which is supposed to be suggestive of the manner in which it has been discovered or to do honor to some person who may or may not be interested in it therefore it is not to be supposed that a name for this pet of bobs had not been discussed even before work had been begun on it  each one of the boys had proposed some appellation bobs favorite being the invalid in honor of george and because as he said it had really had a chance of an existence through harnetts illness for he stoutly contended that had the senior owner been well he would have been so cautious about opening it on credit that all of them would have grown grayheaded before they saw it flowing  jim and dick thought that since bob had really been the one to open it in case oil was struck it should be called the moonlighter in honor of the one who had done all the work when there was no chance that he could be benefited by its success  george wanted to call it the gurney and his suggestion gave to bob and ralph just the name the well should bear in case it answered their expectations in regard to its yield  we will call it the harnett said ralph more decidedly than he had yet said anything in regard to the scheme and since bob was in favor of this it came to be considered a settled fact that that should be the name after that conversation old mr simpson never spoke of it save as the harnett and the boys soon learned to follow his example until even george gave it that title  work went on rapidly until the drills were boring eight hundred feet below the surface and it was hourly expected that bedrock would be struck when george broached to ralph a matter he had had on his mind from the hour he first learned that the harnett was being opened  do you remember ralph what we said about giving mr simpson a share in the land if oil was found there he asked when ralph came in to tell him that the rock had not been struck but that bob believed it would be before night  yes and i still think we ought to do so replied the junior partner quickly after he had taken our money massie offered to give up the whole of the mortgage for a deed of the woodlot and he refused for he considered himself bound to us even though he knew we only bought it to help him along  and what about bob asked george meaningly what he says about our hesitating to begin work before we had money of our own to carry it through is nearly true and if oil is struck there we shall have him to thank for it  i know that and i have been meaning to talk with you about it why cant we give mr simpson and him an equal share with us i think they really ought to have it  so do i and my proposition is that we give to each of them an undivided fourth of the entire property they to share equally with us in everything  and i agree to that fully replied ralph quickly i have wanted to propose something of the kind but was afraid you wouldnt agree to it because of bobs being a moonlighter and having given you so much trouble  but if the harnett is a success we must attribute it all to the trouble bob made for us if the team hadnt been stolen we should not have been in bradford to meet mr simpson and if it hadnt been for the theft we never should have imagined that there was any oil on the property besides if bob owns an interest here youll find that he wont do any more moonlighting  well said ralph anxious that their good intentions should be carried into effect as soon as possible when shall we give them their share now or after we find whether there is oil in the harnett  now you drive right into town have the deeds made out and bring them here so that i can sign them with you  it was early in the day and ralph would have plenty of time to make all the arrangements and yet be back before the drilling ceased unless of course the rock was struck almost immediately therefore he started at once refusing to answer any of the questions which mr simpson and bob put to him as to what had called him in town so suddenly  of course neither of those whom he had left in an aggravated suspense could have any idea of his errand and his sudden reticence after he had been in the habit of telling them all he was going to do mystified them considerably bob in particular being greatly exercised over it  i hope gurney hasnt got on his ear about anything he said to george after he had watched ralph drive away hes gone into town as glum as a judge and wont say a word  what makes you think there is anything the matter asked george with a smile have you and he been having any trouble  not that i know of except that he might have got cross when he was at the well and thought i ought to have treated one of the proprietors with a little more deference i was helping set the drills when he came out last and im not sure but that i spoke sharply when i answered his questions but i didnt intend to  i guess theres nothing the matter with him said george rather enjoying the moonlighters perplexity knowing how soon it would be ended you probably were a trifle cross when he was there and being guilty fancied that he spoke or acted differently from usual  i didnt fancy it for he was queer i asked him where he was going and so did mr simpson but he wouldnt answer either of us  ill find out what the trouble is when he comes back and let you know replied george  and with this answer bob went back to his work thinking it very singular that ralph who had always been so goodnatured should have suddenly become so crusty  twice during the remainder of the forenoon bob came to the house with some trifling excuse for so doing but really to learn if ralph had returned and while he was there the last time talking with george about the probabilities of striking sand or gravel rock the junior partner returned  he had with him some officiallooking documents and as he entered the house he said to bob speaking quite sharply without any intention of so doing and yet resolving all the moonlighters suspicions into certainties  i want some witnesses to georges signature will you bring mr simpson jim and dick here  bob arose silently to comply with the request looked at ralph wonderingly and reproachfully an instant and then left the room  while he was absent george told his friend of the moonlighters trouble and the two were making merry over it when he returned with the witnesses ralph had asked for  the papers were handed to george who signed both of them and then asked jim and dick to sign their names as witnesses to his signature ralph had already signed them while in town  then purposely taking considerable time about it ralph examined the documents as if to make sure that all was correct and said  mr simpson after george and i learned there was a chance that oil would be found on your woodlot we agreed that you should share equally with us in whatever might come of it for that purpose i went into town and have had a deed drawn up giving you an equal share with us  but i dont want none of it said the old man in a trembling voice while there was a suspicious moisture in his eyes i sold the land to you as id a sold it to anybody else and whatevers there you own  but the deed is made out now and there is no use for you to protest against it said george and without giving the old man time to reply he added as he turned to ralph now i understand that there has been some trouble between you and bob or he fancies there has  bob motioned to george to be silent but it was too late and ralph said  the only trouble is that i chose to go away this morning without telling him where i was going then i owned onehalf of the woodlot with all there is or may be on it and since it was the last time i should have the right to do anything regarding it without his knowledge i refused to tell him where i was going but now that he owns an equal share with you mr simpson and me he will have a perfect right to question me  bob looked up in blank amazement but made no attempt to speak and after waiting several moments during which no one save the two original partners seemed to understand the situation ralph said as he handed bob one of the documents  believing that but for you the harnett would not have been opened at least for some time we have thought it best to divide the property into fourths one of which belongs to you  perhaps for the first time in his life bob was unable to make any reply and he walked quickly out of the room to the woodpile where he sat for some time as if trying to make himself believe that what ralph had said was true     chapter xxviii  red rock   the idea that ralph and george would voluntarily give him a portion of what he considered to be very valuable property was the farthest thought from bobs mind he had gone to work to open the well simply because he was anxious to prove to those who had declared he knew nothing about it that there was a large deposit of oil where he had always insisted there must be if any one had said to him that he was entitled to any considerable reward because he had given up his own business to improve the value of his friends property he would have said truly that he had not neglected his own business since just at that time there was no work for moonlighters to do  he had started in on the work with no idea of being paid for his services although if oil was found and he had needed any small amount of money he would not have hesitated to ask for it the work had been begun by him upon the impulse of the moment and this making him an equal owner in the well simply because of what he had done surprised him even more than it did any one else  it was after he had been sitting on the woodpile long enough to understand why this property had been given him reading first the deed and then looking toward the woodlot where he could hear the sounds of activity that he entered the house where both his old and his new partners were discussing as they had ever since the work had begun the probabilities of finding oil  i tell you what it is boys he said to george and ralph this thing aint just straight youve got no right in the first place to give away a quarter of that property before you know what its worth and then again if you paid me ten times over for what ive done it wouldnt amount to this now if you think youd feel better to pay me for my work take back this deed and so long as i have charge of the harnett give me one barrel in every twenty you take out that will be mighty big pay and a good deal more than i am worth  but i suppose youd be glad to own a portion of a well bob and especially as big a one as you insist this is going to be said george  so i would like to own one and id rather have this one quarter so far as money goes than half of any well i know of but you see this dont belong to me for i havent earned it and you havent the right to give away so much  but we have given it away and you cant insist upon the size of the gift because none of us know whether instead of being a benefit it will not saddle a debt on you of one quarter of the expense of sinking the well said ralph  i know that it wont cried bob earnestly and so do we all for were sure of striking a big flow  well bob youve got the deed interrupted george and since we want to make you one of the owners of the harnett well say to you as we did to mr simpsonyouve got the deed and you cant help yourself  bob made no further reply but five minutes later the boys saw him and mr simpson perched high up on the woodpile talking very earnestly about something which they quite naturally concluded was the gift they had just received and on commenting upon it mrs harnett although she knew there was very little necessity for it advised the boys to insist upon the acceptance of the gift for she believed both the recipients deserved what they considered such good fortune  both ralph and george were perfectly satisfied with what they had done and in an hour after the presentation all the partners were discussing the chances of striking oil much as they had every day before when two of them had no idea they were to become part owners  the doctors visits had grown less frequent since george had begun to recover so rapidly and it had been three days since he had seen the patient  george had insisted that he was perfectly able to walk as far as the harnett and would have done so had not his mother and his friends urged so strongly for him to wait until he should see the doctor again  it was on this day just after george had eaten what any one would consider a hearty dinner for an invalid that the physician called and almost as soon as he appeared george asked his opinion about his taking a little outdoor exercise  i see no reason why you should not do so replied the doctor providing you may be trusted to act as your own physician and come in before you get tired  this george was positive he would be able to do and almost before the doctor had left the house he was planning a visit to the harnett but that his mother objected to at once since it would be impossible for him to ride and it would be much too long a walk  he was anxious to see the work but under the pressure of advice from all his friends he consented to defer seeing the harnett until later and take a ride with ralph instead the horses were harnessed into his own carriage which was made even more comfortable than ever by a profusion of mrs simpsons pillows and assisted by all the invalid started for his first outdoor exercise since the murderous assault upon him  george wanted to drive through sawyer for since he had been cleared of the charge against him he was anxious to meet his friends there and ralph willingly drove in that direction  upon arriving at the town there was every reason to fear that he would not get as his own physician as the doctor advised for he was warmly welcomed by every one whether stranger or friend until his reception was a perfect ovation over and over again was he thanked for the assistance he had rendered during the conflagration and the congratulations on his recovery poured in on every side  among the cordial welcomes he received none was more hearty than that from the officer who had arrested him the night he was starting in pursuit of the horsethieves and from him ralph and george heard some news which interested them  the men who had committed the assault were in the jail at bradford awaiting their examination which was to take place as soon as their victims recovery was certain and the officer asked when george would be able to appear as a witness  the senior owner of the harnett had no desire even then that these men should be punished but since the matter was one in which he could have no choice and since he would be obliged to attend the examination he declared that he could go at as early a date as might be set  evidently anxious to have the matter off his hands as soon as possible the officer said  then if you feel able to drive into town tomorrow we will hold the examination it will not take very much of your time and if in the morning you do not feel able to attempt it dont hesitate to send me word and it shall be postponed  i dont think there is any doubt but that i shall be here said george  and then after bidding the kindlydisposed officer goodby he confessed to ralph that he should be obliged to return home  the meeting with so many in town had tired him more than the ride of two hours could have done and ralph began to blame himself for having permitted him to stay so long even though he could hardly have prevented it if he had tried  but during the ride back the weary look on the invalids face disappeared under the refreshing influence of the quiet drive and by the time they turned into the lane which led to the simpson farmhouse he looked quite as bright as when he started  the lane was nearly a quarter of a mile long and when they first entered it ralph was aware that something unusual had occurred and he trembled lest some accident had happened but as soon as he could distinguish them more plainly he understood that the gathering was caused by joy more than sorrow  bob jim and dick were standing in front of the house surrounded by some of the workmen from the well and mr and mrs simpson were hurrying from one to the other much as if they were serving out refreshments  what can be the matter asked ralph anxiously as he hurried the horses along do you suppose they have struck oil already  no that couldnt be possible replied george i rather fancy that bob and mr simpson are celebrating the happy event of being admitted to the ownership of the well  ralph was satisfied that such was the case and he pulled the horses in unwilling to arrive at a scene where he feared he might be obliged to listen to thanks for what they had done  before many minutes however the boys could see that those at the house were shouting to them and when they arrived within hearing distance they recognized bobs voice as he shouted  bedrock bedrock  and then went up a shout from all that was nearly deafening  they have got through to the rock cried george his pale face flushing with excitement  and in a moment the carriage was surrounded by partners and workmen as each one tried to tell the good news that the drills had struck the rock at a depth of eight hundred and forty feet  what have you found asked george as soon as he could make himself heard  sandstone replied bob and we shall be obliged to try glycerine  the moonlighters will open the moonlighters well cried dick as if an immense amount of sport was to be had from such an operation  indeed the moonlighters shall have nothing to do with it replied bob with no small show of dignity and to the great surprise of all therell be no sneaking around to shoot this well i can promise you that for well have her opened in the daylight squarely or not at all  jim and dick could hardly believe that which they heard that their old partner one of the most successful moonlighters in the oil regions should object to having a well in which he had a quarter interest opened as he had opened wells for others was something too incredible to be true there must have been some mistake about it they thought and they would shoot the well by moonlight as soon as bob should consider the matter more fully  but all this time george was still in the carriage and as soon as the boys realized this they began to make arrangements for helping him out content to wait to tell the good news more fully after he should be in his room once more     chapter xxix  the examination   beyond the fact that the drills had struck the rock and that it was of such a nature that they could not work in it but would necessitate the use of glycerine but little more remained to be told after that first announcement  but yet all the boys crowded into georges room and insisted on trying to tell him something new regarding the important fact  the drills had struck the rock very shortly after ralph and george had started out and in their rejoicing that the work was so nearly over mr and mrs simpson had insisted that all hands should come to the house where a generous luncheon of preserves and bread and butter was passed around in honor of the happy event  that was all any of them could tell and then came the question of shooting the well jim and dick looking anxiously at their former partner to hear him retract those words so traitorous to moonlighting generally  both ralph and george were as glad as they were surprised to hear bob exclaim against having moonlighters open the harnett they would have opposed any such proposition had he made it but since he himself objected to it the matter was simple enough  i will drive down to town tonight and arrange with roberts brothers to send a man up here tomorrow said bob and before tomorrow night we will know just what the harnett is worth  but bob cried dick you dont mean to say that after we have shot the well that youre goin to pay them more than its worth for doin it no better than any of them can  thats just what i do mean to tell them my son replied bob with a mingled air of authority and patronage  why  well in the first place it will avoid any trouble in the second place it dont look well to be sneakin round as moonlighters have to do and in the third place we want the harnett opened square  but you always said moonlighting was square and that you wouldnt even let the regular men come near a well of yours urged jim  and from his tone it was easy to understand that this opening of the harnett was a matter upon which he and dick had quite set their hearts  that was before i owned an interest in a well myself boys replied bob mind you i dont say now that moonlightin isnt square for i believe it is but when its such a stunner of a well as this thats to be shot i say that it haint best to give anybody a chance to raise a question about it  it was evident to all from that moment that bob hubbard the oil producer was to be a very different sort of a party from bob hubbard the moonlighter and all save his old partners were delighted at the change  then have you given up moonlightin entirely bob asked dick with a world of reproach in his voice  indeed i have was the emphatic reply im still ready to say that its all right and legitimate but im through with it  then just for the sake of old times bob an seeins how we havent come into possession of quarter of an oilwell let us open your well for you pleaded jim  and all present understood that he and dick having been interested in the well from the time it was first discovered were anxious to do something toward opening it  ill tell you how it can be done said george desirous of granting jim and dick the very slight favor which they asked and yet quite as unwilling as was bob that the work should be done in any way which could be called illegal bob can go to the torpedo people pay them for the charge get the cartridges and glycerine with the express understanding that he is to do the work himself that would make matters right all around and you can fancy that you are moonlighting again  it was a happy thought this one of georges and every one present even including mr simpson hailed it with joy it was an arrangement which would please all of them very much better than to have any strangers doing the work and bob would have started at once to attend to it if ralph had not stopped him by telling him of the examination which he would be obliged to attend next day  since you will be obliged to go with us you had better wait until tomorrow you can have the tubing started on the road at the same time and on the next day we can shoot the well suggested george  bob was not at all inclined to wait fortyeight hours when half that time would suffice to decide whether the harnett was a wonderful success or a dismal failure but since he would be obliged to be present at the examination which would occupy a portion of the day he tried to content himself as best he could  the remainder of that day was spent in discussing plans for the future bob entering into a profound calculation of the amount of material they would need to build a tank for he was so certain they would strike oil that he would have had no hesitation in beginning work on the tank even before the well was opened  on the following morning george was feeling so well and looking so bright that there could no longer be any fear he had overexerted himself the day before and preparations were begun at once for the ride into town  ralph and george were to drive in with the latters team while the old firm of moonlighters with mr simpson were to go in bobs doubleseated wagon everything was taken which it was thought the invalid might need and the party started all of them wishing the journey had some other motive than that of assuring punishment to others even though they were guilty  on arriving in town they were met by the officer whom they had spoken with the day before and he told them after they had found a comfortable seat in the courtroom of all that had been learned of the prisoners  their names were william dean and henry ramsdell and they had worked for some time in oil city for a civil engineer there by this means they had learned the oil business and had shown an especial aptitude for prospecting there they committed what may or may not have been their first crime for no one knew where they had lived before they appeared in oil city they robbed their employer of nearly two hundred dollars and it is probable that it was after that money was spent that they had stolen georges team  the examination did not last very long george told of the theft of his team of his pursuing the thieves in company with ralph and bob and of all that occurred up to the time he left his companions to go to mr simpsons for his instruments  then he said when i had got nearly half way from where i had left my friends at the house these men stepped from among the bushes directly in front of me and one demanded the paper which i held in my hand i refused to give it to him and as i did so before i had time to act on the defensive the elder of the men struck me full in the face i at once began to defend myself but it was two to one and in a very short time a blow on the head from some hard substance felled me to the ground unconscious  that was all george could tell and ralph and bob were both called to the stand to testify to what they knew both of the theft of the team and of the finding of george  mr simpson jim and dick were also ready to testify as to the condition of george when they found him and when they carried him into the house but their evidence was not needed then nor was the doctors who had examined and attended the wounded youth  beyond asking one or two unimportant questions of each witness the accused had nothing to say for themselves or in contradiction of what had been testified to and the judge committed them without bail for trial at the next term of court  as soon as the examination was over bob went to the office of the torpedo works and there contracted for the necessary amount of material to shoot the well and also stipulated that he be given permission to do the work  at first this was refused peremptorily on the ground that it was a dangerous operation and that he would probably succeed only in killing himself  bob understood at once that he was not recognized and he asked if mr newcombe was in the building that gentleman was in and appeared very shortly after he was sent for greeting bob as heartily as if they had always been the best of friends rather than enemies  mr newcombe i have come for an eightyquart charge with the stipulation that i can work it myself in the well on the simpson farm of which i own one quarter this gentleman refuses because he is afraid i may kill myself wont you vouch for my skill in the matter  indeed i will was the hearty reply and if you will buy all your charges in the same manner i shall have very much less work to do  ive stopped all that work now said bob solemnly and so far as i am concerned you wont have another nights drive for moonlighters  of course after mr newcombes introduction bob had no difficulty in gaining the desired permission and he joined those who were waiting for him outside happy in the thought that as he expressed it the harnett would have a chance next day to show what she could do     chapter xxx  legal moonlighters   when the boys arrived at the simpson farmhouse after the close of the examination there was very little they could do save talk over that which was to be done on the morrow when the value of the harnett was to be decided  a portion of the tubing to be used in case there was any flow of oil was already on the ground and the remainder would be hauled by noon of the next day at the latest there were no cartridges to prepare for the torpedo companys workmen would attend to all that delivering both the tin cases and the glycerine ready for use  everything was done that could be and in a few hours more the casing of rock which might or might not cover a large deposit of oil would be blown out  as sanguine as bob had been from the first that a large yield of oil would be found he was exceedingly nervous now that the time for the question to be settled was near at hand not but that he was still as positive as ever that they should strike oil but he began to fear that it might not be found in such quantity as he had imagined  he would talk for a few moments with the boys then find some pretext for going to the well over which a guard had been set to prevent any evildisposed parties from tampering with it and once there he was quite as eager to get back to his partners as he had been to leave them in fact he was in the highest degree nervous and had not the others been afflicted in a similar way they would have noticed his condition  mr simpson was in such a disturbed mental condition that he went about his work in a dazed sort of way until his wife insisted on his sitting on the woodpile where if he did no good he could at least do no harm while she did the chores for him  on hearing bob say for at least the tenth time since he returned from town that everything was all right at the well the old man did pull himself together sufficiently to do the milking and then no sooner had he performed that task than he forgot what he had done and tried to do the whole work over again remembering his previous accomplishment only when one of the cows kicked the empty pail over and very nearly served him in the same way  jim and dick were not as anxious regarding the yield of the well therefore they were in a state of excitement only because they were to be at what would be very nearly their old moonlighting tricks again and were simply impatient for the time to come when they could be at work  they spent their time sitting on a rather sharp rail of the fence bemoaning bobs obstinacy in not having the well shot in regular moonlighters fashion without being so weakkneed as to buy the right to do simply what no one ought to be allowed to prevent him from doing  ralph and george were inwardly as excited as any one else but outwardly very much more calm they sat in the latters room talking over the prospects of striking a goodly quantity of oil while despite all they could do the conversation would come around to what the result would be in case the harnett proved to be a dry well they knew that all the bills had been contracted in their names since they were the sole owners at the time the work was commenced and in case of a failure they would find themselves burdened with such a load of debt that it would take them a very long time to clear it off  even at that late hour they regretted that bob had commenced to sink the well and it is extremely probable that if it had been possible to undo all that had been done leaving the land exactly as it was before the signs of oil were discovered they would gladly have agreed to forego all their dream of wealth  whether mrs harnett and mrs simpson also suffered from suspense that evening it is hard to say but certain it is that they were more silent than usual and the former sewed remarkably fast while the latters knittingneedles clicked with unusual force  it was a trying time for all in that house had it been daylight when they could have been at work the hours would not have seemed nearly as long but in the evening the time passed so slowly that it almost seemed as if there was a conspiracy of the clocks and that their hands were only moving about half as fast as they should have done  then came the night when every one went to bed and tried to sleep but three in that household succeeded very badly and who those three were may be very easily imagined  next morning every one was up so early that the hens were frightened from their roosts half an hour before their regular time and the breakfast had been eaten fully an hour before it was customary to begin to prepare it  george showed the effects of his anxiety very plainly and had his mother not feared the suspense would be worse for him than the fatigue she would have tried to induce him to remain in the house instead of going to the well as had been agreed upon  bob who had visited the scene of operations before breakfast again announced that everything was all right and that one more load of tubing would give them sufficient  under the pretext that there were a great many things which it was necessary for him to attend to while everyone knew he was simply inventing work for the purpose of hiding his anxiety he insisted that ralph jim and dick should help george out to the well when he was ready to come and then he hurried away  the charge would not be exploded until nearly noon and on the night before it had been agreed that george should not venture out until a short time before the decisive moment but now that the time was so near at hand he could not remain in the house and the result was that his mother and ralph agreed he should go at once  an easy chair was carried out in the grove and placed at a safe distance from the well but where he could have a good view of what was going on then with ralph at one side dick at the other mrs simpson ahead carrying a footstool and a fan and his mother in the rear with a bottle of salts and an umbrella the cortege started its general dignity sadly marred when the party were obliged to climb the fence  bob was nowhere to be seen when the invalid and his attendants arrived at the reserved seat but before he was comfortably seated the superintendent came up with another announcement that everything was all right and aided them in disposing of george  he was comfortably seated under a large tree with mrs harnett and mrs simpson on either side of him and so far as could be judged was quite as well off there as he would have been in the house once he was where he could see what was going on and viewing the works for the first time the haggard look left his face thus showing the wisdom of his friends in not preventing him from coming when he wanted to  the first arrival after the spectators had assembled was the last load of tubing and bobs only trouble was or he professed that it was that they would lose so much oil before they could make arrangements for storing it  as the time went on bob was the only one who had anything to do and those who watched him insisted that he simply did the same work over and over again  finally when every one began to fear that the torpedo company had entirely forgotten their contract a wagon similar to the one owned by bob drove up with the long tin tubes on the uprights and the box evidently stored with the dangerous liquid  in an instant the moonlighters were changed boys all their nervousness or listlessness was gone and in its place a bustling consequential air that was almost ludicrous  all three of the boys helped unload the wagon and when the driver attempted to do his share they plainly told him that all he would be allowed to do was to fasten his horses if he wanted to see the operation or to drive away if he was not interested in it he chose the latter course and save for the workmen the party most interested in the harnett were left alone  bob critically examined the cartridges making many unfavorable comparisons between them and the ones he had been in the habit of making and then began the work of fastening the reel to the derrick as well as setting the upright in position which served as a guide to the rope that was to lower the cartridges in position  when that was doneand the moonlighters did not hurry in their work anxious as they had been before for they were determined that this last shot of theirs should be a perfect successthe more delicate task of filling the cartridges was begun  there were four of these each capable of holding twenty quarts and the spectators were not wholly at their ease as can after can of the explosive fluid was poured into these fraillooking vessels even though the moonlighters handled it much more carefully than ralph had seen them handle that which had been used at the hoxie well on the famous night when mr newcombe guarded their hut for them  as each tube was filled the boys lowered it into position in the well and the nervous anxiety which had assailed them the night before again took possession of ralph and george  at last everything was ready for the launching of the iron bolt which was to call into activity the explosive mass that was to shatter the rock under which it was hoped the oil was concealed the moment had come when the value or worthlessness of the harnett was to be decided     chapter xxxi  the shot   it is barely possible that when bob stood over the aperture with the iron poised in his hands which was to be the means of opening to them the mystery of the well there was just a shade of fear at his heart that he had been mistaken in the signs and that an upward rush of water would be all that would follow the explosion  his partners noted a look of almost painful hesitation on his face for an instant and then as it vanished he dropped the godevil retreating to where the group of anxious watchers were gathered around georges chair  the seconds that followed the dropping of the iron were wonderfully long ones and it seemed as if each one present ceased to breathe as the time had come when the value or worthlessness of the well was to be decided  then was heard three distinct reports somewhat louder than had been heard at the hoxie well because of the charge being nearer the surface of the earth and this was followed by the black noisome vapor that wreathed slowly around the aperture as if sent by the demons of the earth to keep back those venturesome mortals who would seek to penetrate their secrets  no one spoke and each eye was riveted upon the mouth of the well to read there the story which was soon told first came a shower of water breaking into drops as it reached the surface sparkling in the sun like diamonds and then uprose not slowly and waveringly as ralph had seen it once before but shooting quickly in the air a transparent greenish column of oil that broke amid the timbers of the derrick shattering into splinters the smaller joists and scattering them in every direction  it was clearly and unmistakably oil not in any small quantity or sent with any slight force but a discharge which from its volume and intensity showed how vast was the reservoir from which it had come how great the strength of confined gas that sent it heavenward  for nearly five minutes the spectators sat watching the flow of oil which told of the value of the harnett until bob broke the spell that bound them by shouting  hurrah for the harnett hurrah for petroleum  in an instant all present even including george burst into loud shouts of welcome to the longconfined and valuable product of the earth which was theirs  during the thirty minutes that the new well spouted congratulations were poured in on bob from all sides for through his efforts had this work been done and without him it might have been many years before such a scene would have been witnessed on the simpson woodlot  the partners hardly knew how to express their joy george was quietly happy but the unusual brilliancy of his eyes and the flush on his cheeks told of the deep but suppressed excitement under which he was laboring in that steady upward flow of oil he saw a competency for himself and his mother which he had not dreamed he should secure during many long years of toil and as he clasped her fervently by the hand she knew that it was of the many things this well would produce which would add to her comfort that he was thinking  old mr simpson and his wife stood with clasped hands looking at the representation of wealth which was pouring out before them and in their eyes even as they gazed was a faraway look as if they were thinking of their loved ones who when on this earth had been deprived of many of the necessaries of life while wealth beyond their wildest imaginings lay beneath their very feet  ralph was laboring under the most intense excitement which he strove vainly to suppress he had not like george been obliged to battle with the world for those things which money can buy but he saw before him a course already marked out which he had believed he would be obliged to struggle very hard to reach  now he was rich and all those things he had desired could be his  jim and dick were loud in their demonstrations of joy that their last shot had produced such magnificent results but their old partner bob outstripped them all in loud rejoicings he had demonstrated beyond the possibility of an argument that his location of the oil belt in the vicinity was correct and he had done so even as against the theories of those older and more experienced in the business than himself  in addition onequarter of all this was his and he was what he had long dreamed of beingan oil producer  the length of time which the well flowed demonstrated the fact that if it would not produce a thousand barrels of oil per day the yield would not fall far short of that and when it finally ceased flowing bob was transformed into the steady hardworking superintendent he had been since the work was first commenced  it was necessary that something be done at once to save all this oil which was now going to waste and he directed the workmen at once how they should begin  unknown to his partners bob had already made arrangements for the building of a tank and as soon as the workmen were engaged with the tubing he started jim off to town with a message to the contractors that no time might be lost in getting at the work  before jim left ralph gave him a message which he wanted him to send to his father it was short containing only these words      well just opened good for eight hundred barrels per day  on reading it bob insisted that the eight hundred should be changed to one thousand since that would probably be nearer the actual yield but ralph let it remain as it was preferring to be two hundred barrels short of the actual yield rather than two hundred barrels over  mrs harnett persuaded george to return to the house as soon as the first flow had ceased and aided by ralph and mr simpsonfor the others were too busy to be able to help himhe went back fancying as soon as he was away from the well that he had dreamed of the wonderful things he had seen and that it could not be a reality  his friends were not certain whether he had been injured or benefited by the excitement but he was so thoroughly tired out when he reached his room that he was obliged to go to bed at once and there he fell into a long sweet sleep from which he did not awaken until evening  as may be imagined everything was in the greatest state of activity around the harnett during the remainder of that day and all the night making ready to save the oil which then was being lost and before the morning came those who were working at the well decided that even bobs estimate of a thousand barrels was too small  the harnett was flowing at the rate of twelve hundred barrels of oil per day and that represented at least as many dollars although the price of oil might fall much lower than it then was when the supply exceeded the demand  if there is anybody that thinks now that the oilbelt dont extend up this way i should like to have them come up and take a squint at the harnett shes spouting like a daisy and i knew she would from the first said bob as he came in to breakfast next morning after having worked all night his joy so great that he did not even feel the fatigue  george seemed almost well on this morning and he took his seat with the others at the breakfasttable much as if he was as strong as any of them while his looks did not belie his actions  i knew youd be well this morning said bob gleefully for no matter how weak you were such a sight as you saw yesterday would put the strength into you  and then the exmoonlighters tongue rattled on as if it had as motive power a greater force than that which sent the oil up through the harnett  bob was as full of business as ever on this morning by common consent and without the necessity of any conversation on the matter he had been tacitly accepted as superintendent and it was not possible for him just then to spend many idle moments  already had the work on the tank been begun and until it was finished the harnett would be connected with an empty one about two miles away the tubing being already nearly in position  bob had sent the night before for more workmen and he confidently expected that by night all the product of the harnett could be saved  old pete who had acted as a sort of watchman and guard for bob when he was a moonlighter had been sent for to fill a similar position at the well and very many schemes were in progress  a house was to be built for the accommodation of the workmen and this bob insisted ralph should attend to at once as it was needed sadly  mr simpson was charged with making a road to lead from the highway to the well and since george was not strong enough to do any other work he was made bookkeeper and cashier as well as general financier  jim and dick were both hired by the owners of the harnett one to act as general messenger and clerk to george and the other for such important duties as the partners might not be able to attend to  in fact before sunset of the day after the well had been opened each one of the owners was hard at work and when they had ceased their labors for the day gathering in georges room now turned office for a chat bob rather startled them by the information that it was his purpose to sink another well close by the house as soon as he should get matters straightened out at the harnett     chapter xxxii  massies scheme   during the following week matters went on very smoothly at the well newly opened on mr simpsons woodlot  george had continued steadily to improve and looked quite like his old self so much good had prosperity done for him his mother recognizing the fact that she could no longer be of service to him and feeling not exactly at home in the rather limited accommodations which the simpson house afforded had gone home while the three boys had settled down as regular boarders or rather guests at the simpson farm  the road had been built the house for the workmen was well under way and the tank completed by having this storage place near at hand the value of the harnett could be definitely settled and it was found that the well was producing a trifle over twelve hundred barrels of oil every twentyfour hours  the money which mr gurney had advanced had already been repaid and it was georges intention to settle for the machinery and tools in a few days more for they were all anxious to be free from debt  ralphs father had replied to the telegram by a letter of congratulation and had promised to come up there to see the property before ralphs vacation had expired for it was by no means the young oil producers intention to neglect his studies while the other partners attended to the work at the well it was his purpose to return to college to finish the regular course he had started on  it did not seem possible that now the well was open and flowing so freely anything could happen to prevent them from becoming wealthy and that in a comparatively short time but from this dream of fancied security they were destined to be rather rudely awakened  one morning when they were all at the well while bob was trying as he had every day since he first saw oil from the harnett to convince them of the wisdom of boring another well just outside the limits of their own property but on that of mr simpsons which was entirely at their service two men drove up directly in front of them  visitors had been so plenty at the well that neither of the partners paid much attention to these new arrivals every one near there had heard bob hubbards predictions that the oil belt embraced mr simpsons property but without believing him and when the news went out that he had struck a twelvehundredbarrel well just where every one believed there was no oil it seemed as if the people must see it before they could be convinced it was really there  almost a constant stream of visitors had been at the well from the day it was opened and bob believing these two men had come simply to assure themselves that what others had said was true paid no attention to them but continued his argument with george as showing how they could open another well further down the gully that should pay as well as this one  can we see mr george harnett and mr ralph gurney asked one of the men as both advanced toward the lucky owners of the harnett  those are the gentlemen said bob carelessly as he pointed to george and ralph and then turned away to attend to some work believing the visitors had only idle questions to ask  and are you robert hubbard asked the second man stepping in front of bob in such a manner as to prevent his leaving the place  i am  and this i presume is mr daniel simpson continued the man as he pointed to the fourth partner who had not yet gotten over his surprise at seeing oil flow on his land  it is said bob sharply is there any one else around here you wish to see if there is call the roll now for we have nothing else to do but stand up for inspection  you four are all we have any business with just now although in a few moments we shall want to see all who are at work here said the man who had first spoken and then as he produced an officiallooking document from his pocket he added here is an injunction from the court restraining you from trespassing any further on this property and from removing anything from it here also are summonses for you to appear in a suit for ten thousand dollars damages brought against you by marcus massie  massie exclaimed bob while the others looked at the documents in speechless astonishment what have we got to do with him we dont owe him any money  he claims that you have damaged him to the amount named by opening this well without his knowledge or consent replied the man  well i like that cried bob angrily of course we opened it without his knowledge or consent and perhaps you can tell us why it would have been necessary to consult him about it what has he got to do with us  since the well is on his land and since you have been converting the oil to your own use he thinks he has a great deal to do with it replied the second man who looked very much like a lawyer while the other was evidently an officer of some kind  his land cried george and then all four of the partners looked at each other in a dazed way as if they had suddenly been deprived of the power of speech  yes his land replied the lawyer he had a mortgage on all this property which he foreclosed and he proposes to take possession of the house at once  butbut i paid that mortgage cried mr simpson in a trembling voice i paid that mortgage and have got it now  yes was the quiet reply i understand that by some means you have got the instrument itself in your possession but if you had got it because you had paid the amount due you would have received and had recorded a release from mr massie have you got that  a release repeated the old man in bewilderment i dont rightly understand you i paid my money and got the mortgage wasnt that enough  if you had paid the money replied the lawyer with a decided emphasis on the first word you would have received a release and that would have been recorded with the mortgage otherwise that instrument is in full force  but i paid it i paid it wailed the old man  i know you did mr simpson said george sternly and so does massie this is a sharp trick on his part to force us into buying his imaginary claim off for he tried very hard to get hold of this property in the first place and would have succeeded if he had not tried to get too much we will consult a lawyer at once  in the meantime gentlemen said the lawyer i warn you against removing any more oil or interfering in any way with my clients property  i dont suppose you have got an order of the court to prevent the well from flowing have you asked bob angrily making what seemed such unnecessary movements with his hands that the lawyer stepped several paces backward very quickly  this officer will remain in charge of such property as you may own here since it is attached by mr massie said the lawyer evidently thinking it best for him to depart and getting into the carriage with a celerity that hardly seemed possible in one of his age  oh he will will he cried bob savagely well i shall stay here in charge of him and i promise you he wont do anything more here than the law permits him to  what can we do asked ralph as the lawyer drove away and the officer sauntered around the premises like one who already owned them  i dont know what we can do now except to go into town and consult a lawyer there is no question but that massie is trying a little sharp practice and if it is a possible thing he will get the best of us said george ralph you and i will go into town while bob stays here i suppose we had better take mr simpson with us so that he can tell all the particulars of paying the money  we will telegraph for father cried ralph as if the thought has just occurred to him he is a lawyer and he will help us through with it  thats a good idea replied george but we will also see a lawyer in town so as to know exactly what we ought to do now  mr simpson followed ralph and george as they went to the stable and from time to time he repeated half to himself as he passed his hand over his forehead as if to collect his scattered senses  i paid the mortgagei paid the mortgage  we know you did mr simpson and it will be hard if we cant prove it at all events he has not got possession of the property yet and i do not believe he ever will     chapter xxxiii  holding possession   it was a mournfullooking superintendent bob made when his partners had left him alone with the officer who was acting as keeper of the property massie had attached in pursuance of his swindling scheme  bob had a wholesome dread of openly defying the law in a case like moonlighting where the question of legality had never been definitely settled he had been prompt enough to take his chances as to whether he was proceeding in strict accordance with or directly against the law but in the present case where the man whom he would have been most pleased to forcibly eject from the premises was armed with all the powers of the court bob was obliged to content himself with thinking what he would like to do  as the officer sat there near the enginehouse doing no more than was absolutely his duty bob looked upon him as simply mr massies representative and the temptation to vent his anger by some act of violence was very great  he restrained himself however from saying or doing anything that would entangle him in the meshes of the law but in order to preserve this outward tranquility he was obliged to ease his mind in some way which he did by actually glowering at the innocent officer as though he would wither him with a glance  of course there was a certain amount of work which it was absolutely necessary to do such as caring for the oil attending to the engine which forced the oil into the tank and such things as even the law might not be able to restrain but the work on the buildings the sinking of pipes in order to get a supply of gas for illuminating purposes extending the road from the well to the house and all that labor which was for the purpose of improvement of the property was necessarily at an end  had george remained his prudence would have dictated the discharge of all their force of workmen who were not employed exclusively on the well until the question at law had been settled but to bob such a course seemed too much like submitting to what was a deliberate wrong perpetrated under the guise of justice and he preferred the expense rather than even the semblance of backing down  the officer may or may not have had a disagreeable time in the pursuance of his duty while ralph and george were in town but to bob it was certainly anything but pleasant since he had great difficulty in not coming to an open conflict with this personification of law brought in to aid fraud  it seemed to the exmoonlighter as if his companions would never return and once at least during every ten minutes he walked toward the house in the hope of seeing them as they came up the lane  it was not until quite two hours past noon that his vigil was rewarded and then he saw them coming toward the house with a fourth party in the wagon whom he rightly conjectured was the lawyer whom they had been to consult  well he cried even before they had had time to alight from the wagon how have you made out  i havent got time to tell you now said george hurriedly but you will hear it all when we are through with what we have to do mr hillman the lawyer whom we consulted and who has come out with us says that the first and main thing to do is to hold possession not only of the woodlot but of the farm massie will attempt this very afternoon to get his men in here as his lawyer threatened and if he succeeds we shall be the ones who will have to sue him instead of his being the outside party as he is now  can we prevent any one from coming here asked bob quickly  certainly you can and must replied the lawyer no one can come here without your permission until after the matter has been decided in court and you must be careful that no one does  that settles it then said bob gleefully as he started towards the well the first thing ill do will be to fire out that fellow massie has got here and he wont be handled very tenderly either  stop cried the lawyer obliged to speak very loudly for bob was some distance away before he had ceased speaking that man has a perfect right to be here for he represents the court in the matter of holding certain movable property until the suit can be decided what you are to do is simply to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining admittance  but how is that going to help matters  and bob was again disconsolate because this revenge had been denied him  i prefer to wait until mr gurney can get here before i decide fully on just what shall be done replied mr hillman he stands very high as a lawyer and his advice in the matter will be worth much more than mine  well asked the moonlighter impatiently how are we going to prevent any one from coming on the land  that is a very easy matter with your workmen and yourselves you ought to form a regular patrol at those few points at which a person could enter and the law will sustain you in keeping any one away who does not come armed with an order from the court even though you use force  that was sufficient for bob legally entitled to act on the offensive under certain circumstances and to defend his and mr simpsons property against all save those coming in the name of the law there was an opportunity for him to work off some of the anger which he had found so difficult to restrain during the forenoon  george and ralph were perfectly willing to let him attend to the defenses they acting under his orders and bob set to work with a feverish energy that boded ill for the perfecting of mr massies scheme  pete was ordered to take up his position at the entrance of the lane which led to the simpson house and mr simpson was detailed to see that the negro did his duty a stout club was all he was allowed as a weapon but this would be sufficient it was thought  four of the workmen under the immediate supervision of jim were stationed at the road leading to the well and their orders were peremptory against allowing any one to enter unless with the express permission of mr hillman who if any papers purporting to be orders from the court were presented would first examine them to learn if they were correct  four more men under dick were stationed along the front of the property with orders to patrol the entire line and three others were stationed around the house under ralphs charge  bob intended to have a personal supervision of all the points of defense and in order that he might move about more readily he had one of his horses saddled by which means of locomotion he could visit each of his sentries at least once every half hour  the officer who had been stationed at the works as keeper of the property massie had attached was informed that he would be considered a trespasser and treated as such if he attempted to go anywhere except just where those articles were which he was expected to guard  george and the lawyer were thus left free from any duty of guarding the place and this bob very wisely concluded was necessary since they might be obliged to go to town at any moment  mrs simpson was set at work cooking up a quantity of food for the defenders of the castle and this bob proposed to carry to them himself for he did not intend that one of his men should leave his post even for a moment  after all this was done bob had time to talk with george and mr hillman relative to the interview that had been held in town  mr simpson had remained in the same dazed condition he had fallen into when massies attorney first appeared and had been unable to repeat a single word of the interview he had had with the moneylender when he paid off the mortgage or to remember what had been done at the time  the records had been searched however and no release had been found therefore it was plain that mr simpsons ignorance of such matters had caused him to neglect to ask for one  the probabilities were that mr massie after learning of the valuable well which had been found on this property which might have been his had he not tried to gain possession of the whole farm had taken advantage of this oversight on the part of his debtor and although he had been repaid the borrowed money intended to deny that he had ever received it  that mr hillman had fears of the ultimate result was shown by his desire to consult with mr gurney before taking any steps in the matter other than to hold possession of the property and all the partners save mr simpson who did not seem to be able to understand anything just then felt that there was a possibility that they might lose the harnett after all their labor and rejoicing  bob was by no means easy in his mind when he left mr hillman and george to begin his rounds of the outposts but he was determined that since all they could do was to hold possession no one not legally entitled to it should gain admittance to the place  for two hours during which bob had made his rounds four times nothing had been seen to indicate that any one had even a desire to enter the simpson farm and then while bob was talking with the old man trying to force him to remember all he had done while at mr massies office three wagons filled with men were seen down the road coming directly toward the place  there could be no question but that this was the moneylenders party coming to take possession and they were in larger force than any one had anticipated  riding quickly to the house bob ordered ralph and his men to join pete and mr simpson and then he called in dick and his men giving these last orders to proceed at once to support jim in case any of the newcomers attempted to go that way  he thought however that the greatest trouble would be had at the lane and he believed he was fully prepared for it     chapter xxxiv  the missing witness   bob had hardly called the main portion of his men to the point which was threatened by the moneylenders party when the wagons reached the entrance to the lane and the occupants began to get out  you cannot enter here cried bob as the first man started toward the lane as if he would force his way past those who were guarding the entrance  i am sent here by the owner of the property and it is my intention not only to go in but to drive away those who are intruding here replied the man in an offensive tone  well cried bob the anger which he had kept under control with greatest difficulty during the day now gaining the ascendancy it may first be necessary for you to get in before you drive any one out and i warn you that you attempt to enter at your peril i am here by the orders of the true owner of the property and it will be a mighty hard show for you to get in since my instructions are to keep every one out  by this time mr hillman had arrived at the scene of the threatened trouble and he said loudly so that all might hear him  gentlemen the owner of this property is mr daniel simpson my client acting under my advice he refuses to allow any one to enter on his farm and for that purpose has a body of men here to defend his rights i warn you that you will be rendering yourselves liable to prosecution if you attempt to enter here against his express orders to the contrary  for a moment those who had been sent by massie retreated to the wagons as if unwilling to do anything which might bring them in conflict with the majesty of the law and it seemed very much as if they were going to leave the place when the lawyer who had first visited the well and who had accompanied them called out  you know very well that this is mr massies property since he has foreclosed the mortgage he held upon it and if in obeying his orders you do anything which renders you liable to the law it will be him not you who will be obliged to answer for your actions i insist upon your going into the lane  it will be their heads which will get cracked at all events if they attempt to come in here cried bob almost beside himself with rage and if you think we havent the right or the inclination to knock down the first man who tries to come in why dont you lead the way to shew that you are not frightened  although mr hillman would have prevented bob from speaking if he had been able to do so the speech had had its effect for the men cried out to the lawyer  yes you lead the way and we will follow you  leaping from his horse and seizing petes club bob cried out  show your men that you have a right to come in here and i will show them what they may expect if they try to follow by an example on your own head  the legal gentleman was not as eager to lead the way as he was to urge the men on and instead of going boldly up to bob he tried to induce his men to go in but none of them would make the attempt because of the formidable array before them and seeing how useless his efforts would be in this direction the lawyer called one of the men to him talking to him in a low tone  bob divining just what was being said and fearful lest he should be outwitted finally went to each one of his men and ordered them to start for the road that led to the well the instant they should see the intruders get into their wagons  this order was given none too quickly for almost before bob had given his directions to the last man massies party clambered into their wagons and started down the road at a sharp gallop  come on every one of you shouted bob as he forced his horse to leap the fence  by riding at full speed he succeeded in getting ahead of those who would take possession of that to which their employer had no rights  of course it was not possible for bobs force to get over the ground as quickly as he did but they ran as fast as possible leaving only mr hillman mr simpson george and pete to guard the entrance to the lane  bob arrived at the place where jim and his men were stationed a few seconds before the wouldbe invaders did and in as few words as possible told them what had occurred at the lane  strike the first man who attempts to enter he shouted and strike him hard  by that time the lawyer and his party had alighted and were marching in a solid body up to the road evidently believing they could force their way through before the others could arrive  instead of dismounting from his horse this time bob grasped a club that was being raised by one of the men and urged his horse at full speed among those who were attempting to force an entrance  they had come out there in mr massies employ believing that there might be some little difficulty about entering which their very numbers would dispel at once but by no means anticipating such a vigorous resistance it did not suit them to measure strength with these who at last appeared to have right on their side and they fled before bobs charge with the greatest precipitation  bob was careful not to follow them into the highway for though he had no very extensive acquaintance with the law he rightly conjectured that if he did this he might be exceeding the powers mr hillman had said were his but he stood on the very line of his property swinging his club in a fashion that would make it uncomfortable for anyone who might get within its reach  you should be ashamed of yourselves he cried anxious to hold them in check by any means until the remainder of his army could arrive upon the scene to attempt even to aid massie in depriving an old man of his hardearned rights mr simpson paid the moneylender all the money he had borrowed but not knowing anything of the beautiful intricacies of the law which gives a semblance of legality to such a theft as this neglected to ask for a release of the property after oil was discovered here massie saw a chance to steal the property and he has hired you to do what he doesnt dare to do himself if i so much as thought i was as contemptible as you show yourselves to be by trying to do this dirty work i would go and drown myself in the most stagnant pool i could find  bobs speech had quite as much effect upon the men as the sight of the clubs had had and they retreated toward their teams protesting that they did not know the facts of the case when they started out  it was in vain that the lawyer who had accompanied them insisted that they were only doing what his client had a legal right to ask them to do in vain that he urged them to enter on the property regardless of those who tried to prevent them  bob had made them feel ashamed of the part they were playing and before ralph who had outstripped the others in the race arrived they were in their wagons insisting that they would have nothing more to do with the matter  the lawyer scolded and shouted himself hoarse trying to oblige them to do as he coaxed and commanded but all to no purpose they were determined to return and they plainly told him that unless he came with them they should drive away without him  under this pressure which he could not control the lawyer was obliged to obey those whom he had vainly attempted to command and the party drove away leaving bob the wellearned title of conqueror in this first battle of mr massies  but after all danger so far as this party was concerned had disappeared bob was by no means inclined to relax his vigilance he stationed his men in the positions he had originally intended they should occupy supplied each of them with a generous lunch with the addition of hot coffee and even gave a portion to the solitary officer at the well when he had originally intended that he should go hungry  after that was done and after he had cautioned them to be watchful impressing on the minds of ralph jim and dick the necessity of mistrusting every one whom they might see approaching the farm bob went back to the house to consult with mr hillman and george  there some especially good news awaited him it seemed as if this direct attack on massies part had restored mr simpson to something near his presence of mind and aided by his wife who had always found scolding efficacious when he relapsed into absentmindedness had succeeded in recalling the events on the afternoon when he paid the moneylender the five hundred dollars which he had had so much difficulty to raise  he now distinctly remembered that when he entered massies office a man by the name of jared thompson formerly an old neighbor of his was there and that his first words were to the effect that he had brought the money to pay off the mortgage  the old man was equally positive that he had laid the amount on the moneylenders desk in the presence of this same man and that massie had then offered to buy the woodlot how much more might have been said while thompson was there he was not certain but of that much he was positive  mr hillman was overjoyed at the news that there had been a witness to the repayment of the money but when he asked where the man could be found he was disappointed in the reply  mr thompson had lived on the next farm to mr simpsons but when he left it he went to bradford and from there it had been said that he had gone to babcock where he was living at that time mr simpson neither knew nor did he know of any one else who might be acquainted with mr thompsons whereabouts  if we can find this man and if he heard what mr simpson thinks he did then the case will be clear enough for we shall have a witness to the payment of the money which i think will be sufficient to explode massies claim  we must find him was bobs reply  and just then he felt able to find any man however hard he might try to hide  yes but how asked ralph who had come in at the close of the conversation  i dont know exactly said bob but there must be a way george can be spared better than any one else let him harness his horses and start out he can stay away until he finds him  i think the best way would be to make inquiries at bradford and from there you might be able to track him suggested mr hillman just remember that with this man everything will be plain sailing and that without him massie may get the best of us and i am confident you will bring him back with you  and above all things george dont give up the chase because you think we may need you here just remember that we can get along as well without you and spare neither time nor expense in the search said bob  george was perfectly willing to start in pursuit of the missing witness and at once made his preparations for the journey  fortunately he had with him as much money as he would be likely to want and to harness his horses and to gather up such things as he might need was but the work of a few moments  dont come back without your man shouted bob as george drove away  and the defenders of the harnett and the simpson farm were left alone to await the coming of mr gurney and of george with the missing witness  all of them feared that massies next attempt to gain admittance would be made under the cover of darkness and to prevent this from being successful bob went to work  first he sent one of the men on his horse to sawyer to purchase a number of lanterns and while the messenger was gone he got from mrs simpson all the blankets and comfortables she had  it was his purpose that half his men should sleep at their posts during the night while the others watched in order that they might be able to continue sentry duty for any length of time and he also proposed that each one on guard should carry a lantern that both he and any one who might meditate an attack would know those in possession of the property were still on the alert  this done the inmates and guardians of the farm were ready for the coming of the night     chapter xxxv  massies failure   although bob had taken so many precautions against the coming of the enemy during the night they were all useless since neither mr massie nor any one in his employ appeared at the simpson farm  well said bob next morning while he was waiting for mrs simpson to prepare the breakfast for the sentinels since they didnt come during the night theyll most likely be here today so it wont do for us to grow careless  as the day wore on and nothing was seen of the force which it was believed would appear ralph said to bob  if father started as soon as he got my telegram he ought to be here on the train tonight and some of us must drive into town for him  thats true and you must be the one to go replied bob decidedly you can take my team and if any one comes while you are gone we shall get rid of them i guess  since mr hillman wished to go to his office for some lawbooks and papers before mr gurney arrived ralph started off with him about noon leaving the farm with the oftenexpressed wish that nothing would happen during the absence of three of the defenders  if you mean by that that youre afraid some of massies men may get in here youre mistaken said bob stoutly unless we have a mind to let them which isnt at all likely there wont one of them get a chance to so much as show his nose inside  now that mr simpson had succeeded in gathering his scattered faculties once more and understood that everything might yet be well with them he seemed suddenly to have grown young again for he was as eager in watching for approaching danger as bob was  dont fear for us he shouted as mr hillman and ralph drove down the lane we can keep a regiment of them at their distance and he acted much as if he believed all he said  it was about two hours after ralph and the lawyer drove away when bob was honored with another visit from mr massies messengers but this time they did not come in sufficient force to cause any alarm  the lawyer and two men drove up to the lane where bob having seen them while they were yet some distance away had a force of five men and the following conversation took place  i am instructed by mr marcus massie the rightful owner of this place to take possession of it at once and to order you off the grounds as trespassers said the lawyer do you intend to prevent us from an exercise of our legal rights  i intend to prevent you from coming in here replied bob and i warn you now that i will seriously injure the first one who attempts to come on to this land which belongs to mr simpson  i have made the demand upon you continued the lawyer in an unruffled tone and i tell you now that my client will proceed against you if you thus attempt by force to prevent him from the exercise of his just and lawful rights  your client may proceed to do whatever he can and just as soon as he can and if my answer has not been sufficiently plain i tell you again that none of you can come in here  and bob made a demonstration with his club which appeared to convince the lawyer that he would have no hesitation about using it on his precious body  i have warned you said the legal gentleman viciously and now you can take the consequences  and i have warned you cried bob and im certain that you will take the consequences if you attempt to come here where neither you nor your client have any rights  with this pleasant conversation the lawyer and his companions drove away and once more was bob master of the situation  the next arrivals to the disputed property were mr gurney mr hillman and ralph the former had started as soon as he had received his sons telegram and from the look on ralphs face it was easy to see that the two lawyers after a consultation together did not consider the situation a desperate one  father says that even if george doesnt succeed in finding thompson he believes it will be possible to show to the satisfaction of a jury that mr simpson paid off the mortgage said ralph as the two lawyers entered the house leaving the boys alone in the stableyard of course if this witness could be found everything could be settled at once  ralphs father was also able to do something for the immediate relief of the owners of the harnett  on the morning after his arrival and the guardians of the property had been undisturbed during the night mr gurney and mr hillman went into town where they succeeded in getting bondsmen for the boys thus releasing the property from attachment they also began a suit against mr massie to restrain him from taking any further steps in the matter until the question of ownership could be decided at law  while they were absent george returned and with him was the missing witness mr jared thompson he had been found at babcock and since he had no business on hand he was perfectly willing to accompany george and all the more so because he had been promised he should be well paid for his time which just then was of no value to him  he remembered distinctly seeing mr simpson at massies office and of seeing him pay over a large roll of money which he stated was the amount of the mortgage he also heard massie say after he had counted the money that it was all right and saw him hand mr simpson the mortgage which he took from his safe  after that mr thompson heard some conversation between the two men relative to the purchase of the woodlot but since he was not interested in the matter he left the office shortly after it had begun  on the arrival of mr gurney from townfor he returned alone since there was no necessity for mr hillman to accompany him after the bonds had been given for the release of the propertyhe questioned the witness george had brought and then stated that there was no further cause for anxiety about the matter since this testimony would answer also the purpose of a written release of the mortgage  he also gave bob an order to the keeper of the property at the well recalling him from his disagreeable duties and the exmoonlighter had the pleasure of escorting the officer to the main road happy that they were once more in possession of their own  then of course mr gurney was shown the wonderful well and listened long and attentively to bobs arguments as to why another well should be sunk near the house to the surprise of all the partners except perhaps bob mr gurney advised that that scheme be carried out saying that bobs argument seemed to be supported by such facts in the case as were apparent even to those unfamiliar with the business  bob was highly delighted at having convinced ralphs father of the feasibility of this scheme and mr simpson was so impressed by the celebrated lawyers advice that he insisted on deeding that very night the strip of land on which it was proposed to sink the well to the firm of harnett gurney hubbard  simpson  mr gurney insisted that the other three partners should pay to mr simpson their proportion of the valuation of the land which would have been several thousand dollars but the old man would listen to no such proposition he had been presented with a quarter of the woodlot when he had no claim upon it and he urged his right to make the firm a present of as much land as he owned  there was no necessity of watching the farm that night although bob thought it was careless to leave it unguarded but no harm came to it nor did they even hear from the worthy mr massie  bob lost no time in setting about the work of opening the new well and his first duty next morning was to set a portion of the men at work making ready for the erection of the derrick  fortunately for the boys the court was already in session and massies claim came up for an early hearing  it seemed as if the old moneylender must have entirely forgotten that there had been a witness to the payment of the money for he came into court apparently confident that he should be able to call the harnett his own but as soon as he saw thompson all his confidence vanished and he sneaked out of court even before the case was fairly opened  of course there could be but one decision under the circumstances and in less than an hour from the time the case was called a verdict had been given in favor of mr simpson who was advised by the judge to demand of massie a written release and there was no longer any question as to the ownership of the harnett  so far as ralph was concerned the case had been decided none too soon it was time for him to return to college and on the next day in company with his father he bade his partners adieu for a year as he returned to his studies ralph gurneys vacation was at an end as this story should be since it promised simply to tell of that time                                       with the story brought to a close the work of the author should be ended unless as in this case he makes brief mention of what has happened concerning the principal characters from that time until the present  ramsdell and dean were convicted of the assault on george and sentence of two years in the state prison pronounced against them the charge of stealing the team still hanging over their heads in case george wants to press it when their term of imprisonment has ended which is not probable  while ralph was finishing his collegiate course bob worked at the new well and when it was opened he telegraphed to ralph      new well just shot another victory for the moonlighter for it     is not more than two hundred barrels less than the other  and ralph replied      i claim the right to name it it shall be called the     moonlighter  when ralph graduated he owned a quarter of three good paying wells and bob has now an idea that it will pay to open another some distance away where he has been prospecting for the past month  mr and mrs simpson still live on the old farm and george ralph and bob live with them but a new house has been built by the side of the old one for the old couple would not consent that their first home should be torn down and at any time that the readers visit that section of the country they should not fail to look at the harnett which still flows as it did
