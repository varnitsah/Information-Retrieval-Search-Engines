11245372	the clicking of cuthbert     by p g wodehouse  1922      dedication  to the immortal memory of john henrie and pat rogie who at edinburgh in the year 1593 ad were imprisoned for playing of the gowff on the links of leith every sabbath the time of the sermonses also of robert robertson who got it in the neck in 1604 ad for the same reason     fore   this book marks an epoch in my literary career it is written in blood it is the outpouring of a soul as deeply seared by fates unkindness as the pretty on the dogleg hole of the second nine was ever seared by my iron it is the work of a very nearly desperate man an eighteenhandicap man who has got to look extremely slippy if he doesnt want to find himself in the twenties again  as a writer of light fiction i have always till now been handicapped by the fact that my disposition was cheerful my heart intact and my life unsoured handicapped i say because the public likes to feel that a writer of farcical stories is piquantly miserable in his private life and that if he turns out anything amusing he does it simply in order to obtain relief from the almost insupportable weight of an existence which he has long since realized to be a washout well today i am just like that  two years ago i admit i was a shallow farceur my work lacked depth i wrote flippantly simply because i was having a thoroughly good time then i took up golf and now i can smile through the tears and laugh like figaro that i may not weep and generally hold my head up and feel that i am entitled to respect  if you find anything in this volume that amuses you kindly bear in mind that it was probably written on my return home after losing three balls in the gorse or breaking the head off a favourite driver and with a murmured brave fellow brave fellow recall the story of the clown jesting while his child lay dying at home that is all thank you for your sympathy it means more to me than i can say do you think that if i tried the square stance for a bit but after all this cannot interest you leave me to my misery   postscriptin the second chapter i allude to stout cortez staring at the pacific shortly after the appearance of this narrative in serial form in america i received an anonymous letter containing the words you big stiff it wasnt cortez it was balboa this i believe is historically accurate on the other hand if cortez was good enough for keats he is good enough for me besides even if it was balboa the pacific was open for being stared at about that time and i see no reason why cortez should not have had a look at it as well                                      p g wodehouse     contents   fore  chapter  i    the clicking of cuthbert  ii   a woman is only a woman  iii  a mixed threesome  iv   sundered hearts  v

came into the smokingroom of the clubhouse and flung his bag with a clatter on the floor he sank moodily into an armchair and pressed the bell  waiter  sir  the young man pointed at the bag with every evidence of distaste  you may have these clubs he said take them away if you dont want them yourself give them to one of the caddies  across the room the oldest member gazed at him with a grave sadness through the smoke of his pipe his eye was deep and dreamythe eye of a man who as the poet says has seen golf steadily and seen it whole  you are giving up golf he said  he was not altogether unprepared for such an attitude on the young mans part for from his eyrie on the terrace above the ninth green he had observed him start out on the afternoons round and had seen him lose a couple of balls in the lake at the second hole after taking seven strokes at the first  yes cried the young man fiercely for ever dammit footling game blanked infernal fatheaded silly ass of a game nothing but a waste of time  the sage winced  dont say that my boy  but i do say it what earthly good is golf life is stern and life is earnest we live in a practical age all round us we see foreign competition making itself unpleasant and we spend our time playing golf what do we get out of it is golf any use thats what im asking you can you name me a single case where devotion to this pestilential pastime has done a man any practical good  the sage smiled gently  i could name a thousand  one will do  i will select said the sage from the innumerable memories that rush to my mind the story of cuthbert banks  never heard of him  be of good cheer said the oldest member you are going to hear of him now                                       it was in the picturesque little settlement of wood hills said the oldest member that the incidents occurred which i am about to relate even if you have never been in wood hills that suburban paradise is probably familiar to you by name situated at a convenient distance from the city it combines in a notable manner the advantages of town life with the pleasant surroundings and healthful air of the country its inhabitants live in commodious houses standing in their own grounds and enjoy so many luxuriessuch as gravel soil main drainage electric light telephone baths h and c and companys own water that you might be pardoned for imagining life to be so ideal for them that no possible improvement could be added to their lot mrs willoughby smethurst was under no such delusion what wood hills needed to make it perfect she realized was culture material comforts are all very well but if the summum bonum is to be achieved the soul also demands a look in and it was mrs smethursts unfaltering resolve that never while she had her strength should the soul be handed the losers end it was her intention to make wood hills a centre of all that was most cultivated and refined and golly how she had succeeded under her presidency the wood hills literary and debating society had tripled its membership  but there is always a fly in the ointment a caterpillar in the salad the local golf club an institution to which mrs smethurst strongly objected had also tripled its membership and the division of the community into two rival camps the golfers and the cultured had become more marked than ever this division always acute had attained now to the dimensions of a schism the rival sects treated one another with a cold hostility  unfortunate episodes came to widen the breach mrs smethursts house adjoined the links standing to the right of the fourth tee and as the literary society was in the habit of entertaining visiting lecturers many a golfer had foozled his drive owing to sudden loud outbursts of applause coinciding with his downswing and not long before this story opens a sliced ball whizzing in at the open window had come within an ace of incapacitating raymond parsloe devine the rising young novelist who rose at that moment a clear foot and a half from any further exercise of his art two inches indeed to the right and raymond must inevitably have handed in his dinnerpail  to make matters worse a ring at the frontdoor bell followed almost immediately and the maid ushered in a young man of pleasing appearance in a sweater and baggy knickerbockers who apologetically but firmly insisted on playing his ball where it lay and what with the shock of the lecturers narrow escape and the spectacle of the intruder standing on the table and working away with a niblick the afternoons session had to be classed as a complete frost mr devines determination from which no argument could swerve him to deliver the rest of his lecture in the coalcellar gave the meeting a jolt from which it never recovered  i have dwelt upon this incident because it was the means of introducing cuthbert banks to mrs smethursts niece adeline as cuthbert for it was he who had so nearly reduced the musterroll of rising novelists by one hopped down from the table after his stroke he was suddenly aware that a beautiful girl was looking at him intently as a matter of fact everyone in the room was looking at him intently none more so than raymond parsloe devine but none of the others were beautiful girls long as the members of wood hills literary society were on brain they were short on looks and to cuthberts excited eye adeline smethurst stood out like a jewel in a pile of coke  he had never seen her before for she had only arrived at her aunts house on the previous day but he was perfectly certain that life even when lived in the midst of gravel soil main drainage and companys own water was going to be a pretty poor affair if he did not see her again yes cuthbert was in love and it is interesting to record as showing the effect of the tender emotion on a mans game that twenty minutes after he had met adeline he did the short eleventh in one and as near as a toucher got a three on the fourhundredyard twelfth  i will skip lightly over the intermediate stages of cuthberts courtship and come to the moment whenat the annual ball in aid of the local cottage hospital the only occasion during the year on which the lion so to speak lay down with the lamb and the golfers and the cultured met on terms of easy comradeship their differences temporarily laid asidehe proposed to adeline and was badly stymied  that fair soulful girl could not see him with a spyglass  mr banks she said i will speak frankly  charge right ahead assented cuthbert  deeply sensible as i am of  i know of the honour and the compliment and all that but passing lightly over all that guff what seems to be the trouble i love you to distraction  love is not everything  youre wrong said cuthbert earnestly youre right off it love and he was about to dilate on the theme when she interrupted him  i am a girl of ambition  and very nice too said cuthbert  i am a girl of ambition repeated adeline and i realize that the fulfilment of my ambitions must come through my husband i am very ordinary myself  what cried cuthbert you ordinary why you are a pearl among women the queen of your sex you cant have been looking in a glass lately you stand alone simply alone you make the rest look like battered repaints  well said adeline softening a trifle i believe i am fairly goodlooking  anybody who was content to call you fairly goodlooking would describe the taj mahal as a pretty nifty tomb  but that is not the point what i mean is if i marry a nonentity i shall be a nonentity myself for ever and i would sooner die than be a nonentity  and if i follow your reasoning you think that that lets me out  well really mr banks have you done anything or are you likely ever to do anything worth while  cuthbert hesitated  its true he said i didnt finish in the first ten in the open and i was knocked out in the semifinal of the amateur but i won the french open last year  thewhat  the french open championship golf you know  golf you waste all your time playing golf i admire a man who is more spiritual more intellectual  a pang of jealousy rent cuthberts bosom  like whatshisname devine he said sullenly  mr devine replied adeline blushing faintly is going to be a great man already he has achieved much the critics say that he is more russian than any other young english writer  and is that good  of course its good  i should have thought the wheeze would be to be more english than any other young english writer  nonsense who wants an english writer to be english youve got to be russian or spanish or something to be a real success the mantle of the great russians has descended on mr devine  from what ive heard of russians i should hate to have that happen to me  there is no danger of that said adeline scornfully  oh well let me tell you that there is a lot more in me than you think  that might easily be so  you think im not spiritual and intellectual said cuthbert deeply moved very well tomorrow i join the literary society  even as he spoke the words his leg was itching to kick himself for being such a chump but the sudden expression of pleasure on adelines face soothed him and he went home that night with the feeling that he had taken on something rather attractive it was only in the cold grey light of the morning that he realized what he had let himself in for  i do not know if you have had any experience of suburban literary societies but the one that flourished under the eye of mrs willoughby smethurst at wood hills was rather more so than the average with my feeble powers of narrative i cannot hope to make clear to you all that cuthbert banks endured in the next few weeks and even if i could i doubt if i should do so it is all very well to excite pity and terror as aristotle recommends but there are limits in the ancient greek tragedies it was an ironclad rule that all the real rough stuff should take place offstage and i shall follow this admirable principle it will suffice if i say merely that j cuthbert banks had a thin time after attending eleven debates and fourteen lectures on vers libre poetry the seventeenthcentury essayists the neoscandinavian movement in portuguese literature and other subjects of a similar nature he grew so enfeebled that on the rare occasions when he had time for a visit to the links he had to take a full iron for his mashie shots  it was not simply the oppressive nature of the debates and lectures that sapped his vitality what really got right in amongst him was the torture of seeing adelines adoration of raymond parsloe devine the man seemed to have made the deepest possible impression upon her plastic emotions when he spoke she leaned forward with parted lips and looked at him when he was not speakingwhich was seldomshe leaned back and looked at him and when he happened to take the next seat to her she leaned sideways and looked at him one glance at mr devine would have been more than enough for cuthbert but adeline found him a spectacle that never palled she could not have gazed at him with a more rapturous intensity if she had been a small child and he a saucer of icecream all this cuthbert had to witness while still endeavouring to retain the possession of his faculties sufficiently to enable him to duck and back away if somebody suddenly asked him what he thought of the sombre realism of vladimir brusiloff it is little wonder that he tossed in bed picking at the coverlet through sleepless nights and had to have all his waistcoats taken in three inches to keep them from sagging  this vladimir brusiloff to whom i have referred was the famous russian novelist and owing to the fact of his being in the country on a lecturing tour at the moment there had been something of a boom in his works the wood hills literary society had been studying them for weeks and never since his first entrance into intellectual circles had cuthbert banks come nearer to throwing in the towel vladimir specialized in grey studies of hopeless misery where nothing happened till page three hundred and eighty when the moujik decided to commit suicide it was tough going for a man whose deepest reading hitherto had been vardon on the pushshot and there can be no greater proof of the magic of love than the fact that cuthbert stuck it without a cry but the strain was terrible and i am inclined to think that he must have cracked had it not been for the daily reports in the papers of the internecine strife which was proceeding so briskly in russia cuthbert was an optimist at heart and it seemed to him that at the rate at which the inhabitants of that interesting country were murdering one another the supply of russian novelists must eventually give out  one morning as he tottered down the road for the short walk which was now almost the only exercise to which he was equal cuthbert met adeline a spasm of anguish flitted through all his nervecentres as he saw that she was accompanied by raymond parsloe devine  good morning mr banks said adeline  good morning said cuthbert hollowly  such good news about vladimir brusiloff  dead said cuthbert with a touch of hope  dead of course not why should he be no aunt emily met his manager after his lecture at queens hall yesterday and he has promised that mr brusiloff shall come to her next wednesday reception  oh ah said cuthbert dully  i dont know how she managed it i think she must have told him that mr devine would be there to meet him  but you said he was coming argued cuthbert  i shall be very glad said raymond devine of the opportunity of meeting brusiloff  im sure said adeline he will be very glad of the opportunity of meeting you  possibly said mr devine possibly competent critics have said that my work closely resembles that of the great russian masters  your psychology is so deep  yes yes  and your atmosphere  quite  cuthbert in a perfect agony of spirit prepared to withdraw from this lovefeast the sun was shining brightly but the world was black to him birds sang in the treetops but he did not hear them he might have been a moujik for all the pleasure he found in life  you will be there mr banks said adeline as he turned away  oh all right said cuthbert  when cuthbert had entered the drawingroom on the following wednesday and had taken his usual place in a distant corner where while able to feast his gaze on adeline he had a sporting chance of being overlooked or mistaken for a piece of furniture he perceived the great russian thinker seated in the midst of a circle of admiring females raymond parsloe devine had not yet arrived  his first glance at the novelist surprised cuthbert doubtless with the best motives vladimir brusiloff had permitted his face to become almost entirely concealed behind a dense zareba of hair but his eyes were visible through the undergrowth and it seemed to cuthbert that there was an expression in them not unlike that of a cat in a strange backyard surrounded by small boys the man looked forlorn and hopeless and cuthbert wondered whether he had had bad news from home  this was not the case the latest news which vladimir brusiloff had had from russia had been particularly cheering three of his principal creditors had perished in the last massacre of the bourgeoisie and a man whom he owed for five years for a samovar and a pair of overshoes had fled the country and had not been heard of since it was not bad news from home that was depressing vladimir what was wrong with him was the fact that this was the eightysecond suburban literary reception he had been compelled to attend since he had landed in the country on his lecturing tour and he was sick to death of it when his agent had first suggested the trip he had signed on the dotted line without an instants hesitation worked out in roubles the fees offered had seemed just about right but now as he peered through the brushwood at the faces round him and realized that eight out of ten of those present had manuscripts of some sort concealed on their persons and were only waiting for an opportunity to whip them out and start reading he wished that he had stayed at his quiet home in nijninovgorod where the worst thing that could happen to a fellow was a brace of bombs coming in through the window and mixing themselves up with his breakfast egg  at this point in his meditations he was aware that his hostess was looming up before him with a pale young man in hornrimmed spectacles at her side there was in mrs smethursts demeanour something of the unction of the masterofceremonies at the big fight who introduces the earnest gentleman who wishes to challenge the winner  oh mr brusiloff said mrs smethurst i do so want you to meet mr raymond parsloe devine whose work i expect you know he is one of our younger novelists  the distinguished visitor peered in a wary and defensive manner through the shrubbery but did not speak inwardly he was thinking how exactly like mr devine was to the eightyone other younger novelists to whom he had been introduced at various hamlets throughout the country raymond parsloe devine bowed courteously while cuthbert wedged into his corner glowered at him  the critics said mr devine have been kind enough to say that my poor efforts contain a good deal of the russian spirit i owe much to the great russians i have been greatly influenced by sovietski  down in the forest something stirred it was vladimir brusiloffs mouth opening as he prepared to speak he was not a man who prattled readily especially in a foreign tongue he gave the impression that each word was excavated from his interior by some uptodate process of mining he glared bleakly at mr devine and allowed three words to drop out of him  sovietski no good  he paused for a moment set the machinery working again and delivered five more at the pithead  i spit me of sovietski  there was a painful sensation the lot of a popular idol is in many ways an enviable one but it has the drawback of uncertainty here today and gone tomorrow until this moment raymond parsloe devines stock had stood at something considerably over par in wood hills intellectual circles but now there was a rapid slump hitherto he had been greatly admired for being influenced by sovietski but it appeared now that this was not a good thing to be it was evidently a rotten thing to be the law could not touch you for being influenced by sovietski but there is an ethical as well as a legal code and this it was obvious that raymond parsloe devine had transgressed women drew away from him slightly holding their skirts men looked at him censoriously adeline smethurst started violently and dropped a teacup and cuthbert banks doing his popular imitation of a sardine in his corner felt for the first time that life held something of sunshine  raymond parsloe devine was plainly shaken but he made an adroit attempt to recover his lost prestige  when i say i have been influenced by sovietski i mean of course that i was once under his spell a young writer commits many follies i have long since passed through that phase the false glamour of sovietski has ceased to dazzle me i now belong wholeheartedly to the school of nastikoff  there was a reaction people nodded at one another sympathetically after all we cannot expect old heads on young shoulders and a lapse at the outset of ones career should not be held against one who has eventually seen the light  nastikoff no good said vladimir brusiloff coldly he paused listening to the machinery  nastikoff worse than sovietski  he paused again  i spit me of nastikoff he said  this time there was no doubt about it the bottom had dropped out of the market and raymond parsloe devine preferred were down in the cellar with no takers it was clear to the entire assembled company that they had been all wrong about raymond parsloe devine they had allowed him to play on their innocence and sell them a pup they had taken him at his own valuation and had been cheated into admiring him as a man who amounted to something and all the while he had belonged to the school of nastikoff you never can tell mrs smethursts guests were wellbred and there was consequently no violent demonstration but you could see by their faces what they felt those nearest raymond parsloe jostled to get further away mrs smethurst eyed him stonily through a raised lorgnette one or two low hisses were heard and over at the other end of the room somebody opened the window in a marked manner  raymond parsloe devine hesitated for a moment then realizing his situation turned and slunk to the door there was an audible sigh of relief as it closed behind him  vladimir brusiloff proceeded to sum up  no novelists any good except me sovietskiyah nastikoffbah i spit me of zem all no novelists anywhere any good except me p g wodehouse and tolstoi not bad not good but not bad no novelists any good except me  and having uttered this dictum he removed a slab of cake from a nearby plate steered it through the jungle and began to champ  it is too much to say that there was a dead silence there could never be that in any room in which vladimir brusiloff was eating cake but certainly what you might call the general chitchat was pretty well down and out nobody liked to be the first to speak the members of the wood hills literary society looked at one another timidly cuthbert for his part gazed at adeline and adeline gazed into space it was plain that the girl was deeply stirred her eyes were opened wide a faint flush crimsoned her cheeks and her breath was coming quickly  adelines mind was in a whirl she felt as if she had been walking gaily along a pleasant path and had stopped suddenly on the very brink of a precipice it would be idle to deny that raymond parsloe devine had attracted her extraordinarily she had taken him at his own valuation as an extremely hot potato and her heroworship had gradually been turning into love and now her hero had been shown to have feet of clay it was hard i consider on raymond parsloe devine but that is how it goes in this world you get a following as a celebrity and then you run up against another bigger celebrity and your admirers desert you one could moralize on this at considerable length but better not perhaps enough to say that the glamour of raymond devine ceased abruptly in that moment for adeline and her most coherent thought at this juncture was the resolve as soon as she got up to her room to burn the three signed photographs he had sent her and to give the autographed presentation set of his books to the grocers boy  mrs smethurst meanwhile having rallied somewhat was endeavouring to set the feast of reason and flow of soul going again  and how do you like england mr brusiloff she asked  the celebrity paused in the act of lowering another segment of cake  dam good he replied cordially  i suppose you have travelled all over the country by this time  you said it agreed the thinker  have you met many of our great public men  yaisyaisquite a few of the nibslloyid gorge i meet him but beneath the matting a discontented expression came into his face and his voice took on a peevish note but i not meet your real great menyour arbmishel your arreevadoni not meet them thats what gives me the pipovitch have you ever met arbmishel and arreevadon  a strained anguished look came into mrs smethursts face and was reflected in the faces of the other members of the circle the eminent russian had sprung two entirely new ones on them and they felt that their ignorance was about to be exposed what would vladimir brusiloff think of the wood hills literary society the reputation of the wood hills literary society was at stake trembling in the balance and coming up for the third time in dumb agony mrs smethurst rolled her eyes about the room searching for someone capable of coming to the rescue she drew blank  and then from a distant corner there sounded a deprecating cough and those nearest cuthbert banks saw that he had stopped twisting his right foot round his left ankle and his left foot round his right ankle and was sitting up with a light of almost human intelligence in his eyes  er said cuthbert blushing as every eye in the room seemed to fix itself on him i think he means abe mitchell and harry vardon  abe mitchell and harry vardon repeated mrs smethurst blankly i never heard of  yais yais most very shouted vladimir brusiloff enthusiastically arbmishel and arreevadon you know them yes what no perhaps  ive played with abe mitchell often and i was partnered with harry vardon in last years open  the great russian uttered a cry that shook the chandelier  you play in ze open why he demanded reproachfully of mrs smethurst was i not been introducted to this young man who play in opens  well really faltered mrs smethurst well the fact is mr brusiloff  she broke off she was unequal to the task of explaining without hurting anyones feelings that she had always regarded cuthbert as a piece of cheese and a blot on the landscape  introduct me thundered the celebrity  why certainly certainly of course this is mr  she looked appealingly at cuthbert  banks prompted cuthbert  banks cried vladimir brusiloff not cootaboot banks  is your name cootaboot asked mrs smethurst faintly  well its cuthbert  yais yais cootaboot there was a rush and swirl as the effervescent muscovite burst his way through the throng and rushed to where cuthbert sat he stood for a moment eyeing him excitedly then stooping swiftly kissed him on both cheeks before cuthbert could get his guard up my dear young man i saw you win ze french open great great grand superb hot stuff and you can say i said so will you permit one who is but eighteen at nijninovgorod to salute you once more  and he kissed cuthbert again then brushing aside one or two intellectuals who were in the way he dragged up a chair and sat down  you are a great man he said  oh no said cuthbert modestly  yais great most very the way you lay your approachputts dead from anywhere  oh i dont know  mr brusiloff drew his chair closer  let me tell you one vairy funny story about putting it was one day i play at nijninovgorod with the pro against lenin and trotsky and trotsky had a twoinch putt for the hole but just as he addresses the ball someone in the crowd he tries to assassinate lenin with a rewolweryou know that is our great national sport trying to assassinate lenin with rewolwersand the bang puts trotsky off his stroke and he goes five yards past the hole and then lenin who is rather shaken you understand he misses again himself and we win the hole and match and i clean up three hundred and ninetysix thousand roubles or fifteen shillings in your money some gameovitch and now let me tell you one other vairy funny story  desultory conversation had begun in murmurs over the rest of the room as the wood hills intellectuals politely endeavoured to conceal the fact that they realized that they were about as much out of it at this reunion of twin souls as cats at a dogshow from time to time they started as vladimir brusiloffs laugh boomed out perhaps it was a consolation to them to know that he was enjoying himself  as for adeline how shall i describe her emotions she was stunned before her very eyes the stone which the builders had rejected had become the main thing the hundredtoone shot had walked away with the race a rush of tender admiration for cuthbert banks flooded her heart she saw that she had been all wrong cuthbert whom she had always treated with a patronizing superiority was really a man to be looked up to and worshipped a deep dreamy sigh shook adelines fragile form  half an hour later vladimir and cuthbert banks rose  gootabye mrs smetthirst said the celebrity zank you for a most charming visit my friend cootaboot and me we go now to shoot a few holes you will lend me clobs friend cootaboot  any you want  the niblicksky is what i use most gootabye mrs smetthirst  they were moving to the door when cuthbert felt a light touch on his arm adeline was looking up at him tenderly  may i come too and walk round with you  cuthberts bosom heaved  oh he said with a tremor in his voice that you would walk round with me for life  her eyes met his  perhaps she whispered softly it could be arranged                                       and so concluded the oldest member you see that golf can be of the greatest practical assistance to a man in lifes struggle raymond parsloe devine who was no player had to move out of the neighbourhood immediately and is now i believe writing scenarios out in california for the flicker film company adeline is married to cuthbert and it was only his earnest pleading which prevented her from having their eldest son christened abe mitchell ribbedfaced mashie banks for she is now as keen a devotee of the great game as her husband those who know them say that theirs is a union so devoted so                                       the sage broke off abruptly for the young man had rushed to the door and out into the passage through the open door he could hear him crying passionately to the waiter to bring back his clubs     2  a woman is only a woman   on a fine day in the spring summer or early autumn there are few spots more delightful than the terrace in front of our golf club it is a vantagepoint peculiarly fitted to the man of philosophic mind for from it may be seen that varied neverending pageant which men call golf in a number of its aspects to your right on the first tee stand the cheery optimists who are about to make their opening drive happily conscious that even a topped shot will trickle a measurable distance down the steep hill away in the valley directly in front of you is the lake hole where these same optimists will be converted to pessimism by the wet splash of a new ball at your side is the ninth green with its sinuous undulations which have so often wrecked the returning traveller in sight of home and at various points within your line of vision are the third tee the sixth tee and the sinister bunkers about the eighth greennone of them lacking in food for the reflective mind  it is on this terrace that the oldest member sits watching the younger generation knocking at the divot his gaze wanders from jimmy fothergills twohundredandtwentyyard drive down the hill to the silver drops that flash up in the sun as young freddie woosleys mashieshot drops weakly into the waters of the lake returning it rests upon peter willard large and tall and james todd small and slender as they struggle up the fairway of the ninth                                       love says the oldest member is an emotion which your true golfer should always treat with suspicion do not misunderstand me i am not saying that love is a bad thing only that it is an unknown quantity i have known cases where marriage improved a mans game and other cases where it seemed to put him right off his stroke there seems to be no fixed rule but what i do say is that a golfer should be cautious he should not be led away by the first pretty face i will tell you a story that illustrates the point it is the story of those two men who have just got on to the ninth greenpeter willard and james todd  there is about great friendships between man and man said the oldest member a certain inevitability that can only be compared with the ageold association of ham and eggs no one can say when it was that these two wholesome and palatable foodstuffs first came together nor what was the mutual magnetism that brought their deathless partnership about one simply feels that it is one of the things that must be so similarly with men who can trace to its first beginnings the love of damon for pythias of david for jonathan of swan for edgar who can explain what it was about crosse that first attracted blackwell we simply say these men are friends and leave it at that  in the case of peter willard and james todd one may hazard the guess that the first link in the chain that bound them together was the fact that they took up golf within a few days of each other and contrived as time went on to develop such equal form at the game that the most expert critics are still baffled in their efforts to decide which is the worse player i have heard the point argued a hundred times without any conclusion being reached supporters of peter claim that his driving off the tee entitles him to an unchallenged preeminence among the worlds most hopeless foozlersonly to be discomfited later when the advocates of james show by means of diagrams that no one has ever surpassed their man in absolute incompetence with the spoon it is one of those problems where debate is futile  few things draw two men together more surely than a mutual inability to master golf coupled with an intense and everincreasing love for the game at the end of the first few months when a series of costly experiments had convinced both peter and james that there was not a tottering greybeard nor a toddling infant in the neighbourhood whose downfall they could encompass the two became inseparable it was pleasanter they found to play together and go neck and neck round the eighteen holes than to take on some lissome youngster who could spatter them all over the course with one old ball and a cutdown cleek stolen from his father or some spavined elder who not only rubbed it into them but was apt between strokes to bore them with personal reminiscences of the crimean war so they began to play together early and late in the small hours before breakfast long ere the first faint piping of the waking caddie made itself heard from the caddieshed they were halfway through their opening round and at close of day when bats wheeled against the steely sky and the pros had stolen home to rest you might see them in the deepening dusk going through the concluding exercises of their final spasm after dark they visited each others houses and read golf books  if you have gathered from what i have said that peter willard and james todd were fond of golf i am satisfied that is the impression i intended to convey they were real golfers for real golf is a thing of the spirit not of mere mechanical excellence of stroke  it must not be thought however that they devoted too much of their time and their thoughts to golfassuming indeed that such a thing is possible each was connected with a business in the metropolis and often before he left for the links peter would go to the trouble and expense of ringing up the office to say he would not be coming in that day while i myself have heard jamesand this not once but frequentlysay while lunching in the clubhouse that he had half a mind to get gracechurch street on the phone and ask how things were going they were in fact the type of men of whom england is proudestthe backbone of a great country toilers in the mart untired businessmen keen redblooded men of affairs if they played a little golf besides who shall blame them  so they went on day by day happy and contented and then the woman came into their lives like the serpent in the links of eden and perhaps for the first time they realized that they were not one entitynot one single indivisible something that made for topped drives and short puttsbut two individuals in whose breasts nature had implanted other desires than the simple ambition some day to do the dogleg hole on the second nine in under double figures my friends tell me that when i am relating a story my language is inclined at times a little to obscure my meaning but if you understand from what i have been saying that james todd and peter willard both fell in love with the same womanall right let us carry on that is precisely what i was driving at  i have not the pleasure of an intimate acquaintance with grace forrester i have seen her in the distance watering the flowers in her garden and on these occasions her stance struck me as graceful and once at a picnic i observed her killing wasps with a teaspoon and was impressed by the freedom of the wristaction of her backswing beyond this i can say little but she must have been attractive for there can be no doubt of the earnestness with which both peter and james fell in love with her i doubt if either slept a wink the night of the dance at which it was their privilege first to meet her  the next afternoon happening to encounter peter in the bunker near the eleventh green james said  that was a nice girl that miss whatshername  and peter pausing for a moment from his trenchdigging replied  yes  and then james with a pang knew that he had a rival for he had not mentioned miss forresters name and yet peter had divined that it was to her that he had referred  love is a fever which so to speak drives off without wasting time on the address on the very next morning after the conversation which i have related james todd rang peter willard up on the phone and cancelled their golf engagements for the day on the plea of a sprained wrist peter acknowledging the cancellation stated that he himself had been on the point of ringing james up to say that he would be unable to play owing to a slight headache they met at teatime at miss forresters house james asked how peters headache was and peter said it was a little better peter inquired after jamess sprained wrist and was told it seemed on the mend miss forrester dispensed tea and conversation to both impartially  they walked home together after an awkward silence of twenty minutes james said  there is something about the atmospherethe aura shall i saythat emanates from a good woman that makes a man feel that life has a new a different meaning  peter replied  yes  when they reached jamess door james said  i wont ask you in tonight old man you want to go home and rest and cure that headache  yes said peter  there was another silence peter was thinking that only a couple of days before james had told him that he had a copy of sandy macbeans how to become a scratch man your first season by studying photographs coming by parcelpost from town and they had arranged to read it aloud together by now thought peter it must be lying on his friends table the thought saddened him and james guessing what was in peters mind was saddened too but he did not waver he was in no mood to read macbeans masterpiece that night in the twenty minutes of silence after leaving miss forrester he had realized that grace rhymes with face and he wanted to sit alone in his study and write poetry the two men parted with a distant nod i beg your pardon yes you are right two distant nods it was always a failing of mine to count the score erroneously  it is not my purpose to weary you by a minute recital of the happenings of each day that went by on the surface the lives of these two men seemed unchanged they still played golf together and during the round achieved towards each other a manner that superficially retained all its ancient cheeriness and affection ifi should saywhen james topped his drive peter never failed to say hard luck and whenor rather if peter managed not to top his james invariably said great but things were not the same and they knew it  it so happened as it sometimes will on these occasions for fate is a dramatist who gets his best effects with a small cast that peter willard and james todd were the only visible aspirants for the hand of miss forrester right at the beginning young freddie woosley had seemed attracted by the girl and had called once or twice with flowers and chocolates but freddies affections never centred themselves on one object for more than a few days and he had dropped out after the first week from that time on it became clear to all of us that if grace forrester intended to marry anyone in the place it would be either james or peter and a good deal of interest was taken in the matter by the local sportsmen so little was known of the form of the two men neither having figured as principal in a loveaffair before that even money was the best you could get and the market was sluggish i think my own flutter of twelve golfballs taken up by percival brown was the most substantial of any of the wagers i selected james as the winner why i can hardly say unless that he had an aunt who contributed occasional stories to the womans sphere these things sometimes weigh with a girl on the other hand george lucas who had halfadozen of gingerale on peter based his calculations on the fact that james wore knickerbockers on the links and that no girl could possibly love a man with calves like that in short you see we really had nothing to go on  nor had james and peter the girl seemed to like them both equally they never saw her except in each others company and it was not until one day when grace forrester was knitting a sweater that there seemed a chance of getting a clue to her hidden feelings  when the news began to spread through the place that grace was knitting this sweater there was a big sensation the thing seemed to us practically to amount to a declaration  that was the view that james todd and peter willard took of it and they used to call on grace watch her knitting and come away with their heads full of complicated calculations the whole thing hung on one pointto wit what size the sweater was going to be if it was large then it must be for peter if small then james was the lucky man neither dared to make open inquiries but it began to seem almost impossible to find out the truth without them no masculine eye can reckon up purls and plains and estimate the size of chest which the garment is destined to cover moreover with amateur knitters there must always be allowed a margin for involuntary error there were many cases during the war where our girls sent sweaters to their sweethearts which would have induced strangulation in their young brothers the amateur sweater of those days was in fact practically tantamount to german propaganda  peter and james were accordingly baffled one evening the sweater would look small and james would come away jubilant the next it would have swollen over a vast area and peter would walk home singing the suspense of the two men can readily be imagined on the one hand they wanted to know their fate on the other they fully realized that whoever the sweater was for would have to wear it and as it was a vivid pink and would probably not fit by a mile their hearts quailed at the prospect  in all affairs of human tension there must come a breaking point it came one night as the two men were walking home  peter said james stopping in midstride he mopped his forehead his manner had been feverish all the evening  yes said peter  i cant stand this any longer i havent had a good nights rest for weeks we must find out definitely which of us is to have that sweater  lets go back and ask her said peter  so they turned back and rang the bell and went into the house and presented themselves before miss forrester  lovely evening said james to break the ice  superb said peter  delightful said miss forrester looking a little surprised at finding the troupe playing a return date without having booked it in advance  to settle a bet said james will you please tell us whoi should say whomyou are knitting that sweater for  it is not a sweater replied miss forrester with a womanly candour that well became her it is a sock and it is for my cousin juliets youngest son willie  good night said james  good night said peter  good night said grace forrester  it was during the long hours of the night when ideas so often come to wakeful men that james was struck by an admirable solution of his and peters difficulty it seemed to him that were one or the other to leave woodhaven the survivor would find himself in a position to conduct his wooing as wooing should be conducted hitherto as i have indicated neither had allowed the other to be more than a few minutes alone with the girl they watched each other like hawks when james called peter called when peter dropped in james invariably popped round the thing had resolved itself into a stalemate  the idea which now came to james was that he and peter should settle their rivalry by an eighteenhole match on the links he thought very highly of the idea before he finally went to sleep and in the morning the scheme looked just as good to him as it had done overnight  james was breakfasting next morning preparatory to going round to disclose his plan to peter when peter walked in looking happier than he had done for days  morning said james  morning said peter  peter sat down and toyed absently with a slice of bacon  ive got an idea he said  one isnt many said james bringing his knife down with a jerkshot on a fried egg what is your idea  got it last night as i was lying awake it struck me that if either of us was to clear out of this place the other would have a fair chance you know what i meanwith her at present weve got each other stymied now how would it be said peter abstractedly spreading marmalade on his bacon if we were to play an eighteenhole match the loser to leg out of the neighbourhood and stay away long enough to give the winner the chance to find out exactly how things stood  james started so violently that he struck himself in the left eye with his fork  thats exactly the idea i got last night too  then its a go  its the only thing to do  there was silence for a moment both men were thinking remember they were friends for years they had shared each others sorrows joys and golfballs and sliced into the same bunkers  presently peter said  i shall miss you  what do you mean miss me  when youre gone woodhaven wont seem the same place but of course youll soon be able to come back i shant waste any time proposing  leave me your address said james and ill send you a wire when you can return you wont be offended if i dont ask you to be best man at the wedding in the circumstances it might be painful to you  peter sighed dreamily  well have the sittingroom done in blue her eyes are blue  remember said james there will always be a knife and fork for you at our little nest grace is not the woman to want me to drop my bachelor friends  touching this match said peter strict royal and ancient rules of course  certainly  i mean to sayno offence old manbut no grounding niblicks in bunkers  precisely and without hinting at anything personal the ball shall be considered holedout only when it is in the hole not when it stops on the edge  undoubtedly andyou know i dont want to hurt your feelingsmissing the ball counts as a stroke not as a practiceswing  exactly andyoull forgive me if i mention ita player whose ball has fallen in the rough may not pull up all the bushes within a radius of three feet  in fact strict rules  strict rules  they shook hands without more words and presently peter walked out and james with a guilty look over his shoulder took down sandy macbeans great work from the bookshelf and began to study the photograph of the short approachshot showing mr macbean swinging from point a through dotted line bc to point d his head the while remaining rigid at the spot marked with a cross he felt a little guiltily that he had stolen a march on his friend and that the contest was as good as over                                       i cannot recall a lovelier summer day than that on which the great toddwillard eighteenhole match took place it had rained during the night and now the sun shone down from a clear blue sky on to turf that glistened more greenly than the young grass of early spring butterflies flitted to and fro birds sang merrily in short all nature smiled and it is to be doubted if nature ever had a better excuse for smilingor even laughing outright for matches like that between james todd and peter willard do not occur every day  whether it was that love had keyed them up or whether hours of study of braids advanced golf and the badminton book had produced a belated effect i cannot say but both started off quite reasonably well our first hole as you can see is a bogey four and james was dead on the pin in seven leaving peter who had twice hit the united kingdom with his mashie in mistake for the ball a difficult putt for the half only one thing could happen when you left peter a difficult putt and james advanced to the lake hole one up peter as he followed trying to console himself with the thought that many of the best golfers prefer to lose the first hole and save themselves for a strong finish  peter and james had played over the lake hole so often that they had become accustomed to it and had grown into the habit of sinking a ball or two as a preliminary formality with much the same stoicism displayed by those kings in ancient and superstitious times who used to fling jewellery into the sea to propitiate it before they took a voyage but today by one of those miracles without which golf would not be golf each of them got over with his first shotand not only over but dead on the pin our pro himself could not have done better  i think it was at this point that the two men began to go to pieces they were in an excited frame of mind and this thing unmanned them you will no doubt recall keatss poem about stout cortez staring with eagle eyes at the pacific while all his men gazed at each other with a wild surmise silent upon a peak in darien precisely so did peter willard and james todd stare with eagle eyes at the second lake hole and gaze at each other with a wild surmise silent upon a tee in woodhaven they had dreamed of such a happening so often and woke to find the vision false that at first they could not believe that the thing had actually occurred  i got over whispered james in an awed voice  so did i muttered peter  in one  with my very first  they walked in silence round the edge of the lake and holed out one putt was enough for each and they halved the hole with a two peters previous record was eight and james had once done a seven there are times when strong men lose their selfcontrol and this was one of them they reached the third tee in a daze and it was here that mortification began to set in  the third hole is another bogey four up the hill and past the tree that serves as a directionpost the hole itself being out of sight on his day james had often done it in ten and peter in nine but now they were unnerved james who had the honour shook visibly as he addressed his ball three times he swung and only connected with the ozone the fourth time he topped badly the discs had been set back a little way and james had the mournful distinction of breaking a record for the course by playing his fifth shot from the tee it was a low raking brasseyshot which carried a heap of stones twenty feet to the right and finished in a furrow peter meanwhile had popped up a lofty ball which came to rest behind a stone  it was now that the rigid rules governing this contest began to take their toll had they been playing an ordinary friendly round each would have teed up on some convenient hillock and probably been past the tree with their second for james would in ordinary circumstances have taken his drive back and regarded the strokes he had made as a little preliminary practice to get him into midseason form but today it was war to the niblick and neither man asked nor expected quarter peters seventh shot dislodged the stone leaving him a clear field and james with his eleventh extricated himself from the furrow fifty feet from the tree james was eighteen peter twelve but then the latter as every golfer does at times suddenly went right off his game he hit the tree four times then hooked into the sandbunkers to the left of the hole james who had been playing a game that was steady without being brilliant was on the green in twentysix peter taking twentyseven poor putting lost james the hole peter was down in thirtythree but the pace was too hot for james he missed a twofoot putt for the half and they went to the fourth tee all square  the fourth hole follows the curve of the road on the other side of which are picturesque woods it presents no difficulties to the expert but it has pitfalls for the novice the dashing player stands for a slice while the more cautious are satisfied if they can clear the bunker that spans the fairway and lay their ball well out to the left whence an iron shot will take them to the green peter and james combined the two policies peter aimed to the left and got a slice and james also aiming to the left topped into the bunker peter realizing from experience the futility of searching for his ball in the woods drove a second which also disappeared into the jungle as did his third by the time he had joined james in the bunker he had played his sixth  it is the glorious uncertainty of golf that makes it the game it is the fact that james and peter lying side by side in the same bunker had played respectively one and six shots might have induced an unthinking observer to fancy the chances of the former and no doubt had he not taken seven strokes to extricate himself from the pit while his opponent by some act of god contrived to get out in two jamess chances might have been extremely rosy as it was the two men staggered out on to the fairway again with a score of eight apiece once past the bunker and round the bend of the road the hole becomes simple a judicious use of the cleek put peter on the green in fourteen while james with a braid iron reached it in twelve peter was down in seventeen and james contrived to halve it was only as he was leaving the hole that the latter discovered that he had been putting with his niblick which cannot have failed to exercise a prejudicial effect on his game these little incidents are bound to happen when one is in a nervous and highlystrung condition  the fifth and sixth holes produced no unusual features peter won the fifth in eleven and james the sixth in ten the short seventh they halved in nine the eighth always a tricky hole they took no liberties with james sinking a long putt with his twentythird just managing to halve a dingdong race up the hill for the ninth found james first at the pin and they finished the first nine with james one up  as they left the green james looked a little furtively at his companion  you might be strolling on to the tenth he said i want to get a few balls at the shop and my mashie wants fixing up i shant be long  ill come with you said peter  dont bother said james you go on and hold our place at the tee  i regret to say that james was lying his mashie was in excellent repair and he still had a dozen balls in his bag it being his prudent practice always to start out with eighteen no what he had said was mere subterfuge he wanted to go to his locker and snatch a few minutes with sandy macbeans how to become a scratch man he felt sure that one more glance at the photograph of mr macbean driving would give him the mastery of the stroke and so enable him to win the match in this i think he was a little sanguine the difficulty about sandy macbeans method of tuition was that he laid great stress on the fact that the ball should be directly in a line with a point exactly in the centre of the back of the players neck and so far jamess efforts to keep his eye on the ball and on the back of his neck simultaneously had produced no satisfactory results                                       it seemed to james when he joined peter on the tenth tee that the latters manner was strange he was pale there was a curious look in his eye  james old man he said  yes said james  while you were away i have been thinking james old man do you really love this girl  james stared a spasm of pain twisted peters face  suppose he said in a low voice she were not all youwethink she is  what do you mean  nothing nothing  miss forrester is an angel  yes yes quite so  i know what it is said james passionately youre trying to put me off my stroke you know that the least thing makes me lose my form  no no  you hope that you can take my mind off the game and make me go to pieces and then youll win the match  on the contrary said peter i intend to forfeit the match  james reeled  what  i give up  butbut james shook with emotion his voice quavered ah he cried i see now i understand you are doing this for me because i am your pal peter this is noble this is the sort of thing you read about in books ive seen it in the movies but i cant accept the sacrifice  you must  no no  i insist  do you mean this  i give her up james old man ii hope you will be happy  but i dont know what to say how can i thank you  dont thank me  but peter do you fully realize what you are doing true i am one up but there are nine holes to go and i am not right on my game today you might easily beat me have you forgotten that i once took fortyseven at the dogleg hole this may be one of my bad days do you understand that if you insist on giving up i shall go to miss forrester tonight and propose to her  i understand  and yet you stick to it that you are through  i do and but the way theres no need for you to wait till tonight i saw miss forrester just now outside the tennis court shes alone  james turned crimson  then i think perhaps  youd better go to her at once  i will james extended his hand peter old man i shall never forget this  thats all right  what are you going to do  now do you mean oh i shall potter round the second nine if you want me youll find me somewhere about  youll come to the wedding peter said james wistfully  of course said peter good luck  he spoke cheerily but when the other had turned to go he stood looking after him thoughtfully then he sighed a heavy sigh                                       james approached miss forrester with a beating heart she made a charming picture as she stood there in the sunlight one hand on her hip the other swaying a tennis racket  how do you do said james  how are you mr todd have you been playing golf  yes  with mr willard  yes we were having a match  golf said grace forrester seems to make men very rude mr willard left me without a word in the middle of our conversation  james was astonished  were you talking to peter  yes just now i cant understand what was the matter with him he just turned on his heel and swung off  you oughtnt to turn on your heel when you swing said james only on the ball of the foot  i beg your pardon  nothing nothing i wasnt thinking the fact is ive something on my mind so has peter you mustnt think too hardly of him we have been playing an important match and it must have got on his nerves you didnt happen by any chance to be watching us  no  ah i wish you had seen me at the lakehole i did it one under par  was your father playing  you dont understand i mean i did it in one better than even the finest player is supposed to do it its a mashieshot you know you mustnt play too light or you fall in the lake and you mustnt play it too hard or you go past the hole into the woods it requires the nicest delicacy and judgment such as i gave it you might have to wait a year before seeing anyone do it in two again i doubt if the pro often does it in two now directly we came to this hole today i made up my mind that there was going to be no mistake the great secret of any shot at golf is ease elegance and the ability to relax the majority of men you will find think it important that their address should be good  how snobbish what does it matter where a man lives  you dont absolutely follow me i refer to the waggle and the stance before you make the stroke most players seem to fix in their minds the appearance of the angles which are presented by the position of the arms legs and club shaft and it is largely the desire to retain these angles which results in their moving their heads and stiffening their muscles so that there is no freedom in the swing there is only one point which vitally affects the stroke and the only reason why that should be kept constant is that you are enabled to see your ball clearly that is the pivotal point marked at the base of the neck and a line drawn from this point to the ball should be at right angles to the line of flight  james paused for a moment for air and as he paused miss forrester spoke  this is all gibberish to me she said  gibberish gasped james i am quoting verbatim from one of the best authorities on golf  miss forrester swung her tennis racket irritably  golf she said bores me pallid i think it is the silliest game ever invented  the trouble about telling a story is that words are so feeble a means of depicting the supreme moments of life that is where the artist has the advantage over the historian were i an artist i should show james at this point falling backwards with his feet together and his eyes shut with a semicircular dotted line marking the progress of his flight and a few stars above his head to indicate moral collapse there are no words that can adequately describe the sheer black horror that froze the blood in his veins as this frightful speech smote his ears  he had never inquired into miss forresters religious views before but he had always assumed that they were sound and now here she was polluting the golden summer air with the most hideous blasphemy it would be incorrect to say that jamess love was turned to hate he did not hate grace the repulsion he felt was deeper than mere hate what he felt was not altogether loathing and not wholly pity it was a blend of the two  there was a tense silence the listening world stood still then without a word james todd turned and tottered away                                       peter was working moodily in the twelfth bunker when his friend arrived he looked up with a start then seeing that the other was alone he came forward hesitatingly  am i to congratulate you  james breathed a deep breath  you are he said on an escape  she refused you  she didnt get the chance old man have you ever sent one right up the edge of that bunker in front of the seventh and just not gone in  very rarely  i did once it was my second shot from a good lie with the light iron and i followed well through and thought i had gone just too far and when i walked up there was my ball on the edge of the bunker nicely teed up on a chunk of grass so that i was able to lay it dead with my mashieniblick holing out in six well what i mean to say is i feel now as i felt thenas if some unseen power had withheld me in time from some frightful disaster  i know just how you feel said peter gravely  peter old man that girl said golf bored her pallid she said she thought it was the silliest game ever invented he paused to mark the effect of his words peter merely smiled a faint wan smile you dont seem revolted said james  i am revolted but not surprised you see she said the same thing to me only a few minutes before  she did  it amounted to the same thing i had just been telling her how i did the lakehole today in two and she said that in her opinion golf was a game for children with water on the brain who werent athletic enough to play animal grab  the two men shivered in sympathy  there must be insanity in the family said james at last  that said peter is the charitable explanation  we were fortunate to find it out in time  we were  we mustnt run a risk like that again  never again  i think we had better take up golf really seriously it will keep us out of mischief  youre quite right we ought to do our four rounds a day regularly  in spring summer and autumn and in winter it would be rash not to practise most of the day at one of those indoor schools  we ought to be safe that way  peter old man said james ive been meaning to speak to you about it for some time ive got sandy macbeans new book and i think you ought to read it it is full of helpful hints  james  peter  silently the two men clasped hands james todd and peter willard were themselves again                                       and so said the oldest member we come back to our original startingpointto wit that while there is nothing to be said definitely against love your golfer should be extremely careful how he indulges in it it may improve his game or it may not but if he finds that there is any danger that it may notif the object of his affections is not the kind of girl who will listen to him with cheerful sympathy through the long evenings while he tells her illustrating stance and grip and swing with the kitchen poker each detail of the days roundthen i say unhesitatingly he had better leave it alone love has had a lot of pressagenting from the oldest times but there are higher nobler things than love a woman is only a woman but a hefty drive is a slosh     3  a mixed threesome   it was the holiday season and during the holidays the greens committees have decided that the payment of twenty guineas shall entitle fathers of families not only to infest the course themselves but also to decant their nearest and dearest upon it in whatever quantity they please all over the links in consequence happy laughing groups of children had broken out like a rash a wanfaced adult who had been held up for ten minutes while a drove of issue quarrelled over whether little claude had taken two hundred or two hundred and twenty approach shots to reach the ninth green sank into a seat beside the oldest member  what luck inquired the sage  none to speak of returned the other moodily i thought i had bagged a small boy in a lord fauntleroy suit on the sixth but he ducked these children make me tired they should be bowling their hoops in the road golf is a game for grownups how can a fellow play with a platoon of progeny blocking him at every hole  the oldest member shook his head he could not subscribe to these sentiments  no doubt said the oldest member the summer golfchild is from the point of view of the player who likes to get round the course in a single afternoon something of a trial but personally i confess it pleases me to see my fellow human beingsand into this category golfchildren though at the moment you may not be broadminded enough to admit it undoubtedly falltaking to the noblest of games at an early age golf like measles should be caught young for if postponed to riper years the results may be serious let me tell you the story of mortimer sturgis which illustrates what i mean rather aptly  mortimer sturgis when i first knew him was a carefree man of thirtyeight of amiable character and independent means which he increased from time to time by judicious ventures on the stock exchange although he had never played golf his had not been altogether an illspent life he swung a creditable racket at tennis was always ready to contribute a baritone solo to charity concerts and gave freely to the poor he was what you might call a goldenmean man goodhearted rather than magnetic with no serious vices and no heroic virtues for a hobby he had taken up the collecting of porcelain vases and he was engaged to betty weston a charming girl of twentyfive a lifelong friend of mine  i like mortimer everybody liked him but at the same time i was a little surprised that a girl like betty should have become engaged to him as i said before he was not magnetic and magnetism i thought was the chief quality she would have demanded in a man betty was one of those ardent vivid girls with an intense capacity for heroworship and i would have supposed that something more in the nature of a plumed knight or a corsair of the deep would have been her ideal but of course if there is a branch of modern industry where the demand is greater than the supply it is the manufacture of knights and corsairs and nowadays a girl however flaming her aspirations has to take the best she can get i must admit that betty seemed perfectly content with mortimer  such then was the state of affairs when eddie denton arrived and the trouble began  i was escorting betty home one evening after a teaparty at which we had been fellowguests when walking down the road we happened to espy mortimer he broke into a run when he saw us and galloped up waving a piece of paper in his hand he was plainly excited a thing which was unusual in this wellbalanced man his broad goodhumoured face was working violently  good news he cried good news dear old eddies back  oh how nice for you dear said betty eddie denton is mortimers best friend she explained to me he has told me so much about him i have been looking forward to his coming home mortie thinks the world of him  so will you when you know him cried mortimer dear old eddie hes a wonder the best fellow on earth we were at school and the varsity together theres nobody like eddie he landed yesterday just home from central africa hes an explorer you know he said to me spends all his time in places where its death for a white man to go  an explorer i heard betty breathe as if to herself i was not so impressed i fear as she was explorers as a matter of fact leave me a trifle cold it has always seemed to me that the difficulties of their life are greatly exaggeratedgenerally by themselves in a large country like africa for instance i should imagine that it was almost impossible for a man not to get somewhere if he goes on long enough give me the fellow who can plunge into the bowels of the earth at piccadilly circus and find the right tube train with nothing but a lot of misleading signs to guide him however we are not all constituted alike in this world and it was apparent from the flush on her cheek and the light in her eyes that betty admired explorers  i wired to him at once went on mortimer and insisted on his coming down here its two years since i saw him you dont know how i have looked forward dear to you and eddie meeting he is just your sort i know how romantic you are and keen on adventure and all that well you should hear eddie tell the story of how he brought down the bull bongo with his last cartridge after all the pongos or native bearers had fled into the dongo or undergrowth  i should love to whispered betty her eyes glowing i suppose to an impressionable girl these things really are of absorbing interest for myself bongos intrigue me even less than pongos while dongos frankly bore me when do you expect him  he will get my wire tonight im hoping we shall see the dear old fellow tomorrow afternoon some time how surprised old eddie will be to hear that im engaged hes such a confirmed bachelor himself he told me once that he considered the wisest thing ever said by human tongue was the swahili proverbwhoso taketh a woman into his kraal depositeth himself straightway in the wongo wongo he tells me is a sort of broth composed of herbs and meatbones corresponding to our soup you must get eddie to give it you in the original swahili it sounds even better  i saw the girls eyes flash and there came into her face that peculiar set expression which married men know it passed in an instant but not before it had given me material for thought which lasted me all the way to my house and into the silent watches of the night i was fond of mortimer sturgis and i could see trouble ahead for him as plainly as though i had been a palmist reading his hand at two guineas a visit there are other proverbs fully as wise as the one which mortimer had translated from the swahili and one of the wisest is that quaint old east london saying handed down from one generation of costermongers to another and whispered at midnight in the wigwams of the whelkseller never introduce your donah to a pal in those seven words is contained the wisdom of the ages i could read the future so plainly what but one thing could happen after mortimer had influenced bettys imagination with his stories of his friends romantic career and added the finishing touch by advertising him as a womanhater he might just as well have asked for his ring back at once my heart bled for mortimer                                i happened to call at his house on the second evening of the explorers visit and already the mischief had been done  denton was one of those lean hardbitten men with smouldering eyes and a brickred complexion he looked what he was the man of action and enterprise he had the wiry frame and strong jaw without which no explorer is complete and mortimer beside him seemed but a poor soft product of our hothouse civilization mortimer i forgot to say wore glasses and if there is one time more than another when a man should not wear glasses it is while a strongfaced keeneyed wanderer in the wilds is telling a beautiful girl the story of his adventures  for this was what denton was doing my arrival seemed to have interrupted him in the middle of narrative he shook my hand in a strong silent sort of way and resumed  well the natives seemed fairly friendly so i decided to stay the night  i made a mental note never to seem fairly friendly to an explorer if you do he always decides to stay the night  in the morning they took me down to the river at this point it widens into a kongo or pool and it was here they told me that the crocodile mostly lived subsisting on the native oxenthe shorthorned jongoswhich swept away by the current while crossing the ford above were carried down on the longos or rapids it was not however till the second evening that i managed to catch sight of his ugly snout above the surface i waited around and on the third day i saw him suddenly come out of the water and heave his whole length on to a sandbank in midstream and go to sleep in the sun he was certainly a monsterfully thirtyyou have never been in central africa have you miss weston no you ought to go therefully fifty feet from tip to tail there he lay glistening i shall never forget the sight  he broke off to light a cigarette i heard betty draw in her breath sharply mortimer was beaming through his glasses with the air of the owner of a dog which is astonishing a drawingroom with its clever tricks  and what did you do then mr denton asked betty breathlessly  yes what did you do then old chap said mortimer  denton blew out the match and dropped it on the ashtray  eh oh he said carelessly i swam across and shot him  swam across and shot him  yes it seemed to me that the chance was too good to be missed of course i might have had a pot at him from the bank but the chances were i wouldnt have hit him in a vital place so i swam across to the sandbank put the muzzle of my gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger i have rarely seen a crocodile so taken aback  but how dreadfully dangerous  oh danger eddie denton laughed lightly one drops into the habit of taking a few risks out there you know talking of danger the time when things really did look a little nasty was when the wounded gongo cornered me in a narrow tongo and i only had a pocketknife with everything in it broken except the corkscrew and the thing for taking stones out of horses hoofs it was like this  i could bear no more i am a tenderhearted man and i made some excuse and got away from the expression on the girls face i could see that it was only a question of days before she gave her heart to this romantic newcomer                                       as a matter of fact it was on the following afternoon that she called on me and told me that the worst had happened i had known her from a child you understand and she always confided her troubles to me  i want your advice she began im so wretched  she burst into tears i could see the poor girl was in a highly nervous condition so i did my best to calm her by describing how i had once done the long hole in four my friends tell me that there is no finer soporific and it seemed as though they may be right for presently just as i had reached the point where i laid my approachputt dead from a distance of fifteen feet she became quieter she dried her eyes yawned once or twice and looked at me bravely  i love eddie denton she said  i feared as much when did you feel this coming on  it crashed on me like a thunderbolt last night after dinner we were walking in the garden and he was just telling me how he had been bitten by a poisonous zongo when i seemed to go all giddy when i came to myself i was in eddies arms his face was pressed against mine and he was gargling  gargling  i thought so at first but he reassured me he was merely speaking in one of the lesserknown dialects of the wallawalla natives of eastern uganda into which he always drops in moments of great emotion he soon recovered sufficiently to give me a rough translation and then i knew that he loved me he kissed me i kissed him we kissed each other  and where was mortimer all this while  indoors cataloguing his collection of vases  for a moment i confess i was inclined to abandon mortimers cause a man i felt who could stay indoors cataloguing vases while his fiancee wandered in the moonlight with explorers deserved all that was coming to him i overcame the feeling  have you told him  of course not  you dont think it might be of interest to him  how can i tell him it would break his heart i am awfully fond of mortimer so is eddie we would both die rather than do anything to hurt him eddie is the soul of honour he agrees with me that mortimer must never know  then you arent going to break off your engagement  i couldnt eddie feels the same he says that unless something can be done he will say goodbye to me and creep far far away to some distant desert and there in the great stillness broken only by the cry of the prowling yongo try to forget  when you say unless something can be done what do you mean what can be done  i thought you might have something to suggest dont you think it possible that somehow mortimer might take it into his head to break the engagement himself  absurd he loves you devotedly  im afraid so only the other day i dropped one of his best vases and he just smiled and said it didnt matter  i can give you even better proof than that this morning mortimer came to me and asked me to give him secret lessons in golf  golf but he despises golf  exactly but he is going to learn it for your sake  but why secret lessons  because he wants to keep it a surprise for your birthday now can you doubt his love  i am not worthy of him she whispered  the words gave me an idea  suppose i said we could convince mortimer of that  i dont understand  suppose for instance he could be made to believe that you were let us say a dipsomaniac  she shook her head he knows that already  what  yes i told him i sometimes walked in my sleep  i mean a secret drinker  nothing will induce me to pretend to be a secret drinker  then a drugfiend i suggested hopefully  i hate medicine  i have it i said a kleptomaniac  what is that  a person who steals things  oh thats horrid  not at all its a perfectly ladylike thing to do you dont know you do it  but if i dont know i do it how do i know i do it  i beg your pardon  i mean how can i tell mortimer i do it if i dont know  you dont tell him i will tell him i will inform him tomorrow that you called on me this afternoon and stole my watch andi glanced about the roommy silver matchbox  id rather have that little vinaigrette  you dont get either i merely say you stole it what will happen  mortimer will hit you with a cleek  not at all i am an old man my white hairs protect me what he will do is to insist on confronting me with you and asking you to deny the foul charge  and then  then you admit it and release him from his engagement  she sat for a while in silence i could see that my words had made an impression  i think its a splendid idea thank you very much she rose and moved to the door i knew you would suggest something wonderful she hesitated you dont think it would make it sound more plausible if i really took the vinaigrette she added a little wistfully  it would spoil everything i replied firmly as i reached for the vinaigrette and locked it carefully in my desk  she was silent for a moment and her glance fell on the carpet that however did not worry me it was nailed down  well goodbye she said  au revoir i replied i am meeting mortimer at sixthirty tomorrow you may expect us round at your house at about eight                                       mortimer was punctual at the tryst next morning when i reached the tenth tee he was already there we exchanged a brief greeting and i handed him a driver outlined the essentials of grip and swing and bade him go to it  it seems a simple game he said as he took his stance youre sure its fair to have the ball sitting up on top of a young sandhill like this  perfectly fair  i mean i dont want to be coddled because im a beginner  the ball is always teed up for the drive i assured him  oh well if you say so but it seems to me to take all the element of sport out of the game where do i hit it  oh straight ahead  but isnt it dangerous i mean suppose i smash a window in that house over there  he indicated a charming bijou residence some five hundred yards down the fairway  in that case i replied the owner comes out in his pyjamas and offers you the choice between some nuts and a cigar  he seemed reassured and began to address the ball then he paused again  isnt there something you say before you start he asked five or something  you may say fore if it makes you feel any easier but it isnt necessary  if i am going to learn this silly game said mortimer firmly i am going to learn it right fore  i watched him curiously i never put a club into the hand of a beginner without something of the feeling of the sculptor who surveys a mass of shapeless clay i experience the emotions of a creator here i say to myself is a semisentient being into whose soulless carcass i am breathing life a moment before he was though technically living a mere clod a moment hence he will be a golfer  while i was still occupied with these meditations mortimer swung at the ball the club whizzing down brushed the surface of the rubber sphere toppling it off the tee and propelling it six inches with a slight slice on it  damnation said mortimer unravelling himself  i nodded approvingly his drive had not been anything to write to the golfing journals about but he was picking up the technique of the game  what happened then  i told him in a word  your stance was wrong and your grip was wrong and you moved your head and swayed your body and took your eye off the ball and pressed and forgot to use your wrists and swung back too fast and let the hands get ahead of the club and lost your balance and omitted to pivot on the ball of the left foot and bent your right knee  he was silent for a moment  there is more in this pastime he said than the casual observer would suspect  i have noticed and i suppose other people have noticed that in the golf education of every man there is a definite point at which he may be said to have crossed the dividing linethe rubicon as it werethat separates the golfer from the nongolfer this moment comes immediately after his first good drive in the ninety minutes in which i instructed mortimer sturgis that morning in the rudiments of the game he made every variety of drive known to science but it was not till we were about to leave that he made a good one  a moment before he had surveyed his blistered hands with sombre disgust  its no good he said i shall never learn this beast of a game and i dont want to either its only fit for lunatics wheres the sense in it hitting a rotten little ball with a stick if i want exercise ill take a stick and go and rattle it along the railings theres something in that well lets be getting along no good wasting the whole morning out here  try one more drive and then well go  all right if you like no sense in it though  he teed up the ball took a careless stance and flicked moodily there was a sharp crack the ball shot off the tee flew a hundred yards in a dead straight line never ten feet above the ground soared another seventy yards in a graceful arc struck the turf rolled and came to rest within easy mashie distance of the green  splendid i cried  the man seemed stunned  how did that happen  i told him very simply  your stance was right and your grip was right and you kept your head still and didnt sway your body and never took your eye off the ball and slowed back and let the arms come well through and rolled the wrists and let the clubhead lead and kept your balance and pivoted on the ball of the left foot and didnt duck the right knee  i see he said yes i thought that must be it  now lets go home  wait a minute i just want to remember what i did while its fresh in my mind let me see this was the way i stood or was it more like this no like this he turned to me beaming what a great idea it was my taking up golf its all nonsense what you read in the comic papers about people foozling all over the place and breaking clubs and all that youve only to exercise a little reasonable care and what a corking game it is nothing like it in the world i wonder if betty is up yet i must go round and show her how i did that drive a perfect swing with every ounce of weight wrist and muscle behind it i meant to keep it a secret from the dear girl till i had really learned but of course i have learned now lets go round and rout her out  he had given me my cue i put my hand on his shoulder and spoke sorrowfully  mortimer my boy i fear i have bad news for you  slow backkeep the head whats that bad news  about betty  about betty what about her dont sway the bodykeep the eye on the  prepare yourself for a shock my boy yesterday afternoon betty called to see me when she had gone i found that she had stolen my silver matchbox  stolen your matchbox  stolen my matchbox  oh well i dare say there were faults on both sides said mortimer tell me if i sway my body this time  you dont grasp what i have said do you realize that betty the girl you are going to marry is a kleptomaniac  a kleptomaniac  that is the only possible explanation think what this means my boy think how you will feel every time your wife says she is going out to do a little shopping think of yourself left alone at home watching the clock saying to yourself now she is lifting a pair of silk stockings now she is hiding gloves in her umbrella just about this moment she is getting away with a pearl necklace  would she do that  she would she could not help herself or rather she could not refrain from helping herself how about it my boy  it only draws us closer together he said  i was touched i own my scheme had failed but it had proved mortimer sturgis to be of pure gold he stood gazing down the fairway wrapped in thought  by the way he said meditatively i wonder if the dear girl ever goes to any of those salesthose auctionsales you know where youre allowed to inspect the things the day before they often have some pretty decent vases  he broke off and fell into a reverie                                       from this point onward mortimer sturgis proved the truth of what i said to you about the perils of taking up golf at an advanced age a lifetime of observing my fellowcreatures has convinced me that nature intended us all to be golfers in every human being the germ of golf is implanted at birth and suppression causes it to grow and grow tillit may be at forty fifty sixtyit suddenly bursts its bonds and sweeps over the victim like a tidal wave the wise man who begins to play in childhood is enabled to let the poison exude gradually from his system with no harmful results but a man like mortimer sturgis with thirtyeight golfless years behind him is swept off his feet he is carried away he loses all sense of proportion he is like the fly that happens to be sitting on the wall of the dam just when the crack comes  mortimer sturgis gave himself up without a struggle to an orgy of golf such as i have never witnessed in any man within two days of that first lesson he had accumulated a collection of clubs large enough to have enabled him to open a shop and he went on buying them at the rate of two and three a day on sundays when it was impossible to buy clubs he was like a lost spirit true he would do his regular four rounds on the day of rest but he never felt happy the thought as he sliced into the rough that the patent woodenfaced cleek which he intended to purchase next morning might have made all the difference completely spoiled his enjoyment  i remember him calling me up on the telephone at three oclock one morning to tell me that he had solved the problem of putting he intended in future he said to use a croquet mallet and he wondered that no one had ever thought of it before the sound of his broken groan when i informed him that croquet mallets were against the rules haunted me for days  his golf library kept pace with his collection of clubs he bought all the standard works subscribed to all the golfing papers and when he came across a paragraph in a magazine to the effect that mr hutchings an examateur champion did not begin to play till he was past forty and that his opponent in the final mr s h fry had never held a club till his thirtyfifth year he had it engraved on vellum and framed and hung up beside his shavingmirror                                       and betty meanwhile she poor child stared down the years into a bleak future in which she saw herself parted for ever from the man she loved and the golfwidow of another for whomeven when he won a medal for lowest net at a weekly handicap with a score of a hundred and three minus twentyfourshe could feel nothing warmer than respect those were dreary days for betty we threeshe and i and eddie dentonoften talked over mortimers strange obsession denton said that except that mortimer had not come out in pink spots his symptoms were almost identical with those of the dreaded mongomongo the scourge of the west african hinterland poor denton he had already booked his passage for africa and spent hours looking in the atlas for good deserts  in every fever of human affairs there comes at last the crisis we may emerge from it healed or we may plunge into still deeper depths of soulsickness but always the crisis comes i was privileged to be present when it came in the affairs of mortimer sturgis and betty weston  i had gone into the clubhouse one afternoon at an hour when it is usually empty and the first thing i saw as i entered the main room which looks out on the ninth green was mortimer he was grovelling on the floor and i confess that when i caught sight of him my heart stood still i feared that his reason sapped by dissipation had given way i knew that for weeks day in and day out the niblick had hardly ever been out of his hand and no constitution can stand that  he looked up as he heard my footstep  hallo he said can you see a ball anywhere  a ball i backed away reaching for the doorhandle my dear boy i said soothingly you have made a mistake quite a natural mistake one anybody would have made but as a matter of fact this is the clubhouse the links are outside there why not come away with me very quietly and let us see if we cant find some balls on the links if you will wait here a moment i will call up doctor smithson he was telling me only this morning that he wanted a good spell of ballhunting to put him in shape you dont mind if he joins us  it was a silver king with my initials on it mortimer went on not heeding me i got on the ninth green in eleven with a nice mashieniblick but my approachputt was a little too strong it came in through that window  i perceived for the first time that one of the windows facing the course was broken and my relief was great i went down on my knees and helped him in his search we ran the ball to earth finally inside the piano  whats the local rule inquired mortimer must i play it where it lies or may i tee up and lose a stroke if i have to play it where it lies i suppose a niblick would be the club  it was at this moment that betty came in one glance at her pale set face told me that there was to be a scene and i would have retired but that she was between me and the door  hallo dear said mortimer greeting her with a friendly waggle of his niblick im bunkered in the piano my approachputt was a little strong and i overran the green  mortimer said the girl tensely i want to ask you one question  yes dear i wish darling you could have seen my drive at the eighth just now it was a pip  betty looked at him steadily  are we engaged she said or are we not  engaged oh to be married why of course i tried the open stance for a change and  this morning you promised to take me for a ride you never appeared where were you  just playing golf  golf im sick of the very name  a spasm shook mortimer  you mustnt let people hear you saying things like that he said i somehow felt the moment i began my upswing that everything was going to be all right i  ill give you one more chance will you take me for a drive in your car this evening  i cant  why not what are you doing  just playing golf  im tired of being neglected like this cried betty stamping her foot poor girl i saw her point of view it was bad enough for her being engaged to the wrong man without having him treat her as a mere acquaintance her conscience fighting with her love for eddie denton had kept her true to mortimer and mortimer accepted the sacrifice with an absentminded carelessness which would have been galling to any girl we might just as well not be engaged at all you never take me anywhere  i asked you to come with me to watch the open championship  why dont you ever take me to dances  i cant dance  you could learn  but im not sure if dancing is a good thing for a fellows game you never hear of any firstclass pro dancing james braid doesnt dance  well my minds made up mortimer you must choose between golf and me  but darling i went round in a hundred and one yesterday you cant expect a fellow to give up golf when hes at the top of his game  very well i have nothing more to say our engagement is at an end  dont throw me over betty pleaded mortimer and there was that in his voice which cut me to the heart youll make me so miserable and when im miserable i always slice my approach shots  betty weston drew herself up her face was hard  here is your ring she said and swept from the room                                       for a moment after she had gone mortimer remained very still looking at the glistening circle in his hand i stole across the room and patted his shoulder  bear up my boy bear up i said  he looked at me piteously  stymied he muttered  be brave  he went on speaking as if to himself  i had picturedah how often i had picturedour little home hers and mine she sewing in her armchair i practising putts on the hearthrug he choked while in the corner little harry vardon sturgis played with little j h taylor sturgis and round the roomreading busy with their childish taskslittle george duncan sturgis abe mitchell sturgis harold hilton sturgis edward ray sturgis horace hutchinson sturgis and little james braid sturgis  my boy my boy i cried  whats the matter  werent you giving yourself rather a large family  he shook his head moodily  was i he said dully i dont know whats bogey  there was a silence  and yet he said at last in a low voice he paused an odd bright look had come into his eyes he seemed suddenly to be himself again the old happy mortimer sturgis i had known so well and yet he said who knows perhaps it is all for the best they might all have turned out tennisplayers he raised his niblick again his face aglow playing thirteen he said i think the game here would be to chip out through the door and work round the clubhouse to the green dont you                                       little remains to be told betty and eddie have been happily married for years mortimers handicap is now down to eighteen and he is improving all the time he was not present at the wedding being unavoidably detained by a medal tournament but if you turn up the files and look at the list of presents which were both numerous and costly you will seesomewhere in the middle of the column the words    sturgis j mortimer     two dozen silver king golfballs and one patent sturgis          aluminium selfadjusting selfcompensating puttingcleek     4  sundered hearts   in the smokingroom of the clubhouse a cheerful fire was burning and the oldest member glanced from time to time out of the window into the gathering dusk snow was falling lightly on the links from where he sat the oldest member had a good view of the ninth green and presently out of the greyness of the december evening there appeared over the brow of the hill a golfball it trickled across the green and stopped within a yard of the hole the oldest member nodded approvingly a good approachshot  a young man in a tweed suit clambered on to the green holed out with easy confidence and shouldering his bag made his way to the clubhouse a few moments later he entered the smokingroom and uttered an exclamation of rapture at the sight of the fire  im frozen stiff  he rang for a waiter and ordered a hot drink the oldest member gave a gracious assent to the suggestion that he should join him  i like playing in winter said the young man you get the course to yourself for the world is full of slackers who only turn out when the weather suits them i cannot understand where they get the nerve to call themselves golfers  not everyone is as keen as you are my boy said the sage dipping gratefully into his hot drink if they were the world would be a better place and we should hear less of all this modern unrest  i am pretty keen admitted the young man  i have only encountered one man whom i could describe as keener i allude to mortimer sturgis  the fellow who took up golf at thirtyeight and let the girl he was engaged to marry go off with someone else because he hadnt the time to combine golf with courtship i remember you were telling me about him the other day  there is a sequel to that story if you would care to hear it said the oldest member  you have the honour said the young man go ahead                                       some people began the oldest member considered that mortimer sturgis was too wrapped up in golf and blamed him for it i could never see eye to eye with them in the days of king arthur nobody thought the worse of a young knight if he suspended all his social and business engagements in favour of a search for the holy grail in the middle ages a man could devote his whole life to the crusades and the public fawned upon him why then blame the man of today for a zealous attention to the modern equivalent the quest of scratch mortimer sturgis never became a scratch player but he did eventually get his handicap down to nine and i honour him for it  the story which i am about to tell begins in what might be called the middle period of sturgiss career he had reached the stage when his handicap was a wobbly twelve and as you are no doubt aware it is then that a man really begins to golf in the true sense of the word mortimers fondness for the game until then had been merely tepid compared with what it became now he had played a little before but now he really buckled to and got down to it it was at this point too that he began once more to entertain thoughts of marriage a profound statistician in this one department he had discovered that practically all the finest exponents of the art are married men and the thought that there might be something in the holy state which improved a mans game and that he was missing a good thing troubled him a great deal moreover the paternal instinct had awakened in him as he justly pointed out whether marriage improved your game or not it was to old tom morriss marriage that the existence of young tommy morris winner of the british open championship four times in succession could be directly traced in fact at the age of fortytwo mortimer sturgis was in just the frame of mind to take some nice girl aside and ask her to become a stepmother to his eleven drivers his baffy his twentyeight putters and the rest of the ninetyfour clubs which he had accumulated in the course of his golfing career the sole stipulation of course which he made when dreaming his daydreams was that the future mrs sturgis must be a golfer i can still recall the horror in his face when one girl admirable in other respects said that she had never heard of harry vardon and didnt he mean dolly vardon she has since proved an excellent wife and mother but mortimer sturgis never spoke to her again  with the coming of january it was mortimers practice to leave england and go to the south of france where there was sunshine and crisp dry turf he pursued his usual custom this year with his suitcase and his ninetyfour clubs he went off to saint brule staying as he always did at the hotel superbe where they knew him and treated with an amiable tolerance his habit of practising chipshots in his bedroom on the first evening after breaking a statuette of the infant samuel in prayer he dressed and went down to dinner and the first thing he saw was her  mortimer sturgis as you know had been engaged before but betty weston had never inspired the tumultuous rush of emotion which the mere sight of this girl had set loose in him he told me later that just to watch her holing out her soup gave him a sort of feeling you get when your drive collides with a rock in the middle of a tangle of rough and kicks back into the middle of the fairway if golf had come late in life to mortimer sturgis love came later still and just as the golf attacking him in middle life had been some golf so was the love considerable love mortimer finished his dinner in a trance which is the best way to do it at some hotels and then scoured the place for someone who would introduce him he found such a person eventually and the meeting took place                                       she was a small and rather fragilelooking girl with big blue eyes and a cloud of golden hair she had a sweet expression and her left wrist was in a sling she looked up at mortimer as if she had at last found something that amounted to something i am inclined to think it was a case of love at first sight on both sides  fine weather were having said mortimer who was a capital conversationalist  yes said the girl  i like fine weather  so do i  theres something about fine weather  yes  itsitswell fine weathers so much finer than weather that isnt fine said mortimer  he looked at the girl a little anxiously fearing he might be taking her out of her depth but she seemed to have followed his train of thought perfectly  yes isnt it she said its soso fine  thats just what i meant said mortimer so fine youve just hit it  he was charmed the combination of beauty with intelligence is so rare  i see youve hurt your wrist he went on pointing to the sling  yes i strained it a little playing in the championship  the championship mortimer was interested its awfully rude of me he said apologetically but i didnt catch your name just now  my name is somerset  mortimer had been bending forward solicitously he overbalanced and nearly fell off his chair the shock had been stunning even before he had met and spoken to her he had told himself that he loved this girl with the storedup love of a lifetime and she was mary somerset the hotel lobby danced before mortimers eyes  the name will of course be familiar to you in the early rounds of the ladies open golf championship of that year nobody had paid much attention to mary somerset she had survived her first two matches but her opponents had been nonentities like herself and then in the third round she had met and defeated the champion from that point on her name was on everybodys lips she became favourite and she justified the public confidence by sailing into the final and winning easily and here she was talking to him like an ordinary person and if he could read the message in her eyes not altogether indifferent to his charms if you could call them that  golly said mortimer awed                                       their friendship ripened rapidly as friendships do in the south of france in that favoured clime you find the girl and nature does the rest on the second morning of their acquaintance mortimer invited her to walk round the links with him and watch him play he did it a little diffidently for his golf was not of the calibre that would be likely to extort admiration from a champion on the other hand one should never let slip the opportunity of acquiring wrinkles on the game and he thought that miss somerset if she watched one or two of his shots might tell him just what he ought to do and sure enough the opening arrived on the fourth hole where mortimer after a drive which surprised even himself found his ball in a nasty cuppy lie  he turned to the girl  what ought i to do here he asked  miss somerset looked at the ball she seemed to be weighing the matter in her mind  give it a good hard knock she said  mortimer knew what she meant she was advocating a full iron the only trouble was that when he tried anything more ambitious than a halfswing except off the tee he almost invariably topped however he could not fail this wonderful girl so he swung well back and took a chance his enterprise was rewarded the ball flew out of the indentation in the turf as cleanly as though john henry taylor had been behind it and rolled looking neither to left nor to right straight for the pin a few moments later mortimer sturgis had holed out one under bogey and it was only the fear that having known him for so short a time she might be startled and refuse him that kept him from proposing then and there this exhibition of golfing generalship on her part had removed his last doubts he knew that if he lived for ever there could be no other girl in the world for him with her at his side what might he not do he might get his handicap down to sixto threeto scratchto plus something good heavens why even the amateur championship was not outside the range of possibility mortimer sturgis shook his putter solemnly in the air and vowed a silent vow that he would win this pearl among women  now when a man feels like that it is impossible to restrain him long for a week mortimer sturgiss soul sizzled within him then he could contain himself no longer one night at one of the informal dances at the hotel he drew the girl out on to the moonlit terrace  miss somerset he began stuttering with emotion like an imperfectlycorked bottle of gingerbeer miss somersetmay i call you mary  the girl looked at him with eyes that shone softly in the dim light  mary she repeated why of course if you like  if i like cried mortimer dont you know that it is my dearest wish dont you know that i would rather be permitted to call you mary than do the first hole at muirfield in two oh mary how i have longed for this moment i love you i love you ever since i met you i have known that you were the one girl in this vast world whom i would die to win mary will you be mine shall we go round together will you fix up a match with me on the links of life which shall end only when the grim reaper lays us both a stymie  she drooped towards him  mortimer she murmured  he held out his arms then drew back his face had grown suddenly tense and there were lines of pain about his mouth  wait he said in a strained voice mary i love you dearly and because i love you so dearly i cannot let you trust your sweet life to me blindly i have a confession to make i am noti have not always beenhe pauseda good man he said in a low voice  she started indignantly  how can you say that you are the best the kindest the bravest man i have ever met who but a good man would have risked his life to save me from drowning  drowning mortimers voice seemed perplexed you what do you mean  have you forgotten the time when i fell in the sea last week and you jumped in with all your clothes on  of course yes said mortimer i remember now it was the day i did the long seventh in five i got off a good teeshot straight down the fairway took a baffy for my second and but that is not the point it is sweet and generous of you to think so highly of what was the merest commonplace act of ordinary politeness but i must repeat that judged by the standards of your snowy purity i am not a good man i do not come to you clean and spotless as a young girl should expect her husband to come to her once playing in a foursome my ball fell in some long grass nobody was near me we had no caddies and the others were on the fairway god knows his voice shook god knows i struggled against the temptation but i fell i kicked the ball on to a little bare mound from which it was an easy task with a nice halfmashie to reach the green for a snappy seven mary there have been times when going round by myself i have allowed myself tenfoot putts on three holes in succession simply in order to be able to say i had done the course in under a hundred ah you shrink from me you are disgusted  im not disgusted and i dont shrink i only shivered because it is rather cold  then you can love me in spite of my past  mortimer  she fell into his arms  my dearest he said presently what a happy life ours will be that is if you do not find that you have made a mistake  a mistake she cried scornfully  well my handicap is twelve you know and not so darned twelve at that there are days when i play my second from the fairway of the next hole but one days when i couldnt putt into a coalhole with welcome written over it and you are a ladies open champion still if you think its all right oh mary you little know how i have dreamed of some day marrying a really firstclass golfer yes that was my visionof walking up the aisle with some sweet plus two girl on my arm you shivered again you are catching cold  it is a little cold said the girl she spoke in a small voice  let me take you in sweetheart said mortimer ill just put you in a comfortable chair with a nice cup of coffee and then i think i really must come out again and tramp about and think how perfectly splendid everything is                                       they were married a few weeks later very quietly in the little village church of saint brule the secretary of the local golfclub acted as best man for mortimer and a girl from the hotel was the only bridesmaid the whole business was rather a disappointment to mortimer who had planned out a somewhat florid ceremony at st georges hanover square with the vicar of tooting a scratch player excellent at short approach shots officiating and the voice that breathed oer st andrews boomed from the organ he had even had the idea of copying the military wedding and escorting his bride out of the church under an arch of crossed cleeks but she would have none of this pomp she insisted on a quiet wedding and for the honeymoon trip preferred a tour through italy mortimer who had wanted to go to scotland to visit the birthplace of james braid yielded amiably for he loved her dearly but he did not think much of italy in rome the great monuments of the past left him cold of the temple of vespasian all he thought was that it would be a devil of a place to be bunkered behind the colosseum aroused a faint spark of interest in him as he speculated whether abe mitchell would use a full brassey to carry it in florence the view over the tuscan hills from the torre rosa fiesole over which his bride waxed enthusiastic seemed to him merely a nasty bit of rough which would take a deal of getting out if  and so in the fullness of time they came home to mortimers cosy little house adjoining the links                                       mortimer was so busy polishing his ninetyfour clubs on the evening of their arrival that he failed to notice that his wife was preoccupied a less busy man would have perceived at a glance that she was distinctly nervous she started at sudden noises and once when he tried the newest of his mashieniblicks and broke one of the drawingroom windows she screamed sharply in short her manner was strange and if edgar allen poe had put her into the fall of the house of usher she would have fitted it like the paper on the wall she had the air of one waiting tensely for the approach of some imminent doom mortimer humming gaily to himself as he sandpapered the blade of his twentysecond putter observed none of this he was thinking of the morrows play  your wrists quite well again now darling isnt it he said  yes yes quite well  fine said mortimer well breakfast earlysay at halfpast sevenand then well be able to get in a couple of rounds before lunch a couple more in the afternoon will about see us through one doesnt want to overgolf oneself the first day he swung the putter joyfully how had we better play do you think we might start with you giving me a half  she did not speak she was very pale she clutched the arm of her chair tightly till the knuckles showed white under the skin  to anybody but mortimer her nervousness would have been even more obvious on the following morning as they reached the first tee her eyes were dull and heavy and she started when a grasshopper chirruped but mortimer was too occupied with thinking how jolly it was having the course to themselves to notice anything  he scooped some sand out of the box and took a ball out of her bag his wedding present to her had been a brandnew golfbag six dozen balls and a full set of the most expensive clubs all born in scotland  do you like a high tee he asked  oh no she replied coming with a start out of her thoughts doctors say its indigestible  mortimer laughed merrily  deuced good he chuckled is that your own or did you read it in a comic paper there you are he placed the ball on a little hill of sand and got up now lets see some of that championship form of yours  she burst into tears  my darling  mortimer ran to her and put his arms round her she tried weakly to push him away  my angel what is it  she sobbed brokenly then with an effort she spoke  mortimer i have deceived you  deceived me  i have never played golf in my life i dont even know how to hold the caddie  mortimers heart stood still this sounded like the gibberings of an unbalanced mind and no man likes his wife to begin gibbering immediately after the honeymoon  my precious you are not yourself  i am thats the whole trouble im myself and not the girl you thought i was  mortimer stared at her puzzled he was thinking that it was a little difficult and that to work it out properly he would need a pencil and a bit of paper  my name is not mary  but you said it was  i didnt you asked if you could call me mary and i said you might because i loved you too much to deny your smallest whim i was going on to say that it wasnt my name but you interrupted me  not mary the horrid truth was coming home to mortimer you were not mary somerset  mary is my cousin my name is mabel  but you said you had sprained your wrist playing in the championship  so i had the mallet slipped in my hand  the mallet mortimer clutched at his forehead you didnt say the mallet  yes mortimer the mallet  a faint blush of shame mantled her cheek and into her blue eyes there came a look of pain but she faced him bravely  i am the ladies open croquet champion she whispered  mortimer sturgis cried aloud a cry that was like the shriek of some wounded animal  croquet he gulped and stared at her with unseeing eyes he was no prude but he had those decent prejudices of which no selfrespecting man can wholly rid himself however broadminded he may try to be croquet  there was a long silence the light breeze sang in the pines above them the grasshoppers chirrupped at their feet  she began to speak again in a low monotonous voice  i blame myself i should have told you before while there was yet time for you to withdraw i should have confessed this to you that night on the terrace in the moonlight but you swept me off my feet and i was in your arms before i realized what you would think of me it was only then that i understood what my supposed skill at golf meant to you and then it was too late i loved you too much to let you go i could not bear the thought of you recoiling from me oh i was madmad i knew that i could not keep up the deception for ever that you must find me out in time but i had a wild hope that by then we should be so close to one another that you might find it in your heart to forgive but i was wrong i see it now there are some things that no man can forgive some things she repeated dully which no man can forgive  she turned away mortimer awoke from his trance  stop he cried dont go  i must go  i want to talk this over  she shook her head sadly and started to walk slowly across the sunlit grass mortimer watched her his brain in a whirl of chaotic thoughts she disappeared through the trees  mortimer sat down on the teebox and buried his face in his hands for a time he could think of nothing but the cruel blow he had received this was the end of those rainbow visions of himself and her going through life side by side she lovingly criticizing his stance and his backswing he learning wisdom from her a croquetplayer he was married to a woman who hit coloured balls through hoops mortimer sturgis writhed in torment a strong mans agony  the mood passed how long it had lasted he did not know but suddenly as he sat there he became once more aware of the glow of the sunshine and the singing of the birds it was as if a shadow had lifted hope and optimism crept into his heart  he loved her he loved her still she was part of him and nothing that she could do had power to alter that she had deceived him yes but why had she deceived him because she loved him so much that she could not bear to lose him dash it all it was a bit of a compliment  and after all poor girl was it her fault was it not rather the fault of her upbringing probably she had been taught to play croquet when a mere child hardly able to distinguish right from wrong no steps had been taken to eradicate the virus from her system and the thing had become chronic could she be blamed was she not more to be pitied than censured  mortimer rose to his feet his heart swelling with generous forgiveness the black horror had passed from him the future seemed once more bright it was not too late she was still young many years younger than he himself had been when he took up golf and surely if she put herself into the hands of a good specialist and practised every day she might still hope to become a fair player he reached the house and ran in calling her name  no answer came he sped from room to room but all were empty  she had gone the house was there the furniture was there the canary sang in its cage the cook in the kitchen the pictures still hung on the walls but she had gone everything was at home except his wife  finally propped up against the cup he had once won in a handicap competition he saw a letter with a sinking heart he tore open the envelope  it was a pathetic a tragic letter the letter of a woman endeavouring to express all the anguish of a torn heart with one of those fountainpens which suspend the flow of ink about twice in every three words the gist of it was that she felt she had wronged him that though he might forgive he could never forget and that she was going away away out into the world alone  mortimer sank into a chair and stared blankly before him she had scratched the match                                       i am not a married man myself so have had no experience of how it feels to have ones wife whizz off silently into the unknown but i should imagine that it must be something like taking a full swing with a brassey and missing the ball something i take it of the same sense of mingled shock chagrin and the feeling that nobody loves one which attacks a man in such circumstances must come to the bereaved husband and one can readily understand how terribly the incident must have shaken mortimer sturgis i was away at the time but i am told by those who saw him that his game went all to pieces  he had never shown much indication of becoming anything in the nature of a firstclass golfer but he had managed to acquire one or two decent shots his work with the light iron was not at all bad and he was a fairly steady putter but now under the shadow of this tragedy he dropped right back to the form of his earliest period it was a pitiful sight to see this gaunt haggard man with the look of dumb anguish behind his spectacles taking as many as three shots sometimes to get past the ladies tee his slice of which he had almost cured himself returned with such virulence that in the list of ordinary hazards he had now to include the teebox and when he was not slicing he was pulling i have heard that he was known when driving at the sixth to get bunkered in his own caddie who had taken up his position directly behind him as for the deep sandtrap in front of the seventh green he spent so much of his time in it that there was some informal talk among the members of the committee of charging him a small weekly rent  a man of comfortable independent means he lived during these days on next to nothing golfballs cost him a certain amount but the bulk of his income he spent in efforts to discover his wifes whereabouts he advertised in all the papers he employed private detectives he even much as it revolted his finer instincts took to travelling about the country watching croquet matches but she was never among the players i am not sure that he did not find a melancholy comfort in this for it seemed to show that whatever his wife might be and whatever she might be doing she had not gone right under  summer passed autumn came and went winter arrived the days grew bleak and chill and an early fall of snow heavier than had been known at that time of the year for a long while put an end to golf mortimer spent his days indoors staring gloomily through the window at the white mantle that covered the earth  it was christmas eve                                       the young man shifted uneasily on his seat his face was long and sombre  all this is very depressing he said  these soul tragedies agreed the oldest member are never very cheery  look here said the young man firmly tell me one thing frankly as man to man did mortimer find her dead in the snow covered except for her face on which still lingered that faint sweet smile which he remembered so well because if he did im going home  no no protested the oldest member nothing of that kind  youre sure you arent going to spring it on me suddenly  no no  the young man breathed a relieved sigh  it was your saying that about the white mantle covering the earth that made me suspicious  the sage resumed                                       it was christmas eve all day the snow had been falling and now it lay thick and deep over the countryside mortimer sturgis his frugal dinner concludedwhat with losing his wife and not being able to get any golf he had little appetite these dayswas sitting in his drawingroom moodily polishing the blade of his jigger soon wearying of this once congenial task he laid down the club and went to the front door to see if there was any chance of a thaw but no it was freezing the snow as he tested it with his shoe crackled crisply the sky above was black and full of cold stars it seemed to mortimer that the sooner he packed up and went to the south of france the better he was just about to close the door when suddenly he thought he heard his own name called  mortimer  had he been mistaken the voice had sounded faint and far away  mortimer  he thrilled from head to foot this time there could be no mistake it was the voice he knew so well his wifes voice and it had come from somewhere down near the gardengate it is difficult to judge distance where sounds are concerned but mortimer estimated that the voice had spoken about a short mashieniblick and an easy putt from where he stood  the next moment he was racing down the snowcovered path and then his heart stood still what was that dark something on the ground just inside the gate he leaped towards it he passed his hands over it it was a human body quivering he struck a match it went out he struck another that went out too he struck a third and it burnt with a steady flame and stooping he saw that it was his wife who lay there cold and stiff her eyes were closed and on her face still lingered that faint sweet smile which he remembered so well                                       the young man rose with a set face he reached for his golfbag  i call that a dirty trick he said after you promised the sage waved him back to his seat  have no fear she had only fainted  you said she was cold  wouldnt you be cold if you were lying in the snow  and stiff  mrs sturgis was stiff because the trainservice was bad it being the holidayseason and she had had to walk all the way from the junction a distance of eight miles sit down and allow me to proceed                                       tenderly reverently mortimer sturgis picked her up and began to bear her into the house halfway there his foot slipped on a piece of ice and he fell heavily barking his shin and shooting his lovely burden out on to the snow  the fall brought her to she opened her eyes  mortimer darling she said  mortimer had just been going to say something else but he checked himself  are you alive he asked  yes she replied  thank god said mortimer scooping some of the snow out of the back of his collar  together they went into the house and into the drawingroom wife gazed at husband husband at wife there was a silence  rotten weather said mortimer  yes isnt it  the spell was broken they fell into each others arms and presently they were sitting side by side on the sofa holding hands just as if that awful parting had been but a dream  it was mortimer who made the first reference to it  i say you know he said you oughtnt to have nipped away like that  i thought you hated me  hated you i love you better than life itself i would sooner have smashed my pet driver than have had you leave me  she thrilled at the words  darling  mortimer fondled her hand  i was just coming back to tell you that i loved you still i was going to suggest that you took lessons from some good professional and i found you gone  i wasnt worthy of you mortimer  my angel he pressed his lips to her hair and spoke solemnly all this has taught me a lesson dearest i knew all along and i know it more than ever now that it is youyou that i want just you i dont care if you dont play golf i dont care he hesitated then went on manfully i dont care even if you play croquet so long as you are with me  for a moment her face showed rapture that made it almost angelic she uttered a low moan of ecstasy she kissed him then she rose  mortimer look  what at  me just look  the jigger which he had been polishing lay on a chair close by she took it up from the bowl of golfballs on the mantelpiece she selected a brand new one she placed it on the carpet she addressed it then with a merry cry of fore she drove it hard and straight through the glass of the chinacupboard  good god cried mortimer astounded it had been a bird of a shot  she turned to him her whole face alight with that beautiful smile  when i left you mortie she said i had but one aim in life somehow to make myself worthy of you i saw your advertisements in the papers and i longed to answer them but i was not ready all this long weary while i have been in the village of auchtermuchtie in scotland studying under tamms mcmickle  not the tamms mcmickle who finished fourth in the open championship of 1911 and had the best ball in the foursome in 1912 with jock mchaggis andy mcheather and sandy mchoots  yes mortimer the very same oh it was difficult at first i missed my mallet and long to steady the ball with my foot and use the toe of the club wherever there was a direction post i aimed at it automatically but i conquered my weakness i practised steadily and now mr mcmickle says my handicap would be a good twentyfour on any links she smiled apologetically of course that doesnt sound much to you you were a twelve when i left you and now i suppose you are down to eight or something  mortimer shook his head  alas no he replied gravely my game went right off for some reason or other and im twentyfour too  for some reason or other she uttered a cry oh i know what the reason was how can i ever forgive myself i have ruined your game  the brightness came back to mortimers eyes he embraced her fondly  do not reproach yourself dearest he murmured it is the best thing that could have happened from now on we start level two hearts that beat as one two drivers that drive as one i could not wish it otherwise by george its just like that thing of tennysons  he recited the lines softly                   my bride     my wife my life oh we will walk the links     yoked in all exercise of noble end     and so thro those dark bunkers off the course     that no man knows indeed i love thee come     yield thyself up our handicaps are one     accomplish thou my manhood and thyself     lay thy sweet hands in mine and trust to me  she laid her hands in his  and now mortie darling she said i want to tell you all about how i did the long twelfth at auchtermuchtie in one under bogey     5  the salvation of george mackintosh   the young man came into the clubhouse there was a frown on his usually cheerful face and he ordered a gingerale in the sort of voice which an ancient greek would have used when asking the executioner to bring on the hemlock  sunk in the recesses of his favourite settee the oldest member had watched him with silent sympathy  how did you get on he inquired  he beat me  the oldest member nodded his venerable head  you have had a trying time if i am not mistaken i feared as much when i saw you go out with pobsley how many a young man have i seen go out with herbert pobsley exulting in his youth and crawl back at eventide looking like a toad under the harrow he talked  all the time confound it put me right off my stroke  the oldest member sighed  the talking golfer is undeniably the most pronounced pest of our complex modern civilization he said and the most difficult to deal with it is a melancholy thought that the noblest of games should have produced such a scourge i have frequently marked herbert pobsley in action as the crackling of thorns under a pot he is almost as bad as poor george mackintosh in his worst period did i ever tell you about george mackintosh  i dont think so  his said the sage is the only case of golfing garrulity i have ever known where a permanent cure was affected if you would care to hear about it                                       george mackintosh said the oldest member when i first knew him was one of the most admirable young fellows i have ever met a handsome wellsetup man with no vices except a tendency to use the mashie for shots which should have been made with the light iron and as for his positive virtues they were too numerous to mention he never swayed his body moved his head or pressed he was always ready to utter a tactful grunt when his opponent foozled and when he himself achieved a glaring fluke his selfreproachful click of the tongue was music to his adversarys bruised soul but of all his virtues the one that most endeared him to me and to all thinking men was the fact that from the start of a round to the finish he never spoke a word except when absolutely compelled to do so by the exigencies of the game and it was this man who subsequently for a black period which lives in the memory of all his contemporaries was known as gabby george and became a shade less popular than the germ of spanish influenza truly corruptio optimi pessima  one of the things that sadden a man as he grows older and reviews his life is the reflection that his most devastating deeds were generally the ones which he did with the best motives the thought is disheartening i can honestly say that when george mackintosh came to me and told me his troubles my sole desire was to ameliorate his lot that i might be starting on the downward path a man whom i liked and respected never once occurred to me  one night after dinner when george mackintosh came in i could see at once that there was something on his mind but what this could be i was at a loss to imagine for i had been playing with him myself all the afternoon and he had done an eightyone and a seventynine and as i had not left the links till dusk was beginning to fall it was practically impossible that he could have gone out again and done badly the idea of financial trouble seemed equally out of the question george had a good job with the oldestablished legal firm of peabody peabody peabody peabody cootes toots and peabody the third alternative that he might be in love i rejected at once in all the time i had known him i had never seen a sign that george mackintosh gave a thought to the opposite sex  yet this bizarre as it seemed was the true solution scarcely had he seated himself and lit a cigar when he blurted out his confession  what would you do in a case like this he said  like what  well he choked and a rich blush permeated his surface well it seems a silly thing to say and all that but im in love with miss tennant you know  you are in love with celia tennant  of course i am ive got eyes havent i who else is there that any sane man could possibly be in love with that he went on moodily is the whole trouble theres a field of about twentynine and i should think my place in the betting is about thirtythree to one  i cannot agree with you there i said you have every advantage it appears to me you are young amiable goodlooking comfortably off scratch  but i cant talk confound it he burst out and how is a man to get anywhere at this sort of game without talking  you are talking perfectly fluently now  yes to you but put me in front of celia tennant and i simply make a sort of gurgling noise like a sheep with the botts it kills my chances stone dead you know these other men i can give claude mainwaring a third and beat him i can give eustace brinkley a stroke a hole and simply trample on his corpse but when it comes to talking to a girl im not in their class  you must not be diffident  but i am diffident whats the good of saying i mustnt be diffident when im the man who wrote the words and music when diffidence is my middle name and my telegraphic address i cant help being diffident  surely you could overcome it  but how it was in the hope that you might be able to suggest something that i came round tonight  and this was where i did the fatal thing it happened that just before i took up braid on the pushshot i had been dipping into the current number of a magazine and one of the advertisements i chanced to remember might have been framed with a special eye to georges unfortunate case it was that one which i have no doubt you have seen which treats of how to become a convincing talker i picked up this magazine now and handed it to george  he studied it for a few minutes in thoughtful silence he looked at the picture of the man who had taken the course being fawned upon by lovely women while the man who had let this opportunity slip stood outside the group gazing with a wistful envy  they never do that to me said george  do what my boy  cluster round clinging cooingly  i gather from the letterpress that they will if you write for the booklet  you think there is really something in it  i see no reason why eloquence should not be taught by mail one seems to be able to acquire every other desirable quality in that manner nowadays  i might try it after all its not expensive theres no doubt about it he murmured returning to his perusal that fellow does look popular of course the evening dress may have something to do with it  not at all the other man you will notice is also wearing evening dress and yet he is merely among those on the outskirts it is simply a question of writing for the booklet  sent post free  sent as you say post free  ive a good mind to try it  i see no reason why you should not  i will by duncan he tore the page out of the magazine and put it in his pocket ill tell you what ill do ill give this thing a trial for a week or two and at the end of that time ill go to the boss and see how he reacts when i ask for a rise of salary if he crawls itll show theres something in this if he flings me out it will prove the things no good  we left it at that and i am bound to sayowing no doubt to my not having written for the booklet of the memory training course advertised on the adjoining page of the magazinethe matter slipped from my mind when therefore a few weeks later i received a telegram from young mackintosh which ran      worked like magic  i confess i was intensely puzzled it was only a quarter of an hour before george himself arrived that i solved the problem of its meaning  so the boss crawled i said as he came in  he gave a light confident laugh i had not seen him as i say for some time and i was struck by the alteration in his appearance in what exactly this alteration consisted i could not at first have said but gradually it began to impress itself on me that his eye was brighter his jaw squarer his carriage a trifle more upright than it had been but it was his eye that struck me most forcibly the george mackintosh i had known had had a pleasing gaze but though frank and agreeable it had never been more dynamic than a fried egg this new george had an eye that was a combination of a gimlet and a searchlight coleridges ancient mariner i imagine must have been somewhat similarly equipped the ancient mariner stopped a wedding guest on his way to a wedding george mackintosh gave me the impression that he could have stopped the cornish riviera express on its way to penzance selfconfidenceaye and more than selfconfidencea sort of sinful overbearing swank seemed to exude from his very pores  crawled he said well he didnt actually lick my boots because i saw him coming and sidestepped but he did everything short of that i hadnt been talking an hour when  an hour i gasped did you talk for an hour  certainly you wouldnt have had me be abrupt would you i went into his private office and found him alone i think at first he would have been just as well pleased if i had retired in fact he said as much but i soon adjusted that outlook i took a seat and a cigarette and then i started to sketch out for him the history of my connection with the firm he began to wilt before the end of the first ten minutes at the quarter of an hour mark he was looking at me like a lost dog thats just found its owner by the halfhour he was making little bleating noises and massaging my coatsleeve and when after perhaps an hour and a half i came to my peroration and suggested a rise he choked back a sob gave me double what i had asked and invited me to dine at his club next tuesday im a little sorry now i cut the thing so short a few minutes more and i fancy he would have given me his socksuspenders and made over his lifeinsurance in my favour  well i said as soon as i could speak for i was finding my young friend a trifle overpowering this is most satisfactory  soso said george not unsoso a man wants an addition to his income when he is going to get married  ah i said that of course will be the real test  what do you mean  why when you propose to celia tennant you remember you were saying when we spoke of this before  oh that said george carelessly ive arranged all that  what  oh yes on my way up from the station i looked in on celia about an hour ago and its all settled  amazing  well i dont know i just put the thing to her and she seemed to see it  i congratulate you so now like alexander you have no more worlds to conquer  well i dont know so much about that said george the way it looks to me is that im just starting this eloquence is a thing that rather grows on one you didnt hear about my afterdinner speech at the anniversary banquet of the firm i suppose my dear fellow a riot a positive stampede had em laughing and then crying and then laughing again and then crying once more till six of em had to be led out and the rest down with hiccoughs napkins waving  three tables broken  waiters in hysterics i tell you i played on them as on a stringed instrument  can you play on a stringed instrument  as it happens no but as i would have played on a stringed instrument if i could play on a stringed instrument wonderful sense of power it gives you i mean to go in pretty largely for that sort of thing in future  you must not let it interfere with your golf  he gave a laugh which turned my blood cold  golf he said after all what is golf just pushing a small ball into a hole a child could do it indeed children have done it with great success i see an infant of fourteen has just won some sort of championship could that stripling convulse a roomful of banqueters i think not to sway your fellowmen with a word to hold them with a gesture  that is the real salt of life i dont suppose i shall play much more golf now im making arrangements for a lecturingtour and im booked up for fifteen lunches already  those were his words a man who had once done the lakehole in one a man whom the committee were grooming for the amateur championship i am no weakling but i confess they sent a chill shiver down my spine                                       george mackintosh did not i am glad to say carry out his mad project to the letter he did not altogether sever himself from golf he was still to be seen occasionally on the links but nowand i know of nothing more tragic that can befall a manhe found himself gradually shunned he who in the days of his sanity had been besieged with more offers of games than he could manage to accept men simply would not stand his incessant flow of talk one by one they dropped off until the only person he could find to go round with him was old major moseby whose hearing completely petered out as long ago as the year 98 and of course celia tennant would play with him occasionally but it seemed to me that even she greatly as no doubt she loved him was beginning to crack under the strain  so surely had i read the pallor of her face and the wild look of dumb agony in her eyes that i was not surprised when as i sat one morning in my garden reading ray on taking turf my man announced her name i had been half expecting her to come to me for advice and consolation for i had known her ever since she was a child it was i who had given her her first driver and taught her infant lips to lisp fore it is not easy to lisp the word fore but i had taught her to do it and this constituted a bond between us which had been strengthened rather than weakened by the passage of time  she sat down on the grass beside my chair and looked up at my face in silent pain we had known each other so long that i know that it was not my face that pained her but rather some unspoken malaise of the soul i waited for her to speak and suddenly she burst out impetuously as though she could hold back her sorrow no longer  oh i cant stand it i cant stand it  you mean i said though i knew only too well  this horrible obsession of poor georges she cried passionately i dont think he has stopped talking once since we have been engaged  he is chatty i agreed has he told you the story about the irishman  half a dozen times and the one about the swede oftener than that but i would not mind an occasional anecdote women have to learn to bear anecdotes from the men they love it is the curse of eve it is his incessant easy flow of chatter on all topics that is undermining even my devotion  but surely when he proposed to you he must have given you an inkling of the truth he only hinted at it when he spoke to me but i gather that he was eloquent  when he proposed said celia dreamily he was wonderful he spoke for twenty minutes without stopping he said i was the essence of his every hope the tree on which the fruit of his life grew his present his future his past  oh and all that sort of thing if he would only confine his conversation now to remarks of a similar nature i could listen to him all day long but he doesnt he talks politics and statistics and philosophy and  oh and everything he makes my head ache  and your heart also i fear i said gravely  i love him she replied simply in spite of everything i love him dearly but what to do what to do i have an awful fear that when we are getting married instead of answering i will he will go into the pulpit and deliver an address on marriage ceremonies of all ages the world to him is a vast lectureplatform he looks on life as one long afterdinner with himself as the principal speaker of the evening it is breaking my heart i see him shunned by his former friends shunned they run a mile when they see him coming the mere sound of his voice outside the clubhouse is enough to send brave men diving for safety beneath the sofas can you wonder that i am in despair what have i to live for  there is always golf  yes there is always golf she whispered bravely  come and have a round this afternoon  i had promised to go for a walk  she shuddered then pulled herself together  for a walk with george  i hesitated for a moment  bring him along i said and patted her hand it may be that together we shall find an opportunity of reasoning with him  she shook her head  you cant reason with george he never stops talking long enough to give you time  nevertheless there is no harm in trying i have an idea that this malady of his is not permanent and incurable the very violence with which the germ of loquacity has attacked him gives me hope you must remember that before this seizure he was rather a noticeably silent man sometimes i think that it is just natures way of restoring the average and that soon the fever may burn itself out or it may be that a sudden shock  at any rate have courage  i will try to be brave  capital at halfpast two on the first tee then  you will have to give me a stroke on the third ninth twelfth fifteenth sixteenth and eighteenth she said with a quaver in her voice my golf has fallen off rather lately  i patted her hand again  i understand i said gently i understand                                       the steady drone of a baritone voice as i alighted from my car and approached the first tee told me that george had not forgotten the tryst he was sitting on the stone seat under the chestnuttree speaking a few wellchosen words on the labour movement  to what conclusion then do we come he was saying we come to the foregone and inevitable conclusion that  good afternoon george i said  he nodded briefly but without verbal salutation he seemed to regard my remark as he would have regarded the unmannerly heckling of some one at the back of the hall he proceeded evenly with his speech and was still talking when celia addressed her ball and drove off her drive coinciding with a sharp rhetorical question from george wavered in midair and the ball trickled off into the rough halfway down the hill i can see the poor girls tortured face even now but she breathed no word of reproach such is the miracle of womens love  where you went wrong there said george breaking off his remarks on labour was that you have not studied the dynamics of golf sufficiently you did not pivot properly you allowed your left heel to point down the course when you were at the top of your swing this makes for instability and loss of distance the fundamental law of the dynamics of golf is that the left foot shall be solidly on the ground at the moment of impact if you allow your heel to point down the course it is almost impossible to bring it back in time to make the foot a solid fulcrum  i drove and managed to clear the rough and reach the fairway but it was not one of my best drives george mackintosh i confess had unnerved me the feeling he gave me resembled the selfconscious panic which i used to experience in my childhood when informed that there was one awful eye that watched my every movement and saw my every act it was only the fact that poor celia appeared even more affected by his espionage that enabled me to win the first hole in seven  on the way to the second tee george discoursed on the beauties of nature pointing out at considerable length how exquisitely the silver glitter of the lake harmonized with the vivid emerald turf near the hole and the duller green of the rough beyond it as celia teed up her ball he directed her attention to the golden glory of the sandpit to the left of the flag it was not the spirit in which to approach the lakehole and i was not surprised when the unfortunate girls ball fell with a sickening plop halfway across the water  where you went wrong there said george was that you made the stroke a sudden heave instead of a smooth snappy flick of the wrists pressing is always bad but with the mashie  i think i will give you this hole said celia to me for my shot had cleared the water and was lying on the edge of the green i wish i hadnt used a new ball  the price of golfballs said george as we started to round the lake is a matter to which economists should give some attention i am credibly informed that rubber at the present time is exceptionally cheap yet we see no decrease in the price of golfballs which as i need scarcely inform you are rubbercored why should this be so you will say that the wages of skilled labour have gone up true but  one moment george while i drive i said for we had now arrived at the third tee  a curious thing concentration said george and why certain phenomena should prevent us from focusing our attention this brings me to the vexed question of sleep why is it that we are able to sleep through some vast convulsion of nature when a dripping tap is enough to keep us awake i am told that there were people who slumbered peacefully through the san francisco earthquake merely stirring drowsily from time to time to tell an imaginary person to leave it on the mat yet these same people  celias drive bounded into the deep ravine which yawns some fifty yards from the tee a low moan escaped her  where you went wrong there said george  i know said celia i lifted my head  i had never heard her speak so abruptly before her manner in a girl less noticeably pretty might almost have been called snappish george however did not appear to have noticed anything amiss he filled his pipe and followed her into the ravine  remarkable he said how fundamental a principle of golf is this keeping the head still you will hear professionals tell their pupils to keep their eye on the ball keeping the eye on the ball is only a secondary matter what they really mean is that the head should be kept rigid as otherwise it is impossible to  his voice died away i had sliced my drive into the woods on the right and after playing another had gone off to try to find my ball leaving celia and george in the ravine behind me my last glimpse of them showed me that her ball had fallen into a stonestudded cavity in the side of the hill and she was drawing her niblick from her bag as i passed out of sight georges voice blurred by distance to a monotonous murmur followed me until i was out of earshot  i was just about to give up the hunt for my ball in despair when i heard celias voice calling to me from the edge of the undergrowth there was a sharp note in it which startled me  i came out trailing a portion of some unknown shrub which had twined itself about my ankle  yes i said picking twigs out of my hair  i want your advice said celia  certainly what is the trouble by the way i said looking round where is your fiance  i have no fiance she said in a dull hard voice  you have broken off the engagement  not exactly and yetwell i suppose it amounts to that  i dont quite understand  well the fact is said celia in a burst of girlish frankness i rather think ive killed george  killed him eh  it was a solution that had not occurred to me but now that it was presented for my inspection i could see its merits in these days of national effort when we are all working together to try to make our beloved land fit for heroes to live in it was astonishing that nobody before had thought of a simple obvious thing like killing george mackintosh george mackintosh was undoubtedly better dead but it had taken a womans intuition to see it  i killed him with my niblick said celia  i nodded if the thing was to be done at all it was unquestionably a niblick shot  i had just made my eleventh attempt to get out of that ravine the girl went on with george talking all the time about the recent excavations in egypt when suddenlyyou know what it is when something seems to snap  i had the experience with my shoelace only this morning  yes it was like that sharpsuddenhappening all in a moment i suppose i must have said something for george stopped talking about egypt and said that he was reminded by a remark of the last speakers of a certain irishman  i pressed her hand  dont go on if it hurts you i said gently  well there is very little more to tell he bent his head to light his pipe and wellthe temptation was too much for me thats all  you were quite right  you really think so  i certainly do a rather similar action under far less provocation once made jael the wife of heber the most popular woman in israel  i wish i could think so too she murmured at the moment you know i was conscious of nothing but an awful elation butbutoh he was such a darling before he got this dreadful affliction i cant help thinking of ggeorge as he used to be  she burst into a torrent of sobs  would you care for me to view the remains i said  perhaps it would be as well  she led me silently into the ravine george mackintosh was lying on his back where he had fallen  there said celia  and as she spoke george mackintosh gave a kind of snorting groan and sat up celia uttered a sharp shriek and sank on her knees before him george blinked once or twice and looked about him dazedly  save the women and children he cried i can swim  oh george said celia  feeling a little better i asked  a little how many people were hurt  hurt  when the express ran into us he cast another glance around him why how did i get here  you were here all the time i said  do you mean after the roof fell in or before  celia was crying quietly down the back of his neck  oh george she said again  he groped out feebly for her hand and patted it  brave little woman he said brave little woman she stuck by me all through tell mei am strong enough to bear itwhat caused the explosion  it seemed to me a case where much unpleasant explanation might be avoided by the exercise of a little tact  well some say one thing and some another i said whether it was a spark from a cigarette  celia interrupted me the woman in her made her revolt against this wellintentioned subterfuge  i hit you george  hit me he repeated curiously what with the eiffel tower  with my niblick  you hit me with your niblick but why  she hesitated then she faced him bravely  because you wouldnt stop talking  he gaped  me he said i wouldnt stop talking but i hardly talk at all im noted for it  celias eyes met mine in agonized inquiry but i saw what had happened the blow the sudden shock had operated on georges braincells in such a way as to effect a complete cure i have not the technical knowledge to be able to explain it but the facts were plain  lately my dear fellow i assured him you have dropped into the habit of talking rather a good deal ever since we started out this afternoon you have kept up an incessant flow of conversation  me on the links it isnt possible  it is only too true i fear and that is why this brave girl hit you with her niblick you started to tell her a funny story just as she was making her eleventh shot to get her ball out of this ravine and she took what she considered the necessary steps  can you ever forgive me george cried celia  george mackintosh stared at me then a crimson blush mantled his face  so i did its all beginning to come back to me oh heavens  can you forgive me george cried celia again  he took her hand in his  forgive you he muttered can you forgive me mea teetalker a greengabbler a prattler on the links the lowest form of life known to science i am unclean unclean  its only a little mud dearest said celia looking at the sleeve of his coat it will brush off when its dry  how can you link your lot with a man who talks when people are making their shots  you will never do it again  but i have done it and you stuck to me all through oh celia  i loved you george  the man seemed to swell with a sudden emotion his eye lit up and he thrust one hand into the breast of his coat while he raised the other in a sweeping gesture for an instant he appeared on the verge of a flood of eloquence and then as if he had been made sharply aware of what it was that he intended to do he suddenly sagged the gleam died out of his eyes he lowered his hand  well i must say that was rather decent of you he said  a lame speech but one that brought an infinite joy to both his hearers for it showed that george mackintosh was cured beyond possibility of relapse  yes i must say you are rather a corker he added  george cried celia  i said nothing but i clasped his hand and then taking my clubs i retired when i looked round she was still in his arms i left them there alone together in the great silence                                       and so concluded the oldest member you see that a cure is possible though it needs a womans gentle hand to bring it about and how few women are capable of doing what celia tennant did apart from the difficulty of summoning up the necessary resolution an act like hers requires a straight eye and a pair of strong and supple wrists it seems to me that for the ordinary talking golfer there is no hope and the race seems to be getting more numerous every day yet the finest golfers are always the least loquacious it is related of the illustrious sandy mchoots that when on the occasion of his winning the british open championship he was interviewed by reporters from the leading daily papers as to his views on tariff reform bimetallism the trial by jury system and the modern craze for dancing all they could extract from him was the single word mphm having uttered which he shouldered his bag and went home to tea a great man i wish there were more like him     6  ordeal by golf   a pleasant breeze played among the trees on the terrace outside the marvis bay golf and country club it ruffled the leaves and cooled the forehead of the oldest member who as was his custom of a saturday afternoon sat in the shade on a rockingchair observing the younger generation as it hooked and sliced in the valley below the eye of the oldest member was thoughtful and reflective when it looked into yours you saw in it that perfect peace that peace beyond understanding which comes at its maximum only to the man who has given up golf  the oldest member has not played golf since the rubbercored ball superseded the old dignified gutty but as a spectator and philosopher he still finds pleasure in the pastime he is watching it now with keen interest his gaze passing from the lemonade which he is sucking through a straw rests upon the saturday foursome which is struggling raggedly up the hill to the ninth green like all saturday foursomes it is in difficulties one of the patients is zigzagging about the fairway like a liner pursued by submarines two others seem to be digging for buried treasure unlessit is too far off to be certainthey are killing snakes the remaining cripple who has just foozled a mashieshot is blaming his caddie his voice as he upbraids the innocent child for breathing during his upswing comes clearly up the hill  the oldest member sighs his lemonade gives a sympathetic gurgle he puts it down on the table                                       how few men says the oldest member possess the proper golfing temperament how few indeed judging by the sights i see here on saturday afternoons possess any qualification at all for golf except a pair of baggy knickerbockers and enough money to enable them to pay for the drinks at the end of the round the ideal golfer never loses his temper when i played i never lost my temper sometimes it is true i may after missing a shot have broken my club across my knees but i did it in a calm and judicial spirit because the club was obviously no good and i was going to get another one anyway to lose ones temper at golf is foolish it gets you nothing not even relief imitate the spirit of marcus aurelius whatever may befall thee says that great man in his meditations it was preordained for thee from everlasting nothing happens to anybody which he is not fitted by nature to bear i like to think that this noble thought came to him after he had sliced a couple of new balls into the woods and that he jotted it down on the back of his scorecard for there can be no doubt that the man was a golfer and a bad golfer at that nobody who had not had a short putt stop on the edge of the hole could possibly have written the words that which makes the man no worse than he was makes life no worse it has no power to harm without or within yes marcus aurelius undoubtedly played golf and all the evidence seems to indicate that he rarely went round in under a hundred and twenty the niblick was his club  speaking of marcus aurelius and the golfing temperament recalls to my mind the case of young mitchell holmes mitchell when i knew him first was a promising young man with a future before him in the paterson dyeing and refining company of which my old friend alexander paterson was the president he had many engaging qualitiesamong them an unquestioned ability to imitate a bulldog quarrelling with a pekingese in a way which had to be heard to be believed it was a gift which made him much in demand at social gatherings in the neighbourhood marking him off from other young men who could only almost play the mandolin or recite bits of gunga din and no doubt it was this talent of his which first sowed the seeds of love in the heart of millicent boyd women are essentially heroworshippers and when a warmhearted girl like millicent has heard a personable young man imitating a bulldog and a pekingese to the applause of a crowded drawingroom and has been able to detect the exact point at which the pekingese leaves off and the bulldog begins she can never feel quite the same to other men in short mitchell and millicent were engaged and were only waiting to be married till the former could bite the dyeing and refining companys ear for a bit of extra salary  mitchell holmes had only one fault he lost his temper when playing golf he seldom played a round without becoming piqued peeved orin many caseschagrined the caddies on our links it was said could always worst other small boys in verbal argument by calling them some of the things they had heard mitchell call his ball on discovering it in a cuppy lie he had a great gift of language and he used it unsparingly i will admit that there was some excuse for the man he had the makings of a brilliant golfer but a combination of bad luck and inconsistent play invariably robbed him of the fruits of his skill he was the sort of player who does the first two holes in one under bogey and then takes an eleven at the third the least thing upset him on the links he missed short putts because of the uproar of the butterflies in the adjoining meadows  it seemed hardly likely that this one kink in an otherwise admirable character would ever seriously affect his working or professional life but it did one evening as i was sitting in my garden alexander paterson was announced a glance at his face told me that he had come to ask my advice rightly or wrongly he regarded me as one capable of giving advice it was i who had changed the whole current of his life by counselling him to leave the wood in his bag and take a drivingiron off the tee and in one or two other matters like the choice of a putter so much more important than the choice of a wife i had been of assistance to him  alexander sat down and fanned himself with his hat for the evening was warm perplexity was written upon his fine face  i dont know what to do he said  keep the head stillslow backdont press i said gravely there is no better rule for a happy and successful life  its nothing to do with golf this time he said its about the treasurership of my company old smithers retires next week and ive got to find a man to fill his place  that should be easy you have simply to select the most deserving from among your other employees  but which is the most deserving thats the point there are two men who are capable of holding the job quite adequately but then i realize how little i know of their real characters it is the treasurership you understand which has to be filled now a man who was quite good at another job might easily get wrong ideas into his head when he became a treasurer he would have the handling of large sums of money in other words a man who in ordinary circumstances had never been conscious of any desire to visit the more distant portions of south america might feel the urge so to speak shortly after he became a treasurer that is my difficulty of course one always takes a sporting chance with any treasurer but how am i to find out which of these two men would give me the more reasonable opportunity of keeping some of my money  i did not hesitate a moment i held strong views on the subject of charactertesting  the only way i said to alexander of really finding out a mans true character is to play golf with him in no other walk of life does the cloven hoof so quickly display itself i employed a lawyer for years until one day i saw him kick his ball out of a heelmark i removed my business from his charge next morning he has not yet run off with any trustfunds but there is a nasty gleam in his eye and i am convinced that it is only a question of time golf my dear fellow is the infallible test the man who can go into a patch of rough alone with the knowledge that only god is watching him and play his ball where it lies is the man who will serve you faithfully and well the man who can smile bravely when his putt is diverted by one of those beastly wormcasts is pure gold right through but the man who is hasty unbalanced and violent on the links will display the same qualities in the wider field of everyday life you dont want an unbalanced treasurer do you  not if his books are likely to catch the complaint  they are sure to statisticians estimate that the average of crime among good golfers is lower than in any class of the community except possibly bishops since willie park won the first championship at prestwick in the year 1860 there has i believe been no instance of an open champion spending a day in prison whereas the bad golfersand by bad i do not mean incompetent but blacksouledthe men who fail to count a stroke when they miss the globe the men who never replace a divot the men who talk while their opponent is driving and the men who let their angry passions risethese are in and out of wormwood scrubbs all the time they find it hardly worth while to get their hair cut in their brief intervals of liberty  alexander was visibly impressed  that sounds sensible by george he said  it is sensible  ill do it honestly i cant see any other way of deciding between holmes and dixon  i started  holmes not mitchell holmes  yes of course you must know him he lives here i believe  and by dixon do you mean rupert dixon  thats the man another neighbour of yours  i confess that my heart sank it was as if my ball had fallen into the pit which my niblick had digged i wished heartily that i had thought of waiting to ascertain the names of the two rivals before offering my scheme i was extremely fond of mitchell holmes and of the girl to whom he was engaged to be married indeed it was i who had sketched out a few rough notes for the lad to use when proposing and results had shown that he had put my stuff across well and i had listened many a time with a sympathetic ear to his hopes in the matter of securing a rise of salary which would enable him to get married somehow when alexander was talking it had not occurred to me that young holmes might be in the running for so important an office as the treasurership i had ruined the boys chances ordeal by golf was the one test which he could not possibly undergo with success only a miracle could keep him from losing his temper and i had expressly warned alexander against such a man  when i thought of his rival my heart sank still more rupert dixon was rather an unpleasant young man but the worst of his enemies could not accuse him of not possessing the golfing temperament from the drive off the tee to the holing of the final putt he was uniformly suave                                       when alexander had gone i sat in thought for some time i was faced with a problem strictly speaking no doubt i had no right to take sides and though secrecy had not been enjoined upon me in so many words i was very well aware that alexander was under the impression that i would keep the thing under my hat and not reveal to either party the test that awaited him each candidate was of course to remain ignorant that he was taking part in anything but a friendly game  but when i thought of the young couple whose future depended on this ordeal i hesitated no longer i put on my hat and went round to miss boyds house where i knew that mitchell was to be found at this hour  the young couple were out in the porch looking at the moon they greeted me heartily but their heartiness had rather a tinny sound and i could see that on the whole they regarded me as one of those things which should not happen but when i told my story their attitude changed they began to look on me in the pleasanter light of a guardian philosopher and friend  wherever did mr paterson get such a silly idea said miss boyd indignantly i hadfrom the best motivesconcealed the source of the scheme its ridiculous  oh i dont know said mitchell the old boys crazy about golf its just the sort of scheme he would cook up well it dishes me  oh come i said  its no good saying oh come you know perfectly well that im a frank outspoken golfer when my ball goes off nornoreast when i want it to go due west i cant help expressing an opinion about it it is a curious phenomenon which calls for comment and i give it similarly when i top my drive i have to go on record as saying that i did not do it intentionally and its just these trifles as far as i can make out that are going to decide the thing  couldnt you learn to control yourself on the links mitchell darling asked millicent after all golf is only a game  mitchells eyes met mine and i have no doubt that mine showed just the same look of horror which i saw in his women say these things without thinking it does not mean that there is any kink in their character they simply dont realize what they are saying  hush said mitchell huskily patting her hand and overcoming his emotion with a strong effort hush dearest                                       two or three days later i met millicent coming from the postoffice there was a new light of happiness in her eyes and her face was glowing  such a splendid thing has happened she said after mitchell left that night i happened to be glancing through a magazine and i came across a wonderful advertisement it began by saying that all the great men in history owed their success to being able to control themselves and that napoleon wouldnt have amounted to anything if he had not curbed his fiery nature and then it said that we can all be like napoleon if we fill in the accompanying blank orderform for professor orlando rollitts wonderful book are you your own master absolutely free for five days and then seven shillings but you must write at once because the demand is enormous and pretty soon it may be too late i wrote at once and luckily i was in time because professor rollitt did have a copy left and its just arrived ive been looking through it and it seems splendid  she held out a small volume i glanced at it there was a frontispiece showing a signed photograph of professor orlando rollitt controlling himself in spite of having long white whiskers and then some reading matter printed between wide margins one look at the book told me the professors methods to be brief he had simply swiped marcus aureliuss best stuff the copyright having expired some two thousand years ago and was retailing it as his own i did not mention this to millicent it was no affair of mine presumably however obscure the necessity professor rollitt had to live  im going to start mitchell on it today dont you think this is good thou seest how few be the things which if a man has at his command his life flows gently on and is divine i think it will be wonderful if mitchells life flows gently on and is divine for seven shillings dont you                                       at the clubhouse that evening i encountered rupert dixon he was emerging from a showerbath and looked as pleased with himself as usual  just been going round with old paterson he said he was asking after you hes gone back to town in his car  i was thrilled so the test had begun  how did you come out i asked  rupert dixon smirked a smirking man wrapped in a bath towel with a wisp of wet hair over one eye is a repellent sight  oh pretty well i won by six and five in spite of having poisonous luck  i felt a gleam of hope at these last words  oh you had bad luck  the worst i overshot the green at the third with the best brasseyshot ive ever made in my lifeand thats saying a lotand lost my ball in the rough beyond it  and i suppose you let yourself go eh  let myself go  i take it that you made some sort of demonstration  oh no losing your temper doesnt get you anywhere at golf it only spoils your next shot  i went away heavyhearted dixon had plainly come through the ordeal as well as any man could have done i expected to hear every day that the vacant treasurership had been filled and that mitchell had not even been called upon to play his test round i suppose however that alexander paterson felt that it would be unfair to the other competitor not to give him his chance for the next i heard of the matter was when mitchell holmes rang me up on the friday and asked me if i would accompany him round the links next day in the match he was playing with alexander and give him my moral support  i shall need it he said i dont mind telling you im pretty nervous i wish i had had longer to get the stranglehold on that are you your own master stuff i can see of course that it is the real tabasco from start to finish and absolutely as mother makes it but the trouble is ive only had a few days to soak it into my system its like trying to patch up a motor car with string you never know when the thing will break down heaven knows what will happen if i sink a ball at the waterhole and something seems to tell me i am going to do it  there was a silence for a moment  do you believe in dreams asked mitchell  believe in what  dreams  what about them  i said do you believe in dreams because last night i dreamed that i was playing in the final of the open championship and i got into the rough and there was a cow there and the cow looked at me in a sad sort of way and said why dont you use the twov grip instead of the interlocking at the time it seemed an odd sort of thing to happen but ive been thinking it over and i wonder if there isnt something in it these things must be sent to us for a purpose  you cant change your grip on the day of an important match  i suppose not the fact is im a bit jumpy or i wouldnt have mentioned it oh well see you tomorrow at two                                       the day was bright and sunny but a tricky crosswind was blowing when i reached the clubhouse alexander paterson was there practising swings on the first tee and almost immediately mitchell holmes arrived accompanied by millicent  perhaps said alexander we had better be getting under way shall i take the honour  certainly said mitchell  alexander teed up his ball  alexander paterson has always been a careful rather than a dashing player it is his custom a sort of ritual to take two measured practiceswings before addressing the ball even on the puttinggreen when he does address the ball he shuffles his feet for a moment or two then pauses and scans the horizon in a suspicious sort of way as if he had been expecting it to play some sort of a trick on him when he was not looking a careful inspection seems to convince him of the horizons bona fides and he turns his attention to the ball again he shuffles his feet once more then raises his club he waggles the club smartly over the ball three times then lays it behind the globule at this point he suddenly peers at the horizon again in the apparent hope of catching it off its guard this done he raises his club very slowly brings it back very slowly till it almost touches the ball raises it again brings it down again raises it once more and brings it down for the third time he then stands motionless wrapped in thought like some indian fakir contemplating the infinite then he raises his club again and replaces it behind the ball finally he quivers all over swings very slowly back and drives the ball for about a hundred and fifty yards in a dead straight line  it is a method of procedure which proves sometimes a little exasperating to the highly strung and i watched mitchells face anxiously to see how he was taking his first introduction to it the unhappy lad had blenched visibly he turned to me with the air of one in pain  does he always do that he whispered  always i replied  then im done for no human being could play golf against a onering circus like that without blowing up  i said nothing it was i feared only too true wellpoised as i am i had long since been compelled to give up playing with alexander paterson much as i esteemed him it was a choice between that and resigning from the baptist church  at this moment millicent spoke there was an open book in her hand i recognized it as the lifework of professor rollitt  think on this doctrine she said in her soft modulated voice that to be patient is a branch of justice and that men sin without intending it  mitchell nodded briefly and walked to the tee with a firm step  before you drive darling said millicent remember this let no act be done at haphazard nor otherwise than according to the finished rules that govern its kind  the next moment mitchells ball was shooting through the air to come to rest two hundred yards down the course it was a magnificent drive he had followed the counsel of marcus aurelius to the letter  an admirable ironshot put him in reasonable proximity to the pin and he holed out in one under bogey with one of the nicest putts i have ever beheld and when at the next hole the dangerous waterhole his ball soared over the pond and lay safe giving him bogey for the hole i began for the first time to breathe freely every golfer has his day and this was plainly mitchells he was playing faultless golf if he could continue in this vein his unfortunate failing would have no chance to show itself  the third hole is long and tricky you drive over a ravineor possibly into it in the latter event you breathe a prayer and call for your niblick but once over the ravine there is nothing to disturb the equanimity bogey is five and a good drive followed by a brasseyshot will put you within easy mashiedistance of the green  mitchell cleared the ravine by a hundred and twenty yards he strolled back to me and watched alexander go through his ritual with an indulgent smile i knew just how he was feeling never does the world seem so sweet and fair and the foibles of our fellow human beings so little irritating as when we have just swatted the pill right on the spot  i cant see why he does it said mitchell eyeing alexander with a toleration that almost amounted to affection if i did all those swedish exercises before i drove i should forget what i had come out for and go home alexander concluded the movements and landed a bare three yards on the other side of the ravine hes what you would call a steady performer isnt he never varies  mitchell won the hole comfortably there was a jauntiness about his stance on the fourth tee which made me a little uneasy overconfidence at golf is almost as bad as timidity  my apprehensions were justified mitchell topped his ball it rolled twenty yards into the rough and nestled under a dockleaf his mouth opened then closed with a snap he came over to where millicent and i were standing  i didnt say it he said what on earth happened then  search mens governing principles said millicent and consider the wise what they shun and what they cleave to  exactly i said you swayed your body  and now ive got to go and look for that infernal ball  never mind darling said millicent nothing has such power to broaden the mind as the ability to investigate systematically and truly all that comes under thy observation in life  besides i said youre three up  i shant be after this hole  he was right alexander won it in five one above bogey and regained the honour  mitchell was a trifle shaken his play no longer had its first careless vigour he lost the next hole halved the sixth lost the short seventh and then rallying halved the eighth  the ninth hole like so many on our links can be a perfectly simple four although the rolling nature of the green makes bogey always a somewhat doubtful feat but on the other hand if you foozle your drive you can easily achieve double figures the tee is on the farther side of the pond beyond the bridge where the water narrows almost to the dimensions of a brook you drive across this water and over a tangle of trees and undergrowth on the other bank the distance to the fairway cannot be more than sixty yards for the hazard is purely a mental one and yet how many fair hopes have been wrecked there  alexander cleared the obstacles comfortably with his customary short straight drive and mitchell advanced to the tee  i think the loss of the honour had been preying on his mind he seemed nervous his upswing was shaky and he swayed back perceptibly he made a lunge at the ball sliced it and it struck a tree on the other side of the water and fell in the long grass we crossed the bridge to look for it and it was here that the effect of professor rollitt began definitely to wane  why on earth dont they mow this darned stuff demanded mitchell querulously as he beat about the grass with his niblick  you have to have rough on a course i ventured  whatever happens at all said millicent happens as it should thou wilt find this true if thou shouldst watch narrowly  thats all very well said mitchell watching narrowly in a clump of weeds but seeming unconvinced i believe the greens committee run this bally club purely in the interests of the caddies i believe they encourage lost balls and go halves with the little beasts when they find them and sell them  millicent and i exchanged glances there were tears in her eyes  oh mitchell remember napoleon  napoleon whats napoleon got to do with it napoleon never was expected to drive through a primeval forest besides what did napoleon ever do where did napoleon get off swanking round as if he amounted to something poor fish all he ever did was to get hammered at waterloo  alexander rejoined us he had walked on to where his ball lay  cant find it eh nasty bit of rough this  no i cant find it but tomorrow some miserable chinless halfwitted reptile of a caddie with pop eyes and eight hundred and thirtyseven pimples will find it and will sell it to someone for sixpence no it was a brandnew ball hell probably get a shilling for it thatll be sixpence for himself and sixpence for the greens committee no wonder theyre buying cars quicker than the makers can supply them no wonder you see their wives going about in mink coats and pearl necklaces oh dash it ill drop another  in that case alexander pointed out you will of course under the rules governing matchplay lose the hole  all right then ill give up the hole  then that i think makes me one up on the first nine said alexander excellent a very pleasant even game  pleasant on second thoughts i dont believe the greens committee let the wretched caddies get any of the loot they hang round behind trees till the deals concluded and then sneak out and choke it out of them  i saw alexander raise his eyebrows he walked up the hill to the next tee with me  rather a quicktempered young fellow holmes he said thoughtfully i should never have suspected it it just shows how little one can know of a man only meeting him in business hours  i tried to defend the poor lad  he has an excellent heart alexander but the fact iswe are such old friends that i know you will forgive my mentioning ityour style of play gets i fancy a little on his nerves  my style of play whats wrong with my style of play  nothing is actually wrong with it but to a young and ardent spirit there is apt to be something a trifle upsetting in being compelled to watch a man play quite so slowly as you do come now alexander as one friend to another is it necessary to take two practiceswings before you putt  dear dear said alexander you really mean to say that that upsets him well im afraid i am too old to change my methods now  i had nothing more to say  as we reached the tenth tee i saw that we were in for a few minutes wait suddenly i felt a hand on my arm millicent was standing beside me dejection written on her face alexander and young mitchell were some distance away from us  mitchell doesnt want me to come round the rest of the way with him she said despondently he says i make him nervous  i shook my head  thats bad i was looking on you as a steadying influence  i thought i was too but mitchell says no he says my being there keeps him from concentrating  then perhaps it would be better for you to remain in the clubhouse till we return there is i fear dirty work ahead  a choking sob escaped the unhappy girl  im afraid so there is an apple tree near the thirteenth hole and mitchells caddie is sure to start eating apples i am thinking of what mitchell will do when he hears the crunching when he is addressing his ball  that is true  our only hope she said holding out professor rollitts book is this will you please read him extracts when you see him getting nervous we went through the book last night and marked all the passages in blue pencil which might prove helpful you will see notes against them in the margin showing when each is supposed to be used  it was a small favour to ask i took the book and gripped her hand silently then i joined alexander and mitchell on the tenth tee mitchell was still continuing his speculations regarding the greens committee  the hole after this one he said used to be a short hole there was no chance of losing a ball then one day the wife of one of the greens committee happened to mention that the baby needed new shoes so now theyve tacked on another hundred and fifty yards to it you have to drive over the brow of a hill and if you slice an eighth of an inch you get into a sort of no mans land full of rocks and bushes and crevices and old pots and pans the greens committee practically live there in the summer you see them prowling round in groups encouraging each other with merry cries as they fill their sacks well im going to fool them today im going to drive an old ball which is just hanging together by a thread itll come to pieces when they pick it up  golf however is a curious gamea game of fluctuations one might have supposed that mitchell in such a frame of mind would have continued to come to grief but at the beginning of the second nine he once more found his form a perfect drive put him in position to reach the tenth green with an ironshot and though the ball was several yards from the hole he laid it dead with his approachputt and holed his second for a bogey four alexander could only achieve a five so that they were all square again  the eleventh the subject of mitchells recent criticism is certainly a tricky hole and it is true that a slice does land the player in grave difficulties today however both men kept their drives straight and found no difficulty in securing fours  a little more of this said mitchell beaming and the greens committee will have to give up piracy and go back to work  the twelfth is a long dogleg hole bogey five alexander plugged steadily round the bend holing out in six and mitchell whose second shot had landed him in some long grass was obliged to use his niblick he contrived however to halve the hole with a nicelyjudged mashieshot to the edge of the green  alexander won the thirteenth it is a three hundred and sixty yard hole free from bunkers it took alexander three strokes to reach the green but his third laid the ball dead while mitchell who was on in two required three putts  that reminds me said alexander chattily of a story i heard friend calls out to a beginner how are you getting on old man and the beginner says splendidly i just made three perfect putts on the last green  mitchell did not appear amused i watched his face anxiously he had made no remark but the missed putt which would have saved the hole had been very short and i feared the worst there was a brooding look in his eye as we walked to the fourteenth tee  there are few more picturesque spots in the whole of the countryside than the neighbourhood of the fourteenth tee it is a sight to charm the naturelovers heart  but if golf has a defect it is that it prevents a man being a wholehearted lover of nature where the layman sees waving grass and romantic tangles of undergrowth your golfer beholds nothing but a nasty patch of rough from which he must divert his ball the cry of the birds wheeling against the sky is to the golfer merely something that may put him off his putt as a spectator i am fond of the ravine at the bottom of the slope it pleases the eye but as a golfer i have frequently found it the very devil  the last hole had given alexander the honour again he drove even more deliberately than before for quite half a minute he stood over his ball pawing at it with his drivingiron like a cat investigating a tortoise finally he despatched it to one of the few safe spots on the hillside the drive from this tee has to be carefully calculated for if it be too straight it will catch the slope and roll down into the ravine  mitchell addressed his ball he swung up and then from immediately behind him came a sudden sharp crunching sound i looked quickly in the direction whence it came mitchells caddie with a glassy look in his eyes was gnawing a large apple and even as i breathed a silent prayer down came the driver and the ball with a terrible slice on it hit the side of the hill and bounded into the ravine  there was a pausea pause in which the world stood still mitchell dropped his club and turned his face was working horribly  mitchell i cried my boy reflect be calm  calm whats the use of being calm when people are chewing apples in thousands all round you what is this anywaya golf match or a pleasant days outing for the children of the poor apples go on my boy take another bite take several enjoy yourself never mind if it seems to cause me a fleeting annoyance go on with your lunch you probably had a light breakfast eh and are feeling a little peckish yes if you will wait here i will run to the clubhouse and get you a sandwich and a bottle of gingerale make yourself quite at home you lovable little fellow sit down and have a good time  i turned the pages of professor rollitts book feverishly i could not find a passage that had been marked in blue pencil to meet this emergency i selected one at random  mitchell i said one moment how much time he gains who does not look to see what his neighbour says or does but only at what he does himself to make it just and holy  well look what ive done myself im somewhere down at the bottom of that dashed ravine and itll take me a dozen strokes to get out do you call that just and holy here give me that book for a moment  he snatched the little volume out of my hands for an instant he looked at it with a curious expression of loathing then he placed it gently on the ground and jumped on it a few times then he hit it with his driver finally as if feeling that the time for half measures had passed he took a little run and kicked it strongly into the long grass  he turned to alexander who had been an impassive spectator of the scene  im through he said i concede the match goodbye youll find me in the bay  going swimming  no drowning myself  a gentle smile broke out over my old friends usually grave face he patted mitchells shoulder affectionately  dont do that my boy he said i was hoping you would stick around the office awhile as treasurer of the company  mitchell tottered he grasped my arm for support everything was very still nothing broke the stillness but the humming of the bees the murmur of the distant wavelets and the sound of mitchells caddie going on with his apple  what cried mitchell  the position said alexander will be falling vacant very shortly as no doubt you know it is yours if you care to accept it  you meanyou meanyoure going to give me the job  you have interpreted me exactly  mitchell gulped so did his caddie one from a spiritual the other from a physical cause  if you dont mind excusing me said mitchell huskily i think ill be popping back to the clubhouse someone i want to see  he disappeared through the trees running strongly i turned to alexander  what does this mean i asked i am delighted but what becomes of the test  my old friend smiled gently  the test he replied has been eminently satisfactory circumstances perhaps have compelled me to modify the original idea of it but nevertheless it has been a completely successful test since we started out i have been doing a good deal of thinking and i have come to the conclusion that what the paterson dyeing and refining company really needs is a treasurer whom i can beat at golf and i have discovered the ideal man why he went on a look of holy enthusiasm on his fine old face do you realize that i can always lick the stuffing out of that boy good player as he is simply by taking a little trouble i can make him get the wind up every time simply by taking one or two extra practiceswings that is the sort of man i need for a responsible post in my office  but what about rupert dixon i asked  he gave a gesture of distaste  i wouldnt trust that man why when i played with him everything went wrong and he just smiled and didnt say a word a man who can do that is not the man to trust with the control of large sums of money it wouldnt be safe why the fellow isnt honest he cant be he paused for a moment besides he added thoughtfully he beat me by six and five whats the good of a treasurer who beats the boss by six and five     7  the long hole   the young man as he sat filling his pipe in the clubhouse smokingroom was inclined to be bitter  if theres one thing that gives me a pain squarely in the centre of the gizzard he burst out breaking a silence that had lasted for some minutes its a golflawyer they oughtnt to be allowed on the links  the oldest member who had been meditatively putting himself outside a cup of tea and a slice of seedcake raised his white eyebrows  the law he said is an honourable profession why should its practitioners be restrained from indulgence in the game of games  i dont mean actual lawyers said the young man his acerbity mellowing a trifle under the influence of tobacco i mean the blighters whose best club is the book of rules you know the sort of excrescences every time you think youve won a hole they dig out rule eight hundred and fiftythree section two subsection four to prove that youve disqualified yourself by having an ingrowing toenail well take my case the young mans voice was high and plaintive i go out with that man hemmingway to play an ordinary friendly roundnothing depending on it except a measly balland on the seventh he pulls me up and claims the hole simply because i happened to drop my niblick in the bunker oh well a ticks a tick and theres nothing more to say i suppose  the sage shook his head  rules are rules my boy and must be kept it is odd that you should have brought up this subject for only a moment before you came in i was thinking of a somewhat curious match which ultimately turned upon a question of the rulebook it is true that as far as the actual prize was concerned it made little difference but perhaps i had better tell you the whole story from the beginning  the young man shifted uneasily in his chair  well you know ive had a pretty rotten time this afternoon already  i will call my story said the sage tranquilly the long hole for it involved the playing of what i am inclined to think must be the longest hole in the history of golf in its beginnings the story may remind you of one i once told you about peter willard and james todd but you will find that it develops in quite a different manner ralph bingham  i half promised to go and see a man  but i will begin at the beginning said the sage i see that you are all impatience to hear the full details                                       ralph bingham and arthur jukes said the oldest member had never been friendstheir rivalry was too keen to admit of thatbut it was not till amanda trivett came to stay here that a smouldering distaste for each other burst out into the flames of actual enmity it is ever so one of the poets whose name i cannot recall has a passage which i am unable at the moment to remember in one of his works which for the time being has slipped my mind which hits off admirably this ageold situation the gist of his remarks is that lovely woman rarely fails to start something in the weeks that followed her arrival being in the same room with the two men was like dropping in on a reunion of capulets and montagues  you see ralph and arthur were so exactly equal in their skill on the links that life for them had for some time past resolved itself into a silent bitter struggle in which first one then the other gained some slight advantage if ralph won the may medal by a stroke arthur would be one ahead in the june competition only to be nosed out again in july it was a state of affairs which had they been men of a more generous stamp would have bred a mutual respect esteem and even love but i am sorry to say that apart from their golf which was in a class of its own as far as this neighbourhood was concerned ralph bingham and arthur jukes were a sorry pairand yet mark you far from lacking in mere superficial good looks they were handsome fellows both of them and well aware of the fact and when amanda trivett came to stay they simply straightened their ties twirled their moustaches and expected her to do the rest  but there they were disappointed perfectly friendly though she was to both of them the lovelight was conspicuously absent from her beautiful eyes and it was not long before each had come independently to a solution of this mystery it was plain to them that the whole trouble lay in the fact that each neutralized the others attractions arthur felt that if he could only have a clear field all would be over except the sending out of the wedding invitations and ralph was of the opinion that if he could just call on the girl one evening without finding the place all littered up with arthur his natural charms would swiftly bring home the bacon and indeed it was true that they had no rivals except themselves it happened at the moment that woodhaven was very short of eligible bachelors we marry young in this delightful spot and all the likely men were already paired off it seemed that if amanda trivett intended to get married she would have to select either ralph bingham or arthur jukes a dreadful choice                                       it had not occurred to me at the outset that my position in the affair would be anything closer than that of a detached and mildly interested spectator yet it was to me that ralph came in his hour of need when i returned home one evening i found that my man had brought him in and laid him on the mat in my sittingroom  i offered him a chair and a cigar and he came to the point with commendable rapidity  leigh he said directly he had lighted his cigar is too small for arthur jukes and myself  ah you have been talking it over and decided to move i said delighted i think you are perfectly right leigh is overbuilt men like you and jukes need a lot of space where do you think of going  im not going  but i thought you said  what i meant was that the time has come when one of us must leave  oh only one of you it was something of course but i confess i was disappointed and i think my disappointment must have shown in my voice for he looked at me surprised  surely you wouldnt mind jukes going he said  why certainly not he really is going is he  a look of saturnine determination came into ralphs face  he is he thinks he isnt but he is  i failed to understand him and said so he looked cautiously about the room as if to reassure himself that he could not be overheard  i suppose youve noticed he said the disgusting way that man jukes has been hanging round miss trivett boring her to death  i have seen them together sometimes  i love amanda trivett said ralph  poor girl i sighed  i beg your pardon  poor girl i said i mean to have arthur jukes hanging round her  thats just what i think said ralph bingham and thats why were going to play this match  what match  this match weve decided to play i want you to act as one of the judges to go along with jukes and see that he doesnt play any of his tricks you know what he is and in a vital match like this  how much are you playing for  the whole world  i beg your pardon  the whole world it amounts to that the loser is to leave leigh for good and the winner stays on and marries amanda trivett we have arranged all the details rupert bailey will accompany me acting as the other judge  and you want me to go round with jukes  not round said ralph bingham along  what is the distinction  we are not going to play a round only one hole  sudden death eh  not so very sudden its a longish hole we start on the first tee here and hole out in the town in the doorway of the majestic hotel in royal square a distance i imagine of about sixteen miles  i was revolted about that time a perfect epidemic of freak matches had broken out in the club and i had strongly opposed them from the start george willis had begun it by playing a medal round with the pro georges first nine against the pros complete eighteen after that came the contest between herbert widgeon and montague brown the latter a twentyfour handicap man being entitled to shout boo three times during the round at moments selected by himself there had been many more of these degrading travesties on the sacred game and i had writhed to see them playing freak golfmatches is to my mind like ragging a great classical melody but of the whole collection this one considering the sentimental interest and the magnitude of the stakes seemed to me the most terrible my face i imagine betrayed my disgust for bingham attempted extenuation  its the only way he said you know how jukes and i are on the links we are as level as two men can be this of course is due to his extraordinary luck everybody knows that he is the worlds champion fluker i on the other hand invariably have the worst luck the consequence is that in an ordinary round it is always a tossup which of us wins the test we propose will eliminate luck after sixteen miles of giveandtake play i am certainthat is to say the better man is certain to be ahead that is what i meant when i said that arthur jukes would shortly be leaving leigh well may i take it that you will consent to act as one of the judges  i considered after all the match was likely to be historic and one always feels tempted to hand ones name down to posterity  very well i said  excellent you will have to keep a sharp eye on jukes i need scarcely remind you you will of course carry a book of the rules in your pocket and refer to them when you wish to refresh your memory we start at daybreak for if we put it off till later the course at the other end might be somewhat congested when we reached it we want to avoid publicity as far as possible if i took a full iron and hit a policeman it would excite a remark  it would i can tell you the exact remark which it would excite  we will take bicycles with us to minimize the fatigue of covering the distance well i am glad that we have your cooperation at daybreak tomorrow on the first tee and dont forget to bring your rulebook                                       the atmosphere brooding over the first tee when i reached it on the following morning somewhat resembled that of a duellingground in the days when these affairs were sealed with rapiers or pistols rupert bailey an old friend of mine was the only cheerful member of the party i am never at my best in the early morning and the two rivals glared at each other with silent sneers i had never supposed till that moment that men ever really sneered at one another outside the movies but these two were indisputably doing so they were in the mood when men say pshaw  they tossed for the honour and arthur jukes having won drove off with a fine ball that landed well down the course ralph bingham having teed up turned to rupert bailey  go down on to the fairway of the seventeenth he said i want you to mark my ball  rupert stared  the seventeenth  i am going to take that direction said ralph pointing over the trees  but that will land your second or third shot in the lake  i have provided for that i have a fiatbottomed boat moored close by the sixteenth green i shall use a mashieniblick and chip my ball aboard row across to the other side chip it ashore and carry on i propose to go across country as far as woodfield i think it will save me a stroke or two  i gasped i had never before realized the mans devilish cunning his tactics gave him a flying start arthur who had driven straight down the course had as his objective the high road which adjoins the waste ground beyond the first green once there he would play the orthodox game by driving his ball along till he reached the bridge while arthur was winding along the high road ralph would have cut off practically two sides of a triangle and it was hopeless for arthur to imitate his enemys tactics now from where his ball lay he would have to cross a wide tract of marsh in order to reach the seventeenth fairwayan impossible feat and even if it had been feasible he had no boat to take him across the water  he uttered a violent protest he was an unpleasant young man almostit seems absurd to say so but almost as unpleasant as ralph bingham yet at the moment i am bound to say i sympathized with him  what are you doing he demanded you cant play fast and loose with the rules like that  to what rule do you refer said ralph coldly  well that bally boat of yours is a hazard isnt it and you cant row a hazard about all over the place  why not  the simple question seemed to take arthur jukes aback  why not he repeated why not well you cant thats why  there is nothing in the rules said ralph bingham against moving a hazard if a hazard can be moved without disturbing the ball you are at liberty i gather to move it wherever you please besides what is all this about moving hazards i have a perfect right to go for a morning row havent i if i were to ask my doctor he would probably actually recommend it i am going to row my boat across the sound if it happens to have my ball on board that is not my affair i shall not disturb my ball and i shall play it from where it lies am i right in saying that the rules enact that the ball shall be played from where it lies  we admitted that it was  very well then said ralph bingham dont let us waste any more time we will wait for you at woodfield  he addressed his ball and drove a beauty over the trees it flashed out of sight in the direction of the seventeenth tee arthur and i made our way down the hill to play our second                                       it is a curious trait of the human mind that however little personal interest one may have in the result it is impossible to prevent oneself taking sides in any event of a competitive nature i had embarked on this affair in a purely neutral spirit not caring which of the two won and only sorry that both could not lose yet as the morning wore on i found myself almost unconsciously becoming distinctly projukes i did not like the man i objected to his face his manners and the colour of his tie yet there was something in the dogged way in which he struggled against adversity which touched me and won my grudging support many men i felt having been so outmanoeuvred at the start would have given up the contest in despair but arthur jukes for all his defects had the soul of a true golfer he declined to give up in grim silence he hacked his ball through the rough till he reached the high road and then having played twentyseven set himself resolutely to propel it on its long journey  it was a lovely morning and as i bicycled along keeping a fatherly eye on arthurs activities i realized for the first time in my life the full meaning of that exquisite phrase of coleridge      clothing the palpable and familiar     with golden exhalations of the dawn  for in the pellucid air everything seemed weirdly beautiful even arthur jukes heathermixture knickerbockers of which hitherto i had never approved the sun gleamed on their seat as he bent to make his shots in a cheerful and almost a poetic way the birds were singing gaily in the hedgerows and such was my uplifted state that i too burst into song until arthur petulantly desired me to refrain on the plea that though he yielded to no man in his enjoyment of farmyard imitations in their proper place i put him off his stroke and so we passed through bayside in silence and started to cover that long stretch of road which ends in the railway bridge and the gentle descent into woodfield  arthur was not doing badly he was at least keeping them straight and in the circumstances straightness was to be preferred to distance soon after leaving little hadley he had become ambitious and had used his brassey with disastrous results slicing his fiftythird into the rough on the right of the road it had taken him ten with the niblick to get back on to the car tracks and this had taught him prudence  he was now using his putter for every shot and except when he got trapped in the crosslines at the top of the hill just before reaching bayside he had been in no serious difficulties he was playing a nice easy game getting the full face of the putter on to each shot  at the top of the slope that drops down into woodfield high street he paused  i think i might try my brassey again here he said i have a nice lie  is it wise i said  he looked down the hill  what i was thinking he said was that with it i might wing that man bingham i see he is standing right out in the middle of the fairway  i followed his gaze it was perfectly true ralph bingham was leaning on his bicycle in the roadway smoking a cigarette even at this distance one could detect the mans disgustingly complacent expression rupert bailey was sitting with his back against the door of the woodfield garage looking rather used up he was a man who liked to keep himself clean and tidy and it was plain that the crosscountry trip had done him no good he seemed to be scraping mud off his face i learned later that he had had the misfortune to fall into a ditch just beyond bayside  no said arthur on second thoughts the safe game is the one to play ill stick to the putter  we dropped down the hill and presently came up with the opposition i had not been mistaken in thinking that ralph bingham looked complacent the man was smirking  playing three hundred and ninetysix he said as we drew near how are you  i consulted my scorecard  we have played a snappy seven hundred and eleven i said  ralph exulted openly rupert bailey made no comment he was too busy with the alluvial deposits on his person  perhaps you would like to give up the match said ralph to arthur  tchah said arthur  might just as well  pah said arthur  you cant win now  pshaw said arthur  i am aware that arthurs dialogue might have been brighter but he had been through a trying time  rupert bailey sidled up to me  im going home he said  nonsense i replied you are in an official capacity you must stick to your post besides what could be nicer than a pleasant morning ramble  pleasant morning ramble my number nine foot he replied peevishly i want to get back to civilization and set an excavating party with pickaxes to work on me  you take too gloomy a view of the matter you are a little dusty nothing more  and its not only the being buried alive that i mind i cannot stick ralph bingham much longer  you have found him trying  trying why after i had fallen into that ditch and was coming up for the third time all the man did was simply to call to me to admire an infernal iron shot he had just made no sympathy mind you wrapped up in himself why dont you make your man give up the match he cant win  i refuse to admit it much may happen between here and royal square  i have seldom known a prophecy more swiftly fulfilled at this moment the doors of the woodfield garage opened and a small car rolled out with a grimy young man in a sweater at the wheel he brought the machine out into the road and alighted and went back into the garage where we heard him shouting unintelligibly to someone in the rear premises the car remained puffing and panting against the kerb  engaged in conversation with rupert bailey i was paying little attention to this evidence of an awakening world when suddenly i heard a hoarse triumphant cry from arthur jukes and turned i perceived his ball dropping neatly into the cars interior arthur himself brandishing a niblick was dancing about in the fairway  now what about your moving hazards he cried  at this moment the man in the sweater returned carrying a spanner arthur jukes sprang towards him  ill give you five pounds to drive me to royal square he said  i do not know what the sweaterclad young mans engagements for the morning had been originally but nothing could have been more obliging than the ready way in which he consented to revise them at a moments notice i dare say you have noticed that the sturdy peasantry of our beloved land respond to an offer of five pounds as to a buglecall  youre on said the youth  good said arthur jukes  you think youre darned clever said ralph bingham  i know it said arthur  well then said ralph perhaps you will tell us how you propose to get the ball out of the car when you reach royal square  certainly replied arthur you will observe on the side of the vehicle a convenient handle which when turned opens the door the door thus opened i shall chip my ball out  i see said ralph yes i never thought of that  there was something in the way the man spoke that i did not like his mildness seemed to me suspicious he had the air of a man who has something up his sleeve i was still musing on this when arthur called to me impatiently to get in i did so and we drove off arthur was in great spirits he had ascertained from the young man at the wheel that there was no chance of the opposition being able to hire another car at the garage this machine was his own property and the only other one at present in the shop was suffering from complicated trouble of the oilingsystem and would not be able to be moved for at least another day  i however shook my head when he pointed out the advantages of his position i was still wondering about ralph  i dont like it i said  dont like what  ralph binghams manner  of course not said arthur nobody does there have been complaints on all sides  i mean when you told him how you intended to get the ball out of the car  what was the matter with him  he was tooha  how do you mean he was tooha  i have it  what  i see the trap he was laying for you it has just dawned on me no wonder he didnt object to your opening the door and chipping the ball out by doing so you would forfeit the match  nonsense why  because i said it is against the rules to tamper with a hazard if you had got into a sandbunker would you smooth away the sand if you had put your shot under a tree could your caddie hold up the branches to give you a clear shot obviously you would disqualify yourself if you touched that door  arthurs jaw dropped  what then how the deuce am i to get it out  that i said gravely is a question between you and your maker  it was here that arthur jukes forfeited the sympathy which i had begun to feel for him a crafty sinister look came into his eyes  listen he said itll take them an hour to catch up with us suppose during that time that door happened to open accidentally as it were and close again you wouldnt think it necessary to mention the fact eh you would be a good fellow and keep your mouth shut yes you might even see your way to go so far as to back me up in a statement to the effect that i hooked it out with my  i was revolted  i am a golfer i said coldly and i obey the rules  yes but  those rules were drawn up byi bared my head reverentlyby the committee of the royal and ancient at st andrews i have always respected them and i shall not deviate on this occasion from the policy of a lifetime  arthur jukes relapsed into a moody silence he broke it once crossing the west street bridge to observe that he would like to know if i called myself a friend of hisa question which i was able to answer with a wholehearted negative after that he did not speak till the car drew up in front of the majestic hotel in royal square  early as the hour was a certain bustle and animation already prevailed in that centre of the city and the spectacle of a man in a golfcoat and plusfour knickerbockers hacking with a niblick at the floor of a car was not long in collecting a crowd of some dimensions three messengerboys four typists and a gentleman in full eveningdress who obviously possessed or was friendly with someone who possessed a large cellar formed the nucleus of it and they were joined about the time when arthur addressed the ball in order to play his nine hundred and fifteenth by six newsboys eleven charladies and perhaps a dozen assorted loafers all speculating with the liveliest interest as to which particular asylum had had the honour of sheltering arthur before he had contrived to elude the vigilance of his custodians  arthur had prepared for some such contingency he suspended his activities with the niblick and drew from his pocket a large poster which he proceeded to hang over the side of the car it read      come     to     mcclurg and macdonald     18 west street     for     all golfing supplies  his knowledge of psychology had not misled him directly they gathered that he was advertising something the crowd declined to look at it they melted away and arthur returned to his work in solitude  he was taking a wellearned rest after playing his eleven hundred and fifth a nice niblick shot with lots of wrist behind it when out of bridle street there trickled a wearylooking golfball followed in the order named by ralph bingham resolute but going a trifle at the knees and rupert bailey on a bicycle the latter on whose face and limbs the mud had dried made an arresting spectacle  what are you playing i inquired  eleven hundred said rupert we got into a casual dog  a casual dog  yes just before the bridge we were coming along nicely when a stray dog grabbed our nine hundred and ninetyeighth and took it nearly back to woodfield and we had to start all over again how are you getting on  we have just played our eleven hundred and fifth a nice even game i looked at ralphs ball which was lying close to the kerb you are farther from the hole i think your shot bingham  rupert bailey suggested breakfast he was a man who was altogether too fond of creature comforts he had not the true golfing spirit  breakfast i exclaimed  breakfast said rupert firmly if you dont know what it is i can teach you in half a minute you play it with a pot of coffee a knife and fork and about a hundredweight of scrambled eggs try it its a pastime that grows on you  i was surprised when ralph bingham supported the suggestion he was so near holing out that i should have supposed that nothing would have kept him from finishing the match but he agreed heartily  breakfast he said is an excellent idea you go along in ill follow in a moment i want to buy a paper  we went into the hotel and a few minutes later he joined us now that we were actually at the table i confess that the idea of breakfast was by no means repugnant to me the keen air and the exercise had given me an appetite and it was some little time before i was able to assure the waiter definitely that he could cease bringing orders of scrambled eggs the others having finished also i suggested a move i was anxious to get the match over and be free to go home  we filed out of the hotel arthur jukes leading when i had passed through the swingdoors i found him gazing perplexedly up and down the street  what is the matter i asked  its gone  what has gone  the car  oh the car said ralph bingham thats all right didnt i tell you about that i bought it just now and engaged the driver as my chauffeur ive been meaning to buy a car for a long time a man ought to have a car  where is it said arthur blankly the man seemed dazed  i couldnt tell you to a mile or two replied ralph i told the man to drive to glasgow why had you any message for him  but my ball was inside it  now that said ralph is really unfortunate do you mean to tell me you hadnt managed to get it out yet yes that is a little awkward for you im afraid it means that you lose the match  lose the match  certainly the rules are perfectly definite on that point a period of five minutes is allowed for each stroke the player who fails to make his stroke within that time loses the hole unfortunate but there it is  arthur jukes sank down on the path and buried his face in his hands he had the appearance of a broken man once more i am bound to say i felt a certain pity for him he had certainly struggled gamely and it was hard to be beaten like this on the post  playing eleven hundred and one said ralph bingham in his odiously selfsatisfied voice as he addressed his ball he laughed jovially a messengerboy had paused close by and was watching the proceedings gravely ralph bingham patted him on the head  well sonny he said what club would you use here  i claim the match cried arthur jukes springing up ralph bingham regarded him coldly  i beg your pardon  i claim the match repeated arthur jukes the rules say that a player who asks advice from any person other than his caddie shall lose the hole  this is absurd said ralph but i noticed that he had turned pale  i appeal to the judges  we sustain the appeal i said after a brief consultation with rupert bailey the rule is perfectly clear  but you had lost the match already by not playing within five minutes said ralph vehemently  it was not my turn to play you were farther from the pin  well play now go on lets see you make your shot  there is no necessity said arthur frigidly why should i play when you have already disqualified yourself  i claim a draw  i deny the claim  i appeal to the judges  very well we will leave it to the judges  i consulted with rupert bailey it seemed to me that arthur jukes was entitled to the verdict rupert who though an amiable and delightful companion had always been one of natures fatheads could not see it we had to go back to our principals and announce that we had been unable to agree  this is ridiculous said ralph bingham we ought to have had a third judge  at this moment who should come out of the hotel but amanda trivett a veritable goddess from the machine  it seems to me i said that you would both be well advised to leave the decision to miss trivett you could have no better referee  im game said arthur jukes  suits me said ralph bingham  why whatever are you all doing here with your golfclubs asked the girl wonderingly  these two gentlemen i explained have been playing a match and a point has arisen on which the judges do not find themselves in agreement we need an unbiased outside opinion and we should like to put it up to you the facts are as follows  amanda trivett listened attentively but when i had finished she shook her head  im afraid i dont know enough about the game to be able to decide a question like that she said  then we must consult st andrews said rupert bailey  ill tell you who might know said amanda trivett after a moments thought  who is that i asked  my fiance he has just come back from a golfing holiday thats why im in town this morning ive been to meet him he is very good at golf he won a medal at littlemudburyinthewold the day before he left  there was a tense silence i had the delicacy not to look at ralph or arthur then the silence was broken by a sharp crack ralph bingham had broken his mashieniblick across his knee from the direction where arthur jukes was standing there came a muffled gulp  shall i ask him said amanda trivett  dont bother said ralph bingham  it doesnt matter said arthur jukes     8  the heel of achilles   on the young mans face as he sat sipping his gingerale in the clubhouse smokingroom there was a look of disillusionment never again he said  the oldest member glanced up from his paper  you are proposing to give up golf once more he queried  not golf betting on golf the young man frowned ive just been let down badly wouldnt you have thought i had a good thing laying seven to one on mctavish against robinson  undoubtedly said the sage the odds indeed generous as they are scarcely indicate the formers superiority do you mean to tell me that the thing came unstitched  robinson won in a walk after being three down at the turn  strange what happened  why they looked in at the bar to have a refresher before starting for the tenth said the young man his voice quivering and mctavish suddenly discovered that there was a hole in his trouserpocket and sixpence had dropped out he worried so frightfully about it that on the second nine he couldnt do a thing right went completely off his game and didnt win a hole  the sage shook his head gravely  if this is really going to be a lesson to you my boy never to bet on the result of a golfmatch it will be a blessing in disguise there is no such thing as a certainty in golf i wonder if i ever told you a rather curious episode in the career of vincent jopp  the vincent jopp the american multimillionaire  the same you never knew he once came within an ace of winning the american amateur championship did you  i never heard of his playing golf  he played for one season after that he gave it up and has not touched a club since ring the bell and get me a small limejuice and i will tell you all                                       it was long before your time said the oldest member that the events which i am about to relate took place i had just come down from cambridge and was feeling particularly pleased with myself because i had secured the job of private and confidential secretary to vincent jopp then a man in the early thirties busy in laying the foundations of his present remarkable fortune he engaged me and took me with him to chicago  jopp was i think the most extraordinary personality i have encountered in a long and manysided life he was admirably equipped for success in finance having the steely eye and square jaw without which it is hopeless for a man to enter that line of business he possessed also an overwhelming confidence in himself and the ability to switch a cigar from one corner of his mouth to the other without wiggling his ears which as you know is the stamp of the true monarch of the money market he was the nearest approach to the financier on the films the fellow who makes his jawmuscles jump when he is telephoning that i have ever seen  like all successful men he was a man of method he kept a pad on his desk on which he would scribble down his appointments and it was my duty on entering the office each morning to take this pad and type its contents neatly in a looseleaved ledger usually of course these entries referred to business appointments and deals which he was contemplating but one day i was interested to note against the date may 3rd the entry      propose to amelia  i was interested as i say but not surprised though a man of steel and iron there was nothing of the celibate about vincent jopp he was one of those men who marry early and often on three separate occasions before i joined his service he had jumped off the dock to scramble back to shore again later by means of the divorce court lifebelt scattered here and there about the country there were three exmrs jopps drawing their monthly envelope and now it seemed he contemplated the addition of a fourth to the platoon  i was not surprised i say at this resolve of his what did seem a little remarkable to me was the thorough way in which he had thought the thing out this ironwilled man recked nothing of possible obstacles under the date of june 1st was the entry      marry amelia  while in march of the following year he had arranged to have his firstborn christened thomas reginald later on the shortcoating of thomas reginald was arranged for and there was a note about sending him to school many hard things have been said of vincent jopp but nobody has ever accused him of not being a man who looked ahead  on the morning of may 4th jopp came into the office looking i fancied a little thoughtful he sat for some moments staring before him with his brow a trifle furrowed then he seemed to come to himself he rapped his desk  hi you he said it was thus that he habitually addressed me  mr jopp i replied  whats golf  i had at that time just succeeded in getting my handicap down into single figures and i welcomed the opportunity of dilating on the noblest of pastimes but i had barely begun my eulogy when he stopped me  its a game is it  i suppose you could call it that i said but it is an offhand way of describing the holiest  how do you play it  pretty well i said at the beginning of the season i didnt seem able to keep em straight at all but lately ive been doing fine getting better every day whether it was that i was moving my head or gripping too tightly with the right hand  keep the reminiscences for your grandchildren during the long winter evenings he interrupted abruptly as was his habit what i want to know is what a fellow does when he plays golf tell me in as few words as you can just what its all about  you hit a ball with a stick till it falls into a hole  easy he snapped take dictation  i produced my pad  may the fifth take up golf whats an amateur championship  it is the annual competition to decide which is the best player among the amateurs there is also a professional championship and an open event  oh there are golf professionals are there what do they do  they teach golf  which is the best of them  sandy mchoots won both british and american open events last year  wire him to come here at once  but mchoots is in inverlochty in scotland  never mind get him tell him to name his own terms when is the amateur championship  i think it is on september the twelfth this year  all right take dictation september twelfth win amateur championship  i stared at him in amazement but he was not looking at me  got that he said september thiroh i was forgetting add september twelfth corner wheat september thirteenth marry amelia  marry amelia i echoed moistening my pencil  where do you play thiswhatsitsnamegolf  there are clubs all over the country i belong to the wissahicky glen  that a good place  very good  arrange today for my becoming a member                                       sandy mchoots arrived in due course and was shown into the private office  mr mchoots said vincent jopp  mphm said the open champion  i have sent for you mr mchoots because i hear that you are the greatest living exponent of this game of golf  aye said the champion cordially i am that  i wish you to teach me the game i am already somewhat behind schedule owing to the delay incident upon your long journey so let us start at once name a few of the most important points in connection with the game my secretary will make notes of them and i will memorize them in this way we shall save time now what is the most important thing to remember when playing golf  keep your heid still  a simple task  na sae simple as it soonds  nonsense said vincent jopp curtly if i decide to keep my head still i shall keep it still what next  keep yer ee on the ba  it shall be attended to and the next  dinna press  i wont and to resume  mr mchoots ran through a dozen of the basic rules and i took them down in shorthand vincent jopp studied the list  very good easier than i had supposed on the first tee at wissahicky glen at eleven sharp tomorrow mr mchoots hi you  sir i said  go out and buy me a set of clubs a red jacket a cloth cap a pair of spiked shoes and a ball  one ball  certainly what need is there of more  it sometimes happens i explained that a player who is learning the game falls to hit his ball straight and then he often loses it in the rough at the side of the fairway  absurd said vincent jopp if i set out to drive my ball straight i shall drive it straight good morning mr mchoots you will excuse me now i am busy cornering woven textiles                                       golf is in its essence a simple game you laugh in a sharp bitter barking manner when i say this but nevertheless it is true where the average man goes wrong is in making the game difficult for himself observe the nonplayer the man who walks round with you for the sake of the fresh air he will hole out with a single carefree flick of his umbrella the twentyfoot putt over which you would ponder and hesitate for a full minute before sending it right off the line put a driver in his hands and he pastes the ball into the next county without a thought it is only when he takes to the game in earnest that he becomes selfconscious and anxious and tops his shots even as you and i a man who could retain through his golfing career the almost scornful confidence of the nonplayer would be unbeatable fortunately such an attitude of mind is beyond the scope of human nature  it was not however beyond the scope of vincent jopp the superman vincent jopp was i am inclined to think the only golfer who ever approached the game in a spirit of pure reason i have read of men who never having swum in their lives studied a textbook on their way down to the swimming bath mastered its contents and dived in and won the big race in just such a spirit did vincent jopp start to play golf he committed mchootss hints to memory and then went out on the links and put them into practice he came to the tee with a clear picture in his mind of what he had to do and he did it he was not intimidated like the average novice by the thought that if he pulled in his hands he would slice or if he gripped too tightly with the right he would pull pulling in the hands was an error so he did not pull in his hands gripping too tightly was a defect so he did not grip too tightly with that weird concentration which had served him so well in business he did precisely what he had set out to dono less and no more golf with vincent jopp was an exact science  the annals of the game are studded with the names of those who have made rapid progress in their first season colonel quill we read in our vardon took up golf at the age of fiftysix and by devising an ingenious machine consisting of a fishingline and a sawndown bedpost was enabled to keep his head so still that he became a scratch player before the end of the year but no one i imagine except vincent jopp has ever achieved scratch on his first morning on the links  the main difference we are told between the amateur and the professional golfer is the fact that the latter is always aiming at the pin while the former has in his mind a vague picture of getting somewhere reasonably near it vincent jopp invariably went for the pin he tried to hole out from anywhere inside two hundred and twenty yards the only occasion on which i ever heard him express any chagrin or disappointment was during the afternoon round on his first day out when from the tee on the two hundred and eighty yard seventh he laid his ball within six inches of the hole  a marvellous shot i cried genuinely stirred  too much to the right said vincent jopp frowning  he went on from triumph to triumph he won the monthly medal in may june july august and september towards the end of may he was heard to complain that wissahicky glen was not a sporting course the greens committee sat up night after night trying to adjust his handicap so as to give other members an outside chance against him the golf experts of the daily papers wrote columns about his play and it was pretty generally considered throughout the country that it would be a pure formality for anyone else to enter against him in the amateur championshipan opinion which was borne out when he got through into the final without losing a hole a safe man to have betted on you would have said but mark the sequel                                       the american amateur championship was held that year in detroit i had accompanied my employer there for though engaged on this nervewearing contest he refused to allow his business to be interfered with as he had indicated in his schedule he was busy at the time cornering wheat and it was my task to combine the duties of caddy and secretary each day i accompanied him round the links with my notebook and his bag of clubs and the progress of his various matches was somewhat complicated by the arrival of a stream of telegraphboys bearing important messages he would read these between the strokes and dictate replies to me never however taking more than the five minutes allowed by the rules for an interval between strokes i am inclined to think that it was this that put the finishing touch on his opponents discomfiture it is not soothing for a nervous man to have the game hung up on the green while his adversary dictates to his caddy a letter beginning yours of the 11th inst received and contents noted in reply would state this sort of thing puts a man off his game  i was resting in the lobby of our hotel after a strenuous days work when i found that i was being paged i answered the summons and was informed that a lady wished to see me her card bore the name miss amelia merridew amelia the name seemed familiar then i remembered amelia was the name of the girl vincent jopp intended to marry the fourth of the long line of mrs jopps i hurried to present myself and found a tall slim girl who was plainly labouring under a considerable agitation  miss merridew i said  yes she murmured my name will be strange to you  am i right i queried in supposing that you are the lady to whom mr jopp  i am i am she replied and oh what shall i do  kindly give me particulars i said taking out my pad from force of habit  she hesitated a moment as if afraid to speak  you are caddying for mr jopp in the final tomorrow she said at last  i am  then could youwould you mindwould it be giving you too much trouble if i asked you to shout boo at him when he is making his stroke if he looks like winning  i was perplexed  i dont understand  i see that i must tell you all i am sure you will treat what i say as absolutely confidential  certainly  i am provisionally engaged to mr jopp  provisionally  she gulped  let me tell you my story mr jopp asked me to marry him and i would rather do anything on earth than marry him but how could i say no with those awful eyes of his boring me through i knew that if i said no he would argue me out of it in two minutes i had an idea i gathered that he had never played golf so i told him that i would marry him if he won the amateur championship this year and now i find that he has been a golfer all along and what is more a plus man it isnt fair  he was not a golfer when you made that condition i said he took up the game on the following day  impossible how could he have become as good as he is in this short time  because he is vincent jopp in his lexicon there is no such word as impossible  she shuddered  what a man but i cant marry him she cried i want to marry somebody else oh wont you help me do shout boo at him when he is starting his downswing  i shook my head  it would take more than a single boo to put vincent jopp off his stroke  but wont you try it  i cannot my duty is to my employer  oh do  no no duty is duty and paramount with me besides i have a bet on him to win  the stricken girl uttered a faint moan and tottered away                                       i was in our suite shortly after dinner that night going over some of the notes i had made that day when the telephone rang jopp was out at the time taking a short stroll with his afterdinner cigar i unhooked the receiver and a female voice spoke  is that mr jopp  mr jopps secretary speaking mr jopp is out  oh its nothing important will you say that mrs luella mainprice jopp called up to wish him luck i shall be on the course tomorrow to see him win the final  i returned to my notes soon afterwards the telephone rang again  vincent dear  mr jopps secretary speaking  oh will you say that mrs jane jukes jopp called up to wish him luck i shall be there tomorrow to see him play  i resumed my work i had hardly started when the telephone rang for the third time  mr jopp  mr jopps secretary speaking  this is mrs agnes parsons jopp i just called up to wish him luck i shall be looking on tomorrow  i shifted my work nearer to the telephonetable so as to be ready for the next call i had heard that vincent jopp had only been married three times but you never knew  presently jopp came in  anybody called up he asked  nobody on business an assortment of your wives were on the wire wishing you luck they asked me to say that they will be on the course tomorrow  for a moment it seemed to me that the mans iron repose was shaken  luella he asked  she was the first  jane  and jane  and agnes  agnes i said is right  hm said vincent jopp and for the first time since i had known him i thought that he was ill at ease                                       the day of the final dawned bright and clear at least i was not awake at the time to see but i suppose it did for at nine oclock when i came down to breakfast the sun was shining brightly the first eighteen holes were to be played before lunch starting at eleven until twenty minutes before the hour vincent jopp kept me busy taking dictation partly on matters connected with his wheat deal and partly on a signed article dealing with the final entitled how i won at eleven sharp we were out on the first tee  jopps opponent was a nicelooking young man but obviously nervous he giggled in a distraught sort of way as he shook hands with my employer  well may the best man win he said  i have arranged to do so replied jopp curtly and started to address his ball  there was a large crowd at the tee and as jopp started his downswing from somewhere on the outskirts of this crowd there came suddenly a musical boo it rang out in the clear morning air like a bugle  i had been right in my estimate of vincent jopp his forceful stroke never wavered the head of his club struck the ball despatching it a good two hundred yards down the middle of the fairway as we left the tee i saw amelia merridew being led away with bowed head by two members of the greens committee poor girl my heart bled for her and yet after all fate had been kind in removing her from the scene even in custody for she could hardly have borne to watch the proceedings vincent jopp made rings round his antagonist hole after hole he won in his remorseless machinelike way until when lunchtime came at the end of the eighteenth he was ten up all the other holes had been halved  it was after lunch as we made our way to the first tee that the advanceguard of the mrs jopps appeared in the person of luella mainprice jopp a kittenish little woman with blond hair and a pekingese dog i remembered reading in the papers that she had divorced my employer for persistent and aggravated mental cruelty calling witnesses to bear out her statement that he had said he did not like her in pink and that on two separate occasions had insisted on her dog eating the leg of a chicken instead of the breast but time the great healer seemed to have removed all bitterness and she greeted him affectionately  wassums going to win great big championship against nasty rough strong man she said  such said vincent jopp is my intention it was kind of you luella to trouble to come and watch me i wonder if you know mrs agnes parsons jopp he said courteously indicating a kindlooking motherly woman who had just come up how are you agnes  if you had asked me that question this morning vincent replied mrs agnes parsons jopp i should have been obliged to say that i felt far from well i had an odd throbbing feeling in the left elbow and i am sure my temperature was above the normal but this afternoon i am a little better how are you vincent  although she had as i recalled from the reports of the case been compelled some years earlier to request the court to sever her marital relations with vincent jopp on the ground of calculated and inhuman brutality in that he had callously refused in spite of her pleadings to take old dr bennetts tonic swampjuice three times a day her voice as she spoke was kind and even anxious badly as this man had treated herand i remember hearing that several of the jury had been unable to restrain their tears when she was in the witnessbox giving her evidencethere still seemed to linger some remnants of the old affection  i am quite well thank you agnes said vincent jopp  are you wearing your liverpad  a frown flitted across my employers strong face  i am not wearing my liverpad he replied brusquely  oh vincent how rash of you  he was about to speak when a sudden exclamation from his rear checked him a geniallooking woman in a sports coat was standing there eyeing him with a sort of humorous horror  well jane he said  i gathered that this was mrs jane jukes jopp the wife who had divorced him for systematic and ingrowing fiendishness on the ground that he had repeatedly outraged her feelings by wearing a white waistcoat with a dinnerjacket she continued to look at him dumbly and then uttered a sort of strangled hysterical laugh  those legs she cried those legs  vincent jopp flushed darkly even the strongest and most silent of us have our weaknesses and my employers was the rooted idea that he looked well in knickerbockers it was not my place to try to dissuade him but there was no doubt that they did not suit him nature in bestowing upon him a massive head and a jutting chin had forgotten to finish him off at the other end vincent jopps legs were skinny  you poor dear man went on mrs jane jukes jopp what practical joker ever lured you into appearing in public in knickerbockers  i dont object to the knickerbockers said mrs agnes parsons jopp but when he foolishly comes out in quite a strong east wind without his liverpad  little tinkyting dont need no liverpad he dont said mrs luella mainprice jopp addressing the animal in her arms because he was his muzzers pet he was  i was standing quite near to vincent jopp and at this moment i saw a bead of perspiration spring out on his forehead and into his steely eyes there came a positively hunted look i could understand and sympathize napoleon himself would have wilted if he had found himself in the midst of a trio of females one talking babytalk another fussing about his health and the third making derogatory observations on his lower limbs vincent jopp was becoming unstrung  may as well be starting shall we  it was jopps opponent who spoke there was a strange set look on his facethe look of a man whose back is against the wall ten down on the mornings round he had drawn on his reserves of courage and was determined to meet the inevitable bravely  vincent jopp nodded absently then turned to me  keep those women away from me he whispered tensely theyll put me off my stroke  put you off your stroke i exclaimed incredulously  yes me how the deuce can i concentrate with people babbling about liverpads andand knickerbockers all round me keep them away  he started to address his ball and there was a weak uncertainty in the way he did it that prepared me for what was to come his club rose wavered fell and the ball badly topped trickled two feet and sank into a cuppy lie  is that good or bad inquired mrs luella mainprice jopp  a sort of desperate hope gleamed in the eye of the other competitor in the final he swung with renewed vigour his ball sang through the air and lay within chipshot distance of the green  at the very least said mrs agnes parsons jopp i hope vincent that you are wearing flannel next your skin  i heard jopp give a stifled groan as he took his spoon from the bag he made a gallant effort to retrieve the lost ground but the ball struck a stone and bounded away into the long grass to the side of the green his opponent won the hole  we moved to the second tee  now that young man said mrs jane jukes jopp indicating her late husbands blushing antagonist is quite right to wear knickerbockers he can carry them off but a glance in the mirror must have shown you that you  im sure youre feverish vincent said mrs agnes parsons jopp solicitously you are quite flushed there is a wild gleam in your eyes  muzzers pet got little buttons of eyes that dont never have no wild gleam in zem because hes muzzers own darling he was said mrs luella mainprice jopp  a hollow groan escaped vincent jopps ashen lips  i need not recount the play hole by hole i think there are some subjects that are too painful it was pitiful to watch vincent jopp in his downfall by the end of the first nine his lead had been reduced to one and his antagonist rendered a new man by success was playing magnificent golf on the next hole he drew level then with a superhuman effort jopp contrived to halve the eleventh twelfth and thirteenth it seemed as though his iron will might still assert itself but on the fourteenth the end came  he had driven a superb ball outdistancing his opponent by a full fifty yards the latter played a good second to within a few feet of the green and then as vincent jopp was shaping for his stroke luella mainprice gave tongue  vincent  well  vincent that other manbad mannot playing fair when your back was turned just now he gave his ball a great bang i was watching him  at any rate said mrs agnes parsons jopp i do hope when the game is over vincent that you will remember to cool slowly  flesho cried mrs jane jukes jopp triumphantly ive been trying to remember the name all the afternoon i saw about it in one of the papers the advertisements speak most highly of it you take it before breakfast and again before retiring and they guarantee it to produce firm healthy flesh on the most sparselycovered limbs in next to no time now will you remember to get a bottle tonight it comes in two sizes the fiveshilling or large size and the smaller at halfacrown g k chesterton writes that he used it regularly for years  vincent jopp uttered a quavering moan and his hand as he took the mashie from his bag was trembling like an aspen  ten minutes later he was on his way back to the clubhouse a beaten man                                       and so concluded the oldest member you see that in golf there is no such thing as a soft snap you can never be certain of the finest player anything may happen to the greatest expert at any stage of the game in a recent competition george duncan took eleven shots over a hole which eighteenhandicap men generally do in five no back horses or go down to throgmorton street and try to take it away from the rothschilds and i will applaud you as a shrewd and cautious financier but to bet at golf is pure gambling     9  the rough stuff   into the basking warmth of the day there had crept with the approach of evening that heartening crispness which heralds the advent of autumn already in the valley by the ninth tee some of the trees had begun to try on strange colours in tentative experiment against the coming of natures annual fancy dress ball when the soberest tree casts off its workaday suit of green and plunges into a riot of reds and yellows on the terrace in front of the clubhouse an occasional withered leaf fluttered down on the table where the oldest member sat sipping a thoughtful seltzer and lemon and listening with courteous gravity to a young man in a sweater and golf breeches who occupied the neighbouring chair  she is a dear girl said the young man a little moodily a dear girl in every respect but somehowi dont knowwhen i see her playing golf i cant help thinking that womans place is in the home  the oldest member inclined his frosted head  you think he said that lovely woman loses in queenly dignity when she fails to slam the ball squarely on the meat  i dont mind her missing the pill said the young man but i think her attitude toward the game is too lighthearted  perhaps it cloaks a deeper feeling one of the noblest women i ever knew used to laugh merrily when she foozled a short putt it was only later when i learned that in the privacy of her home she would weep bitterly and bite holes in the sofa cushions that i realized that she did but wear the mask continue to encourage your fiancee to play the game my boy much happiness will reward you i could tell you a story  a young woman of singular beauty and rather statuesque appearance came out of the clubhouse carrying a baby swaddled in flannel as she drew near the table she said to the baby  chicketty wicketty wicketty wipsey pop  in other respects her intelligence appeared to be above the ordinary  isnt he a darling she said addressing the oldest member  the sage cast a meditative eye upon the infant except to the eye of love it looked like a skinned poached egg  unquestionably so he replied  dont you think he looks more like his father every day  for a brief instant the oldest member seemed to hesitate  assuredly he said is your husband out on the links today  not today he had to see wilberforce off on the train to scotland  your brother is going to scotland  yes ramsden has such a high opinion of the schools up there i did say that scotland was a long way off and he said yes that had occurred to him but that we must make sacrifices for willies good he was very brave and cheerful about it well i mustnt stay theres quite a nip in the air and rammikins will get a nasty cold in his precious little button of a nose if i dont walk him about say byebye to the gentleman rammy  the oldest member watched her go thoughtfully  there is a nip in the air he said and unlike our late acquaintance in the flannel i am not in my first youth come with me i want to show you something  he led the way into the clubhouse and paused before the wall of the smokingroom this was decorated from top to bottom with bold caricatures of members of the club  these he said are the work of a young newspaper artist who belongs here a clever fellow he has caught the expressions of these men wonderfully his only failure indeed is that picture of myself he regarded it with distaste and a touch of asperity crept into his manner i dont know why the committee lets it stay there he said irritably it isnt a bit like he recovered himself but all the others are excellent excellent though i believe many of the subjects are under the erroneous impression that they bear no resemblance to the originals here is the picture i wished to show you that is ramsden waters the husband of the lady who has just left us  the portrait which he indicated was that of a man in the early thirties pale saffron hair surmounted a receding forehead pale blue eyes looked out over a mouth which wore a pale weak smile from the centre of which protruded two teeth of a rabbitlike character  golly what a map exclaimed the young man at his side  precisely said the oldest member you now understand my momentary hesitation in agreeing with mrs waters that the baby was like its father i was torn by conflicting emotions on the one hand politeness demanded that i confirm any statement made by a lady common humanity on the other hand made it repugnant to me to knock an innocent child yes that is ramsden waters sit down and take the weight off your feet and i will tell you about him the story illustrates a favourite theory of mine that it is an excellent thing that women should be encouraged to take up golf there are i admit certain drawbacks attendant on their presence on the links i shall not readily forget the occasion on which a low raking drive of mine at the eleventh struck the ladies tee box squarely and came back and stunned my caddie causing me to lose stroke and distance nevertheless i hold that the advantages outnumber the drawbacks golf humanizes women humbles their haughty natures tends in short to knock out of their systems a certain modicum of that superciliousness that swank which makes wooing a tough proposition for the diffident male you may have found this yourself  well as a matter of fact admitted the young man now i come to think of it i have noticed that genevieve has shown me a bit more respect since she took up the game when i drive 230 yards after she had taken six sloshes to cover fifty i sometimes think that a new light comes into her eyes  exactly said the sage                                       from earliest youth said the oldest member ramsden waters had always been of a shrinking nature he seemed permanently scared possibly his nurse had frightened him with tales of horror in his babyhood if so she must have been the edgar allan poe of her sex for by the time he reached mens estate ramsden waters had about as much ferocity and selfassertion as a blanc mange even with other men he was noticeably timid and with women he comported himself in a manner that roused their immediate scorn and antagonism he was one of those men who fall over their feet and start apologizing for themselves the moment they see a woman his idea of conversing with a girl was to perspire and tie himself into knots making the while a strange gurgling sound like the language of some primitive tribe if ever a remark of any coherence emerged from his tangled vocal cords it dealt with the weather and he immediately apologized and qualified it to such a man women are merciless and it speedily became an article of faith with the feminine population of this locality that ramsden waters was an unfortunate incident and did not belong finally after struggling for a time to keep up a connection in social circles he gave it up and became a sort of hermit  i think that caricature i just showed you weighed rather heavily on the poor fellow just as he was nerving himself to make another attempt to enter society he would catch sight of it and say to himself what hope is there for a man with a face like that these caricaturists are too ready to wound people simply in order to raise a laugh personally i am broadminded enough to smile at that portrait of myself it has given me great enjoyment though why the committee permits it tobut then of course it isnt a bit like whereas that of ramsden waters not only gave the mans exact appearance very little exaggerated but laid bare his very soul that portrait is the portrait of a chump and such ramsden waters undeniably was  by the end of the first year in the neighbourhood ramsden as i say had become practically a hermit he lived all by himself in a house near the fifteenth green seeing nobody going nowhere his only solace was golf his late father had given him an excellent education and even as early as his seventeenth year i believe he was going round difficult courses in par yet even this admirable gift which might have done him social service was rendered negligible by the fact that he was too shy and shrinking to play often with other men as a rule he confined himself to golfing by himself in the mornings and late evenings when the links were more or less deserted yes in his twentyninth year ramsden waters had sunk to the depth of becoming a secret golfer  one lovely morning in summer a scented morning of green and blue and gold when the birds sang in the trees and the air had that limpid clearness which makes the first hole look about 100 yards long instead of 345 ramsden waters alone as ever stood on the first tee addressing his ball for a space he waggled masterfully then drawing his club back with a crisp swish brought it down and as he did so a voice behind him cried  bing  ramsdens driver wabbled at the last moment the ball flopped weakly among the trees on the right of the course ramsden turned to perceive standing close beside him a small fat boy in a sailor suit there was a pause  rotten said the boy austerely  ramsden gulped and then suddenly he saw that the boy was not alone about a medium approachputt distance moving gracefully and languidly towards him was a girl of such pronounced beauty that ramsden waterss heart looped the loop twice in rapid succession it was the first time that he had seen eunice bray and like most men who saw her for the first time he experienced the sensations of one in an express lift at the tenth floor going down who has left the majority of his internal organs up on the twentysecond he felt a dazed emptiness the world swam before his eyes  you yourself saw eunice just now and though you are in a sense immune being engaged to a charming girl of your own i noticed that you unconsciously braced yourself up and tried to look twice as handsome as nature ever intended you to you smirked and if you had a moustache you would have twiddled it you can imagine then the effect which this vision of loveliness had on lonely diffident ramsden waters it got right in amongst him  im afraid my little brother spoiled your stroke said eunice she did not speak at all apologetically but rather as a goddess might have spoken to a swineherd  ramsden yammered noiselessly as always in the presence of the opposite sex and more than ever now his vocal cords appeared to have tied themselves in a knot which would have baffled a sailor and might have perplexed houdini he could not even gargle  he is very fond of watching golf said the girl  she took the boy by the hand and was about to lead him off when ramsden miraculously recovered speech  would he like to come round with me he croaked how he had managed to acquire the nerve to make the suggestion he could never understand i suppose that in certain supreme moments a sort of desperate recklessness descends on nervous men  how very kind of you said the girl indifferently but im afraid  i want to go shrilled the boy i want to go  fond as eunice bray was of her little brother i imagine that the prospect of having him taken off her hands on a fine summer morning when all nature urged her to sit in the shade on the terrace and read a book was not unwelcome  it would be very kind of you if you would let him said eunice he wasnt able to go to the circus last week and it was a great disappointment this will do instead  she turned toward the terrace and ramsden his head buzzing tottered into the jungle to find his ball followed by the boy  i have never been able to extract full particulars of that mornings round from ramsden if you speak of it to him he will wince and change the subject yet he seems to have had the presence of mind to pump wilberforce as to the details of his home life and by the end of the round he had learned that eunice and her brother had just come to visit an aunt who lived in the neighbourhood their house was not far from the links eunice was not engaged to be married and the aunt made a hobby of collecting dry seaweed which she pressed and pasted in an album one sometimes thinks that aunts live entirely for pleasure  at the end of the round ramsden staggered on to the terrace tripping over his feet and handed wilberforce back in good condition eunice who had just reached the chapter where the hero decides to give up all for love thanked him perfunctorily without looking up from her book and so ended the first spasm of ramsden waterss life romance                                       there are few things more tragic than the desire of the moth for the star and it is a curious fact that the spectacle of a star almost invariably fills the most sensible moth with thoughts above his station no doubt if ramsden waters had stuck around and waited long enough there might have come his way in the fullness of time some nice homely girl with a squint and a good disposition who would have been about his form in his modest day dreams he had aspired to nothing higher but the sight of eunice bray seemed to have knocked all the sense out of the man he must have known that he stood no chance of becoming anything to her other than a handy means of getting rid of little wilberforce now and again why the very instant that eunice appeared in the place every eligible bachelor for miles around her tossed his head with a loud snorting sound and galloped madly in her direction dashing young devils they were handsome wellknit fellows with the figures of greek gods and the faces of movie heroes any one of them could have named his own price from the advertisers of collars they were the sort of young men you see standing grandly beside the fullpage picture of the sevenseater magnifico car in the magazines and it was against this field that ramsden waters the man with the unshuffled face dared to pit his feeble personality one weeps  something of the magnitude of the task he had undertaken must have come home to ramsden at a very early point in the proceedings at eunices home at the hour when women receive callers he was from the start a mere unconsidered unit in the mob scene while his rivals clustered thickly about the girl he was invariably somewhere on the outskirts listening limply to the aunt i imagine that seldom has any young man had such golden opportunities of learning all about dried seaweed indeed by the end of the month ramsden waters could not have known more about seaweed if he had been a deep sea fish and yet he was not happy he was in a position if he had been at a dinner party and things had got a bit slow to have held the table spellbound with the first hand information about dried seaweed straight from the stable yet nevertheless he chafed his soul writhed and sickened within him he lost weight and went right off his approach shots i confess that my heart bled for the man  his only consolation was that nobody else not even the fellows who worked their way right through the jam and got seats in the front row where they could glare into her eyes and hang on her lips and all that sort of thing seemed to be making any better progress  and so matters went on till one day eunice decided to take up golf her motive for doing this was i believe simply because kitty manders who had won a small silver cup at a monthly handicap receiving thirtysix was always dragging the conversation round to this trophy and if there was one firm article in eunice brays simple creed it was that she would be hanged if she let kitty who was by way of being a rival on a small scale put anything over on her i do not defend eunice but women are women and i doubt if any of them really take up golf in that holy questofthegrail spirit which animates men i have known girls to become golfers as an excuse for wearing pink jumpers and one at least who did it because she had read in the beauty hints in the evening paper that it made you lissome girls will be girls  her first lessons eunice received from the professional but after that she saved money by distributing herself among her hordes of admirers who were only too willing to give up good matches to devote themselves to her tuition by degrees she acquired a fair skill and a confidence in her game which was not altogether borne out by results from ramsden waters she did not demand a lesson for one thing it never occurred to her that so poorspirited a man could be of any use at the game and for another ramsden was always busy tooling round with little wilberforce  yet it was with ramsden that she was paired in the first competition for which she entered the annual mixed foursomes and it was on the same evening that the list of the draw went up on the notice board that ramsden proposed  the mind of a man in love works in strange ways to you and to me there would seem to be no reason why the fact that eunices name and his own had been drawn out of a hat together should so impress ramsden but he looked on it as an act of god it seemed to him to draw them close together to set up a sort of spiritual affinity in a word it acted on the poor fellow like a tonic and that very night he went around to her house and having after a long and extremely interesting conversation with her aunt contrived to get her alone coughed eleven times in a strangled sort of way and suggested that the wedding bells should ring out  eunice was more startled than angry  of course im tremendously complimented mr she had to pause to recall the name mr  waters said ramsden humbly  of course yes mr waters as i say its a great compliment  not at all  a great compliment  no no murmured ramsden obsequiously  i wish you wouldnt interrupt snapped eunice with irritation no girl likes to have to keep going back and trying over her speeches its a great compliment but it is quite impossible  just as you say of course agreed ramsden  what demanded eunice have you to offer me i dont mean money i mean something more spiritual what is there in you mr walter  waters  mr waters what is there in you that would repay a girl for giving up the priceless boon of freedom  i know a lot about dried seaweed suggested ramsden hopefully  eunice shook her head  no she said it is quite impossible you have paid me the greatest compliment a man can pay a woman mr waterson  waters said ramsden ill write it down for you  please dont trouble i am afraid we shall never meet again  but we are partners in the mixed foursomes tomorrow  oh yes so we are said eunice well mind you play up i want to win a cup more than anything on earth  ah said ramsden if only i could win what i want to win more than anything else on earth you i mean he added to make his meaning clear if i could win you his tongue tied itself in a bow knot round his uvula and he could say no more he moved slowly to the door paused with his fingers on the handle for one last look over his shoulder and walked silently into the cupboard where eunices aunt kept her collection of dried seaweed  his second start was favoured with greater luck and he found himself out in the hall and presently in the cool air of the night with the stars shining down on him had those silent stars ever shone down on a more brokenhearted man had the cool air of the night ever fanned a more fevered brow ah yes or rather ah no  there was not a very large entry for the mixed foursomes competition in my experience there seldom is men are as a rule idealists and wish to keep their illusions regarding women intact and it is difficult for the most broadminded man to preserve a chivalrous veneration for the sex after a woman has repeatedly sliced into the rough and left him a difficult recovery women tooi am not speaking of the occasional champions but of the average woman the one with the handicap of 33 who plays in highheeled shoesare apt to giggle when they foozle out of a perfect lie and this makes for misogyny only eight couples assembled on the tenth tee where our foursomes matches start on the morning after ramsden waters had proposed to eunice six of these were negligible consisting of males of average skill and young women who played golf because it kept them out in the fresh air looking over the field ramsden felt that the only serious rivalry was to be feared from marcella bingley and her colleague a 16handicap youth named george perkins with whom they were paired for the opening round george was a pretty indifferent performer but marcella a weatherbeaten female with bobbed hair and the wrists of a welterweight pugilist had once appeared in the womens open championship and swung a nasty iron  ramsden watched her drive a nice clean shot down the middle of the fairway and spoke earnestly to eunice his heart was in this competition for though the first prize in the mixed foursomes does not perhaps entitle the winners to a place in the hall of fame ramsden had the soul of the true golfer and the true golfer wants to win whenever he starts whether he is playing in a friendly round or in the open championship  what weve got to do is to play steadily he said dont try any fancy shots go for safety miss bingley is a tough proposition but george perkins is sure to foozle a few and if we play safe weve got em cold the others dont count  you notice something odd about this speech something in it strikes you as curious precisely it affected eunice bray in the same fashion in the first place it contains fortyfour words some of them of two syllables others of even greater length in the second place it was spoken crisply almost commandingly without any of that hesitation and stammering which usually characterized ramsden waterss utterances eunice was puzzled she was also faintly resentful true there was not a word in what he had said that was calculated to bring the blush of shame to the cheek of modesty nevertheless she felt vaguely that ramsden waters had exceeded the limits she had been prepared for a gurgling ramsden waters a ramsden waters who fell over his large feet and perspired but here was a ramsden waters who addressed her not merely as an equal but with more than a touch of superiority she eyed him coldly but he had turned to speak to little wilberforce who was to accompany them on the round  and you my lad said ramsden curtly you kindly remember that this is a competition and keep your merry flow of conversation as much as possible to yourself youve got a bad habit of breaking into small talk when a mans addressing the ball  if you think that my brother will be in the way began eunice coldly  oh i dont mind him coming round said ramsden if he keeps quiet  eunice gasped she had not played enough golf to understand how that noblest of games changes a mans whole nature when on the links she was thinking of something crushing to say to him when he advanced to the tee to drive off  he drove a perfect ball hard and low with a lot of roll even eunice was impressed  good shot partner she said  ramsden was apparently unaware that she had spoken he was gazing down the fairway with his club over his left shoulder in an attitude almost identical with that of sandy mcbean in the plate labelled the drivecorrect finish to face page twentyfour of his monumental work how to become a scratch player your first season by studying photographs eunice bit her lip she was piqued she felt as if she had patted the head of a pet lamb and the lamb had turned and bitten her in the finger  i said good shot partner she repeated coldly  yes said ramsden but dont talk it prevents one concentrating he turned to wilberforce and dont let me have to tell you that again he said  wilberforce has been like a mouse  that is what i complain of said ramsden mice make a beastly scratching sound and thats what he was doing when i drove that ball  he was only playing with the sand in the tee box  well if he does it again i shall be reluctantly compelled to take steps  they walked in silence to where the ball had stopped it was nicely perched up on the grass and to have plunked it on to the green with an iron should have been for any reasonable golfer the work of a moment eunice however only succeeded in slicing it feebly into the rough  ramsden reached for his niblick and plunged into the bushes and presently as if it had been shot up by some convulsion of nature the ball accompanied on the early stages of its journey by about a pound of mixed mud grass and pebbles soared through the air and fell on the green but the mischief had been done miss bingley putting forcefully put the opposition ball down for a four and won the hole  eunice now began to play better and as ramsden was on the top of his game a dingdong race ensued for the remainder of the first nine holes the bingleyperkins combination owing to some inspired work by the female of the species managed to keep their lead up to the tricky ravine hole but there george perkins as might have been expected of him deposited the ball right in among the rocks and ramsden and eunice drew level the next four holes were halved and they reached the clubhouse with no advantage to either side here there was a pause while miss bingley went to the professionals shop to have a tack put into the leather of her mashie which had worked loose george perkins and little wilberforce who believed in keeping up their strength melted silently away in the direction of the refreshment bar and ramsden and eunice were alone                                       the pique which eunice had felt at the beginning of the game had vanished by now she was feeling extremely pleased with her performance on the last few holes and would have been glad to go into the matter fully also she was conscious of a feeling not perhaps of respect so much as condescending tolerance towards ramsden he might be a pretty minus quantity in a drawingroom or at a dance but in a bunker or out in the open with a cleek eunice felt youd be surprised she was just about to address him in a spirit of kindliness when he spoke  better keep your brassey in the bag on the next nine he said stick to the iron the great thing is to keep em straight  eunice gasped indeed had she been of a less remarkable beauty one would have said that she snorted the sky turned black and all her amiability was swept away in a flood of fury the blood left her face and surged back in a rush of crimson you are engaged to be married and i take it that there exists between you and your fiancee the utmost love and trust and understanding but would you have the nerve could you summon up the cold callous gall to tell your genevieve that she wasnt capable of using her wooden clubs i think not yet this was what ramsden waters had told eunice and the delicately nurtured girl staggered before the coarse insult her refined sensitive nature was all churned up  ever since she had made her first drive at golf she had prided herself on her use of the wood her brother and her brassey were the only things she loved and here was this man deliberately eunice choked  mr waters  before they could have further speech george perkins and little wilberforce ambled in a bloated way out of the clubhouse  ive had three ginger ales observed the boy where do we go from here  our honour said ramsden shoot  eunice took out her driver without a word her little figure was tense with emotion she swung vigorously and pulled the ball far out on to the fairway of the ninth hole  even off the tee said ramsden you had better use an iron you must keep em straight  their eyes met hers were glittering with the fury of a woman scorned his were cold and hard and suddenly as she looked at his awful pale set golf face something seemed to snap in eunice a strange sensation of weakness and humility swept over her so might the cave woman have felt when with her back against a cliff and unable to dodge she watched her suitor take his club in the interlocking grip and after a preliminary waggle start his back swing  the fact was that all her life eunice had been accustomed to the homage of men from the time she had put her hair up every man she had met had grovelled before her and she had acquired a mental attitude toward the other sex which was a blend of indifference and contempt for the cringing specimens who curled up and died all over the hearthrug if she spoke a cold word to them she had nothing but scorn she dreamed wistfully of those brusque cavemen of whom she read in the novels which she took out of the village circulating library the female novelist who was at that time her favourite always supplied with each chunk of wholesome and invigorating fiction one beetlebrowed hero with a grouch and a scowl who rode wild horses over the countryside till they foamed at the mouth and treated women like dirt that eunice had thought yearningly as she talked to youths whose spines turned to gelatine at one glance from her bright eyes was the sort of man she wanted to meet and never seemed to come across  of all the men whose acquaintance she had made recently she had despised ramsden waters most where others had grovelled he had tied himself into knots where others had gazed at her like sheep he had goggled at her like a kicked spaniel she had only permitted him to hang round because he seemed so fond of little wilberforce and here he was ordering her about and piercing her with gimlet eyes for all the world as if he were claude delamere in the thirtysecond chapter of the man of chilled steel the one where claude drags lady matilda around the smokingroom by her hair because she gave the rose from her bouquet to the italian count  she was halfcowed halfresentful  mr winklethorpe told me i was very good with the wooden clubs she said defiantly  hes a great kidder said ramsden  he went down the hill to where his ball lay eunice proceeded direct for the green much as she told herself that she hated this man she never questioned his ability to get there with his next shot  george perkins who had long since forfeited any confidence which his partner might have reposed in him had topped his drive leaving miss bingley a difficult second out of a sandy ditch the hole was halved  the match went on ramsden won the short hole laying his ball dead with a perfect iron shot but at the next the long dogleg hole miss bingley regained the honour they came to the last all square  as the match had started on the tenth tee the last hole to be negotiated was of course what in the ordinary run of human affairs is the ninth possibly the trickiest on the course as you know it is necessary to carry with ones initial wallop that combination of stream and lake into which so many well meant drives have flopped this done the player proceeds up the face of a steep slope to find himself ultimately on a green which looks like the sea in the storm scene of a melodrama it heaves and undulates and is altogether a nasty thing to have happen to one at the end of a gruelling match but it is the first shot the drive which is the real test for the water and the trees form a mental hazard of unquestionable toughness  george perkins as he addressed his ball for the vital stroke manifestly wabbled he was scared to the depths of his craven soul he tried to pray but all he could remember was the hymn for those in peril on the deep into which category he feared his ball would shortly fall breathing a few bars of this he swung there was a musical click and the ball singing over the water like a bird breasted the hill like a homing aeroplane and fell in the centre of the fairway within easy distance of the plateau green  nice work partner said miss bingley speaking for the first and last time in the course of the proceedings  george unravelled himself with a modest simper he felt like a gambler who has placed his all on a number at roulette and sees the white ball tumble into the correct compartment  eunice moved to the tee in the course of the last eight holes the girls haughty soul had been rudely harrowed she had foozled two drives and three approach shots and had missed a short putt on the last green but three she had that consciousness of sin which afflicts the golfer off his game that curious selfloathing which humbles the proudest her knees felt weak and all nature seemed to bellow at her that this was where she was going to blow up with a loud report  even as her driver rose above her shoulder she was acutely aware that she was making eighteen out of the twentythree errors which complicate the drive at golf she knew that her head had swayed like some beautiful flower in a stiff breeze the heel of her left foot was pointing down the course her grip had shifted and her wrists felt like sticks of boiled asparagus as the club began to descend she perceived that she had underestimated the total of her errors and when the ball badly topped bounded down the slope and entered the muddy water like a timid diver on a cold morning she realized that she had a full hand there are twentythree things which it is possible to do wrong in the drive and she had done them all  silently ramsden waters made a tee and placed thereon a new ball he was a golfer who rarely despaired but he was playing three and his opponents ball would undoubtedly be on the green possibly even dead in two nevertheless perhaps by a supreme drive and one or two miracles later on the game might be saved he concentrated his whole soul on the ball  i need scarcely tell you that ramsden waters pressed  swish came the driver the ball fanned by the wind rocked a little on the tee then settled down in its original position ramsden waters usually the most careful of players had missed the globe  for a moment there was a silencea silence which ramsden had to strive with an effort almost physically painful not to break rich oaths surged to his lips and blistering maledictions crashed against the back of his clenched teeth  the silence was broken by little wilberforce  one can only gather that there lurks in the supposedly innocuous amber of ginger ale an elevating something which the temperance reformers have overlooked wilberforce bray had if you remember tucked away no fewer than three in the spot where they would do most good one presumes that the child with all that stuff surging about inside him had become thoroughly above himself he uttered a merry laugh  never hit it said little wilberforce  he was kneeling beside the tee box as he spoke and now as one who has seen all that there is to be seen and turns sated to other amusements he moved round and began to play with the sand the spectacle of his alluring trouser seat was one which a stronger man would have found it hard to resist to ramsden waters it had the aspect of a formal invitation for one moment his number ii golf shoe as supplied to all the leading professionals wavered in midair then crashed home  eunice screamed  how dare you kick my brother  ramsden faced her stern and pale  madam he said in similar circumstances i would have kicked the archangel gabriel  then stooping to his ball he picked it up  the match is yours he said to miss bingley who having paid no attention at all to the drama which had just concluded was practising short chip shots with her mashieniblick  he bowed coldly to eunice cast one look of sombre satisfaction at little wilberforce who was painfully extricating himself from a bed of nettles into which he had rolled and strode off he crossed the bridge over the water and stalked up the hill  eunice watched him go spellbound her momentary spurt of wrath at the kicking of her brother had died away and she wished she had thought of doing it herself  how splendid he looked she felt as she watched ramsden striding up to the clubhousejust like carruthers mordyke after he had flung ermyntrude vanstone from him in chapter fortyone of gray eyes that gleam her whole soul went out to him this was the sort of man she wanted as a partner in life how grandly he would teach her to play golf it had sickened her when her former instructors prefacing their criticism with glutinous praise had mildly suggested that some people found it a good thing to keep the head still when driving and that though her methods were splendid it might be worth trying they had spoken of her keeping her eye on the ball as if she were doing the ball a favour what she wanted was a great strong rough brute of a fellow who would tell her not to move her damned head a rugged viking of a chap who if she did not keep her eye on the ball would black it for her and ramsden waters was such a one he might not look like a viking but after all it is the soul that counts and as this afternoons experience had taught her ramsden waters had a soul that seemed to combine in equal proportions the outstanding characteristics of nero a wildcat and the second mate of a tramp steamer                                       that night ramsden walters sat in his study a prey to the gloomiest emotions the gold had died out of him by now and he was reproaching himself bitterly for having ruined for ever his chance of winning the only girl he had ever loved how could she forgive him for his brutality how could she overlook treatment which would have caused comment in the stokehold of a cattle ship he groaned and tried to forget his sorrows by forcing himself to read  but the choicest thoughts of the greatest writers had no power to grip him he tried vardon on the swing and the words swam before his eyes he turned to taylor on the chip shot and the masters pure style seemed laboured and involved he found solace neither in braid on the pivot nor in duncan on the divot he was just about to give it up and go to bed though it was only nine oclock when the telephone bell rang  hello  is that you mr waters this is eunice bray the receiver shook in ramsdens hand ive just remembered werent we talking about something last night didnt you ask me to marry you or something i know it was something  ramsden gulped three times  i did he replied hollowly  we didnt settle anything did we  eh  i say we sort of left it kind of open  yuk  well would it bore you awfully said eunices soft voice to come round now and go on talking it over  ramsden tottered  we shall be quite alone said eunice little wilberforce has gone to bed with a headache  ramsden paused a moment to disentangle his tongue from the back of his neck  ill be right over he said huskily     10  the coming of gowf   prologue  after we had sent in our card and waited for a few hours in the marbled anteroom a bell rang and the majordomo parting the priceless curtains ushered us in to where the editor sat writing at his desk we advanced on all fours knocking our head reverently on the aubusson carpet  well he said at length laying down his jewelled pen  we just looked in we said humbly to ask if it would be all right if we sent you an historical story  the public does not want historical stories he said frowning coldly  ah but the public hasnt seen one of ours we replied  the editor placed a cigarette in a holder presented to him by a reigning monarch and lit it with a match from a golden box the gift of the millionaire president of the amalgamated league of working plumbers  what this magazine requires he said is redblooded onehundredpercent dynamic stuff palpitating with warm human interest and containing a strong poignant lovemotive  that we replied is us all over mabel  what i need at the moment however is a golf story  by a singular coincidence ours is a golf story  ha say you so said the editor a flicker of interest passing over his finelychiselled features then you may let me see it  he kicked us in the face and we withdrew   the story  on the broad terrace outside his palace overlooking the fair expanse of the royal gardens king merolchazzar of oom stood leaning on the low parapet his chin in his hand and a frown on his noble face the day was fine and a light breeze bore up to him from the garden below a fragrant scent of flowers but for all the pleasure it seemed to give him it might have been bonefertilizer  the fact is king merolchazzar was in love and his suit was not prospering enough to upset any man  royal love affairs in those days were conducted on the correspondence system a monarch hearing good reports of a neighbouring princess would despatch messengers with gifts to her court beseeching an interview the princess would name a date and a formal meeting would take place after which everything usually buzzed along pretty smoothly but in the case of king merolchazzars courtship of the princess of the outer isles there had been a regrettable hitch she had acknowledged the gifts saying that they were just what she had wanted and how had he guessed and had added that as regarded a meeting she would let him know later since that day no word had come from her and a gloomy spirit prevailed in the capital at the courtiers club the meetingplace of the aristocracy of oom five to one in pazazas was freely offered against merolchazzars chances but found no takers while in the taverns of the common people where less conservative odds were always to be had you could get a snappy hundred to eight for in good sooth writes a chronicler of the time on a halfbrick and a couple of pavingstones which have survived to this day it did indeed begin to appear as though our beloved monarch the son of the sun and the nephew of the moon had been handed the bitter fruit of the citron  the quaint old idiom is almost untranslatable but one sees what he means                                       as the king stood sombrely surveying the garden his attention was attracted by a small bearded man with bushy eyebrows and a face like a walnut who stood not far away on a gravelled path flanked by rose bushes for some minutes he eyed this man in silence then he called to the grand vizier who was standing in the little group of courtiers and officials at the other end of the terrace the bearded man apparently unconscious of the royal scrutiny had placed a rounded stone on the gravel and was standing beside it making curious passes over it with his hoe it was this singular behaviour that had attracted the kings attention superficially it seemed silly and yet merolchazzar had a curious feeling that there was a deep even a holy meaning behind the action  who he inquired is that  he is one of your majestys gardeners replied the vizier  i dont remember seeing him before who is he  the vizier was a kindhearted man and he hesitated for a moment  it seems a hard thing to say of anyone your majesty he replied but he is a scotsman one of your majestys invincible admirals recently made a raid on the inhospitable coast of that country at a spot known to the natives as snandrews and brought away this man  what does he think hes doing asked the king as the bearded one slowly raised the hoe above his right shoulder slightly bending the left knee as he did so  it is some species of savage religious ceremony your majesty according to the admiral the dunes by the seashore where he landed were covered with a multitude of men behaving just as this man is doing they had sticks in their hands and they struck with these at small round objects and every now and again  fooore called a gruff voice from below  and every now and again went on the vizier they would utter the strange melancholy cry which you have just heard it is a species of chant  the vizier broke off the hoe had descended on the stone and the stone rising in a graceful arc had sailed through the air and fallen within a foot of where the king stood  hi exclaimed the vizier  the man looked up  you mustnt do that you nearly hit his serene graciousness the king  mphm said the bearded man nonchalantly and began to wave his hoe mystically over another stone  into the kings careworn face there had crept a look of interest almost of excitement  what god does he hope to propitiate by these rites he asked  the deity i learn from your majestys admiral is called gowf  gowf gowf king merolchazzar ran over in his mind the musterroll of the gods of oom there were sixtyseven of them but gowf was not of their number it is a strange religion he murmured a strange religion indeed but by belus distinctly attractive i have an idea that oom could do with a religion like that it has a zip to it a sort of fascination if you know what i mean it looks to me extraordinarily like what the court physician ordered i will talk to this fellow and learn more of these holy ceremonies  and followed by the vizier the king made his way into the garden the vizier was now in a state of some apprehension he was exercised in his mind as to the effect which the embracing of a new religion by the king might have on the formidable church party it would be certain to cause displeasure among the priesthood and in those days it was a ticklish business to offend the priesthood even for a monarch and if merolchazzar had a fault it was a tendency to be a little tactless in his dealings with that powerful body only a few mornings back the high priest of hec had taken the vizier aside to complain about the quality of the meat which the king had been using lately for his sacrifices he might be a child in worldly matters said the high priest but if the king supposed that he did not know the difference between homegrown domestic and frozen imported foreign it was time his majesty was disabused of the idea if on top of this little unpleasantness king merolchazzar were to become an adherent of this new gowf the vizier did not know what might not happen  the king stood beside the bearded foreigner watching him closely the second stone soared neatly on to the terrace merolchazzar uttered an excited cry his eyes were glowing and he breathed quickly  it doesnt look difficult he muttered  hoos said the bearded man  i believe i could do it went on the king feverishly by the eight green gods of the mountain i believe i could by the holy fire that burns night and day before the altar of belus im sure i could by hec im going to do it now gimme that hoe  toots said the bearded man  it seemed to the king that the fellow spoke derisively and his blood boiled angrily he seized the hoe and raised it above his shoulder bracing himself solidly on widelyparted feet his pose was an exact reproduction of the one in which the court sculptor had depicted him when working on the lifesize statue our athletic king which stood in the principal square of the city but it did not impress the stranger he uttered a discordant laugh  ye puir gonuph he cried whitkin o a staunce is that  the king was hurt hitherto the attitude had been generally admired  its the way i always stand when killing lions he said in killing lions he added quoting from the wellknown treatise of nimrod the recognized textbook on the sport the weight at the top of the swing should be evenly balanced on both feet  ah weel yere no killing lions the noo yere gowfing  a sudden humility descended upon the king he felt as so many men were to feel in similar circumstances in ages to come as though he were a child looking eagerly for guidance to an allwise mastera child moreover handicapped by water on the brain feet three sizes too large for him and hands consisting mainly of thumbs  o thou of noble ancestors and agreeable disposition he said humbly teach me the true way  use the interlocking grup and keep the staunce a wee bit open and slow back and dinna press or sway the heid and keep yer ee on the ba  my which on the what said the king bewildered  i fancy your majesty hazarded the vizier that he is respectfully suggesting that your serene graciousness should deign to keep your eye on the ball  oh ah said the king  the first golf lesson ever seen in the kingdom of oom had begun                                       up on the terrace meanwhile in the little group of courtiers and officials a whispered consultation was in progress officially the kings unfortunate love affair was supposed to be a strict secret but you know how it is these things get about the grand vizier tells the lord high chamberlain the lord high chamberlain whispers it in confidence to the supreme hereditary custodian of the royal pet dog the supreme hereditary custodian hands it on to the exalted overseer of the kings wardrobe on the understanding that it is to go no farther and before you know where you are the varlets and scurvy knaves are gossiping about it in the kitchens and the society journalists have started to carve it out on bricks for the next issue of palace prattlings  the long and short of it is said the exalted overseer of the kings wardrobe we must cheer him up  there was a murmur of approval in those days of easy executions it was no light matter that a monarch should be a prey to gloom  but how queried the lord high chamberlain  i know said the supreme hereditary custodian of the royal pet dog try him with the minstrels  here why us protested the leader of the minstrels  dont be silly said the lord high chamberlain its for your good just as much as ours he was asking only last night why he never got any music nowadays he told me to find out whether you supposed he paid you simply to eat and sleep because if so he knew what to do about it  oh in that case the leader of the minstrels started nervously collecting his assistants and tiptoeing down the garden he took up his stand a few feet in merolchazzars rear just as that muchenduring monarch after twentyfive futile attempts was once more addressing his stone  lyric writers in those days had not reached the supreme pitch of excellence which has been produced by modern musical comedy the art was in its infancy then and the best the minstrels could do was thisand they did it just as merolchazzar raising the hoe with painful care reached the top of his swing and started down      oh tune the string and let us sing     our godlike great and glorious king       hes a bear hes a bear hes a bear  there were sixteen more verses touching on their rulers prowess in the realms of sport and war but they were not destined to be sung on that circuit king merolchazzar jumped like a stung bullock lifted his head and missed the globe for the twentysixth time he spun round on the minstrels who were working pluckily through their song of praise      oh may his triumphs never cease       he has the strength of ten     first in war first in peace       first in the hearts of his countrymen  get out roared the king  your majesty quavered the leader of the minstrels  make a noise like an egg and beat it again one finds the chroniclers idiom impossible to reproduce in modern speech and must be content with a literal translation by the bones of my ancestors its a little hard by the beard of the sacred goat its tough what in the name of belus and hec do you mean you yowling misfits by starting that sort of stuff when a mans swinging i was just shaping to hit it right that time when you butted in you  the minstrels melted away the bearded man patted the fermenting monarch paternally on the shoulder  ma mannie he said ye may no be a gowfer yet but hoots yere learning the language fine  king merolchazzars fury died away he simpered modestly at these words of commendation the first his bearded preceptor had uttered with exemplary patience he turned to address the stone for the twentyseventh time  that night it was all over the city that the king had gone crazy over a new religion and the orthodox shook their heads                                       we of the present day living in the midst of a million marvels of a complex civilization have learned to adjust ourselves to conditions and to take for granted phenomena which in an earlier and less advanced age would have caused the profoundest excitement and even alarm we accept without comment the telephone the automobile and the wireless telegraph and we are unmoved by the spectacle of our fellow human beings in the grip of the first stages of golf fever far otherwise was it with the courtiers and officials about the palace of oom the obsession of the king was the sole topic of conversation  every day now starting forth at dawn and returning only with the falling of darkness merolchazzar was out on the linx as the outdoor temple of the new god was called in a luxurious house adjoining this expanse the bearded scotsman had been installed and there he could be found at almost any hour of the day fashioning out of holy wood the weird implements indispensable to the new religion as a recognition of his services the king had bestowed upon him a large pension innumerable kaddiz or slaves and the title of promoter of the kings happiness which for the sake of convenience was generally shortened to the pro  at present oom being a conservative country the worship of the new god had not attracted the public in great numbers in fact except for the grand vizier who always a faithful follower of his sovereigns fortunes had taken to gowf from the start the courtiers held aloof to a man but the vizier had thrown himself into the new worship with such vigour and earnestness that it was not long before he won from the king the title of supreme splendiferous maintainer of the twentyfour handicap except on windy days when it goes up to thirtya title which in ordinary conversation was usually abbreviated to the dub  all these new titles it should be said were so far as the courtiers were concerned a fruitful source of discontent there were black looks and mutinous whispers the laws of precedence were being disturbed and the courtiers did not like it it jars a man who for years has had his social position all cut and drieda man to take an instance at random who as second deputy shiner of the royal hunting boots knows that his place is just below the keeper of the eelhounds and just above the second tenor of the corps of minstrelsit jars him we say to find suddenly that he has got to go down a step in favour of the hereditary bearer of the kings baffy  but it was from the priesthood that the real serious opposition was to be expected and the priests of the sixtyseven gods of oom were up in arms as the whitebearded high priest of hec who by virtue of his office was generally regarded as leader of the guild remarked in a glowing speech at an extraordinary meeting of the priests equity association he had always set his face against the principle of the closed shop hitherto but there were moments when every thinking man had to admit that enough was sufficient and it was his opinion that such a moment had now arrived the cheers which greeted the words showed how correctly he had voiced popular sentiment                                       of all those who had listened to the high priests speech none had listened more intently than the kings halfbrother ascobaruch a sinister disappointed man this ascobaruch with mean eyes and a crafty smile all his life he had been consumed with ambition and until now it had looked as though he must go to his grave with this ambition unfulfilled all his life he had wanted to be king of oom and now he began to see daylight he was sufficiently versed in court intrigues to be aware that the priests were the party that really counted the source from which all successful revolutions sprang and of all the priests the one that mattered most was the venerable high priest of hec  it was to this prelate therefore that ascobaruch made his way at the close of the proceedings the meeting had dispersed after passing a unanimous vote of censure on king merolchazzar and the high priest was refreshing himself in the vestryfor the meeting had taken place in the temple of hecwith a small milk and honey  some speech began ascobaruch in his unpleasant crafty way none knew better than he the art of appealing to human vanity  the high priest was plainly gratified  oh i dont know he said modestly  yessir said ascobaruch considerable oration what i can never understand is how you think up all these things to say i couldnt do it if you paid me the other night i had to propose the visitors at the old alumni dinner of oom university and my mind seemed to go all blank but you just stand up and the words come fluttering out of you like bees out of a barn i simply cannot understand it the thing gets past me  oh its just a knack  a divine gift i should call it  perhaps youre right said the high priest finishing his milk and honey he was wondering why he had never realized before what a capital fellow ascobaruch was  of course went on ascobaruch you had an excellent subject i mean to say inspiring and all that why by hec even ithough of course i couldnt have approached your leveleven i could have done something with a subject like that i mean going off and worshipping a new god no one has ever heard of i tell you my blood fairly boiled nobody has a greater respect and esteem for merolchazzar than i have but i mean to say what not right i mean going off worshipping gods no one has ever heard of im a peaceable man and ive made it a rule never to mix in politics but if you happened to say to me as we were sitting here just as one reasonable man to anotherif you happened to say ascobaruch i think its time that definite steps were taken i should reply frankly my dear old high priest i absolutely agree with you and im with you all the way you might even go so far as to suggest that the only way out of the muddle was to assassinate merolchazzar and start with a clean slate  the high priest stroked his beard thoughtfully  i am bound to say i never thought of going quite so far as that  merely a suggestion of course said ascobaruch take it or leave it i shant be offended if you know a superior excavation go to it but as a sensible manand ive always maintained that you are the most sensible man in the countryyou must see that it would be a solution merolchazzar has been a pretty good king of course no one denies that a fair general no doubt and a plusman at lionhunting but after alllook at it fairlyis life all battles and lionhunting isnt there a deeper side wouldnt it be better for the country to have some good orthodox fellow who has worshipped hec all his life and could be relied on to maintain the old beliefswouldnt the fact that a man like that was on the throne be likely to lead to more general prosperity there are dozens of men of that kind simply waiting to be asked let us say purely for purposes of argument that you approached me i should reply unworthy though i know myself to be of such an honour i can tell you this if you put me on the throne you can bet your bottom pazaza that theres one thing that wont suffer and that is the worship of hec thats the way i feel about it  the high priest pondered  o thou of unshuffled features but amiable disposition he said thy discourse soundeth good to me could it be done  could it ascobaruch uttered a hideous laugh could it arouse me in the nightwatches and ask me question me on the matter having stopped me for that purpose on the public highway what i would suggestim not dictating mind you merely trying to help you outwhat i would suggest is that you took that long sharp knife of yours the one you use for the sacrifices and toddled out to the linxyoure sure to find the king there and just when hes raising that sacrilegious stick of his over his shoulder  o man of infinite wisdom cried the high priest warmly verily hast them spoken a fullness of the mouth  is it a wager said ascobaruch  it is a wager said the high priest  thats that then said ascobaruch now i dont want to be mixed up in any unpleasantness so what i think ill do while what you might call the preliminaries are being arranged is to go and take a little trip abroad somewhere the middle lakes are pleasant at this time of year when i come back its possible that all the formalities will have been completed yes  rely on me by hec said the high priest grimly as he fingered his weapon                                       the high priest was as good as his word early on the morrow he made his way to the linx and found the king holingout on the second green merolchazzar was in high good humour  greetings o venerable one he cried jovially hadst thou come a moment sooner them wouldst have seen me lay my ball deadaye dead as mutton with the sweetest little halfmashieniblick chipshot ever seen outside the sacred domain of snandrew on whomhe bared his head reverentlybe peace in one under bogey did i do the holeyea and that despite the fact that slicing my drive i became ensnared in yonder undergrowth  the high priest had not the advantage of understanding one word of what the king was talking about but he gathered with satisfaction that merolchazzar was pleased and wholly without suspicion he clasped an unseen hand more firmly about the handle of his knife and accompanied the monarch to the next altar merolchazzar stooped and placed a small round white object on a little mound of sand in spite of his austere views the high priest always a keen student of ritual became interested  why does your majesty do that  i tee it up that it may fly the fairer if i did not then would it be apt to run a long the ground like a beetle instead of soaring like a bird and mayhap for thou seest how rough and tangled is the grass before us i should have to use a niblick for my second  the high priest groped for his meaning  it is a ceremony to propitiate the god and bring good luck  you might call it that  the high priest shook his head  i may be oldfashioned he said but i should have thought that to propitiate a god it would have been better to have sacrificed one of these kaddiz on his altar  i confess replied the king thoughtfully that i have often felt that it would be a relief to ones feelings to sacrifice one or two kaddiz but the pro for some reason or other has set his face against it he swung at the ball and sent it forcefully down the fairway by abe the son of mitchell he cried shading his eyes a bird of a drive how truly is it written in the book of the prophet vadun the left hand applieth the force the right doth but guide grip not therefore too closely with the right hand yesterday i was pulling all the time  the high priest frowned  it is written in the sacred book of hec your majesty thou shalt not follow after strange gods  take thou this stick o venerable one said the king paying no attention to the remark and have a shot thyself true thou art well stricken in years but many a man has so wrought that he was able to give his grandchildren a stroke a hole it is never too late to begin  the high priest shrank back horrified the king frowned  it is our royal wish he said coldly  the high priest was forced to comply had they been alone it is possible that he might have risked all on one swift stroke with his knife but by this time a group of kaddiz had drifted up and were watching the proceedings with that supercilious detachment so characteristic of them he took the stick and arranged his limbs as the king directed  now said merolchazzar slow back and keep your ee on the ba                                       a month later ascobaruch returned from his trip he had received no word from the high priest announcing the success of the revolution but there might be many reasons for that it was with unruffled contentment that he bade his charioteer drive him to the palace he was glad to get back for after all a holiday is hardly a holiday if you have left your business affairs unsettled  as he drove the chariot passed a fair open space on the outskirts of the city a sudden chill froze the serenity of ascobaruchs mood he prodded the charioteer sharply in the small of the back  what is that he demanded catching his breath  all over the green expanse could be seen men in strange robes moving to and fro in couples and bearing in their hands mystic wands some searched restlessly in the bushes others were walking briskly in the direction of small red flags a sickening foreboding of disaster fell upon ascobaruch  the charioteer seemed surprised at the question  yons the muneecipal linx he replied  the what  the muneecipal linx  tell me fellow why do you talk that way  whitway  why like that the way youre talking  hoots mon said the charioteer his majesty king merolchazzarmay his handicap decreasehae passit a law that a his soobjects shall do it aiblins tis the language spoken by the pro on whom be peace mphm  ascobaruch sat back limply his head swimming the chariot drove on till now it took the road adjoining the royal linx a wall lined a portion of this road and suddenly from behind this wall there rent the air a great shout of laughter  pull up cried ascobaruch to the charioteer  he had recognized that laugh it was the laugh of merolchazzar  ascobaruch crept to the wall and cautiously poked his head over it the sight he saw drove the blood from his face and left him white and haggard  the king and the grand vizier were playing a foursome against the pro and the high priest of hec and the vizier had just laid the high priest a dead stymie  ascobaruch tottered to the chariot  take me back he muttered pallidly ive forgotten something                                       and so golf came to oom and with it prosperity unequalled in the whole history of the land everybody was happy there was no more unemployment crime ceased the chronicler repeatedly refers to it in his memoirs as the golden age and yet there remained one man on whom complete felicity had not descended it was all right while he was actually on the linx but there were blank dreary stretches of the night when king merolchazzar lay sleepless on his couch and mourned that he had nobody to love him  of course his subjects loved him in a way a new statue had been erected in the palace square showing him in the act of getting out of casual water the minstrels had composed a whole cycle of uptodate songs commemorating his prowess with the mashie his handicap was down to twelve but these things are not all a golfer needs a loving wife to whom he can describe the days play through the long evenings and this was just where merolchazzars life was empty no word had come from the princess of the outer isles and as he refused to be put off with justasgood substitutes he remained a lonely man  but one morning in the early hours of a summer day as he lay sleeping after a disturbed night merolchazzar was awakened by the eager hand of the lord high chamberlain shaking his shoulder  now what said the king  hoots your majesty glorious news the princess of the outer isles waits withouti mean wioot  the king sprang from his couch  a messenger from the princess at last  nay sire the princess herselfthat is to say said the lord chamberlain who was an old man and had found it hard to accustom himself to the new tongue at his age her ain sel and believe me or rather mind ahm telling ye went on the honest man joyfully for he had been deeply exercised by his monarchs troubles her highness is the easiest thing to look at these eyes hae ever seen and you can say i said it  she is beautiful  your majesty she is in the best and deepest sense of the word a pippin  king merolchazzar was groping wildly for his robes  tell her to wait he cried go and amuse her ask her riddles tell her anecdotes dont let her go say ill be down in a moment where in the name of zoroaster is our imperial meshknit underwear                                       a fair and pleasing sight was the princess of the outer isles as she stood on the terrace in the clear sunshine of the summer morning looking over the kings gardens with her delicate little nose she sniffed the fragrance of the flowers her blue eyes roamed over the rose bushes and the breeze ruffled the golden curls about her temples presently a sound behind her caused her to turn and she perceived a godlike man hurrying across the terrace pulling up a sock and at the sight of him the princesss heart sang within her like the birds down in the garden  hope i havent kept you waiting said merolchazzar apologetically he too was conscious of a strange wild exhilaration truly was this maiden as his chamberlain had said noticeably easy on the eyes her beauty was as water in the desert as fire on a frosty night as diamonds rubies pearls sapphires and amethysts  oh no said the princess ive been enjoying myself how passing beautiful are thy gardens o king  my gardens may be passing beautiful said merolchazzar earnestly but they arent half so passing beautiful as thy eyes i have dreamed of thee by night and by day and i will tell the world i was nowhere near it my sluggish fancy came not within a hundred and fiftyseven miles of the reality now let the sun dim his face and the moon hide herself abashed now let the flowers bend their heads and the gazelle of the mountains confess itself a cripple princess your slave  and king merolchazzar with that easy grace so characteristic of royalty took her hand in his and kissed it  as he did so he gave a start of surprise  by hec he exclaimed what hast thou been doing to thyself thy hand is all over little rough places inside has some malignant wizard laid a spell upon thee or what is it  the princess blushed  if i make that clear to thee she said i shall also make clear why it was that i sent thee no message all this long while my time was so occupied
