memoirs of scriblerus never before printed and other tracts written either singly or in conjunction with his friends now first collected together the letters are the swift correspondence and they are in a different type from the rest of the book the numbers of the pages are very irregular and show that the contents and arrangement of the volume had been greatly altered from some previous impression the folio copies of the two volumes of poetry and the two of prose are merely the quarto text portioned out into longer pages without a single leaf being reprinted the trifling variations from the quartos were introduced when the matter was put into the folio size        the works of alexander pope esq vol i with explanatory      notes and additions never before printed london printed      for b lintot 1736 small 8vo  this is the first volume of an edition which extended to nine volumes and which from the want of uniformity in the titlepages the dates and names of the publishers appears to consist of odd volumes the copyright of popes works belonged to different proprietors and they at last agreed to print their respective shares in small octavo that the several parts united might form a complete set each proprietor commenced printing his particular section of the octavos when the previous sizes he had on hand were sold and thus it happened that the second volume of the edition came out in 1735 before the first which was published in 1736 the series was not finished till 1742 when the fourth book of the dunciad was added to the poems and the swift correspondence to the letters some of the volumes were reprinted and the later editions occasionally differ slightly from their predecessors the poems and letters of pope are more complete in the octavos than in the quartos but the octavos on the other hand omit all the prose works except the letters and the memoirs of scriblerus and octavos and quartos combined are imperfect in comparison with the editions which

only once set eyes on dryden and had no acquaintance with him marks his admiration by including him in this memorial of relations and friends     advertisement of warburton to his edition of popes works 1751   mr pope in his last illness amused himself amidst the care of his higher concerns in preparing a corrected and complete edition of his writings1 and with his usual delicacy was even solicitous to prevent any share of the offence they might occasion from falling on the friend whom he had engaged to give them to the public2 in discharge of this trust the public has here a complete edition of his works executed in such a manner as i am persuaded would have been to his satisfaction the editor hath not for the sake of profit suffered the authors name to be made cheap by a subscription3 nor his works to be defrauded of their due honours by a vulgar or inelegant impression nor his memory to be disgraced by any pieces unworthy of his talents or virtue on the contrary he hath at a very great expense ornamented this edition with all the advantages which the best artists in paper printing and sculpture could bestow upon it4  if the public hath waited longer than the deference due to its generous impatience for the authors writings should have suffered it was owing to a reason which the editor need not be ashamed to tell it was his regard to the family interests of his deceased friend mr pope at his death had left large impressions of several parts of his works unsold the property of which was adjudged to belong to his executors and the editor was willing they should have time to dispose of them to the best advantage before the publication of this edition which hath been long prepared should put a stop to the sale but it may be proper to be a little more particular concerning the superiority of this edition above all the preceding so far as mr pope himself was concerned what the editor hath done the reader must collect for himself  the first volume and the original poems in the second are here first printed from a copy corrected throughout by the author himself even to the very preface5 which with several additional notes in his own hand he delivered to the editor a little before his death the juvenile translations in the other part of the second volume it was never his intention to bring into this edition of his works on account of the levity of some the freedom of others and the little importance of all but these being the property of other men the editor had it not in his power to follow the authors intention  the third volume all but the essay on man which together with the essay on criticism the author a little before his death had corrected and published in quarto as a specimen of his projected edition was printed by him in his last illness but never published in the manner it is now given the disposition of the epistle on the characters of men is quite altered that on the characters of women much enlarged and the epistles on riches and taste corrected and improved to these advantages of the third volume must be added a great number of fine verses taken from the authors manuscript copies of these poems communicated by him for this purpose to the editor these the author when he first published the poems to which they belong thought proper for various reasons to omit some from the manuscript copy of the essay on man which tended to discredit fate and to recommend the moral government of god had by the editors advice been restored to their places in the last edition of that poem6 the rest together with others of the like sort from his manuscript copy of the other ethic epistles are here inserted at the bottom of the page under the title of variations  the fourth volume contains the satires with their prologuethe epistle to dr arbuthnot and epiloguethe two poems intitled mdccxxxviii the prologue and epilogue are here given with the like advantages as the ethic epistles in the foregoing volume that is to say with the variations or additional verses from the authors manuscripts the epilogue to the satires is likewise inriched with many and large notes now first printed from the authors own manuscript  the fifth volume contains a correcter and completer edition of the dunciad than hath been hitherto published of which at present i have only this further to add that it was at my request he laid the plan of a fourth book i often told him it was pity so fine a poem should remain disgraced by the meanness of its subject the most insignificant of all duncesbad rhymers and malevolent cavillers that he ought to raise and ennoble it by pointing his satire against the most pernicious of allminute philosophers and freethinkers i imagined too it was for the interests of religion to have it known that so great a genius had a due abhorrence of these pests of virtue and society he came readily into my opinion but at the same time told me it would create him many enemies he was not mistaken for though the terror of his pen kept them for some time in respect yet on his death they rose with unrestrained fury in numerous coffeehouse tales and grub street libels the plan of this admirable satire was artfully contrived to show that the follies and defects of a fashionable education naturally led to and necessarily ended in freethinking with design to point out the only remedy adequate to so destructive an evil it was to advance the same ends of virtue and religion that the editor prevailed on him to alter everything in his moral writings that might be suspected of having the least glance towards fate or naturalism and to add what was proper to convince the world that he was warmly on the side of moral government and a revealed will and it would be great injustice to his memory not to declare that he embraced these occasions with the most unfeigned pleasure  the sixth volume consists of mr popes miscellaneous pieces in verse and prose amongst the verse several fine poems make now their first appearance in his works and of the prose all that is good and nothing but what is exquisitely so will be found in this edition  the seventh eighth and ninth volumes consist entirely of his letters the more valuable as they are the only true models which we or perhaps any of our neighbours have of familiar epistles7 this collection is now made more complete by the addition of several new pieces yet excepting a short explanatory letter to col moyser and the letters to mr allen and mr warburton the latter of which are given to show the editors inducements and the engagements he was under to intend the care of this edition excepting these i say the rest are all here published from the authors own printed though not published copies delivered to the editor8  on the whole the advantages of this edition above the preceding are thesethat it is the first complete collection which has ever been made of his original writings that all his principal poems of early or later date are here given to the public with his last corrections and improvements that a great number of his verses are here first printed from the manuscript copies of his principal poems of later date that many new notes of the author are here added to his poems and lastly that several pieces both in prose and verse make now their first appearance before the public  the authors life deserves a just volume and the editor intends to give it for to have been one of the first poets in the world is but his second praise he was in a higher class he was one of the noblest works of god he was an honest man9a man who alone possessed more real virtue than in very corrupt times needing a satirist like him will sometimes fall to the share of multitudes in this history of his life10 will be contained a large account of his writings a critique on the nature force and extent of his genius exemplified from these writings and a vindication of his moral character exemplified by his more distinguished virtueshis filial piety his disinterested friendships his reverence for the constitution of his country his love and admiration of virtue and what was the necessary effect his hatred and contempt of vice his extensive charity to the indigent his warm benevolence to mankind his supreme veneration of the deity and above all his sincere belief of revelation nor shall his faults be concealed it is not for the interests of his virtues that they should nor indeed could they be concealed if we were so disposed for they shine through his virtues no man being more a dupe to the specious appearances of virtue in others11 in a word i mean not to be his panegyrist but his historian and may i when envy and calumny have taken the same advantage of my absence for while i live i will freely trust it to my life to confute them may i find a friend as careful of my honest fame as i have been of his together with his works he hath bequeathed me his dunces so that as the property is transferred i could wish they would now let his memory alone the veil which death draws over the good is so sacred that to tear it and with sacrilegious hands to throw dirt upon the shrine gives scandal even to barbarians and though rome permitted her slaves to calumniate her best citizens on the day of triumph yet the same petulancy at their funeral would have been rewarded with execration and a gibbet12 the public may be malicious but is rarely vindictive or ungenerous it would abhor all insults on a writer dead though it had borne with the ribaldry or even set the ribalds on work when he was alive and in this there is no great harm for he must have a strange impotency of mind indeed whom such miserable scribblers can disturb or ruffle of all that gross beotian phalanx who have written scurrilously against the editor he knows not so much as one whom a writer of reputation would not wish to have his enemy or whom a man of honour would not be ashamed to own for his friend13 he is indeed but slightly conversant in their works and knows little of the particulars of their defamation to his authorship they are heartily welcome but if any of them have been so far abandoned by truth as to attack his moral character in any respect whatsoever to all and every one of these and their abettors he gives the lie in form and in the words of honest father valerian mentiris impudentissime  footnotes  footnote 1 i own the late encroachments upon my constitution made me willing to see the end of all further care about me or my works i would rest for the one in a full resignation of my being to be disposed of by the father of all mercy and for the other though indeed a trifle yet a trifle may be some example i would commit them to the candour of a sensible and reflecting judge rather than to the malice of every shortsighted and malevolent critic or inadvertent and censorious reader and no hand can set them in so good a light clet cxx to mr wwarburton  footnote 2 i also give and bequeath to the said mr warburton the property of all such of my works already printed as he hath written or shall write commentaries or notes upon and which i have not otherwise disposed of or alienated and as he shall publish without future alterationshis last will and testamentwarburton  footnote 3 a subscription would have been simply a petition from warburton to the public soliciting them to increase the value of the legacy bequeathed him by pope  footnote 4 the engravings were execrable the type and paper good but not extraordinary the outlay upon the edition for which warburton takes credit as for a munificent act was a commonplace commercial transaction with the certainty of a large return  footnote 5 the corrections are few and trivial the account which warburton gives of the novelties in his edition is from first to last exaggerated  footnote 6 the only restored lines which improve the orthodoxy of the essay on man relate to a future state  footnote 7 either warburton had never heard of madame de sévignés letters or what is more likely he was unable to taste their charm their delicate graces and native liveliness would have been lost upon the man who thought that popes artificial epistles were true models of familiar letters  footnote 8 the assertion that the copies had not been published is unaccountable every line of them had been published twice over by pope in his lifetime and all but two or three pages had been published again and again  footnote 9      a wits a feather and a chiefs a rod     an honest mans the noblest work of godwarburton  footnote 10 it will be printed in the same form with this and every future edition of his works so as to make a part of themwarburton  the life which warburton promised with such solemn pomp was never written and he was content to assist ruffhead in his feeble compilation  footnote 11 warburton intimates that popes only faults grew out of his credulous belief in the specious appearance of virtue which was a sarcasm directed against those friends of pope who were the enemies of warburton  footnote 12 the demand of warburton was not for a truce on the day of popes funeral which took place seven years before he insisted that because pope was dead no one should ever again question his title to be called good neither pope nor warburton was accustomed to spare dead men and the claim for exemption was specially inconsistent in the preface to works which were full of bitter attacks upon both living and dead warburton was to go on circulating popes venom and any victim who retaliated was to be pronounced sacrilegious a scandal even to barbarians and worthy to be rewarded with execration and a gibbet  footnote 13 warburton was a fortunate author though he published a host of paradoxical notions his opponents if we are to trust his repeated assertions were always fools and knaves     introduction   in his will dated december 12 1743 not quite six months before he died pope bequeathed his printed works to warburton on condition that he published them without future alterations warburton states that the object of the proviso was to relieve him from the obloquy he might incur by reproducing offensive strokes of satire a few slight alterations which had not the sanction of any prior edition were nevertheless introduced by warburton into some of the poems and he announced on the titlepage and in the preface that they were taken from a corrected copy delivered to him by pope mr croker mistrusted the genuineness of the alterations and he intended to reject the text of warburton and adopt in the main the text of the last octavo edition which had appeared during the lifetime of the poet the honour of warburton is not above suspicion but mr croker was misled by erroneous inferences when he accused him of tampering with the text and falsely pleading the authority of a copy corrected by the author himself  fantastic in his conceptions violent in his animosities hasty and imperious in the expression of his opinions warburton sometimes repented his rashness and cancelled numerous leaves in his shakespeare and pope after the volumes were printed off mr kilvert who edited his literary remains found among his papers a cancelled leaf of the pope containing the commencement of the prologue to the satires on the first page warburton had inserted among the variations a couplet which he said was copied from the manuscript of pope      and now vile poets rise before the light     and walk like margarets ghost at dead of night  the allusion was to the ballad of william and margaret written by mallet he was the ally of pope and bolingbroke and when pope was dead he was employed by bolingbroke to blast the memory of their former friend1 the mention of margarets ghost gave warburton the opportunity of appending a bitter note upon mallet whom he accused of arraigning his dead patron for a cheat and the leaf was cancelled to get rid of both note and variation mr croker believed that warburton forged the variation to gratify his spleen against mallet whom he detested and that before the volume was published either his own conscience or some prudent friend suggested that such manifest fraud would not be tolerated the conjecture was unfounded pope presented several of his manuscripts to the son of jonathan richardson the portraitpainter for his trouble in collating them with the printed text richardsons interlined copy of the first quarto volume of popes poetry passed into the hands of malone and was ultimately bought by mr croker the manuscripts which richardson possessed in the handwriting of pope were purchased by dr chauncey and are still the property of his descendants among them is the prologue to the satires and it contains the couplet mr croker believed to have been forged in every instance where the manuscripts exist the variations printed by warburton are found to be authentic  the inference of mr croker from the variations must be reversed they do not invalidate but attest the fidelity of warburton and the alterations in the text of the poems must pass unchallenged unless there is some direct proof of their inaccuracy the arguments on the contrary are altogether in their favour four printed pages of the first moral essay with the corrections in manuscript were discovered by mr kilvert among warburtons papers some of the words says mr croker are so neatly written as to leave a strong impression on my eye of their being popes other portions of the manuscript are more like warburtons looser hand the faint doubt expressed by mr croker would hardly have arisen if his suspicion had not been previously awakened for the corrections are all indubitably in the handwriting of the poet nor was the manuscript in this instance the guide of warburton he followed a copy of the moral essays printed by pope in his last illness though never published warburton has the propriety of it as you know wrote bolingbroke to lord marchmont one of the executors alter it he cannot by the terms of the will2 this of itself is an answer to mr croker the executors had access to popes latest printed version of the moral essays which was warburtons avowed authority and he could not alter a single word without certain detection and the consequent forfeiture of his legacy he was alive to the risk a portion of popes revised edition of his poetical works was passing through the press at the time of his death and warburton directed the printer to give the sheets when the executors inquired for them to their colleague the celebrated murray who was afterwards lord mansfield adding pray preserve all the press copy to the least scrap3 the terms of the will bound the editor to be faithful to his trust under a penalty of 4000l the estimated value of the bequest4 and he saw the necessity of having the voucher of the poets handwriting for the minutest departure from the previous text in such of the proofs as had not received popes final imprimatur a more ample guarantee could not be desired for the authenticity of the particulars in which warburtons text differs from the printed copies superintended by pope all the displaced readings which are not utterly insignificant are preserved in the notes to the present edition as well as numerous unpublished variations which are taken from the manuscripts of pope or the transcripts of richardson  the text of popes poems is more easily settled than elucidated no other poet so near to our own time presents equal difficulties his satires abound in uncertain allusions and controverted topics which require a large amount of illustration and discussion his philosophy was not understood by himself and it is a study to disentangle his confused arguments and interpret his doubtful language he often expressed his opinions with wilful ambiguity took refuge in equivocations or had recourse to falsehoods and we are constantly forced upon perplexing investigations to recover the truth he endeavoured to conceal fortunately his best poems and choicest passages are least incumbered with puzzling questions and his obscurities have not much interfered with his popularity because the mass of readers are content to enjoy the beauties and leave the enigmas unsolved  the number and eminence of the commentators on pope the diversity of their attainments and the extent of their annotations appear to promise all the help which knowledge acuteness and taste could supply the result is far below what might reasonably have been anticipated warburton popes first editor had a vigorous understanding and possessed the enormous advantage that he carried on the work in concert with the poet and could ask the explanation of every difficulty a diseased ambition rendered his talents and opportunities useless without originality he aspired to be original and imagined that to fabricate hollow paradoxes and torture language into undesigned meanings was the surest evidence of a fertile penetrating genius he employed his sagacity less to discover than to distort the ideas of his author and seems to have thought that the more he deviated from the obvious sense the greater would be his fame for inventive power he has left no worse specimen of his perverse propensity than the spurious fancies and idle refinements he fathered upon pope they are among his baldest paradoxes are conveyed in his heaviest style and are supported by his feeblest sophistry his lifeless and verbose conceits soon provoke by their falsity and fatigue by their ponderousness lord marchmont said laughingly to pope that he must be the vainest man alive and must want to show posterity what a quantity of dulness he could carry down on his back without sinking under the load5 the exuberant selfsufficiency of warburton deluded him into the belief that the text derived its principal lustre from the commentary he selected for the frontispiece to his edition a monument on which were hung medallions of himself and the poet and blakey the draughtsman told burke that it was by warburtons particular desire that he made him the principal figure and pope only secondary and that the light contrary to the rules of art goes upwards from warburton to pope a gentleman remarked when burke related the anecdote that they were drawn looking in opposite directions6 the sarcasm summed up the opinion which has always prevailed the clumsy inventions of warburton had not the semblance of plausibility and scarce anybody except his shadow and fulsome echo bishop hurd ever doubted that the text and commentary looked different ways7  proud of his dreary paradoxes warburton scorned the humble office of furnishing useful information pope had said in his imitations of horace that because three ladies liked a luckless play a spendthrift had taken the whole house upon the poets night8 which drew from warburton the following notethe common reader i am sensible will be always more solicitous about the names of these three ladies the unlucky play and every other circumstance that attended this piece of gallantry than for the explanation of our authors sense or the illustration of his poetry even where he is most moral and sublime but had it been in mr popes purpose to indulge so impertinent a curiosity he had sought elsewhere for a commentator on his writings which defect in these notes the periodical scribblers however have been stupid and shameless enough to object to them9 warburtons reserve was praiseworthy when his motive was respect for private feelings his general neglect to clear up the allusions in popes poems did not admit of this apology and in default of a better defence he called his critics stupid and shameless his habit when reasons failed him was to supply their place with abuse  the edition of warburton was published in 1751 and no attempt was made to supersede it till gilbert wakefield commenced a new edition in 1794 he was labouring he says for a subsistence and the cost of the work which was printed at his own expense obliged him to bring out a volume at a time before the first volume was quite through the press he learned that joseph warton was engaged on a similar undertaking warton had the support of the london booksellers and the edition of wakefield ended with his opening volume the world did not lose the benefit of his annotations he published in 1796 his observations on pope which consist of notes on the remaining poems and of supplemental notes to the poems he had previously edited wakefield said that an inculpable perfection pervaded the whole body of popes compositions and in the extravagance of his admiration he overlaid the volume of his unfinished edition with weak rhapsodies which masked the useful part of his labours he restrained his eulogistic excesses in his observations and kept more closely to his main design of tracing popes imitations of his predecessors all persons tolerably read in poetry could perceive that the obligations pope acknowledged in his notes were but a fraction of the whole and in 1740 bowyer the printer with the assistance of mr clarke a clergyman commenced a collection of parallel passages from the letters of clarke to bowyer it appears that pope was annoyed bowyer profited by his irritation and offered to treat with him i think wrote clarke in 1742 you buy his friendship cheap with a whole hecatomb of notes essays illustrations and the mob of commentators10 the progress of the negociation is not recorded the result is revealed in the fact that bowyer shortly afterwards became popes printer the sensitiveness which was disturbed at the gleanings of bowyer would have shuddered at the abundant harvest of wakefield he himself had no intention of depreciating the merits of pope he only wished to illustrate a favourite author many of the parallelisms are too slight to be applicable or they are common phrases the property of every englishman a vast number remain which are a curious exhibition of popes patience and skill in the art of poetical mosaic and of the large amount of borrowed beauties he intermixed with his undoubted originality the interpretation of the text though subordinate with wakefield was not neglected by him he and a friend who assisted him dr william bennet bishop of cloyne have explained more allusions than all the other commentators and the least known and appreciated of the editors of pope is the man who has done the most for his author  the edition of warton appeared in 1797 his reason he says in his preface for undertaking the work was the universal complaint that dr warburton had disfigured and disgraced his edition with many forced and farsought interpretations totally unsupported by the passages which they were brought to elucidate warton had the stimulus of a second motive he published in 1756 the first volume of his essay on pope and his criticisms were roughly attacked in many passages of ruffheads life of the poet which was prompted and partly written by warburton while warburton lived warton did not venture to retaliate the thirty years which intervened had not extinguished his resentment and he seized the opportunity to revenge the ancient grudge his consciousness of warburtons defects did not keep warton from repeating the error of filling page upon page with irrelevant matter his essay on pope had been a receptacle for his store of miscellaneous reading and in a separate work there was no objection to a medley of anecdote and criticism he was seventyfive when he published his edition of pope and to save himself trouble he apportioned out the old farrago in notes profuse in digressions he is sparing of needful explanations his turn was for the lighter portions of criticism and biography and most of his apposite remarks are critical opinions they are often just but never profound for he had neither fervid feelings nor a robust understanding and his highest qualities are a fair poetical taste and a tolerable acquaintance with ancient and modern authors  bowles was a schoolboy at winchester when warton was headmaster and he intimated that this early connection was the cause of his being employed to revise the next edition of pope it appeared in 1806 his poetic sensibility was exquisite and he was wellread shrewd and candid his failing was a hurry of mind which disqualified him for a painstaking commentator he was content to jot down in a careless colloquial style the offhand thoughts of his quick and cultivated intellect and he did not add much to the scanty explanations of warton and warburton the chief merit of his edition is his excellent literary criticism which is truer deeper and more refined than that of his old winchester master the estimate bowles formed of the poetry and character of pope was allowed to pass unchallenged for thirteen years when some remarks of campbell in his specimens of british poets commenced a controversy which lasted from 1819 to 1826 in the series of pamphlets he published to vindicate his opinions bowles exhibited his wonted acuteness courage and negligence with all his slips in minor points the fresh facts which have come to light have more than confirmed his view of popes moral obliquities and in the discussion on the principles of poetry he reduced the whole of his adversaries to silence he and hazlitt were the only persons among the disputants eminent or obscure who showed any real comprehension of the subject  the next edition of pope justly considered by mr croker to be the worst came out in 1824 and was superintended by roscoe the author of the life of lorenzo de medici and leo x he barely contributed a single illustrative note his criticisms are platitudes and his vindications of pope a tissue of blunders he was misled by his credulous faith in his hero by the rashness with which he imposed his own guesses for facts and above all by his want of penetration and research his halfknowledge was worse than ignorance a few of his multitudinous errors were exposed by bowles whom he had attacked roscoe replied in a feeble disingenuous pamphlet which drew from bowles his taunting and crushing retort lessons in criticism to william roscoe esq this ended the pope controversy  the faults of plan and execution in the editions of warburton warton bowles and roscoe stand out in strong relief and mr croker resolved as far as possible to correct the mistakes retrench the superfluities and supply the omissions warton and bowles dismissed a large proportion of the barren oppressive commentaries of warburton roscoe put back the whole of the bulky excrescence most of it had been adopted by pope and to relieve the text without excluding interpretations sanctioned by the poet mr croker determined to print the pedantic lumber in appendixes the notes of the other editors rested upon their intrinsic merits and he intended to sift out the surplusage and only retain what was pertinent to curtail is easy the difficulty was to clear up the many obscurities which remained and mr croker was anxious to furnish his share of explanation though he was convinced that numerous contemporary allusions would always baffle curiosity his chief attention was directed to the satires and he continued for many years to pursue his investigations and accumulate materials his busy life was succeeded by failing health and he died before he had prepared his notes for the press the results of his research have luckily all been preserved for his habit was to write them out in full at the time he was an acute and eager enquirer into political personal and social history and no man could have been more competent to bring to the surface the undercurrent of forgotten circumstances  i have kept to the plan sketched out by mr croker a commentary says johnson must arise from the fortuitous discoveries of many men in devious walks of literature and few poets have had more commentators than pope i have borrowed whatever i met with in previous writers that throw light upon his meaning faults and beauties have cast aside what was plainly inapplicable and erroneous and have done what i could to fill up deficiencies my own notes will be recognised by the absence of any signature all other notes throughout the work have the names of their authors attached even when a note is by the same author as the text the extracts from warton are sometimes taken from his essay and both in his case and that of bowles i have occasionally joined together scattered fragments which were connected in their subject the rest of the arrangements will be understood at a glance  the letters of pope demand a more particular discussion estimated by their intrinsic merits they would call for little notice he laboured them says horace walpole as much as the essay on man and as they were written to everybody they do not look as if they had been written to anybody11 their dry and frigid generalities could not be more happily exposed the chief importance of the correspondence is in its relation to the morality of pope and the fame of men whose reputation is involved in the question of his uprightness his real nature has always been hotly debated his detractors says de quincey fancy that in his character a basis of ignoble qualities was here and there slightly relieved by a few shining spots we on the contrary believe that in pope lay a disposition radically noble and generous clouded and overshadowed by superficial foibles or to adopt the distinction of shakespeare they see nothing but dust a little gilt and we gold a little dusted12 pope boasted loudly of his virtue and his champions judge him by his own representations his accusers hold that his professions were hypocritical as when lord macaulay speaks of his spite and envy thinly disguised by sentiments as benevolent and noble as those which sir peter teazle admired in mr joseph surface13 the charges brought against him are thickly scattered over his life and either the guilty appearances are deceptive or we must admit that his mind was essentially corrupt his correspondence brings up the everrecurring enquiry and we have to decide whether his letters are not many of them fraudulent and the circumstances attending their publication a series of ignominious plots infamous false accusations and impudent lies  every examination into the history of the letters was slight before mr dilke engaged in the laborious task his familiarity with the books pamphlets and periodicals of the time could not be exceeded and his doubts once awakened he accepted nothing upon trust with an immense amount of research and skill he proceeded to track pope through his tortuous courses he laid bare the ramifications of the plot against curll which was only known in a few of its prominent particulars he detected what none of the editors and biographers had perceived the base manoeuvres and deceit which accompanied the publication of the letters to and from dr swift he was originally put upon his investigations by the manuscript collection of popes letters to caryll and these revealed a new set of frauds in the evidence they supplied of letters converted into a fictitious correspondence his inclination was to favour pope whenever there was an opening for a liberal interpretation and it was not from hostility that he exposed the network of fraud and brought out the dark traits of a dishonourable disposition with new and terrible force he printed his discoveries in the athenæum14 and after studying the facts afresh by the light of his essays i am compelled to adopt his conclusions the evidence upon which they rest is often circumstantial and intricate and cannot be followed to the end without steady attention and some trial of patience  the letters of the poet which were first sent to the press were given by cromwell to his mistress elizabeth thomas who sold them in her distress to curll for ten guineas she was a shameless woman and boldly justified her conduct everyone she said knows that the person to whom a letter is addressed has the same right to dispose of it as he has of goods purchased with his money the right which originally belonged to cromwell of publishing to the world whatever had been written to him in the confidence of friendship he had by his gift transferred to herself and thus it appeared that cromwell had a right to be treacherous to pope and mrs thomas a right to be treacherous to both pope and cromwell with more reason she inferred that neither of them at heart would be vexed at the proceeding cromwell she urged could not be angry that the world should know the professions of love gratitude and veneration made him by so celebrated an author and pope could not resent the exhibition of the early pregnancy of his genius and yet she continued had either of you been asked common modesty would have obliged you to refuse what you would not be displeased with if done without your knowledge15 there can be little doubt from his subsequent conduct that this was the light in which the publication was viewed by the poet notwithstanding his assertion in a note to the dunciad that he was ashamed of the letters as very trivial things full not only of levities but of wrong judgments of men and books and only excusable from the youth and inexperience of the writer mrs thomas did him an incalculable injury not by revealing his secrets but by flattering his vanity the favourable reception of his correspondence originated the desire to give some further specimens to the world and led him into the miserable series of falsehoods and frauds by which he endeavoured to accomplish his design without seeming to be privy to it  the letters to cromwell were published in curlls miscellanea of which the titlepage says printed in the year 1727 but the dedication to the letters themselves is dated june 1726 and it was in 1726 that they appeared the incidental and scanty notices of them at the time are sufficient to indicate the impression they produced thompson writing in october to aaron hill says that though careless and uncorrected they are full of wit and gaiety there may have been many who thought that they did as much credit to the heart as to the head of the poet i have read the collection of letters you mention fenton wrote to broome in september 1726 and was delighted with nothing more than that air of sincerity those professions of esteem and respect and that deference paid to his friends judgment in poetry which i have sometimes seen expressed to others and i doubt not with the same cordial affection if they are read in that light they will be very entertaining and useful in the present age but in the next cicero pliny and voiture may regain their reputation the comments on popes sincerity were plainly ironical fenton considered him to be extremely hypocritical and some person concerned in the publication of 1726 must have formed the same opinion of his character if the ludicrous tailpiece is intended to be typical of the letters a little man whose diminutive stature did not permit him to clasp the taller figure in his arms while they stood upon a level is represented as having jumped off the ground and seized his companion round the waist who with his hands thrown into the air at the painful vehemence of the embrace is struggling to get loose undiscerning persons who judged the poet by his words would form a different estimate and would perceive only proofs of his excellence where fenton saw examples of his habitual insincerity his correspondence says johnson of the later collection of 1735 filled the nation with praises of his candour tenderness and benevolence the purity of his purposes and the fidelity of his friendship16  the letters to cromwell had more than an ephemeral success curll in his reply in 1729 to the attack on him in the dunciad after noticing popes affected depreciation of them says however they sell very well price 5s17 the poet had already devised an excuse for following them up by a second set theobald who had earned his lasting enmity by pointing out the errors in his edition of shakespeare was employed by some booksellers to edit the posthumous papers of wycherley which had been purchased from his heir the work appeared in 1728 pope saw in this circumstance a pretence for dragging his own letters before the world and an opportunity of gratifying his spleen against theobald he said that the poems were disreputable to the memory of his early friend and that the correspondence was published because it showed that it was his last resolution to have suppressed them18 it showed the reverse the last printed letter of wycherley exhibits him as intent as ever upon preparing his poems for the press and if we are to believe that he subsequently abandoned the design we must accept the fact upon the bare assertion of pope which derives no support from any part of the correspondence but though it failed to answer the purpose avowed by its editor it answered purposes not avowed which were much nearer to his heart it shows that the verses of wycherley were rugged feeble and full of repetitions and that whatever they possessed of strength and harmony was due to the revision of pope it shows that he furnished entire passages and where the text is not explicit on the point he is careful to reclaim his contributions in the notes it displays on the one hand the first sprightly runnings of the precocious young poet and on the other the last dull droppings of the veteran author who was verging upon his dotage if we were to judge says warburton of this set of letters by the manner of thinking and turn of expression we should conclude that they were all mistitled and that those given to the boy of sixteen were written by the man of seventy and the contrarysuch sober sense such gravity of manners and so much judgment and knowledge of composition enlivened with manly wit distinguish those of mr pope while a childish jealousy a puerile affectation a lying at catch for points together with a total contempt of method make up the character of those of mr wycherley warton transcribes the judgment of warburton and adds his testimony to the superiority of the letters of pope he says that he has excelled wycherley in his own way of striving to be always witty and that the perpetual attempt of the vain old man to be brilliant the accumulation of simile upon simile the antithesis the cant of satire the severity on authors critics and women are sufficiently disgusting in short the whole effect of the correspondence was to display the infirmities of wycherley and the merits of pope and his mode of relieving his departed friend from the reproach of the posthumous poems was to reveal the secret that the only portions of them which might have done him credit were not his own but the work of this zealous vindicator of his fame  with such a futile excuse for printing the letters pope was anxious to throw the responsibility upon some other person he was the intimate friend of edward the second earl of oxford who without being possessed of much ability courted the society of eminent men and who with no great tincture of literature had inherited from his father a passion for collecting books and manuscripts his correspondence with the poet descended with the rest of his personal papers to his only child who married the duke of portland in 1734 from the duchess the papers passed to her eldest daughter lady elizabeth wife to the third viscount weymouth who subsequently became the first marquess of bath the oxford manuscripts were consequently removed to longleat where they have remained ever since among the treasures of a library which is worthy of the regal edifice it adorns19 in popes letters to his friend we have his own record of the device he adopted he wrote to lord oxford in september 1729 and complained that the publication of wycherleys posthumous poems was derogatory to their author as well as to the critic who had advised him to recast them something he said will be necessary to be done to clear both his and my reputation which the letters under his hand will abundantly do for which particular reason i would desire to have them lodged in your lordships hands he had been slow in discovering that something was necessary to be done to clear the reputation of his deceased friend for theobalds book had come forth in 1728 and it was now the autumn of 1729 his tardy zeal appears to have been entirely begotten by the idea that it could be made the pretext for producing the correspondence but having once conceived the scheme he did not allow it to languish on the 6th of october he advanced a step further and began to shadow forth the real object of the request he informed lord oxford that some of the letters were to be printed and asked permission to state that they were already in his library which says he they shall be as soon as you will give orders to any one to receive them i would not he went on appear myself as publisher of them but any one else may or even the bookseller be supposed to have procured copies of themformerly or now it is equal certain it is that no other way can justice be rendered to the memory of a man to whom i had the first obligations of friendship almost in my childhood lord oxford merely replied that if the documents were left in a box with the porter the man had orders to place it in the library and that any mention of that library would be agreeable to its owner20 but he took no notice of the intimation that the poet designed to ascribe the publication to an imaginary agent pope now considered him to be sufficiently prepared and his next letter disclosed the whole of the scheme and at the same time announced its execution it then appeared that his noble dupe who as he was both weak and amiable was expected to prove a submissive tool had been asked to become the keeper of the manuscripts that he might be held up to the world as their publisher i am extremely obliged to you pope wrote to him for your kind permission to quote your library and to mention it in what manner i pleased i consulted mr lewis upon the turn of the preface and have exceeded perhaps my commission on one point though we both judged it the right way for i have made the publishers say that your lordship permitted them a copy of some of the papers from the library where the originals remain as testimonies of the truth it is indeed no more than a justice due to the dead and to the living author21 in other words his lordship was asserted to have permitted the bookseller to print the papers in his library when they were not even sent to his house till after they were printed and this fiction was fathered upon him without so much as his leave being asked or his having been suffered to read a single line of the work he was stated to have authorised when pope alleged that the proceeding was no more than a justice due to the dead and the living author he must have hoped that the outrage to lord oxford of which he had been guilty in committing the act would appear to be diminished by the assurance with which he communicated it his deceptions were not confined to the preface he shortly afterwards wrote to swift and contrived to mention that he had contracted a friendship at sixteen with a man of seventy i speak he said of old mr wycherley some letters of whom bythebye and of mine the booksellers have got and printed not without the concurrence of a noble friend of mine and yours i do not much approve of it though there is nothing in it for me to be ashamed of because i will not be ashamed of anything i do not do myself or of anything that is not immoral but merely dull22 the booksellers had printed the letters with the concurrence of a noble friend and the noble friend had never heard a word on the subject till the printing was completed pope did not much approve of it and he had protested to lord oxford that in no other way could justice be rendered to the memory of a man to whom he had the first obligations of friendship he would not be ashamed of what he did not do himself and he alone had edited the work and sent it to the press the value of his asseverations may be measured by the triple falsehood he volunteered to swift he was aware that the arguments by which he hoped to persuade lord oxford to become his dupe would not impose upon the penetrating understanding of the dean and he therefore openly repudiated what he was unable to excuse if the publication had vindicated wycherley it would have been its own justification but as it was put forth to do honour to pope he sacrificed his veracity to avoid the imputation of vanity he cruelly sneered in his prologue to the satires at the poor garretteer who urged the plea for printing his compositions that he was obliged by hunger and request of friends the poet had not the excuse of hunger and he improved upon the model he satirised when he pretended that his friends had taken his papers and printed them against his will  the deception which pope practised was never suspected till it was revealed by his correspondence with lord oxford which has hitherto remained in manuscript the repetition of the attempt on a more elaborate scale was less successful and it has always been believed by the immense majority of inquirers that the promulgation of the collection of 1735 which the poet vehemently denounced as an act of intolerable treachery was from first to last his own deed it seems says johnson that pope being desirous of printing his letters and not knowing how to do without imputation of vanity what has in this country been done very rarely contrived an appearance of compulsion that when he could complain that his letters were surreptitiously published he might decently and defensively publish them himself23 fresh facts have rendered the evidence against him stronger than ever and the whole derives increased force from the information we now possess that he had previously had recourse to a kindred falsehood in the first case he made a tool of a friend in the second he varied his plan and made a tool of an enemy  pope tells us in the preface to the authorised edition of his correspondence which he brought out in quarto in 1737 that his disgust at the publication of his letters to cromwell and the apprehension of more treatment of the same kind put him upon recalling as many as he could from those who he imagined had kept any24 he applied to his friend caryll in december 1726 to surrender his collection and on renewing the request a few days later he added i have desired the same thing of mrs blount with whose late worthy husband i entertained so long a correspondence and of all others it was more than two years before caryll could be induced to comply with the demand and it would seem that mrs blount was little less backward for on november 28 1729 pope wrote to swift i lately received from the widow of one dead correspondent and the father of another25 several of my own letters of about fifteen and twenty years old when the poet had gleaned together all the letters he could extort he immediately he says lessened the number by burning three parts in four of them the rest he spared not in any preference of their style or writing but merely as they preserved the memory of some friendships which will ever be dear to him or set in a true light some matters of fact from which the scribblers of the time had taken occasion to asperse either his friends or himself he was not more anxious to destroy the three parts than to secure the fourth from destruction he laid by the originals together with those of his correspondents and caused a copy to be taken to deposit in the library of a noble friend that in case either of the revival of slanders or the publication of surreptitious letters during his life or after a proper use might be made of them26 the noble friend was lord oxford and the request to be allowed to place the letters in his library was made by pope in september 1729 when he stated that he had had it at heart for half a year and more upon obtaining lord oxfords consent he had the correspondence transcribed under his own inspection and on october 16 he says i am causing the manuscripts to be fairly written and hope at your lordships return to be the presenter of them in person by his own avowal he had carefully culled his letters had prepared the selected portions for some public purpose and had taken the unusual precaution of preserving them in duplicate the end which he declared they were intended to serve was a palpable pretence he never specified any slanders they refuted and he could have had little idea of employing them to test the truth of surreptitious letters when he began by burning three parts of the collection and only retained a fourth the manifest fact was that while he was desirous of consigning to oblivion those portions of his correspondence which would not add to his reputation he was eager to circulate the picked specimens which he imagined would promote his fame  no advance seems to have been made towards the accomplishment of his design till 1733 when curll advertised a life of pope an unknown person who wrote a feigned hand and who signed his letters with the initials p t then opened a correspondence with the bookseller and furnished some information upon the genealogy of the poet he vindicated him from the charge of plebeian descent and affirmed that he sprung from the same stock as lord downe27 this assertion was repeated by pope in one of the notes to his prologue to the satires though mr pottinger his cousin ridiculed the fine pedigree which had never been heard of in the family and which there is nothing to confirm28 there is thus at starting a curious identity between the apocryphal statements of p t and the apocryphal statements of pope but as p t must have had access to the manuscripts in the keeping of lord oxford he might be supposed to have found the account among the memoranda of the poet and no great stress could be laid upon the coincidence to prove that p t was pope in disguise if the general tenor of the correspondence did not indicate its origin  there was a feud between pope and curll the bookseller believed that the poet had drugged him with an emetic he had been subsequently satirised in the dunciad and he had lost no opportunity of retaliating an uncompromising panegyric upon his antagonist would have run counter to his prejudices and while p t is careful to tell nothing which is not for the honour of pope he has the precaution to consult the antipathies of curll he pretends that the poet with whom he was formerly well acquainted has treated him like a stranger and that he cannot give so good an account of his manners as of his parentage he promises if he receives encouragement to make these moral deficiencies the subject of a future letter without entering into anything in anywise libellous he omitted however in his next communication to keep this part of his engagement and never reverted to it he had spoken of popes family in the same flattering and perhaps fictitious terms as pope himself but in spite of his pledge and his animosity he forbore to relate the minutest particular to the discredit of the poet the inconsistency between the assumed character and the actual conduct of p t is much too glaring an enemy would have been far less partial and considerate  the first communication of p t was dated october 1733 he directed curll to signify the acceptance of his offer by inserting in the daily advertiser the notice e c hath received a letter and will comply with p t this curll did and on the 15th of november got an answer from p t in which the true purpose of the manoeuvre transpires instead of sending traits of the defects in popes manners he announces that he has a large collection of his letters from the former part of his days till the year 1727 which will alone make the most authentic memoirs of him that could be he adds that they will form a four or five shilling volume and yet i expect no more he says than what will barely pay a transcriber that the originals may be preserved in mine or your hands to vouch for the truth of them he appealed to the hatred as well as to the avarice of the bookseller he again asserted that he had experienced bad treatment from pope and that his sole motive was to bestow upon him the same care which curll had done already29 again his thirst for retaliation ended in homage for the collection consisted of the identical letters which the poet had prepared for the press and which were intended to raise instead of to lower his reputation the conduct of p t who having abjured profit and only feigned revenge was to get nothing by his roguery is altogether incomprehensible if we are to suppose that he was what he professed but his conduct ceases to be a mystery if p t was pope who having finished editing his letters may be presumed to have had the same desire to find a pretext for printing them as he had exhibited in the instance of the correspondence with wycherley  the point upon which the bargain went off for a time is equally significant p t enclosed an advertisement of the letters and required as a preliminary that it should be put forth by curll for i shall not he said be justified to some people on whom i have dependence unless it seem to the public eye as no entire act of mine but i may be justified and excused if after they see such a collection is made by you i acknowledge i sent some letters to contribute thereto30 this reasoning carries its own refutation if his patrons could believe that curll without his aid had got at the bulk of the correspondence they would quite as readily have credited that he had not assisted the bookseller to the remainder nor is it likely that the men who would have renounced p t if he had been a principal in the business would have connived at his becoming an accomplice his plea was as fanciful as his desire for revenge but assume that pope was the real negotiator and his motive is transparent the advertisement would have threatened that very surreptitious publication of his letters against which he affirmed that he kept his own version in readiness he would have repudiated the impending piracy and hastened in selfdefence to commit the genuine edition to the press the promise contained in the advertisement that the originals would be shown at curlls when the book was published would have empowered him to give an air of imposture to the transaction and to damage his foe who when challenged would not have been able to produce the documents according to the language which pope uttered in the name of p t he did expect to be justified in his proceedings by means of the advertisement but not at all in the manner which he wished the bookseller to believe  all the conditions required by pope seemed met together in curll he was an enemy and could be denounced when he had been deceived he had printed the letters to cromwell without the consent of the poet and it would readily be credited that he had repeated the act he was not nice in his notions of honour and he might be expected to catch at an offer however discreditable which promised both profit and revenge but whatever might be his greediness and his malice they had not swallowed up his caution and notwithstanding that p t wrote again to express his dissatisfaction that no advertisement appeared curll forbore to announce letters he did not possess at the bidding of a conspirator whose name and person he did not know the subject in consequence slept from november 1733 till march 1735 when the poet was meditating some fresh proceeding respecting his correspondence for on the third of that month he requested lord oxford to send him by the hearer the bound book of copies of letters which he wanted he said to inspect for a day or two there are transcripts among the oxford papers of some of the letters of wycherley to pope which appeared in 1729 there are transcripts of popes correspondence with atterbury which appeared in 1737 there are transcripts of a large part of the swift correspondence which appeared in 1741 but while the earlier and later letters are preserved on loose sheets the bound book has vanished and there is not a single transcript of any letter which was first given to the world in the collection of 1735 the probability is that the book which pope professed to require for a day or two was never returned the circumstance is the more suspicious because he had the originals at home which would have served him for reference whereas if his object was to commit the letters clandestinely to the press he would use the copy which had been specially prepared for the purposewhich had been expurgated altered and sometimes remodelled accordingly we find that p t reappears at this crisis with the correspondence in print he had failed to lure curll by a promise of letters which he would not produce he now changed his tactics and offered him an entire impression of the book  this second act of the plot was opened by a communication of curll to pope on the 22nd of march three weeks after the letters had been withdrawn from the library of lord oxford he invited the poet to close their differences and as a proof of his readiness to oblige him sent him the old advertisement of p t curll asserted that he took the step by direction31 when he republished this statement he volunteered another which seems to be inconsistent with it and says that the discovery of the advertisement when arranging his papers determined him to propose a cessation of hostilities32 as he was unconscious however of any contradiction in the double account it is probable that he may have been influenced by some concurring advice it strengthens this view that pope in an anonymous narrative which he subsequently put forth reports what curll told a few days later to persons who sifted him in the affair33 which shows that the bookseller had people about him in the interest of the poet and these sifters as the critic in the athenæum remarks might when needful become prompters the progress of events proved that the letter of curll was at least singularly opportune and if not written by direction was one of those fortunate chances which often contribute to the success of the best laid schemes pope replied to it by inserting an advertisement in the grub street journal the daily journal and the daily post boy he stated in this manifesto that curll pretended that p t had offered him to print a large collection of popes letters that he would have no correspondence with curll that he knew no such person as p t that he believed the letters to be a forgery and that he should not trouble himself in the matter34 the poet might not choose to have any intercourse with a former enemy of no good fame but it was a strange return for his peaceoffering that he should advertise an insult on him and equally singular when he was incredulous and had resolved not to trouble himself about the matter that he should parade in the newspapers the contents of a private note yet extraordinary as was his conduct if he had not any covert design it was consistent enough if he was the agent in the plot for bringing his letters before the world his advertisement would convey the impression that he could not have connived at the publication he was contriving it would afford an opening for p t to come again upon the stage and by infuriating curll it would induce him to close at once with the proposal which was ready to be made to him in conformity with this supposition p t who had not communicated with the bookseller for upwards of two years saw the advertisement directly it appeared and he lost not an instant in informing curll that since their last negotiation he had printed the letters35 it was true that curll had betrayed him to pope but p t was generous and would still give him the preference the game required that pope should be incapable of being conciliated and p t of taking offence  p t demanded that curll should show he was in earnest by putting forth the old advertisement curll complied and the negotiation went forward an agent was sent to him who assumed the name of smythe and professed to be a clergyman but who was so little conversant with the character he personated that he wore a clerical gown and lawyers bands on the 7th of may he went to curlls house at night and to bring the bargain to a conclusion exhibited to him most of the sheets of the volume and a dozen original letters36 before curll had published this statement pope for the purpose of discrediting the promise which had been made in the advertisement that the originals should be produced when the book appeared had committed himself to the assertion that they all remained in their proper place37 they must nevertheless observes the critic in the athenæum have been out of his possession and doing service on the evening when smythe trafficed with curll the bookseller was not likely to be deceived for he had the cromwell correspondence in his keeping and knew the poets handwriting well38 he was as little likely to deceive for he told the fact in the course of a straightforward story without perceiving or at least without pointing out its force in attesting the connivance of pope  fifty copies of the letters were in the possession of curll by the 12th of may and were speedily sold smythe sent for him at one oclock to a tavern in leicester fields and half an hour afterwards one hundred and ninety additional copies were brought by a couple of porters who were directed to carry them to the shop of the bookseller there they were immediately seized by an order from the house of lords and curll was commanded to attend next day39 the peers in 1722 had voted it a breach of privilege to publish the writings of any member of their body without his consent curll in an advertisement which appeared for the first time that morning had given a list of the persons to whom popes letters were addressed and among the names were those of the earl of halifax and the earl of burlington to print letters to lords was no offence it was necessary that there should be letters from them and of this there was no other indication than that the list of names was followed by the wordswith the respective answers of each correspondent40 curll asserted that the advertisement came to him through smythe41 and the proceedings founded upon it in the hour that it issued wet from the press were as johnson states instigated by pope who attended to stimulate the resentment of his friends42 if he had never set eyes upon the book before it was published curiosity would still have prompted him to turn over the leaves and he must immediately have discovered that it did not contain a single letter from a peer the wording of the advertisement may therefore be suspected to have been devised by him to afford a colour for what he must have known was a groundless prosecution a committee was appointed to investigate the complaint it met on the 14th of may and the case would have ended as soon as it was begun if popes spokesman lord hay who resided at twickenham and was one of his associates had not adduced from a letter to jervas a passage which he alleged to be a reflection on lord burlington but the person who furnished the work to curll had by an elaborate device provided against a charge which no one except its contriver could have foreseen the fifty copies which were sold on the morning of the 12th before the power of the house of lords was put in motion contained the letter those which were furnished in the middle of the day as if to meet the messenger sent to seize them were all defective and in every case the letter to jervas was among the omissions43 nor had the leaves which contained it been simply kept back but every trace of it had been obliterated by an alteration at the printingpress in the complete work the missing letter commenced on p 115 of vol ii44 and ended on p 117 in the imperfect books a note on trumbull which began at p 114 is carried on to the top of p 115 and popes epitaph upon him which appears in no other copies of the correspondence is added to cover a little of the vacant space the word finis follows the note though in spite of this indication that the whole is concluded the work recommences on p 117 with the letters to gay which continue to p 15445 the coincidence was far too extraordinary to be undesigned pope who had incited the prosecution the very hour the book was published and who had been in such haste to instruct lord hay that the debate in the house of lords was concluded and the sheets seized by two oclock could alone have adapted one batch to afford a pretext for the proceeding and another batch to render the proceeding abortivehe alone could have arranged the delivery of the respective parcels and sent the fifty copies which contained the obnoxious passage in time to be sold in the morning and the one hundred and ninety copies in which it was wanting just in time to be captured by the messenger from the house of lords his object was not to procure the confiscation of the correspondence and stop the sale he wished to simulate indignation and divert suspicion from himself without interfering with the success of the work and he conducted the prosecution with so much care to ensure defeat that we may readily credit the assertion of curll that the lords declared they had been made popes tools46  while the copies seized by the messenger had not the letter to jervas they contained in compensation an address to the reader which was not in the first fifty copies sent to curll this preface betrays throughout the hand of pope the original proposition was that it should be furnished by curll and notwithstanding the revenge by which he professed to be actuated p t maintained that the poet ought to be mentioned with praise we must by no means he said seem to use him with disregard but rather commend lest by any circumstances i writ to you the publisher be detected47 i this was seven years after the appearance of the dunciad and pope was not so universally beloved as that the intimation that the correspondence was put forth by an enemy could direct suspicion to the culprit the pretence was too palpable to impose upon any one and p t who among other motives for his procedure probably mistrusted curlls cordiality or skill in a panegyric determined upon consideration to supply it himself he was not sparing in his tribute mr pope he wrote has not any great cause to think the publication much offence to his modesty or reflection on his judgment when we take care to inform the public that there are few letters of his in this collection which were not written under twenty years of age on the other hand we doubt not the reader will be much more surprised to find at that early period so much variety of style affecting sentiment and justness of criticism in pieces which must have been writ in haste very few perhaps ever reviewed and none intended for the eye of the public48 this was the very language of the poet he coveted the distinction of precocity of talent and was perpetually directing attention to the early age at which he affirmed and sometimes falsely that many of his letters and poems were penned he asserted that his most finished epistles were thrown off in haste which as they were always held to bear the marks of labour in every sentence is the last topic of praise that would have been selected by anybody else he was anxious to persuade the world that they were not revised before they were published and he prevaricated to foster the deception49 he protested that they were never meant for the press which no one believed and which could least of all be credited by the assumed traitor who transcribed them from the copy that had been deposited in the library of lord oxford to ensure their preservation the vindictive p t was both so fortunate and so hearty in his commendations that he proved the mere echo of pope in his selfapplauding moods  the other topics in the address to the reader were the same topics which were subsequently reiterated by the poet in his narrative of the p t plot and in the preface to the authorised edition of his correspondence he relates the method by which the cromwell letters were obtained as affording a vindication of his own collection50 p t was beforehand with him in citing the precedent to explain the means by which his piratical volume was formed and to justify its publication51 the similarity of language and ideas in the mention of the wycherley letters was much more peculiar lord oxford appears to have refused to father the volume of 1729 for pope never again alleged that he sent it to the press but neither did the poet avow that he himself was responsible for its appearance on the contrary he renewed the false statement that the letters were not printed till after they were deposited in lord oxfords library and spoke indefinitely of the agency through which they were given to the world it happened soon after he says in his narrative that the posthumous works of mr wycherley were published in such a manner as could no way increase the reputation of that gentleman who had been mr popes first correspondent and friend and several of these letters so fully showed the state of that case that it was thought but justice to mr wycherleys memory to print a few to discredit that imposition52 the next year he says in the preface to the quarto of 1737 the posthumous works of mr wycherley were printed in a way disreputable enough to his memory it was thought a justice due to him to show the world his better judgment and that it was his last resolution to have suppressed those poems as some of the letters which had passed between him and our author cleared that point they were published in 1729 with a few marginal notes added by a friend53 the letters to mr wycherley says p ts address to the reader were procured some years since on account of a surreptitious edition of his posthumous works as those letters showed the true state of that case the publication of them was doing the best justice to the memory of mr wycherley54 pope misrepresented the tenor of the letters as an excuse for divulging them but how came the vindictive p t to be the first to hit upon an untruth in which he had no sort of interest and to serve the cause of his antagonist by promulgating the fanciful description pope ascribed the publication to an indefinite agency to avoid acknowledging that he was the sole originator of the work but how came his enemy p t to anticipate his wishes and the ambiguous phraseology in which he conveyed them the identity of thought and expression was the more singular that p t in a private communication to curll had confirmed the original story of the poet and asserted that a noble lord had handed to the press the letters of wycherley55 to the world he varied the tale and the variation was the same which was adopted a week or two afterwards by pope  a coincidence remains which more than all the rest proclaims pope to be the author of the address to the reader nothing would have served better his purpose in the prosecution than to prevail upon curll to confess that the letters were of his own procuring and printing upon the seizure of the books smythe wrote to him in the name of p t promising that he should have the work upon easier terms and holding out the prospect of a second and more important volume of correspondence if he would keep secret the whole transaction would assert that he had the letters from different hands and avow that he had printed them as he did cromwells before56 the preface which had never been seen by curll and which was appended as if in anticipation of the event to all the copies carried off to the house of lords contained the same tale he was instructed to tell the collection it said hath been owing to several cabinets some drawn from thence by accidents and others even of those to ladies voluntarily given it is to one of that sex we are beholden for the whole correspondence with h cromwell esq which letters being lent her by that gentleman she took the liberty to print on the 12th of may the day the work was published pope gave a similar account to caryll of the mode by which the contents were procured what he said makes me sick of writing is the shameless industry of such fellows as curll and the idle ostentation or weak partiality of many of my correspondents who have shown about my letters which i never writ but in haste and generally against the grain in mere civility for almost all letters are impertinent further than si vales bene est ego valeo to such a degree that a volume of two hundred or more are printed by that rascal but he could never have injured me this way had not my friends furnished him with the occasion by keeping such wretched papers as they ought to have burned the whole of this passage is an egregious specimen of misrepresentation and hypocrisy a glance at the work must have revealed to pope that the new letters it contained were those which had been returned to himthe letters to gay digby blount and caryll that it comprised letters to as well as from him57letters of which he was the sole depositary that the text was not taken from the originals but from the copy he had amended and recast and that it was therefore impossible that his acquaintances should have furnished materials which could only have been derived from one sourcethe bound book in the oxford library his pretence that his letters were hasty and insignificant expressions of civility when he had spared no pains in collecting and editing them his affected indignation at his friends for keeping such wretched papers as they ought to have burned when he himself had preserved them in duplicate and designed them for publication his transparent fiction that almost the entire circle of his correspondentsaddison steele congreve gay walsh trumbull craggs digby blount and othershad been guilty of idle ostentation or weak partiality in showing these wretched papers to somebody who transcribed them for the pressare all so many additional arguments to show the conscious guilt of pope and the gross and clumsy inventions by which he endeavoured to divert suspicion the fable he concocted is in its essential circumstance identical with the fabulous story of p t while p t on his part is telling a falsehood to the public in the preface and begging the bookseller to tell it in the house of lords pope on his own behalf is telling the same falsehood in private to caryll this concurrence of misrepresentation between the letter of the poet and p ts address to the reader and instructions to curll could not have proceeded from independent and hostile persons  curll did not choose when he was before the committee of the house of lords to father the lie which had been suggested to him the proceedings were adjourned from the 14th to the 15th that the clerk might search through some more copies of the book for the missing letter to jervas and p t employed the interval in again pressing curll to assume the entire responsibility of the work he gently rebuked him for owning that the books were sent by an unknown hand which might he said be thought shuffling and induce inquiry and suspicion of some dark transaction and he assured him that the lords would consider him more sincere if he professed that he had the letters from different hands and had printed them himself58 curll repudiated the notion of evidencing his sincerity by deposing to a falsehood and of silencing inquiry and suspicion by pretending that he had procured a quantity of manuscripts from a variety of persons whom he must have refused to name my defence he replied is right i only told the lords i did not know from whence the books came this was strict truth and prevented all further inquiry59 the pertinacity of p t in endeavouring to persuade the bookseller to commit himself to a lie was as gratuitous as it was shameless for he had no interest in the deception he urged curll had several weeks before announced to pope that this mysterious agent was the collector of the letters and pope in communicating the intelligence to the public declared that he knew no such person the renewed mention of a couple of fanciful initials could not increase p ts risk of detection any more than it could signify whether he had sold the correspondence to curll to be printed or had printed it first and sold it afterwards but what would have been purposeless in p t was important to pope the friends who had returned him the letters which appeared in the volume must have joined with the public in ascribing the work to him and it was of the utmost moment that curll should absolve him from the imputation having entrapped his victim into a false confession he would have loudly appealed to it to prove that he was not only innocent but injured he would have complained to the world as he had done to caryll of the idle ostentation and weak partiality which had caused his hasty and artless letters to be printed and his vanity would have been doubly gratified by the appearance that his choicest compositions were the careless scratchings of his pen and that the personal and literary merits they displayed had been forced into day to the grievous annoyance of his reluctant modesty  every incident which arose in the progress of the controversy strengthened the case against pope at the same time that smythe on the behalf of p t exhorted curll to give false evidence before the house of lords he informed the bookseller of the method by which a portion of the correspondence had been acquired p t had been engaged with a noble friend of mr pope in preparing for the press the letters of wycherley and had caused some extra copies to be struck off these he said put into his head the thought of collecting more and when he printed the materials he had since accumulated he imitated as closely as possible the type and paper of the stored up sheets60 p t made a merit of the revelation and wished that curll should see in it a proof of the openness and confidence with which he was treated in reality it was an endeavour to explain the awkward circumstance that the prose part of popes wycherley had been done up with the letters of 1735 the publication of 1729 was entitled the second volume of wycherleys posthumous works and contained a couple of notes referring to poems which were inserted or omitted in what was called the present edition but as popes letters were not an edition of wycherleys works the absurdity of the reference might have led at any moment to the exposure of the fact that the sheets of the old book had been transferred to the new and it was better at once by an air of candid confession to account for the importation than to run the risk of discovery curll had soon a rival version to give of the manner in which these sheets were procured he announced that gilliver who published the wycherley volume of 1729 had declared that pope bought of him the remainder of the impression consisting of six hundred copies and directed the other letters comprised in the volume of 1735 to be printed to match them61 there can be no difficulty in deciding between these opposite statements the assertion of p t we know to be a falsehood for pope himself and not the noble friend prepared the letters of wycherley for the press none of the inferior agents could have carried off any large number of books without detection nor could have stowed them away from 1729 to 1735 the motive to thieve what was already published could only have been lucre and yet thirty pounds were taken for three hundred octavos of 47062 pages each when but 50 of these pages were derived from the sheets that cost nothing if too there was any truth in p ts story he was encumbered with the pile of stolen goods when he opened the correspondence with curll in 1733 whereas it is clear from his communications at that time that the idea of supplying printed books had not then occurred to him the trick which had been practised was known to pope when he put forth his narrative and he might have obtained a clue to the culprit by an investigation at the printingoffice he nevertheless made no comments on the subject nor loudly as he exclaimed against the abstraction of his letters did he breathe a whisper against the abstraction of the sheets of the wycherley not a single specimen again of the work of 1729 is now known to exist which is in some degree explained by its absorption into the volume of 1735 but on the supposition that the sheets transferred to that volume were merely extra copies struck off secretly for p t there is no reason why the wycherley of 1729 should have disappeared the conflicting statement of curll is not embarrassed by any of these difficulties and was never denied by either gilliver or pope which is of itself sufficient to establish its truth when we bear in mind that instead of confronting calumny with silence the poet denounced every charge he could repel  the letter urging curll anew to make a false statement of the means by which he obtained the correspondence was received by him on the morning of may 15 i am he said in his reply just again going to the lords to finish pope63 he verified his boast in place of adopting the advice of p t he showed the letter which contained it64 popes double dealing had been strongly suspected on the previous day when it was discovered that the copies seized had been altered in anticipation of the charge he preferred there was now a second coincidence to connect him with the plot the letter produced by curll revealed that the correspondence had been taken from the archives of lord oxford and that the story pope had volunteered to caryll and which he undoubtedly reiterated to his friends among the lords was not only an invention to conceal the truth but the same invention which p t exhorted the bookseller to adopt some step was necessary to save the poet from discomfiture he therefore put forth an advertisement in the daily postboy acknowledging what he was no longer able to deny that some of the letters could only be procured from his own library or that of a noble lord and promising twenty guineas to either smythe or p t if they would discover the whole affair and forty guineas if they could prove that they had acted by the direction of any other person65 this was an old device of the poet to escape from the obloquy he incurred by an impious and indecent parody of the first psalm he inserted an advertisement in the postman offering a reward of three guineas for the discovery of the person who sent it to the press the publisher mrs burleigh declared that she possessed the manuscript in his own handwriting and expressed her readiness to produce it but he never ventured to accept the challenge or to contradict her assertion66 pope did not acknowledge that the essence of a falsehood was in the deceit if you have seen a late advertisement he wrote to miss blount august 7 1716 alluding probably to this transaction you will know that i have not told a lie which we both abominate but equivocated pretty genteelly without in strict language disclaiming the authorship he intended that the reader should understand it as a disclaimer his advertisement respecting the letters was a kindred case he meant it to be received as a denial of all connivance at the publication of his correspondence and in strict language he denied nothing he said that the book was printed by p t in combination with smythe which was equally true if p t was pope he could use the phrase some of the letters when driven to confess that they were procured from the library of lord oxford because the volume contained the cromwell and wycherley letters which had been printed before he could hold out the bait of rewards to himself without any risk of betrayal and the manoeuvre must have been adopted in concert with his accomplice smythe upon whose secresy and fidelity he was already dependent  the committee of the lords reported that there was not a letter from any peer in the work and since no law had been infringed they recommended that the seized copies should be restored67 motte the bookseller writing to swift in july 31 1735 says that when curll was before the house he was ruffled for the publication in a manner as to a man of less impudence than his own would have been very uneasy with whatever virulence he may have been attacked by the partisans of the poet he was invulnerable from his want of character as well as from his want of shame and he had the gratification of inflicting wounds he could not receive pope he said to the lords has a knack of versifying but in prose i think myself a match for him68 he afterwards boasted that he had not only vindicated his assertion but that he might affirm with regard to all the attacks made upon him by the petulant little gentlemanveni vidi vici69 his ally p t derived no satisfaction from this victory over their common antagonist curll had proved a less ready dupe than had been anticipated and his insidious prompter reproached him for his adherence to the truth smythe informed him that p t was out of humour with him for not owning the printing at his final attendance before the committee of the house of lords that he had probably by his wilfulness lost a future copyright of immense value and that his imperfect sheets would not be completed nor additional books supplied unless he paid twenty pounds in advance70 the reply of curll was lofty and defiant he said he cared nothing for any mans illhumour that he would never stoop to own a fact of which he was innocent that he had acted justly which was what he should always think wisely that he despised the future copyright of which hopes were held out to him that he would have no more dealings with such dark suspicious characters and that unless he was frankly and fairly treated he would print all the letters he had received from them71 p t had previously stipulated that his letters should be given up to him72 but curll had the precaution to take copies before he returned the originals and to avoid cavil he stated that he would make an affidavit of their accuracy the effect of the threat showed the alarm it excited smythe completely changed his tone he no longer prefers complaints against curll nor exacts conditions he is his friend and servant and will bring him the remainder of the impression on thursday he professes to be tired with the caprice of p t and has hardly written the words when he announces that he has been sent for by him and hears from the messenger that he is in good humour73 though p t was awed curll no longer trusted him and before thursday came the bookseller had advertised what he called from the signature of the chief conspirator the initial correspondence74  p t and smythe put forth a counteradvertisement on the 23rd of may in which they declared that they would retaliate by committing to the press the letters of curll75 the ostensible motive of the mock clergyman and his employer was to cover the bookseller with infamy the effect they said will be to open a scene of baseness and fouldealing that will sufficiently show to mankind his character and conduct the correspondence does not bear out this description the documents show that the lying and trickery rested with p t while the bookseller was veracious in his assertions and straightforward in his proceedings that curll says johnson gave a true account of the transaction it is reasonable to believe because no falsehood was ever detected76 it was his boast that falsehood had been his abhorrence throughout the discussion and he drew vaunting comparisons between popes addiction to the vice and his own detestation of it77 his very failings in one direction had helped to sustain his virtue in another he had too much effrontery to care to descend to duplicity and it is impossible to read his many controversial manifestoes without perceiving that he was in general as truthful as he was impudent in the instance of popes letters there is the original blot that he saw no discredit in publishing papers which he supposed to be purloined but he had already avowed the fact before the house of lords and the crime was more than shared by p t in everything else the acts and language of the bookseller contrast favourably with the meanness and falsehoods of his correspondent who would not have assisted to disseminate the record of his own misdeeds but it was different with the poet he must have seen that the inevitable tendency of the initial correspondence would be to convict him of the offences he had tried to fasten upon curll his single chance of diminishing its disastrous effect was to promulgate it as evidence upon his own side and not to allow it to come forth solely as the hostile statement of an opponent the proceeding in p t would have been to aid in propagating the proofs of p ts baseness and fouldealing in pope it was an effort to throw upon the initials the stigma which would otherwise have fallen upon pope himself  the resolution of p t to proclaim his own disgrace was less extraordinary than his manner of doing it it was announced on the 24th of may that the clergyman concerned with p t and edmund curll to publish mr popes letters hath discovered the whole transaction and a narrative of the same will be speedily printed78 hence it appears that smythe had made a full confession to the author of the narrative and p t must be presumed to have been a party to it since he transmitted the originals of the communications he had addressed to curll together with curlls replies this narrative was the work of pope he alone could have furnished several of the particulars together with the letter which curll wrote to him in march 1735 and the statements the misrepresentations79 the reflections and sometimes the words are the same which he employed in the preface to the quarto of 1737 hitherto p t had been so fearful of detection by the poet that in the language of smythe he suspected his own shadow he now unmasked himself without a motive and without reserve to the man he had injured he had nothing to tell of curll but what curll had insisted upon relating before the house of lords and the only novel information he could give was the details of his own thefts and frauds this indeed was what pope would chiefly have cared to learn he would have been eager to ascertain who the person could be that had got access to his letters and the means by which they were copied and printed and he certainly would not have called anything a discovery of the whole transaction which contained no revelation upon the only points of the least importance but it is extremely improbable that the wary p t should have wantonly turned selfaccuser to the last this fabulous personage continued to act in the manner which was most convenient to pope and the true explanation of the pretended confession is that it was a fiction of the poet to account for his possession of the correspondence with curll  more inexplicable than all was the forbearance of pope to produce the facts in his narrative he might feel bound to suppress the names of culprits who had volunteered a confession of their crime but he might have told the manner of the theft and specified the printer employed by p t he refrained on the contrary from revealing the particulars which would have absolved him from an odious imputation he kept back every tittle of evidence which would have acquitted him if he was innocent and have implicated him if he was guilty his story has none of the circumstantiality of an actual occurrence his statements are as indefinite as the agents were shadowy he disclosed the dealings of p t with curll which curll had noised abroad and was about to publish but he does not bestow a thought upon the far more essential question of the mode in which the correspondence was purloined and seems to be satisfied himself and wishes that the world should be satisfied likewise with learning that a person whose only designation was a couple of initials sent the letters ready printed to the bookseller obliged to abandon his original story of the means by which they found their way to the press pope had now some powerful reason for diverting attention from the subject and leaving the mystery unexplained  he speedily manifested his desire to consign p t to oblivion and reverted to his former scheme of imputing the publication to curll in the very narrative which showed that the bookseller had no share in gathering together the correspondence pope inculcated the idea that he had been active in the task he charged him with having put forth an advertisement of the letters to cromwell in which he promised encouragement to all persons who should send him more and adds a little lower down by these honest means mr curll went on increasing his collection80 the accused challenged him to produce the advertisement and the accuser was silent he persevered nevertheless in misrepresenting to his acquaintances curlls part in the business writing to fortescue on march 26 1736 of the volume of 1735 he calls it the book of letters which curll printed and spared not though the poets own witnesses p t and smythe had demonstrated even in their anger against curll that he had nothing to do with procuring or printing the letters and was merely the vendor of the copies he had bought in popes complaints to his other friends curll is the single culprit to whom he ascribed the injury he had suffered and on no one occasion did he go through the form of keeping up his p t fiction his misrepresentations to the world at large were more covertly expressed he spoke in his authorised edition of the publishers own accounts in his prefaces and as his first example quotes p ts address to the reader which he knew from the letters of smythe had never been seen by the publisher till it was shown him at the bar of the house of lords to help out the misstatement in the text his reference in a note is made to curlls reprint of the collection of 1735 instead of to the volume in which the address to the reader was originally produced81 nor was it perhaps without design that in the catalogue of surreptitious editions prefixed to an octavo impression of his letters which appeared in 1737 he put first in the list as if it had been the parent of the rest an edition of curll which was taken from the volume of p t and allotted the second place to the primitive text he never revived the clumsy fabrication he had been compelled to promulgate in his narrative in private he transferred the crimes of p t to curll in public he insinuated what he dared not assert for fear of retaliation but neither in public nor private was anything heard of the phantom who had purloined printed and sold the correspondence had his existence been real or the invention been credited pope would not have persisted in calumniating the bookseller for want of a culprit upon whom to lay the offence  faulkner the dublin printer told dr birch in 1749 that james worsdale was the person who went to curll by popes direction in the habit of a clergyman82 before the entry in birchs diary was published dr johnson had given the same account in his lives of the poets83 worsdale was a painter dramatist and actor and as if his triple calling was insufficient for his versatile disposition he followed a fourth and was hired johnson says to conduct clandestine negotiations when an attempt was made to extort money from the second son of sir robert walpole he was engaged to mix with the conspirators to win their confidence and to betray it they were convicted of the fraud and worsdale in giving his evidence acted with so much life and spirit the several parts he had performed during the time of sifting out the mystery as gave no small diversion to the court84 according to horace walpole the poet had employed this personator and detector of rogues in his more reputable capacity to make several copies of a portrait of atterbury85 he seemed formed to carry on the traffic with curll and since it was his profession to aid in plots he might be expected to be a secret as well as a willing assistant johnson who attached some weight to his evidence says he was of doubtful veracityan objection which would have applied to the disclosures of any representative of smythe for no upright man would have played a part in a scheme of deception his assertion would have been worthless if it had stood alone but it at least falls in with the numerous circumstances which all conjoin to criminate pope  if his impatience to print the wycherley correspondence renders it probable that he would be anxious to print the more important collection which he had sedulously prepared for the press if the deception he practised in 1729 to avoid being taxed with the proceeding and to throw it upon somebody else favours the belief that he repeated the deception in 1735 with the same intention and if the various facts connected with the publication unite to prove with accumulative force that he was the sole contriver of it there is the further argument that no other person had the slightest interest in perpetrating the act the numbers says dr johnson offered to sale by the private messengers showed that the hope of gain could not have been the motive to the impression money was so little the object that a parcel of the books was sent to lintot for which no price was ever demanded as he had made known his resolution not to pay a porter and consequently not to deal with a nameless agent86 any person in the employment of lord oxford who had access to the papers and was competent to transcribe them would not have undergone the toil and risked detection disgrace and ruin for the sake of a few pounds which he must have shared with his accomplice smythe the vaunted revenge of p t could not have been the motive for beyond the empty profession it was belied alike by his words and deeds the poet in truth loved himself too well to be able to counterfeit speciously the part of a hater p t published the letters which pope meant to be published he lauded pope in popes own strain he took the measures which were most to popes advantage he reflected popes vanities weaknesses and falsehoods and behaved throughout in a manner as identical with popes position as it was remote from his own lucre and revenge were propensities to which p t was a stranger though he aspired to a reputation for the latter and the only passion apparent in his conduct is his mania to gratify by dishonesty and deceit the literary ambition of pope  the engineer was hoist with his own petard and curll the intended victim had the satisfaction of being the executioner the poet plainly considered him to be a scoundrel whom he had a right to damage by any means foul or fair walter scott believed that his inveterate persecutor administered the emetic to him and extraordinary as it may seem that a celebrated man of letters should adopt this method of punishing an obnoxious bookseller the language of pope obliges us to accept the conclusion87 the trick was puerile and degrading but it inflicted no injury the prosecution in the house of lords and the subsequent effort to fasten his own misdeeds upon his enemy was an outrage of a different description to lure him into purchasing a book and then to employ the influence conferred by genius in founding charges upon the act which were absolutely groundless and in branding him with the disgrace which belonged to his accuser was a baseness of which the lowest grubstreet scribbler satirised in the dunciad would probably not have been capable a spirit of unfairness which bad as it might be was less injurious pervaded his commercial dealings with curll the bookseller paid ten pounds in money and twenty pounds in promissory notes for three hundred copies of the work two hundred and forty only were delivered and of these one hundred and ninety wanted the letters to jervas digby blount and others88 p t and smythe stated in their advertisement of may 23 that curlls notes had proved not negotiable which they seem to have designed as an excuse for not completing the imperfect books89 curll maintained that the defence added slander to treachery for the notes were not due till the 12th of june and he indignantly declared that they would be honoured if the terms of the bargain were fulfilled90 but these terms were never intended to be performed smythe had contracted to reserve the whole impression for curll and assured him on may 10 that no one else should sell a single copy91 the pledge was violated as soon as made by sending a parcel of the books to lintot and one of the artifices which marked every part of the transaction was employed in public to counteract the promises which had been given in private as curll was to provide his own titlepage and preface and the copies seized by the order of the house of lords had a titlepage and preface by p t smythe wrote to curll on the 13th of may to explain this departure from the arrangement a wonderful caution had suddenly seized p t who apprehending that an injunction might be obtained in chancery against curll had furnished a preface which threw the publication entirely off him and a titlepage in which substituting the entire trade for an individual it was said that the volume was printed and sold by the booksellers of london and westminster92 this was pronounced by smythe to be as lucky as could be and it was certainly a curious piece of fortune which caused p t to transmit the fifty early copies without title or preface and inspired him immediately afterwards to attach both to the copies which were instantly to be pounced upon by a messenger from the lords to deceive curll by promises was the first end to be attained and he was led to believe that he would have a monopoly of the work to deprive him of the advantages he imagined he had secured was a second though a subordinate object of the conspiracy the whole corporation of booksellers were to be invited to encroach upon his rights and the preface and titlepage affixed to the copies produced at the bar of the house of lords had been drawn up with the secret purpose of contradicting any claim which might be set up by curll when smythe wrote his deceptive explanation of the motives of p t these confederates were endeavouring to coax their dupe into owning that he was the collector of the letters and it was necessary that he should still be humoured and beguiled when the mask was thrown off p t and smythe joined in the declaration that they had neither of them given or could pretend to give any title whatever to mr popes letters to curll and they promised that every bookseller should be indemnified every way from any possible prosecution or molestation of the said curll93 this invitation to all the world to republish the correspondence of pope was advertised in the newspapers and the poet shortly afterwards reprinted it in his narrative without a word of direct remonstrance against the pretension to dispose of his property p t had always hitherto adopted the course which furthered the projects of pope and pope in return appeared to smile upon the enormous prerogative to make a general grant of his correspondence which had been assumed by p t commercial honesty was not to be expected in a plan which was based upon falsehood and calumny but if an ordinary tradesman had conducted his dealings in the same manner as pope his custom and character would have been destroyed the events which followed the publication lead to the same conclusion with the incidents which preceded and attended it pope stated in his narrative that there were so many omissions and interpolations in the surreptitious volume that it was impossible for him to own the contents in their present condition94 in two distinct advertisements which he put forth in may and july 1735 he went further and declared that some of the letters were not his at all95 nevertheless the bookseller cooper with whom he was now in alliance reprinted the entire collection and brought it out on the 12th of june he at the same time announced that his edition had been entered at stationers hall according to the act of queen anne and that edmund curll or any other pirater of the book should be prosecuted curll then served upon him a process the purport of which does not appear and pope wrote to his friend and counsel fortescue who a few months later was raised to the bench and informed him that he had bid cooper send him the document for his legal opinion begged to be acquainted with the steps which were necessary to be taken and acknowledged that he had connived at coopers publication in a subsequent note he asks for further directions in the conduct of the case the poet and the bookseller were therefore working in conjunction or to speak more correctly the bookseller was the agent of the poet it must have been by popes authority that he appropriated the copyright of the letters and threatened proceedings against any one who invaded it when curll took up the gauntlet pope adopted the cause engaged fortescue in the defence and carried on with him the correspondence respecting it his sanction of the publication is confirmed by the catalogue of surreptitious editions since this impression of cooper is omitted from the list notwithstanding the insertion of a later impression by the same bookseller containing some slight additions that had not been ordered by pope thus while the poet pretended that he could not own the p t collection with its mutilated interpolated and forged letters he had secretly authorised a reprint which was identical with the collection he denounced his actions evince the insincerity of his words he had the power to erase the forgeries and interpolations with a stroke of his pen and unless he had approved of the book in its primitive state he would not have entered into a league with cooper to produce it unaltered he afterwards seemed to disclaim the republication he had espoused in the preface to his avowed edition in 1737 he spoke of the piratical printers of the surreptitious editions without making any exception and said that there was not one of them to whom he had ever given the least title or any other encouragement than that of not prosecuting them this was either a direct untruth or what was more in accordance with his peculiar morality a deceptive quibble though he knew that his readers must infer that the epithet piratical was applied to all the printers who had put forth an edition of the volume of 1735 he may yet have justified to himself the assertion that he had never given the least title to any of them by the reflection that as he had given a title to cooper he was not a piratical printer  while the inquiry was going on before the house of lords in may smythe impressed upon curll that p t had his whole heart set upon the publication of the letters not so much on account of the volume which had been seized as because it was the precursor of a much more important correspondence with swift the late lord oxford the bishop of rochester and lord bolingbroke96 when p t disappeared from the scene pope is found to have inherited his ideas and to be animated by the desire to complete the schemes his enemy left unfulfilled since i saw you he wrote to lord oxford june 17 1735 i have learnt of an excellent machine of curlls or rather his directors to engraft a lie upon to make me seem more concerned than i was in the affair of the letters it is so artful an one that i longed to tell it younot that i will enter into any controversy with such a dog but i believe it will occasion a thing you will not be sorry for relating to the bishop of rochesters letters and papers there are no further particulars to explain in what degree pope had acknowledged to lord oxford that he was concerned in the affair of the letters97 nor does any record remain of the artful device of curll or of the new director who had succeeded to p t and smythe the want of all foundation for the allegations against the bookseller is probably the cause of the vagueness of the allusions the single palpable circumstance is that in spite of his lamentations at the publication of his letters pope was already designing to send a fresh instalment of them to the press whatever may have been the excellent machine to which he darkly referred curll had furnished him with the pretence he sought the bookseller put forth a new edition of the printed copies he purchased from p t and called it the first volume of mr popes literary correspondence partly perhaps to vex pope and partly to attract purchasers he affixed the same title to future volumes which were principally a medley of trash that had no relation to the poet among the promised contents of the second volume were atterburys letters to mr pope pope cited the announcement as a reason for publishing his correspondence with the bishop which p t had enumerated among the much more important correspondence that was intended to follow and which the poet in precise agreement with him declared was of a nature less insignificant than the printed collection98 the coincidence of opinion between these bitter antagonists is especially remarkable because others have not been struck with the superiority of the letters of atterbury mr croker thought them with one or two exceptions dull pedantic and commonplace and warton complains that they are many of them crowded to affectation with trite quotations from horace and virgil the excuse for making them public was weak in the extreme on the 12th of june cooper replied to curlls advertisement of his second volume by a counteradvertisement and offered him ten pounds for any letter of atterbury to pope or of pope to atterbury of which he could produce the original or a voucher p ts copy if it existed must have been demanded when he made his confession and it is among the circumstances which show this confession to have been a fiction that the poet in his narrative omitted to mention the surrender of the important transcript and never subsequently alluded to its existence without copies or originals curll could not violate the secrecy for which pope affected to be anxious the poet in fact did not put forth his pretence for printing the correspondence till he had received practical evidence of the poverty of the booksellers resources curlls volume was published on the 14th of july99 and popes advertisement did not come out till the following day it was drawn up on the 13th100 when he had probably seen an early copy of the book or he would have waited till the next morning when he could have read in conjunction with the rest of the public the letters which atterbury was alleged to have written to him they were three in number the longest was a statement printed by the bishop and addressed to the entire world refuting a charge of having corrupted the manuscript of clarendons history the remaining two were pronounced by pope to be forgeries and of these one had already appeared in a biographical dictionary101 and the other consisted chiefly of poetical quotations not a line had oozed out from his private papers and the argument for divulging them was gone a man who was eager to drag them into day might use the incident as a pretext but anybody who did not court publicity would have left them in their obscurity upon the discovery that they continued safe from prying eyes and transcribing fingers popes practice and professions were as usual at variance he raised a cry of distress at the publication of his letters by p t and laid hold of the first hollow excuse for completing the obnoxious design and spreading before the world that portion of his correspondence which p t had been unable to smuggle into print in consequence of curlls unexpected revelation of the plot  pope stated in his advertisement that along with his correspondence with the bishop of rochester he should publish such of the letters as were genuine from the surreptitious volume and added that the work would be printed with all convenient speed102 but speed was not convenient the project slept till march 26 1736 when he writes to fortescue your too partial mention of the book of letters with all its faults and follies which curll printed and spared not nor yet will spare for he has published a fourth sham volume yesterday makes me think it may not be amiss to send youwhat i know you will be much more pleased with than i can bea proposal for a correct edition of them which at last i find must be offered since people have misunderstood an advertisement i printed some time ago merely to put some stop to that rascals books as a promise that i would publish such a book his excuse for the delay in redeeming his pledge of supplying an authentic edition is a curious instance of the absurdity to which a man of genius may be reduced when unable to divulge his true reasons he has recourse to invention people could not have misunderstood the advertisement as a promise that he would publish such a book for the promise was distinct and there was no room left for misunderstanding in the matter but if we allow that an advertisement in the newspapers asserting that he was under a necessity of putting out a genuine edition which would be printed with all convenient speed was only designed to be read as a threat for the purpose of stopping curlls trade it is plain that curll must have become acquainted with an interpretation which was apparent to the rest of the world and would have paid no attention to a menace that was not intended to be executed unless pope desired that the public should believe he was serious the whole proceeding was objectless he was long in learning the misconstruction which had been put upon his words while the announcement was fresh and likely to have been a topic of conversation he remained completely passive and it was not till after an interval of more than eight months that he discovered he was supposed to have given a pledge and must immediately redeem it he had forgotten that he had betrayed to fortescue that he was in earnest at the time the advertisement appeared on august 2 1735 a fortnight after it was issued pope wrote to him and asked to have back his letters for said he i find my collection such as it is must be hastened or will not be so effectual it had not yet occurred to him to maintain that his promised publication was a feint the true cause of his procrastination has been suggested by the critic in the athenæum he had distributed portions of his extensive correspondence with caryll among other groups and addressed several of the letters to men of higher position or greater fame he must have rejected the fictitious compound from his genuine edition or waited till caryll who was sinking with age and illness was in his grave the latter was the course which pope preferred his friend was no doubt dying at the close of march 1736 and on the 6th of april he expired with him disappeared the sole difficulty which stood in the way of the new edition and the poet from that moment was active in its prosecution  it is amusing to observe the indifference and distaste which pope feigned for an undertaking that was entirely within his own discretion he began by announcing that the work would be printed with speed he then protested he did not mean what he said and only yielded because others had erroneously inferred that by advertising in the papers that he would immediately print a book he intended to signify that a book would be printed he next resolved to publish by subscription which was a mode of levying forced contributions through the canvass of the author and his friends he hoped nevertheless that the subscription would fail in order that he might be excused from an act to which he had been overpersuaded103 his hope that support would be withheld had grown to a belief when he wrote to allen on the 30th of april and allen who had sought his acquaintance from admiration of the benevolence and goodness of heart which pervaded his letters offered to bear the cost of the impression the public by their backwardness afforded pope the opportunity he professed to desire of dropping the work but the patronage of an individual was sufficient encouragement he at once replied that he would not serve his private fame entirely at anothers expense but that he would accept the assistance in any moderate degree which meant that he would allow allen to defray the outlay which was in excess of the amount subscribed104 time wore on the letters were threequarters printed and the subscribers were few105 in his first receipts the poet had stated that if he did not proceed with the book the money should be returned on demand after midsummer106 the unwilling public pleaded the uncertainty as a reason for not putting down their names he admitted that the doubt they expressed was a pretence and informed allen that to deprive them of the pretext he had substituted receipts in which he promised to deliver the volume by lady day107 his object he said was to save allens purse the reluctance had ceased to be with the poet he began by consenting to print a book he would rather not have printed that he might oblige the world and ended by compelling the world to subscribe to a book they would rather not have purchased that they might oblige pope  the subscription was a guinea for a quarto volume and the donation of allen which pope acknowledged in his will was probably paid in part on this occasion the copyright was purchased by dodsley108 and from these united sources of emolument the book produced as johnson had heard sufficient profit109 it appeared on may 18 1737 in folio and quarto and a little later in octavo that the various sizes might range with previous editions of the poets works in the preface he enters into a history of the fate which had attended his letters and of the circumstances which compelled him to publish them but with a studious avoidance of every question which had been raised by the collection of 1735 he says it is notorious what means have been taken to procure his correspondence and disposes of the single instance which required explanation by enumerating among the methods the transacting with people who dealt without names in the dark he says that several letters have been ascribed to him which he did not write and specifies examples none of which appeared in the book sold to curll he says that the piratical editions contain various passages which no man of common sense would have printed himself and this he could assert with truth because the greater part of the cromwell series owed their publicity to mrs thomas alone he declares that he had not authorised any of the surreptitious impressions but forbore to allege that the primitive impression was surreptitious and shunned all allusion to its birth and parentage he laments the need which exists for his own volume and when he proceeds to state the case fairly in the present situation none of his reasons appertain to the work of p t he indulges in general declamation upon the enormity of procuring letters by disreputable contrivances but carefully avoids affirming that any of those which first saw the light in 1735 were obtained in the manner he deprecates he assures us indeed that his epistolary effusions are emanations of the heart and not efforts of genius and adds this alone may induce any candid reader to believe their publication an act of necessity rather than vanity which honestly interpreted implies that he was not the person who originally sent them to the press the candid writer however omitted to inform the candid reader of the pains he had taken to render them worthy of his head as well as of his heart and the falsification of the premises destroys the credibility of the inference the silence of pope upon the p t collection is under the circumstances equivalent to a confession of guilt he gives an account of the surreptitious publication of his letters to cromwell he states the reason of the publication of his letters to wycherley he reverts once and again to what he justly called the sham volumes of curll he records the minutest wrong he can detect in the execution of any of the hostile schemes but though the conduct of p t was the most flagrant of all though the poet was believed to be the contriver of the plot and his enemies taunted him with the fraud though he professed to have learnt the details of the mystery and half a dozen sentences if he was innocent would have set him right with both friends and foes though the collection of 1735 was in its nature and extent far more important than the rest and though it was the basis and primary cause of the edition he was ushering into the world he yet relates no particulars he offers no opinion he ventures upon no denial he endeavours instead to mask his evasion of the subject and tries to confound the main point with subsidiary topics there are wilful misrepresentations in his preface and he was not restrained in his language by his homage to truth but he had been baffled by the disclosures of curll and he was afraid to risk specific assertions which had been already exposed  his correspondence with atterbury and several other letters were printed for the first time in the avowed edition of pope he omitted as well as added and left out some of the letters to and from wycherley some of the letters to and from cromwell some of the letters to ladies and a few scattered letters from the remaining groups in the letters he republished he here and there erased a sentence which had appeared in the volume of 1735 or inserted a sentence which was new the minuter verbal alterations are numerous but many of them are only corrections of errors of the press in all essential particulars the collection of p t a little more sifted is reproduced in the quarto of 1737 pope had profited in the interval by the criticisms of the public he set aside the portions of his correspondence which were condemned he endeavoured to rectify the inconsistencies into which he had been betrayed in its reconstruction and he sometimes altered a word or a phrase in the final revision to which he subjected the work the changes leave it apparent that the pope text and the p t text are identical in their origin and neither of them are the text of the actual letters of the poet his selection affords an imperfect test of the parts which he disowned as being counterfeited he said in his advertisement of july 15 1735 that he would reprint whatever was genuine in the surreptitious editions but he relinquished this design and wrote to allen that he was determined to leave out every syllable that could give the least ill example to an age apt to take it or the least offence to any good or serious man110 he accordingly stated in his preface that he had not only omitted the letters which were not his but those which were not approved of by him without committing himself to an assertion which might be refuted he probably wished to obtain the benefit of the first alternative for letters which he had rejected under the last nevertheless in his eagerness to particularise any real forgery he in effect accredited the entire collection of p t he had far greater interest in showing that it was not authentic than in damaging the trumpery volumes of curll and his forbearance to select a single instance of imposition from its pages is a plain proof that none existed for which he himself was not responsible the charge of interpolation which he had twice put forth in his advertisements111 and subsequently repeated to allen112 was still more openly abandoned for he tells us in his preface that the passages he omitted were improper or at least impertinent to be divulged to the public and he no longer pretended that they were any of them spurious he did not in short disown in his genuine edition one sentence of the volume of 1735 but practically receded from his previous allegations which were misstatements intended to persuade caryll that he was not answerable for the garbling of the letters and the world that he was not a party to their publication  his acts continued to confirm his guilt a little while after the quarto was published there appeared the 5th and 6th volume of the octavo edition of popes works which the titlepage says consists of letters wherein to those of the authors own edition are added all that are genuine from the former impressions with some never before printed113 this edition bears internal evidence of having been printed concurrently with the quarto itself a sheet signed dd the pages of which are numbered from 215 to 222 is interpolated in the quarto between the two last leaves of dd and the numbers are of necessity repeated on the succeeding eight pages the interpolated letters of the quarto are equally an interpolation in the octavo where they follow p 116 of vol vi on a duplicate halfsheet signed i and the paging is repeated on the halfsheet which follows consequently the octavo must have been struck off before the letters were interpolated in the quarto or they would not have been printed in the octavo on an interpolated halfsheet a second insertion tells the same tale a few letters are added at the end of the quarto with the announcement that they had been published since the foregoing sheets were printed off these letters appear in like manner at the end of the octavo after finis at the very moment therefore that pope was compelling his reluctant friends to subscribe to his expurgated quarto he was clandestinely printing an octavo edition in which he put back the whole of the omitted letters he allowed to be genuine and his imperfect quarto was simply a fraud upon the purchasers for the purpose of accrediting his feigned reprobation of the p t volume  one watson who assumed for the occasion the name of t johnson printed a piratical edition of the new octavos dodsley filed a bill against him in chancery on november 25 for the invasion of the copyright of popes edition in folio on october 31 dodsley had entered at stationers hall the works of alexander pope esq vol v and vol vi the second edition corrected 8vo he had omitted to enter the previous edition of the octavos and in a letter which watson wrote on november 30 he objected that the folio was not the book he had pirated and that the octavo volumes were only entered at stationers hall on october 31 which he says was at least a full month after the publication of the edition complained of and popes own first edition entirely sold before the octavo was entered his meaning was that since the first edition of the octavo had not been entered the entry of the second edition which was subsequent to the piracy came too late to secure the copyright the greater part however of watsons volumes were identical with the text of the folio which had been entered on may 18 and watson did not persevere in his defence he consented to deliver up the 1646 copies in his possession on the receipt of 25l and to give pope a bond in which he undertook to pay a penalty of 100l if he ever again invaded his rights by printing any of his works114  popes prohibition of watsons work coupled with his own publication of the octavos is fresh evidence of the insincerity of his professed dissatisfaction with the p t selection his apology for replacing in the octavos the letters he had rejected was that they were in process of being reinstated in a piratical edition of the quarto115 pope had the power which he used to stop piratical publications and at the same time he absurdly made the piracy the plea for publishing himself the condemned letters he had cast aside his mode of relieving his disgust at their appearance and of giving effect to his eager desire for their suppression was to lay hold of a hollow excuse for reprinting them  while pope proceeded against watson he submitted to the piracies of curll his conduct once more betrayed that he was the author of the p t plot curll had all along persisted in printing the p t letters he immediately seized the new letters in the quarto and inserted them in his fifth volume of mr popes literary correspondence he was not content with usurping popes property he insulted defied and accused him pope had the strongest motive in selfvindication to grapple with the charges of curll and he shrunk from the contest he resented the infringement of his copyright by an indifferent person and he could not willingly have endured to be despoiled by his mocking antagonist and sit down quietly under the contumely and wrong the bill filed against watson discovers the cause of his forbearance there we find that pope in applying for an injunction was obliged to state that his quarto edition was the first publication of his letters with his consent direction or approbation116 and if he had filed a similar bill against curll the bookseller would have proved that he had purchased the p t edition and that pope had printed and sold it curll announced in september 1735 that he had filed a bill against smythe to compel the fulfilment of his contract and he made gilliver a party to the suit in consequence of his confession that pope had purchased of him the old sheets of the wycherley and directed the rest of the p t collection to be printed to match them117 smythe was a shadow who could not be reached the facts remained and pope could not attempt to convict curll of piracy without being himself convicted of having sold him the work he had been worsted on this very point when he fought with his best weapon the pen and he did not dare to renew the conflict in a court of law where allegations could neither be passed over in silence nor be met by evasions and quibbles any doubt that the motive for his toleration was fear was done away by his filing a bill against curll the instant he pirated the swift correspondence which was entirely distinct from the p t transaction  pope had shown earlier that he was afraid to join issue with curll before a legal tribunal curll inserted an advertisement in fogs journal of july 26 1735 in which he accused pope of having printed the p t collection and of telling falsehoods in selfdefence the proprietor of fogs journal was induced by a threat of prosecution to apologise for the insertion of the advertisement and curll immediately reprinted it in the second volume of mr popes literary correspondence accompanied by a scornful account of popes interference pope did not venture to accept the taunting challenge his vapouring ceased when he was dared to fight he menaced the publisher of a newspaper who would not brave a trial in a cause which was not his own and tamely retreated before the real offender in person  the octavo edition of 1737 enables us to put the veracity of pope in repudiating the p t collection to yet another proof in may and july 1735 he published advertisements protesting that several letters ascribed to him in the p t volume were not his118 he prefixed to the octavo of 1737 a catalogue of surreptitious editions in which he repeated that the p t publication contained several letters not genuine119 he had hitherto been loud in exclaiming against the p t forgeries without being imprudent enough to name them his caution relaxed as time wore on and he had the courage to state on the titlepage of the first octavo edition of 1737 that he had added to the letters of the authors own edition all that are genuine from the former impressions the spurious letters in the p t collection were thus declared to be the letters which were excluded from the octavo edition of 1737 they were seven in number three were letters or extracts of letters from wycherley two belonged to the section headed letters to several ladies and two were letters to gay unless they were really forgeries pope told and retold emphatic lies to discredit the p t collection and establish his innocence and the deceit would leave no doubt of his criminality  four letters out of the seven we know to have been genuine the three letters of wycherley were on the sheets transferred from the edition of his posthumous works which was published by pope and copies of two of them are among the oxford papers one of the suppressed letters to ladies exists in duplicate and was sent by pope to miss blount and to miss marriot the friend and neighbour of his coadjutor broome the letters are both originals in the handwriting of pope there are no means of verifying the remaining three letters nor is it necessary to test them when more than half the pretended forgeries are found to be authentic once again we have absolute evidence that his accusation of forgery was an acted clamour to screen himself he finally adopted all the letters but seven and his assertion that these seven were fabrications was a falsehood  besides the necessity pope was under of rejecting some of the p t letters to bear out his mendacious charge of forgery he had particular reasons for disclaiming three at least of the four letters which proceeded from his own pen the letter he addressed to miss blount and miss marriot was a disquisition on a human monstrosity exhibiting in london he had said in his essay on criticism that vile obscenity should find no pardon he was among the offenders he pronounced unpardonable and often revelled in dull and studied indecorums which he mistook for wit the laboured letter he esteemed so highly that he sent it to two of his female correspondents was more than ordinarily gross and stupid the fancied humour appeared to the public revolting coarseness and he cast out the letter because it excited disgust and contempt  the next letter pope rejected consisted of a satirical and false description of blenheim he represented a fraction of the house to be the whole and founded upon his misstatement the reflection i think the architect built it entirely in complaisance to the taste of its owners for it is the most inhospitable thing imaginable and the most selfish a second sarcasm on the duchess in the p t volume was obliterated in the octavo of 1737 cleland pope writes to gay is at tunbridge he plays now with the old duchess of m nay dines with her after she has won all his money in the octavo of 1737 he erased the name and left the passage to be applied to any old duchess who was then alive he had obviously some inducement to renounce his abuse of the duchess of marlborough and the probable cause was that a friendly intercourse had grown up in the interval he speaks of her to swift in 1739 as paying great court to him120  his desire to disavow an ebullition of enmity which had been succeeded by renewed cordiality was his apparent motive for cancelling a letter addressed to gay fielding relates that no person during the reign of king alexander would read a work which had not his license and this license he granted to only four authorsswift young arbuthnot and gayhis principal courtiers and favourites121 it chanced that one of the courtiers was in disgrace when the p t volume appeared and pope introduced a sneer at his egotism and pomposity in a word he says to gay yg himself has not acquired more tragic majesty in his aspect by reading his own verses than i by homers the offence of young was a species of remonstrance he sent to the monarch under the guise of advice pope completed his essay on man in 1734 and young urged him in a pressing letter to write something on the side of revelation in order to take off the impression of those doctrines which the essay seemed to convey harte a minor courtier of king alexander told warton that the sensitive monarch took the letter amiss122 he was annoyed at the censure implied in the exhortation and retaliated by ridiculing the selfimportance of his monitor when pope was taxed with personalities he could not defend he never scrupled where it was possible to deny that he alluded to the person who remonstrated when evasion was impracticable and the work had not been avowed the easiest course was to repudiate the authorship  these were the circumstances which chiefly governed popes selection of the p t forgeries had there been a single fabricated letter he would have hastened to name it just as he specified in his preface to the quarto some fictitious letters which were not in the p t publication the p t letters being authentic he was afraid to disclaim in print particular letters which surviving persons might know to be his and he could not venture to advance beyond the indirect statement that the octavo of 1737 contained all the letters that were genuine from former impressions trusting that no one who could convict him would be at the trouble to collate the editions he thought himself safe from exposure and he could privately appeal with little risk of detection to the disclaimer on his titlepage when he had merely to disown a letter in his individual intercourse with the duchess of marlborough or young he did not care to increase the hazard of discovery by repeating his titlepage he dropped it in the second edition of the octavo and the assertion that he had printed all the letters that are genuine from the former impressions dwindled down to the assurance that there is not one but is genuine123  the controversies on popes character have naturally drawn forth uncompromising language both from defenders and accusers those who believed him incapable of the acts imputed to him could but conclude that he was bitterly calumniated those who believed that the charges were true could but brand him with reprobation the offences were not of a nature to be softened by apologies de quincey was in a lenient mood when he wrote his sketch of popes life and his more favourable impressions necessarily carried with them the conviction that the disgraceful imputation against pope of having made curll his tool and victim was most assuredly unfounded124 speaking on another occasion of popes attack on hill and the duke of chandos he says evil is the day for a conscientious man when his sole resource for selfdefence lies in a falsehood125 de quincey was ignorant of the history of the letters and he would have altered his opinion if he had known that pope in selfdefence had been prodigal of the falsehoods which are the last refuge of guilt  there still remains the small episode of the six letters unconnected with the p t volume which were declared by pope to be spurious in his preface to the quarto four of them purported to be from pope to miss blount and two to be letters of atterbury to pope those to miss blount were forwarded to curll by a correspondent who signed himself s e the bookseller published them in the third volume of mr popes literary correspondence and announced that he had discovered them to be translations from voiture s e only professed to send copies which are now in the bodleian library at oxford mr carruthers states correctly that the size and quality of the paper is precisely the same as in the genuine letters of the poet and that the handwriting appears to be his a little disguised the letters bear on their face the marks of their origin and pope acted according to usage in endeavouring to delude curll that he might afterwards build a charge upon his own deceptions there is however a second claimant for the honour of having devised the cheat in an edition of popes works which belonged to douce the antiquary some one has copied an extract from a letter of mr j plumptre dated may 1 1744 in which he informs his wife that their son charles who was afterwards rector of st mary woolnoth london and archdeacon of ely was the author of the trick126 the incident was nine years old when mr plumptre proudly acquainted mrs plumptre with the secret he mentioned that the letters were sent to curll by the penny post and the original cover in the bodleian library shows that they were not sent by post at all he said that his son translated them and pope had proclaimed that they were borrowed from a published translation the account is false and the pretended extract from the letter may be itself apocryphal for its authenticity is guaranteed by no external testimony the similarity of paper and handwriting coupled with the pressing necessity pope was under to supply himself with examples of fabrication strongly indicate that the person who profited by the imposition contrived it  pope affirmed in his preface that the two letters ascribed to atterbury had never been seen by the bishop or himself and to show the absurdity of the fraud he adds that they were advertised even after that period when it was made felony to correspond with him at length in 1739 one of the letters was adopted in a reprint of coopers octavos and undoubtedly by the order of the poet himself since it was included in the collection he delivered to warburton we have ventured says a note in the cooper edition to insert this letter which was plainly intended for mr pope though we are informed that on second thoughts it was not judged proper to send it him a copy was preserved and published soon after in the english additions to bayles dictionary under the article of atterbury popes assertion in the preface to the quarto that the letter was fabricated was either a reckless charge or a falsehood and there are strong grounds for believing that he was all along aware that the letter was genuine in the catalogue of surreptitious editions we are told of curlls second volume that it has no letters to mr pope but one said to be bishop atterburys and another in that bishops name certainly not his the distinction drawn between the two amounts to an admission that the former might be authentic and this is confirmed in the conclusion of the catalogue where a reprint of the pt collection is described as containing the forged letter not letters from the bishop of rochester though this very reprint contained them both they were introduced into all the reprints themselves in a manner which showed that they were not considered of equal authority in curlls work they are represented to be alike by atterbury and to be addressed alike to pope in the reprints of the p t collection the letter which pope ultimately accepted is alone given as written by atterbury or addressed to the poet its fellow has asterisks to represent the person to whom it was sent and neither asterisks nor name to represent the sender popes ally cooper is supposed to have been concerned in the volume to which the atterbury epistles were first transferred from the publication of curll and it is obvious that no bookseller would have originated the alteration and that no other person would have prompted it who had not a peculiar interest in the correspondence of the poet and who was not aware that these stray productions would be at once appended to a current p t impression the distinction between the letters was made in the reprints of the p t collection before pope published the preface to the quarto in which he affirmed that both were counterfeited he made the distinction in the catalogue almost immediately after the quarto appeared he did not the less preserve the passage in his preface unchanged in every edition of his correspondence and never uttered a single word of recantation he allowed the charge of forgery to be circulated till it had served his purpose and then without an allusion to his former language imported the letter into his works with the complacent announcement that it was plainly intended for mr pope  the reason assigned by pope why a letter must be forged which he afterwards admitted to be genuine was one of his usual deceptions by the bill of pains and penalties against atterbury it was declared to be felony to correspond with him in his exile after june 25 1723 pope disregarded the enactment with little risk of discovery and perhaps without much danger of punishment if his harmless intercourse was detected he condoled with the bishop on the death of his daughter mrs morice and the bishop thus commenced his reply which is dated montpelier november 20 1729 yes dear sir i have had all you designed for me and have read all as i read whatever you write with esteem and pleasure but your last letter full of friendship and goodness gave me such impressions of concern and tenderness as neither i can express nor you perhaps with all the force of your imagination fully conceive this again must have drawn forth a response from the poet for atterbury says in an answer without date i venture to thank you for your kind and friendly letter because i think myself very sure of a safe conveyance and i am uneasy till i have told you what impressions it made upon me i will do it with the same simplicity with which i wrote to you from montpelier upon a very melancholy occasion these extracts testify that the letter which curll published of november 23 1731 was not a solitary instance and that other letters had passed between the poet and atterbury even after that period when it was made felony to correspond with him the proof which pope urged with triumphant scorn to demonstrate that the letter of november 23 must be counterfeited was therefore an absolute fraud his disingenuousness did not end here he printed atterburys letter of november 20 1729 at the same time that he reproduced the letter published by curll and said in a notethis also seems genuine though whether written to mr p or some learned friend in france is uncertain but we doubt not it will be acceptable to the reader to support the alleged uncertainty he omitted the passages which showed that it was addressed to a sickly poet in england the complete letter was inserted by mr nichols in the epistolary correspondence of atterbury and his version is confirmed by a copy among the oxford papers at longleat the bishop died in february 1732 and if in 1739 pope thought it unsafe to admit that he had held communication with him in his banishment upon literary and domestic topics he might have left the letter to be published by warburton and not have violated truth for the sake of hurrying it before the world  such was the series of stratagems which ushered in and accompanied the collection of 1735 from its first appearance in the volume of p t to its final shape in the volumes of cooper popes skill in deception was not equal to his passion for it audacity was the chief characteristic of his contrivances and equivocation and lying his weapons of defence when a trick or a subterfuge was detected and could no longer be denied he yet remained unabashed and dropping all allusion to the points which had been proved against him he continued to rely upon the falsehoods or fallacies which had been less completely exposed his pertinacity in reiterating that he was sinned against when he was sinning derived support from his literary fame which gave currency to his representations and in some degree gained credit to them but his duplicity and his artifices were known to many and it would be difficult to say whether his effrontery or his hypocrisy was most conspicuous when he affixed to the preface to the quarto of 1737 the punning motto vellem nescire literas bewailed in the preface itself the necessity for the publication hoped that no honest man might be reduced to a similar dilemma talked with injured indignation of thefts forgeries and piracies and exhorted the legislature to provide a remedy against the evil his tone was not moderated by the suspicions he had roused and the humiliations he had undergone they had just as little effect in abating his love of treachery or blunting his appetite for epistolary fame and he was no sooner clear of one plot than he engaged in another of the same description and for the same ends  his correspondence with swift appeared in 1741 the english edition was a sequel to the quarto of 1737 and formed part of what was called on the titlepage the works of mr alexander pope in prose vol ii in a prefatory notice to the reader the letters are stated to have been copied from an impression sent from dublin and said to have been printed by the deans direction an impression it is added which was begun without our authors knowledge and continued without his consent pope held the same language in private to allen and warburton and professed to be extremely annoyed at the step his account has been almost uniformly accepted as true till the critic in the athenæum showed that the publication of the correspondence with swift was no exception to the previous proceedings of the poet and that as in the case of the wycherley letters of 1729 and the miscellaneous collection of 1735 he himself had sent the manuscripts to the press and charged the act upon others  on november 28 1729 pope protested to swift that it was many years since he endeavoured to play the wit in his familiar correspondence he assured the dean that as he had a greater love and esteem for him than for others so he wrote to him with even more than ordinary negligence i smile to think he continues how curll would be bit were our epistles to fall into his hands and how gloriously they would fall short of every ingenious readers expectations warburton tells us that pope valued himself upon this abstinence from all effort to be brilliant127 but his pretence of sinking the author in the friend gained no credit from swift who took care to show his incredulity i find he replied on february 26 1730 you have been a writer of letters almost from your infancy and by your own confession had schemes even then of epistolary fame montaigne says that if he could have excelled in any kind of writing it would have been in letters but i doubt they would not have been natural for it is plain that all plinys letters were written with a view of publishing and i accuse voiture of the same crime although he be an author i am fond of they cease to be letters when they become a jeu desprit pope seems to have suspected that this halfdirect halfoblique criticism was suggested by his recent collection and arrangement of his correspondence and he denied in his answer of april 9 that he was open to the censure i am pleased he observed to see your partiality and it is for that reason i have kept some of your letters and some of those of my other friends these if i put together in a volume for my own secret satisfaction in reviewing a life passed in innocent amusements and studies not without the good will of worthy and ingenious men do not therefore say i aim at epistolary fame i never had any fame less in my head but the fame i most covet indeed is that which must be derived to me from my friendships the poet as usual adapted his assertions to the exigencies of the moment for it was not for his own secret satisfaction in reviewing a life passed in innocent amusements and studies that he had deposited a duplicate of the volume with lord oxford or kept it in readiness against the revival of slanders and the publication of surreptitious letters this suppression of facts and motives could have had no effect in deluding swift once on september 3 1735 when his faculties were waning and his powers rose and fell with his malady he echoed back popes former language neither he said did our letters contain any turns of wit or fancy or politics or satire but mere innocent friendship i believe we neither of us ever leaned our head upon our hand to study what we should write next but by the 21st of october he had already returned to his old conviction and after mentioning the publication of the poets correspondence by curll he added i believe my letters have escaped being published because i writ nothing but nature and friendship and particular incidents which could make no figure in writinga plain intimation that the opposite qualities had in his opinion caused the letters of pope to be communicated to the world  the poet made the volume of 1735 the plea for pressing swift to return him his letters he had ceased to smile at the thought how curll would be bit by getting hold of them and earnestly demanded that the dean should secure him against that rascal printer128 if it is admitted that pope was the publisher of the p t collection his accusations against the rascal printer were groundless and his fears were feigned he was endeavouring under cover of a false pretence to obtain possession of his letters to swift and it was easy to foresee that when he had succeeded in his object the secret store would soon be laid open to the public he had previously forced his other friends to surrender his correspondence by the clamorous apprehensions he expressed of curll the letters which were safe in their guardianship had not been long committed to his keeping when they came forth from the shop of this very individual and pope was now urging the fact as a reason why fresh letters should be transferred from a custody which had been effectual to a custody which had proved to be insecure swift perhaps by this time had begun to penetrate the designs of his friend and he declined to comply with his request you need not fear any consequence he wrote september 3 1735 in the commerce that hath so long passed between us although i never destroyed one of your letters but my executors are men of honour and virtue who have strict orders in my will to burn every letter left behind me yet i am loth that any letters from you and a very few friends should die before me no answer could have been less pleasing to pope than to be told that his letters were doomed to destruction his eagerness to rescue them must have been increased by the announcement and he offered if swift would let him have them at once to send him copies the poets excuse for a proposal which defeated his professed purpose was merely that the originals might not fall into the hands of curll and thereby a hundred particulars be at his mercy129 the particulars would have been as much at curlls mercy in the copies as in the originals they replaced unless pope intended to disavow the transcripts he had himself furnished which shows how much value is to be attached to his assertion that parts of the collection of 1735 were forged his remonstrances induced swift to promise that the letters should not be committed to the flames but he persevered in refusing to surrender them while he lived as to what you say of your letters he wrote april 22 1736 my resolution is to direct my executors to send you all your letters well sealed and pacquetted and leave them entirely to your disposal these things are all tied up endorsed and locked in a cabinet and i have not one servant who can properly be said to write or read no mortal shall copy them but you shall surely have them when i am no more since swift persisted in believing that he could protect private papers from curll quite as efficiently as the poet who had signally failed in the attempt pope reversed his petition and disclosing his real intention begged that he might have them to print i told him he says in his account to lord orrery as soon as i found myself obliged to publish an edition of my letters to my great sorrow that i wished to make use of some of these nor did i think any part of my correspondence would do me a greater honour and be really a greater pleasure to me than what might preserve the memory how well we loved one another i find the dean was not quite of the same opinion or he would not i think have denied this when pope affected in 1729 to depreciate his correspondence with swift that he might mask his design in gathering together his other letters he had even smiled to reflect how gloriously our epistles would fall short of every ingenious readers expectations he now maintained that our epistles would confer upon him a vast deal of honour which he could not suppose would be obtained by balking expectation but though none of these inconsistencies are immaterial the most important circumstance and one which bears upon the whole of the subsequent evidence is that pope was pining for the publication of the letters and swift would not consent to it  an event happened opportunely to assist the solicitations of the poet towards the close of 1736 curll printed a couple of letters to swift of which the first was written by pope and the second by bolingbroke the bookseller announced that they were transmitted to him from ireland together with several other valuable originals and pope on the 30th of december employed this practical proof to convince the dean that the correspondence was not safe in his custody the two letters as they were called were in fact a joint epistle for not only does the portion of bolingbroke purport to be a continuation of the portion of the poet but swift who had been absent says in the reply which on his return home he addressed to pope i found a letter from you with an appendix longer than yours from bolingbroke the letter and its appendix were printed by curll at the period when pope had exhausted his arguments to induce swift to resign the correspondence and the occurrence was so well timed for the purposes of the poet and the device so much in accordance with his practices that it is impossible not to suspect that he contrived the injury as a means of extorting the redress the original of his share of the epistle still exists130 and shows that the published version has been edited in his usual fashion the variations in the aggregate could not have arisen from carelessness and they are not of a kind which an independent person could have had any motive to introduce from design the appendix of bolingbroke had been in the power of pope who might have transcribed it together with his own contribution before it was sent but he declared that he never possessed a copy of either131 and small as is the credit due to his protestations he may have spoken the truth in this particular and been guilty not the less the dean was accustomed to lend his acquaintances a volume in which he had stitched specimens of the letters of his eminent friends132 the joint letter of august 1723 was preserved133 when the letters of pope to swift for a considerable period before and after were lost or destroyed and it is likely that it escaped the common fate by its insertion in the volume of selections there it was easily accessible and as worsdale the reputed mockclergyman who had personated smythe was sometimes resident in dublin his old employer had a trusty or at any rate a trusted agent ready to his hand curll did not print any more of his boasted originals and he probably only spoke on the faith of promises which had been made him with a view to compel compliance from the dean by persuading him that traitors had admission to his cabinet  the announcement of the publication by curll of the joint letter of august 23 had not the desired effect upon swift in his reply he took no notice of the circumstance and pope finding that nothing he could urge would shake his resolution addressed in the beginning of march 1737 a statement of the case to lord orrery who was then in ireland and engaged him to second his entreaties lord orrery obtained a promise from swift that the correspondence should be returned and offered to be the bearer of it the dean accordingly acquaints pope july 23 1737 that when his lordship goes over which will be as he hopes in about ten days he will take with him all the letters i preserved of yours i cannot said swift in making the communication trust my memory half an hour and this passage was a proof that he did not exaggerate his infirmity lord orrery had set sail in the middle of june and under the same date that swift wrote from ireland that his lordship would go over in about ten days his lordship wrote to swift from england your commands are obeyed long ago dr king has his cargo mrs barber her conversation and mr pope his letters mrs barbers conversation was the manuscript of the polite conversation of swift which she had asked permission to print for her own advantage and the cargo for dr king was the manuscript of the history of the four last years of queen anne which the dean was anxious to print for his own credit but much as it was in his thoughts at this time he only remembered his settled intention to send the paperswhether history conversation or lettersby lord orrery and the act by which the intention was fulfilled had already faded from his mind the understanding of swift was rapidly yielding to his mournful malady and the first faculty to suffer was his memory  the letters of pope were therefore in his own keeping and out of the power of swift before july 23 1737 the dean however informed him that by reading the dates he found a chasm of six years and that he had searched for the missing correspondence in vain pope did not abandon the hope of recovering it and swift apparently in reply to his applications wrote on august 8 1738 to acquaint him that every letter received from him for twenty years and upwards had been sealed up in bundles and consigned to the custody of mrs whiteway whom he describes as a very worthy rational and judicious cousin of mine mrs whiteway who had none of the papers had a short time before kept swift from sending a similar fictitious account but the idea had taken deep root in his mind and rightly conjecturing that he would reiterate it she engaged lord orrery to inform pope that she had neither got any of the correspondence herself nor had the slightest knowledge where it was134 on the present as on the former occasion swift showed her what he had written and on the 24th of august he subjoined a postscript in which after saying that he would correct if it were possible the blunders committed in his letter he simply added that his cousin had assured him that a great collection of yourmy letters to meyou are put up and scaled and in some very safe hand the counterassurance of mrs whiteway to lord orrery that she had no knowledge of the collection shows that the corrected version was as fanciful as the original statement swifts language in 1738 would imply that the chasm in the correspondence no longer existed and that no part of the series had yet been transmitted to england but it was the language of a man labouring under the misapprehension and obliviousness produced by disease and could have little weight in opposition to the testimony that pope had received back a packet of his letters in the previous year any doubt which could have existed on the point is done away by the admission of pope himself mrs whiteway had refused in 1740 to send back some of his letters by the mother of the mr nugent who afterwards became lord clare because the poet had authorised her to entrust them to a mr maulay i believe pope wrote to mr nugent they had entertained a jealousy of you as the same persons did before of my lord orrery they then prevented the dean from complying to any purpose with my request they then sent a few just to save appearances and possibly to serve as a sort of plea to excuse them of being taxed with this proceeding which is now thrown upon the dean himself135 the proceeding was the committing the correspondence to the press and pope on his own part to avoid being taxed with it was privately putting forth the plea that the bulk of his letters had not been returned to him the confession that he had received a few is a complete answer to the delusion of swift and they must have been more than a very few or they would not have been sufficient to save appearances setting aside the representations of the poet upon which no dependence can be placed except when he bears witness against himself there is nothing to oppose and much to confirm the idea that they were the identical few which were published in the quarto of 1741  when swift first collected the letters in may 1737 he mentioned that they were not much above sixty and in july when they had been sent away and he described his past act in the language of intention he said they were not above twentyfive his account in july when the correspondence was no longer under his eye and when his failing memory made him forget the departure of lord orrery is far less reliable than his account in may when he was fresh from the task of sorting the letters a smaller number than he specified appeared in the quarto which exclusive of the answers of the dean contains only forty this upon an average does not amount to two a year and the poet when he had an end to serve would not have scrupled to call even sixty few in comparison with the many that had been written swift imagined that the missing letters might have been lost on some of those occasions when he had been compelled to entrust his papers to friends and pope may honestly have believed that they were detained by designing persons but they were never published while those which were printed have a chasm of seven years from june 1716 to august 1723 or only one year more than the dean detected in the series he got ready to despatch to twickenham the new correspondence like popes previous volumes was merely a selection and there is but a single letter of the poet to swift in 1714 none whatever in 1715 and again but a single letter in 1716 the suppression of the letters in 1717 as in 1715 or even a slip of memory or a slip of the pen with the dean both of which had become a frequent occurrence will account for the slight discrepancy between the chasm in the printed volume and the chasm which swift announced the letter of august 1723 is the joint letter of pope and bolingbroke which was sent corrected to curll and this is followed by a second gap from august 1723 to september 14 1725 the extensive hiatus in the correspondence of which pope was forewarned by swift must in all reason be supposed to be the chief deficiency of which pope complained though in language coloured to suit his purpose and when a similar blank exists in the quarto there is a strong presumption that the letters which he acknowledged had been sent to save appearances were the same letters of which the book was composed a kindred circumstance supports the conclusion the last letter of pope in the quarto is dated march 23 1737 which falls in with the fact that the collection was gathered together in may and transmitted to him in june but if the volume of 1741 had proceeded from swift it would be a curious coincidence that not a single line written by the poet since the time when his correspondence was returned to him should have found its way into the work  it is against the innocence of pope that in his public statements he kept out of sight the fact that he had received back a certain portion of the correspondence and designedly conveyed the impression that the whole of it remained with swift in the advertisement to the quarto it is said that pope could not be prevailed upon to revise the volume printed in dublin but that he had furnished the london booksellers with a few more of the letters of the dean a little to clear up the history of their publication the reader is informed that he will see this history in one view if he observes the passages marked by inverted commas the story they reveal is that swift ultimately promised to send the correspondence that he collected it for the purpose and ended by sending none of it the deans communication of august 8 is produced as exhibiting the final result and pope marked with inverted commas the declaration i can faithfully assure you that every letter you have favoured me with these twenty years and more are sealed up in bundles and delivered to mrs whiteway the sense in which the poet wished the passage to be understood is defined in the table of contents the entire collection of his and mr popes letters for twenty years and upwards found and in the hands of a lady a worthy and judicious relation of the deansthis a mistake not in hers but in some other safe hands a note was added by pope to the letter for the purpose of strengthening the case against swift but not one syllable did he let drop to indicate that the dean was deceived in supposing that the series remained unbroken and that no part of it had been sent back the testimony of another witness which had the appearance of corroborating the error was produced by the poet the assertion in the postscript that mrs whiteway vouched for a great collection being in some very safe hand seems to have beguiled him into the belief that the missing letters had turned up and lord orrery having lately come from ireland he applied to him on the subject lord orrery answered that mrs whiteway knew nothing of the letters that he was satisfied they were neither lost nor burnt and that his attempts to discover where they were deposited had been fruitless to us who are aware that lord orrery had been the bearer of an instalment of the correspondence it is plain that he is referring to that portion of it which could not be found when he carried over the remainder to those who had only before them the version contained in the quarto and who merely read of an intention to send letters by him in july 1737 which had not been forwarded in august 1738 his general expressions in answer to pope would appear to apply to the whole of the correspondence and seem a confirmation of the delusion of swift the poet made himself responsible for the misconceptions of the dean by marking them with inverted commas by supporting them with specious subsidiary evidence and attesting that they embodied the history of the publication and since they leave an impression which he knew to be false upon the precise particular which implicates himself his disingenuous sanction of the error must be considered to be the act of conscious guilt  i should think with you madam lord orrery wrote to mrs whiteway that some of mr popes servants had stolen the letters did not many appear from various people to the dean of which mr pope cannot be supposed either to have seen the copies or originals with our present information the letters in the collection which are not from the pen of pope tell the other way and contribute in a powerful degree to fix the publication on him the replies of swift together with much of swifts correspondence with gay are included in the volume and it will be found upon examination that all these materials were likely to have been furnished by the poet and that part of them could have been furnished by nobody else he has twice touched upon the subject in the annotations to the quarto the first note is attached to the heading letters of dr swift to mr gray and states that they were found among mr gays papers and returned to dr swift by the duke of queensberry and mr pope the second note is appended to that portion of the postscript of august 24 1738 in which the dean mentions a great collection of yourmy letters to meyou it is written subjoins the poet just thus in the original the book that is now printed seems to be part of the collection here spoken of as it contains not only the letters of mr pope but of dr swift both to him and mr gay which were returned him after mr gays death though any mention made by mr p of the return or exchange of letters has been industriously suppressed in the publication and only appears by some of the answers  the case of gay is first to be considered there is not an allusion in any of the answers either to the exchange of the letters which passed between gay and swift or the return of the letters which swift addressed to gay an exchange at all events had not taken place the letters of gay were retained by swift and after the death of the dean they were printed from the originals three only are contained in the quarto of 1741 and these are joint productions of gay and pope136 which would naturally have been made over to the latter when he reclaimed the whole of his correspondence with swift if the dean was the culprit we must believe that while publishing or permitting others to publish his own letters to gay he deliberately excluded every one of gays replies with the exception of the three in which pope had a share if pope was the culprit the peculiarity is explained he published the three letters which being in part his own writing had been sent back to him in 1737 and he published no others because the rest of the letters of gay were not in his possession  as the duke of queensberry was living the introduction of his name is a species of guarantee that swift had received back his letters to gay but the conclusion does not follow which pope intended to be drawn that the dean must therefore have supplied them to the printer one thing says swift to gay nov 20 1729 you are to consider because it is an old compact that when i write to you or mr pope i write to both on the death of gay the correspondence passed a second time through popes hands and with his habit at that period of getting the letters of his intimates as well as his own letters transcribed for future use it may readily be imagined that he would not miss the opportunity of securing a valuable collection in which he may be said to have had a common property with his departed friend137 hence it happens that copies of all swifts letters to gay together with one that was not printed are preserved among the oxford manuscripts and with this evidence that the entire series was not less in the power of pope than of swift suspicion must incline to the one who had made elaborate preparations for publication and who had shown himself eager for it the suppression too of gays replies contrary to the general rule observed in the work would here again favour the opinion that the letters of swift were sent to the press by the person to whom the replies were inaccessible and not by the person who had the correspondence on both sides at his command  the assertion that the letters were returned which swift addressed to pope is next to be examined according to the poet his surrender of them appears from some of the answers of swift but the single passage by which it is implied is that in which the dean speaks of a great collection of yourmy letters to meyou the very letter in which the sentence occurs commences with a lament by swift that he has entirely lost his memory and the strange double form in which he describes the correspondence seems chiefly to indicate a consciousness that his recollection of its nature was uncertain and confused on one half of the subject he had manifested his misconceptions a few days before he had forgotten the chasm in the series of popes letters had forgotten that any of them had been restored to their author had forgotten mrs whiteways denial that she possessed them and when she again corrected him continued to fancy they were deposited with some person he knew not whom in some place he knew not where his notions respecting his letters to pope were not likely to be better founded than his notions respecting the letters of pope to him but more than this he only professed to make the statement upon the authority of his cousin and his cousin disavowed all knowledge of the collection far from being aware that the dean had received back his letters to pope she expressed her conviction that the materials for the printed volume could not have been drawn from ireland just because those letters formed part of it138 the literal interpretation of a single phrase of swift in a letter which bears internal evidence of the grievous extent of his malady being negatived by the authority upon which it claims to be based there still exists the ambiguous assurance of pope that he returned the correspondence after the death of gay which happened in december 1732 the replies however of swift in the quarto instead of stopping at this date extend to august 1738 and those of the last halfdozen years must have remained with the poet the dean had said in 1717 that he kept no copies of letters mrs whiteway testified that he had never taken a copy during the twelve years she had been at his elbow excepting of a letter to a lordlieutenant or a bishop whom he feared might make an ill use of it and as for the letters to pope she had seen him write them and send them off immediately letters of which pope had the originals and swift no copies must plainly have owed their publicity to pope  there is another inconsistency which makes it very doubtful whether the poet could have sent back the earlier letters of swift any more than the later after informing the dean on december 30 1736 that the joint letter of august 1723 had been recently printed by curll pope went on to say your answer to that letter he has not got it has never been out of my custody for whatever is lent is lost wit as well as money to these needy poetical readers here we have pope avowing that he retained in 1736 an answer of the dean which belonged to the year 1723 there is no indication that it was an exception to the rest of the correspondence and the presumption therefore is that none of the letters which pope received from swift had been restored upon the death of gay in 1732 the poets assertion is rendered more suspicious by the absence of all allusion to the circumstance in the arguments which he addressed through lord orrery to swift in march 1737 with a view to convince him that his refusal to return popes own letters was unjust no plea could have had greater force than the statement that pope had already sent back the letters of swift and was only asking the dean to deal by him as he had dealt by the dean  although we were to suppose against the evidence that the poet had given up the whole of the originals he must still have retained copies he avowedly inserted six letters of the dean in the quarto to clear up the history of the publication and four of the number belong to the years 1732 and 1733 which shows that pope continued to have the command of the correspondence at the period of its appearance in 1741 indeed copies of five of the published letters of swift to pope with eight that are unpublished are in the oxford papers and since none of the six which the poet contributed to the quarto are among them more must have existed unless he had kept the originals that he had never parted with them is the just conclusion from the facts139 and his note is one of those instances in which he had recourse to the licence he allowed himself of equivocating genteelly the letters of swift to gay may be presumed to have been returned to swift when the duke of queensberry examined gays papers after his death the expressions in the deans childlike postscript of august 24 gave a colour to the notion that he had also got back his letters to pope the admission suggested to the poet to draw up a note which read by the ordinary rules of language affirms that the letters to himself were returned as well as the letters to gay but in which the return of the letters by a forced construction might be made to apply to gay alone who is the immediate antecedent this accounts for the death of gay having been fixed upon for the era of the alleged restoration to the dean of his correspondence with pope though there was no connection between the events and though the choice of so early a date left unexplained the appearance in the quarto of the subsequent letters of swift that any mention made by mr p of the return or exchange of letters should be industriously suppressed by mr p in the publication was a necessary consequence or it would have been manifest that the only letters which had been returned were those of gay by evasions like these the poet satisfied a conscience that held a lie to be justifiable provided it was couched in language which could be wrested by the deceiver into a different sense from what it bore to the deceived  the correspondence between swift and bolingbroke completed the series which pope complained was printed without his consent of the eight letters from bolingbroke seven were written in conjunction with the poet these joint compositions like the partnership letters of gay are exactly those which would have been returned to pope one of the number furnishes evidence which almost amounts to a demonstration that the collection of 1741 proceeded from himself when he brought out the avowed edition of his letters in 1737 he inserted at the end of the volume a letter of swift a letter of his own and the joint letter from himself and bolingbroke of which curll had obtained a copy this little supplement was ushered in by a notice which says since the foregoing sheets were printed off the following letters having been published without the consent of their writers we have added them though not in the order of time whatever the motive the announcement was deceptive the letter of swift was his reply to the joint letter of pope and bolingbrokethat very reply which the poet boasted a month or two before could not be produced surreptitiously because it had never been out of his custody nobody else by his own showing had the power to make it public no earlier impression of it is known to exist and as will be seen by comparing it with the copy from the oxford papers it was printed with omissions and variations which must have been the act of the poet or he would have restored the genuine readings when he included it in his appendix in juxtaposition with it is a letter from pope to swift dated december 10 1725 which in like manner has never been found in any prior publication and which of all his letters to the dean is the single one we are certain was in his power when the quarto of 1737 was in the press he transcribed the original at the time it was written and sent a copy to lord oxford ostensibly to let him see the way in which he was mentioned in it but partly perhaps because the poet thought well of the production140 this letter of december 1725 reappears in tho quarto of 1741 with the addition for the first time of a postscript by bolingbroke a copy of the entire performance is among the oxford papers and reveals the fact that the pope portion and the bolingbroke portion are both abridged in the published version yet although the persons who brought out the collection of 1741 had the manuscript before them or they could not have given bolingbrokes share of the letter they nevertheless by a marvellous coincidence print popes share precisely as it had been printed by pope himself in 1737 the conclusion is irresistible that the editor of the quarto of 1737 was the editor of the collection of 1741 the postscript of bolingbroke was not written when he was in the house with pope but was added subsequently when he got back to dawley141 and its omission from the volume of 1737 was due to the circumstance that the poet had not then received back his correspondence from swift and only possessed a copy of his own carefully composed essay  the letter of bolingbroke to swift in which the poet had no share was commenced at aixlachapelle on august 30 1729 and completed at dawley on october 5 pope appears not to have seen it before it was sent for four days later on october 9 he says to swift lord bolingbroke has told me ten times over he was going to write to you has he or not the elaborate epistle of bolingbroke was a reply to a letter which swift had addressed to pope and the consequent interest that pope would have had in the answer may have induced the author proud of his production to provide him with a copy but however he came by it a copy was deposited by him in lord oxfords library where as in the quarto of 1741 it is the single example of an epistle by bolingbroke alone swift had by him a quantity of bolingbrokes correspondence some of which would have been full as appropriate as the specimen that is given and it is a weighty fact in the question whether the dean or the poet furnished the materials to the printer that the one letter selected was the one letter that pope possessed the three letters which are inserted from swift to bolingbroke incline the scale to the same side the first relates in part to pope the conclusion of the second is addressed to him and the third is the answer to the letter of august 30 1729 it was never pretended that the dean received back his letters to bolingbroke and it was not his habit to make copies but with our knowledge that the poet and bolingbroke had much of their correspondence with swift in common we may be sure that these three letters at least had been in the hands of pope and if he did not retain the originals it would in 1729 the year to which they all belong have been in accordance with his common practice to transcribe them  thus what was printed of the correspondence and what was not printed concur to show that pope must have been the source from which it was derived the history of the circumstances under which the publication took place will confirm this inference pope asserted that the quarto was copied from an impression sent from dublin there is now proof in abundance that the dublin edition which came out as the seventh volume of swifts works was copied from an impression sent from england mr deane swift a cousin of his famous namesake and the soninlaw of mrs whiteway informed mr nichols in 1778 that he was the only person then living who could give a full account how faulkners seventh volume that is how swifts and popes correspondence came to be not first printed but first published in ireland142 the italics are mr swifts own and the fact on which he laid such especial emphasis is at once attested and explained by the statement of faulkner himself to dr birch in august 1749 mr pope he said sent to ireland to dr swift by mr gerrard an irish gentleman then at bath a printed copy of their letters with an anonymous letter which occasioned dr swift to give mr faulkner leave to reprint them at dublin though mr popes edition was published first143 faulkner also solicited the sanction of pope and we have the poets summary of the application in the letter he wrote to mr nugent on august 14 1740 last week i received an account from faulkner the dublin bookseller that the dean himself has given him a collection of letters of his own and mine and others to be printed and he civilly asks my consent assuring me the dean declares them genuine and that mr swift mrs whiteways soninlaw will correct the press out of his great respect to the dean and myself he says they were collected by some unknown persons and the copy sent with a letter importing that it was criminal to suppress such an amiable picture of the dean and his private character appearing in those letters and that if he would not publish them in his lifetime others would after his death it is manifest from these particulars that faulkner was not then aware that pope himself had sent the correspondence to swift and the conviction was only forced upon his mind by subsequent events but the bookseller could not be mistaken on the point that the letters were handed to him in print as he later told dr birch that the dean had given him leave to reprint them because they were printed already so he proclaimed that his volume was a reprint at the time he inserted at the end of his first edition the few new letters which were added in the quarto of 1741 and says that he found them in the london impression after he had reprinted the foregoing sheets faulkner had no sort of motive to deceive whether the letters were in type or in manuscript he had equally received them from swift and obtained his authority to publish them  if further testimony is required it is supplied by pope to the mention of mrs whiteway in lord orrerys letter of 1738 the poet appended a note in which he says this lady since gave mr pope the strongest assurances that she had used her utmost endeavours to prevent the publicationnay went so far as to secrete the book till it was commanded from her and delivered to the dublin printer whereupon her soninlaw d swift esq insisted upon writing a preface to justify mr p from having any knowledge of it and to lay it upon the corrupt practices of the printers in london but this he would not agree to as not knowing the truth of the fact it was therefore a book and a printed book which was delivered to faulkner since if the collection transmitted to the dean had been in manuscript mrs whiteway and her soninlaw would not have laid it upon the corrupt practices of the printers and it must have been transmitted from england or they would neither have laid it upon the printers of london nor have proposed to justify mr p from having any knowledge of it the story was told him while it could be refuted if it was false but he did not venture to question the existence of the printed volume and had nothing more to say than that he did not personally know that it was due to the corrupt practices of the london booksellers he might have gone further and stated that he knew the booksellers to be innocent  the assertion of faulkner that it was pope who sent this volume to swift is equally supported by unexceptionable evidence the collection of 1735 was secretly printed and sold to curll and when a secretly printed work turns out to be the origin of the collection of 1741 the nature of the device proclaims its author but the circumstance which most implicates pope is his anxiety that it should not transpire that a printed volume had been sent to swift at all he informed his friend allen that he had endeavoured to put a stop to the work and that this had drawn forth replies from the deans peoplethe women and the bookseller with their statements before him he kept back from allen the main fact that the dublin volume was taken entirely from a printed copy and speaks instead as if it was taken from the originals he adds that it is too manifest to admit of any doubt how many tricks have been played with the deans papers and accused his people of secreting them as long as they feared he would not permit them to be published this dishonest substitution of originals and papers for the printed book is a convincing proof that pope had some motive incompatible with innocence for his studious perversion of the truth the desire to obliterate the traces of his delinquency reappears in the preface to the quarto he writes with implied censure of swift for his sanction of the dublin edition and has the disingenuousness to conceal that he had merely allowed faulkner to reproduce in ireland a volume which had been printed in englanda volume over which the dean had no control and which being printed he knew would inevitably be published  the artful wording of the very note in which pope refers to the printed book betrays his desire to keep the fact out of sight his statement could enlighten no one who was previously ignorant it was not from choice that he promulgated however obscurely the allegation of mrs whiteway that the work had its origin in london but he was forced upon one of two evils and he selected the least mrs whiteway knew that the letters must either have been printed by pope or have found their way to the press by the corruption of those who had access to his papers she acquitted pope out of courtesy perhaps to his own protestations and accepted the second conclusion that the london booksellers had procured the manuscripts by bribes though she could hardly have entertained the serious belief that the curlls had been at the expense of purchasing and printing them for no other purpose than to ship a solitary copy to ireland she was eager to be cleared from any possible imputation of abusing the trust which devolved on her through the imbecility of swift144 and her anxiety to absolve herself and the dean is the secret of her soninlaw insisting upon writing a preface to prove that the traitors must have been in england and not in ireland he alone would have been responsible for the facts and arguments he adduced and they would have appeared in the edition of faulkner where they would not have claimed the sanction of pope his ignorance could be no reason why an independent person should not tell what he knew and believed and his unwillingness to be justified was in direct opposition to his conduct through life it was for a different cause that he interfered with the execution of the design mr swift would have disclosed the fact that the letters of the poet had been returned to him through lord orrery in 1737 that he had exclusive possession of the letters of the dean that the groundwork of the collection was at twickenham that it had been printed at london and had come printed to dublin when he insisted upon fulfilling his intention pope to divert him from it must have been driven to propose the insertion of the exculpatory note he drew it up in a form which would bear one meaning to those who were acquainted with the facts and another to the multitude who were in the dark he had the contradictory ends to answer of propitiating mrs whiteway and concealing the truth and his language like everything he wrote on the question is consequently vague and evasive  in the same letter in which pope ignored the existence of the printed book to allen and pretended that the irish edition was taken directly from the originals he further asserted that the deans people had at length consented to give up the manuscripts if the originals were really in their possession there would be strong grounds for concluding that the conspirators were at dublin if on the contrary the allegation of the poet was a wilful untruth this additional misrepresentation must lead us to conclude that he was the author of a fraud from which he defended himself by falsehood mrs whiteway had it is true commissioned mr nugent to acquaint him that she had secured several of his letters mr nugent having delivered the message in march 1740 informs her in april that he was authorised to receive them and begs her to transmit them to him in london by a safe hand145 she evidently preferred that they should go direct to their owner and wrote to pope in may that she would forward them by the first trustworthy messenger who would deliver them to pope himself it was agreed between them that mr maulay should be the person but they were ultimately sent to lord orrery at his country seat in ireland in january or february 1741 and were no doubt conveyed by him to their final destination when he visited england in march the critic in the athenæum plausibly conjectures that they were the letters which had been written since the transmission of the collection in june 1737 and the late period at which they were received would account for none of them appearing in the quarto which was published by the middle of april 1741  when pope at the beginning of august 1740 heard from faulkner that the dean had given him permission to print or rather to reprint the correspondence he expressed his conviction to mr nugent who was still meddling in the business that the offer of returning the letters was a feint i presume now he added that she would have sent but a few of no consequence for the bookseller tells me there are several of lord bolingbrokes c which must have been in the deans own custody146 mrs whiteway had merely undertaken to return to pope the letters which were written by pope and it is not apparent why the printing of several of the letters of bolingbroke should have involved the conclusion that she was practising a feint and would only have sent a few of no consequence the incongruity of the observation seems to have been the result of the guilt which dictated it the poet was aware that the originals promised him were a comparatively small number which had no connection with the printed letters and he was meeting the circumstance by anticipation in the probable event of its reaching the ears of mr nugent the rest of the correspondence was already in his possession and he assigned a foolish reason why mrs whiteway would not have sent it because the real reason could not be stated  it was several months subsequent to this communication to mr nugent and after he had received the comments of mrs whiteway on the volume which came from england that he opened his griefs to mr allen the letter is not dated but a letter to warburton which gives a portion of the same information as a piece of novel intelligence bears the date of february 4 1741 they now offer pope tells allen to send me the originals which have been so long detained and i will accept of them though they have done their job a few months later he reverted to the subject and says to allen it will please you to know that i have received the packet of letters safe from ireland by the means of lord orrery147 he has not the candour to acknowledge that the letters were voluntarily tendered him by mrs whiteway long before the printed collection had been heard of he wished to have it believed that they had only been offered to him since the booksellers had done their job and the motive for this deception must have been the desire to identify the letters from mrs whiteway with the letters in faulkners volume while he had a secret consciousness that they had nothing in common it might be conjectured indeed that he was speaking of a distinct occurrence and that lord orrery was the bearer of two sets of letters though pope mentions only one if it were not certain as i shall now proceed to show that the originals of the printed collection sent to dublin were never offered to him at all  after the collection had been consigned to faulkner mrs whiteway wrote her sentiments at large to lord orrery she asked him with reference to a letter of popes if he believed the collection genuine and slight as were her doubts the question would have been absurd if she had professedly the originals of the correspondence in her hands she declared her conviction that the poet had been betrayed by his own servants and since the letters extended over three and twenty years she could not have imagined that they had all the while been intercepted on their road to the post but must have assumed that they had been abstracted from the cabinets in which they were stored away at twickenham the main stress of her argument against the theory that the work had been concocted in ireland was laid upon the presence of the letters of the dean which pope alone could command and not upon the letters of pope which might have been copied while they remained in the possession of swift but she pointed out the improbability of the supposition by remarking that no use had been made of the book in which swift had stitched specimens of the correspondence of various eminent men and which was peculiarly accessible from his habit of circulating it among his friends in particular she noticed that she had formerly his permission to take from it a letter of pope and she triumphantly remarks that this letter had not been printed the boast could have had no force if all the printed correspondence had been the same correspondence she had promised to return the notion that she had offered to send back the originals of the collection of 1741 is inconsistent with every part of her defencea defence in which she was not afraid to challenge contradiction since she authorised lord orrery to pass it on to pope neither could the originals have been offered by faulkner for both at the time and afterwards he asserted that his volume was only a reprint pope may even be said to bear testimony against himself he was eager to make it appear that the work was composed of materials which must have been drawn from the papers of swift and he took advantage of the erroneous phrase in swifts postscript of august 24 to add in a note the book that is now printed seems to be part of the collection here spoken of the announcement that the deans people had acknowledged that they possessed a large proportion of the originals would have decided the question and the silence of the poet is an admission that he dared not repeat in public where it would meet the eye of the persons implicated the fable he had palmed off upon allen in private nay when stating in the quarto that mrs whiteway and her soninlaw charged the whole proceeding upon the corrupt practices of the london printers he still did not venture to retort that the originals had never left the custody of the deans people who detained them in dublin until according to his own expression the dublin printers had done their job the fact was that allen had intimated his apprehension that pope would be suspected of being concerned in the publication and pope replied that the whole thing was so circumstanced that this could never be the case to stifle the suggestion he based a falsehood upon a foundation of truth and spoke of the letters which mrs whiteway had offered to send him in the beginning of 1740 as though they had been the originals of the printed correspondence his invention of a fiction to establish his innocence is a sure indication of his guilt  the deans people promised pope the copy of the correspondence that he might correct and expunge what he pleased i dare not he wrote to allen even do this for they would say i revised it his mind immediately veered from decision to uncertainty and in the next sentence but one he states that he knows not whether to make any use of the permission or not a little further and he comes to the conclusion that until he sees the letters he can form no judgment of the proper measures to be pursued the excessive earnestness he adds the dean has been in for publishing them makes me hope they are castigated in some degree or he must be totally deprived of his understanding lord mansfield deposed from the personal information of pope that his imperfect memory of their contents increased his anxiety to stop the publication148 in the midst of his apprehensions his knowledge of swifts incapacity and his conviction that it would be insanity to allow the correspondence to go forth in its integrity he yet resolved not to expurgate the copy and then doubted whether he would expurgate it or not this easy kind of hesitation which has none of the appearance of genuine alarm was what might be expected in a man who had already revised the letters to his hearts content and was poorly performing a borrowed part though he ended by refusing to retouch a text of his own preparing he employed the interval while the sheets were submitted to his criticism in forestalling the dublin edition mr d swift believed that the correspondence was first published in ireland faulkner asserted that it was first published in england and faulkner who could not well be mistaken was right no advertisement of the irish volume is to be found in the dublin news letter till some time after the english volume was on sale and no copy exists in the public libraries or after long search could be heard of from the secondhand booksellers which does not contain the additional matter inserted in the quarto149 in the prefatory notice to the quarto itself we are told that the letters are taken from an impression sent from dublin and said to be printed by the deans direction this was the impression which had been privately forwarded to pope and the language seems to have been carefully selected to avoid the assertion that there had been a publication of the work the poets scheme may be discerned in the account he gave to allen he informed him that the book being most of it printed was put past preventing but that he was trying all the means possible to retard it in plain words he was manoeuvring to keep back the irish edition till his rival reprint was in the market when he had succeeded in his device he repeated his old tactics of advertising that the surreptitious collection was the cause of his own and at the same time bespoke the preference for his reprint by announcing that it would contain several additional letters150  apart from these additions the quarto of pope is a reproduction with some variations of the dublin impression and a few notes which faulkner had doubtless found in the volume sent from england are said in the quarto to be taken from faulkner nevertheless there is strong internal evidence that a portion of the quarto had an independent origin and had been printed off before the irish edition was received the correspondence consists of 209 pages which are numbered consecutively from 1 to 115 at this point the letters of swift to gay commence and instead of the numbers proceeding in regular order they go back to page 89 and are thence continued without any break to the final page 182 that the arrangement is not a typographical mistake is clear from the signatures of the sheets being in accordance with the paginga coincidence which was barely possible if the figures had been a misprint the correspondence of swift with gay begins on sheet n which is the letter of the alphabet that answers to page 89 in a quarto volume and this keeping between the letters and the figures is preserved throughout but there is a second coincidence which is absolutely fatal to the idea that the confusion in the paging was an error of the press the quarto edition was accompanied by an edition in folio which was the same impression with the matter parcelled out into pages of greater length and with the requisite changes in the numbering of the pages and the signatures of the sheets in spite of the change there is the identical peculiarity that distinguishes the quarto the numbers run on unbroken from 1 to 108 when we arrive at the letters to gay here we recommence with page 85 and starting from this new basis the figures proceed in regular succession to the end the sheet at page 85 is marked y the proper letter for the folio size and as in the quarto the signatures in every instance correspond with the pages the defect cannot be explained by the supposition that the work had been divided into portions which were printed separately for the sake of expedition with the text of the dublin copy to guide his calculations no compositor could have committed the error of pronouncing that matter which covers 115 pages could he contained in 88 the evident cause of the anomaly is that after the quarto in its original form had passed through the press pope saw reason to cancel the opening part of the volume which preceded swifts correspondence with gay the materials in their second form occupied more space than in their first and instead of filling only 88 pages in the quarto and 84 in the folio run on to 115 in the one and 108 in the other the consequence is that the pages in excess bear the same numbers with the succeeding uncancelled pages which could not be altered the process is rendered further apparent by the signatures to the sheets in both folio and quarto those on the surplus pages in the cancelled division of the volume have an asterisk affixed to denote that the signatures had been already employed151 but though the sheets have this mark of repetition they are placed in the volume before the uncancelled sheets which retain the primitive signatures and which did not admit of any change in the quarto again a half sheet precedes the letters to gay which could not have happened unless it had been a subsequent interpolation when the matter was insufficient to make the sheet complete the halfsheet the duplicate paging and the duplicate signatures are all the result of the insertion of fresh materials after the work was struck off and betray that there was an earlier form of the quarto of 1741 which contained less than the dublin edition and which therefore being prior to it is a proof that the correspondence was originally printed by pope the letters in the quarto are numbered and since the series is unbroken throughout the original cancelled division must ostensibly have comprised as many letters as when it was subsequently enlarged but a letter to gay dated nov 23 1727 is found by the copies preserved in the oxford papers to be compounded of three distinct letters and this system of fusion would have permitted the introduction of large additions without deranging the continuity of the numbers which pope would have been anxious to preserve the cancels he made to suit his varying views were in accordance with his practice the miscellaneous prose works which follow the letters have in one place alone a cancel of upwards of a hundred pages equally characteristic was the desire to preserve any of the old sheets which could be retained regardless of the blemish to the book and the trace they might afford of his manoeuvres it was a repetition of the papersparing policy which led him to incorporate the suppressed sheets of his wycherley into the volume of 1735152  on the 22nd of march 1741 pope called upon lord orrery at his house in london and found him writing to swift the poet took the pen from his hand and continued the letter after large professions of affection he went on to say i must confess a late incident has given me some pain but i am satisfied you were persuaded it would not have given me any and whatever unpleasant circumstances the printing our letters might be attended with there was one that pleased methat the strict friendship we have borne each other so long is thus made known to all mankind as far as it was your will i cannot be angry at what in all other respects i am quite uneasy under had you asked me before you gave them away i think i could have proposed some better monument for our friendship or at least of better materials any words addressed to swift were lost upon him now and pope in reality was speaking to lord orrery and to those who might hereafter read his protestations he had apparently forgotten that just four years before he had complained to the same lord orrery that the dean had denied his request when he wished to insert some of the letters in the quarto of 1737153 the monument he was eager to erect to their friendship in 1737 he repudiated in 1741 he affirmed that he could have proposed a better but never hinted what it was or at least of choicer materials but never troubled himself further about them this was the smallest part of the contradiction he refused his consent to the reprint of the book sent to dublin and had even tried he told allen to stop it by threats of law it is true he confessed to mr nugent at the outset and continued to confess to allen that he had no hope of prevailing but his efforts are not the less the measure of his pretended disgust yet he instantly appropriated the correspondence he was anxious to stifle in its birth contrived to anticipate the dublin edition incorporated the entire collection into his works and published it simultaneously in folio quarto and octavo he stated in the prefatory notice that he had refused to revise the letters because they were committed to the press without his consent but the annoyance which would not permit him to revise the letters was no check to his haste in adopting or to his zeal in circulating them for a man who was quite uneasy at their appearance his eagerness to countenance to parade and to propagate them was amazing and the manifest duplicity is not the least forcible of the arguments which bring the whole contrivance home to pope warburton applauded him for the little resentment he expressed at the indiscretion of his old friend he affected far more than his advocate supposed but if it had been otherwise it is strange that warburton should not have perceived that to talk of resentment was ridiculous when the poet was espousing the indiscretion and was doing his utmost to disseminate the letters he feigned a wish to suppress  curll republished the letters under the title of dean swifts literary correspondence pope filed a bill in chancery against curll on june 4 1741 the poet not only demanded protection for his own letters but desired that the bookseller should be restrained from vending the letters of swift who was not a party to the suit nor had commissioned any one to interfere on his behalf the case was memorable both from its intrinsic importance and from the celebrity of the plaintiff in his answer on the 13th of june curll admitted that nobody had authorised his work he rested his defence on three propositions he maintained that private correspondence did not come within the copyright act of queen anne because the act was declared in the title to be for the encouragement of learning whereas letters on familiar subjects were not learned productions and because the act was designed to protect books which were avowedly composed for the press whereas letters were written without the intention of converting them into a literary commodity he said that he was informed and believed that the letters were first printed154 at dublin and he contended that all persons in england had a right to reproduce books which were first published in ireland he finally argued that letters were in the nature of a gift to the receiver and that after they were delivered to the dean they became his property on the motion to dissolve the injunction on these grounds lord hardwicke decided that they were none of them valid he refused to recognise a distinction between letters and other compositions he denied that a prior publication in ireland could deprive an english author of his english rights he above all determined that though the paper on which the letter was written might possibly be the property of the receiver the matter remained the property of the writer for the same reason that he admitted popes title to his own letters he declined to continue the injunction with respect to the letters addressed to him which had never ceased to belong to the persons who penned them155 the celebrated murray was one of the counsel for the poet156 and afterwards when lord chief justice he quoted and confirmed the decision of the chancellor the question he said was whether the property was not transferred to the correspondent lord hardwicke thought not and that the writer was still the proprietor157 dean swift he said subsequently was certainly the proprietor of the paper upon which popes letters to him were written but no disposition no transfer of paper upon which the composition is written can be construed a conveyance of the copy without the authors express consent to print and publish much less against his will158 just and valuable as is the rule of law which prohibits the publication of a letter without the permission of its author the manner in which pope invoked it was singular according to his statement it was swift that had prepared and put forth a correspondence in which more of the letters were from the pen of the dean than from the pen of the poet pope while professing to be vexed beyond measure at this exposure of private papers asked for an injunction not for the purpose of suppressing them but to obtain a monopoly of the sale he was not even content to reclaim his personal share in the publication of the friend whom he upbraided for the act he tried to prevent any one except himself from profiting by swifts part of the book and at the same time that he was endeavouring to secure goods which did not belong to him he reproached their owner for displaying them his conduct once more betrayed the truth he laboured to conceal he was the compiler of the collection and instinctively regarded a rival edition as an invasion of his rights his proceedings were unnatural if swift was the sole originator of the work but if it had a different source we can perceive why pope was jealous of the least interference with property which from the outset he considered to be exclusively his own  a fatality attended the correspondence of pope curll in defiance of him printed his letters to cromwell lord oxford in spite of his disapproval printed his letters to wycherley an unknown person by unknown means obtained the whole of the collection of 1735 printed it secretly at his own expense and sold it for a song to render the history uniform and complete swift who would not permit pope to print their letters printed them himself while pope changing sides with him remonstrated and threatened that nothing might be wanting to the singularity of the case the three last sets of letters stole into the world when they were under the vigilant guardianship of the poet and the two last sets got abroad after the abiding paroxysm of terror engendered by the indiscretion of a single dissolute friend had induced him to wrest his correspondence from friends of every degree for the purpose of securing it from the possibility of publication mrs whiteway remarked to lord orrery that among the letters in the deans stitched book were numbers from the greatest men in england for genius learning and powerfrom bolingbroke oxford bathurst and peterborough from addison congreve prior parnell and gay she said these were as easily pilfered and would have been as interesting to the world as the letters of pope and swift159 but nobody invaded the sanctity of the private correspondence of the poets contemporaries even when the papers were open to half the gossips of dublin he stood alone in a misfortune which happened to him no less than four times and which it is to be feared would have happened a fifth if he had lived long enough to accumulate the materials for a fresh volume he relaxed his correspondence with caryll in 1729 and with swift in 1737 as a means to compel them to resign his former letters and to both he used the same expressionthat he did not write upon the terms of other honest men160 the fallacy of the parallel was in the epithet if he had resembled other men in their honesty he might have shared in their immunity from the alleged treachery of friends like oxford and swift and of enemies like curll  of all the deceptions which the poet practised to get his correspondence under the eye of the world his dealings towards swift are the worst he had failed to gain his consent to putting forth the letters while any judgment yet remained to him but no sooner had he sunk into dotage than trusting to his inability to detect the cheat pope beguiled him into sanctioning the publication by sending him the volume ready printed with a flattering exhortation the echo of what he had written on a former occasion161 importing that it was criminal to suppress such an amiable picture of the dean and his private character162 the moment swift fell into the pit his friend had dug for him his friend denounced him for the act i think he wrote to mr nugent i can make no reflections upon this strange incident but what are truly melancholy and humble the pride of human naturethat the greatest of geniuses though prudence may have been the companion of wit which is very rare for their whole lives past may have nothing left them at last but their vanity no decay of body is half so miserable extraordinary language to come from the pen of the man whose vanity without any excuse from the decay of his faculties had made him eager to print the letters in 1737 and who had been only thwarted in his desire because swift was wanting in the vanity by which he himself was impelledinfamous language when the deed he reprobated was his own and swift the innocent dupe and when having traded successfully in the mental afflictions of his friend he proceeded to hold up his victim as the criminal but the simulated indignation is less revolting than the simulated fondness when the heart is full of tenderness he said to the dean in the letter of march 22 1741 it must be full of concern at the absolute impotency of all words to come up to it i value and enjoy more the memory of the pleasure and endearing obligations i have formerly received from you than the perfect possession of any other think it not possible that my affection can cease but with my last breath if i could think yours was exhausted i should grieve but not reproach you if i felt myself even hurt by you i should be confident you knew not the blow you gave but had your hand guided by another the hand which guided him was the same hand that was at that moment aiming a blow at his reputation taking advantage of his cruel malady and prostrate understanding pope was even then endeavouring to fasten upon him the stigma of his own personal treachery and this pretended magnanimity in forgiving a deed which he had contrived and instigated was in itself a calumny and a fraud  if any doubt could exist that it was pope who put forth the collection of 1735 and the swift collection of 1741 we have still in the quarto of 1737 his own avowed version of a large portion of his correspondence he published it with the express object of correcting the corrupt text of spurious editions and there remains the inquiry whether he published it truly when he burnt threefourths of it and deposited copies of the rest in the library of lord oxford he professed to have preserved the originals from which the copies were taken lord bolingbroke discovered a great number of returned letters among his papers after his death and told dr heberden that they contained many alterations and corrections which he supposed had been made with the intention of printing them some time or other163 from this it would be inferred that those which had been printed were not part of the collection and that the poet had found it inexpedient to retain vouchers which would condemn if they did not acquit him unfortunately the whole of the manuscripts were destroyed by lord bolingbroke and beyond the unsatisfactory information conveyed in his remark nothing can now be known of them the literal interpretation of his language is favoured by the evidence yet within our reach and we should conclude that pope had not kept originals which would have revealed alterations in the published letters of a far more serious nature than any which bolingbroke appears to have suspected  john caryll a roman catholic country gentleman residing in sussex was among the intimate correspondents of pope for twentyfive years from 1710 to 1735 the poet wrote to him on nov 19 1712 and asked to have the whole cargo of his epistles returned which he said might be of use in a design he had lately engaged in this design was probably to furnish some essays to the guardian which commenced on the 12th of march 1713 he promised to restore the letters when he had done with them and his friend at once complied with his desire after the surreptitious publication of his correspondence with cromwell pope in december 1726 renewed his petition to caryll to make over to him all such papers as he had too partially preserved but the object of the request this time was to put them out of the power of curll the poet announced that he would send back those which could do no hurt to the character of himself his friend or any other person that he would retain those which would serve to bear testimony of his own love for good men or theirs for him and implied as a consequence that he would destroy those which did not fall under either of these heads by this division the insignificant letters alone would have been restored to caryll and whether he was mistrustful of the use to which pope might apply the remainder or whether he was anxious to preserve intact the memorials of his intimacy with a celebrated man he did not think fit to accede to the demand a diminution in the frequency and cordiality of their correspondence ensued and lasted for upwards of two years caryll at length complained and pope replied in february 1729 that he could not open his mind to his acquaintances unless they would return him at the end of every year the forfeitures of his discretion and commit to his justice what he trusted only to their indulgence upon this intimation that compliance was to be the condition of intimacy caryll yielded the point and the receipt of the letters was acknowledged by the poet on the 8th of april the sussex squire defeated the purpose for which they were extorted by copying the greater part of the collection he persevered in the practice till near the close of his life the last letter from pope which he caused to be transcribed is dated july 17 1735 and he died on the 6th of april 1736 when his grandson sold the hereditary estate in 1767 and retired from england to the continent the family papers were left behind stowed away in boxes where they remained for nearly three quarters of a century they then came into the possession of mr dilke and have since been presented by his grandson sir charles w dilke to the british museum among the manuscripts were a dozen folio books containing the farm and domestic accounts and in a volume similar in appearance mr dilke discovered the copies of the letters of pope together with copies of others from the dukes of berwick beaufort and norfolk from dryden wycherley steele roger lestrange st evremond and le grand the external and internal evidence leaves no doubt of their authenticity one unexpected confirmation of their genuineness turned up in an autograph letter of pope to the younger caryll dated nov 8 1712 and which was sent by mr tuckwell to mr croker the letters to the younger caryll remained with his widow the few which exist are originals in the custody of different collectors and this letter of nov 8 is a link in a series of facts that are only known through the transcripts in the caryll folio the recovery of documents which pope did not suspect were in existence discloses to us his mode of dealing with his correspondence when having no idea that it could rise up against him he ventured to use it without reserve  after calling in his letters to his friends pope proceeded to arrange them in order and said they formed altogether an unimportant but yet an innocent history of himself you make i assure you he wrote to caryll july 8 1729 no small figure in these annals from 1710 to 1720 odd upon my word sir i am glad to see how long and how often and how much i have been obliged to you as well as how long how often and how much i have been sensible of and expressed it notwithstanding this assurance caryll made a very small figure indeed in the published collection four letters only were addressed to the hon j c esq in the volume of 1735 and these initials in the quarto of 1737 were added to a fifth letter which had previously been headed mr pope to  one other letter in the quarto bore the title to mr c but it was separated from the former group and it is from the caryll copy that we learn how to fill up the blank both in the edition of 1735 and 1737 pope published a letter to the hon james craggs esq which induced roscoe to conclude that he was the person indicated by the initials and it is not improbable that the poet designed to mislead his readers especially as the claim of caryll to be styled honourable was only a jacobite assumption derived from his being heir to his uncle who had been created a peer by the exiled james ii but though pope did not wish to repeat in public his profuse professions in private and appear as the familiar friend and constant correspondent of a roman catholic country gentleman he as little desired to suppress the choicer portions of the effusions he had addressed to him he conceived the idea of redirecting them and compiled from them in whole or in part four fictitious letters to blount four to addison two to congreve and one each to wycherley steele trumbull and digby a second letter to digby which appeared in the edition of 1735 was transferred to arbuthnot in the quarto of 1737 half a dozen letters at most were allotted to the initials of the sussex squire while fifteen were assigned to more imposing names and a sixteenth was printed in a group of three to the hon  rather than credit an imposition so childish and yet so unwarrantable we should have recourse to the theory that pope sometimes sent the same letter to different persons swift assured him that the best system extant for the conduct of human life might be collected from his epistles and they certainly abound in generalities which like the clowns answer that suited all questions might have been written to anybody but a comparison of the printed letters with the caryll copies shows that this solution is inadmissible and the observation of the clown when his answer proved inopportune is equally applicable to the contrivance of popei see things may serve long and not serve ever164  the spectator of the 10th of november 1712 contained some remarks by pope on the verses which the emperor hadrian composed when he was dying the poet asked carylls opinion of the criticism and the substance of his reply is embodied in the rejoinder of pope the supposition you draw from the suspicion that adrian was addicted to magic seems to me a little uncharitablethat he might fear no sort of deity good or badsince in the third verse he plainly testifies his apprehension of a future state by being solicitous whither his soul was going as to what you mention of his using gay and ludicrous expressions i have already owned my opinion that the expressions are not so but that diminutives are often in latin taken for expressions of tenderness and concern this comment is introduced in the printed correspondence into the letter to steele of november 29 1712 and if it was sent to him as well as to caryll both must have objected to the gay and ludicrous expressions of hadrian both must have spoken of the suspicion that he was addicted to magic both must have inferred from it that he feared no sort of deity good or bad and the language of both must have been as identical as their ideas  i know pope wrote to caryll august 22 1717 you will take part in rejoicing for the victory of prince eugene over the turks in the zeal you bear to the christian interest though your cousin of oxford with whom i dined yesterday says there is no other difference in the christians beating the turks or the turks beating the christians than whether the emperor shall first declare war against spain or spain declare it against the emperor in the published version the passage forms part of a letter to edward blount dated september 8 1717 and either we must admit that it was never written to him or believe that caryll and blount had each an oxford cousin that the poet dined with the oxford cousin of caryll on august 21 and with the oxford cousin of blount on september 7 that both these cousins made at their respective dinners the same epigrammatic observation in the very same words and that the extraordinary coincidence struck pope so little that he did not even remark upon it  another passage of a letter to caryll dated september 20 1713 reappears in a letter to blount dated february 10 1716 i am just returned from the country whither mr rowe did me the favour to accompany me and to pass a week at binfield i need not tell you how much a man of his turn could not but entertain me but i must acquaint you there is a vivacity and gaiety of disposition almost peculiar to that gentleman which renders it impossible to part from him without that uneasiness and chagrin which generally succeeds all great pleasures i have just been taking a solitary walk by moonshine in st jamess park full of reflections of the transitory nature of all human delights and giving my thoughts a loose into the contemplation of those sensations of satisfaction which probably we may taste in the more exalted company of separate spirits when we range the starry walks above thus pope who on his return to town in september 1713 after a weeks companionship with rowe took a solitary walk by moonlight and meditated on the transitory nature of human delights and the happy intercourse of spirits was led by the power of association after another week spent at binfield with rowe in february 1716 to renew the solitary walk by moonlight the instant he returned and indulge in the old contemplation on the transitory nature of human delights and the happy intercourse of separate spirits what renders more singular the second moonlight walk is that the date assigned to it was the memorable season when the thames was frozen over and when the quantity of snow was as unusual as the intensity of the cold the thaw commenced the day before the fragile little bard sallied out for his stroll and he must indeed have been lost in contemplation of the starry walks above not to have been checked in his moonlight rambles by the deplorable condition of the walks below none of the phenomena which were attracting the attention of the rest of the worldthe breaking up of the long and terrible winter the deluge of melting snow the chilling atmosphere the dreary prospectreceived a passing notice from him he saw nothing except the moonshine despite its watery gleam and thought of nothing except the spirits in the stars  in the collection of 1735 there appeared a letter to digby which is dated september 10 1724 and is compounded from two letters to caryll of november 23 and december 25 1725 in the letter of november 23 pope says to caryll my time has been spent in a trembling attendance upon death which has at last seized one of our familymy poor old nurse this sentence was inserted in the letter to digby but as the nurse did not die till november 5 1725 the information could not have been communicated to him in september 1724 the motive of the poet in altering the dates of his letters when he assigned a fanciful address to them was probably to adapt the chronology to the circumstances of his new dramatis personæ his earliest letter to edward blount is dated august 1714 and when he transferred the moonlight reverie from 1713 to 1716 he may have been influenced by the consideration that in the former year his correspondence with blount had not commenced the letter to caryll of november 23 and the letter to digby of september 10 both open with the same compliment on their return from the continent and the date may have been altered from 1725 to 1724 to make it harmonise with digbys travels abroad in remedying one inconsistency pope fell into another a new use was found for the letter in the quarto of 1737 arbuthnot died in february 1735 at the very time when there is reason to suppose that the poet printed the p t collection the final letter in the volume is from the doctor and it was apparently added at the last moment it was then too late to be thinking of a redistribution of the materials and the idea was not executed or perhaps conceived till 1737 when the address which had been changed from caryll to digby was once more changed from digby to arbuthnot in the interval pope appears to have detected the anachronism he retained the day of the month but struck out the year he preserved the announcement death has seized one of our family but dropped the words my poor old nurse her death nevertheless could alone have been meant for in the letters to caryll as in the letter to digby several contemporaneous particulars are mentioned which being repeated in the letter to arbuthnot limit its date to the period of the poor old nurses decease in both cases popes time had been spent in attending upon the dying patient in both cases he and his mother had been ill together in both cases these incidents had hindered his writing in both cases he had been questioned respecting the effect produced upon his mind by the attacks upon his translation of the odyssey and in both cases he had been less troubled by the criticisms upon his writings than by the imputations upon his morals in consequence of some reports which had been spread of his intrigues with martha blount it follows that the letter to arbuthnot though dated september 10 must have been written subsequent to the death of the nurse on november 5 but there is unanswerable evidence that at that time and for weeks and months afterwards he had constant personal intercourse with the poet he was at his elbow and not on the continent165 and the event could not have been communicated to him as news upon his return from any journey he ever made to france the year was omitted by pope exactly because he could fix upon none which would bear the test of examination166 when it is plain that the letter could not have been addressed to arbuthnot it is superfluous to dwell upon the improbability that he and caryll should have put the same question with regard to the railing papers about the odyssey or to enumerate the other coincidences which are beyond the range of belief the letter in all its shapes contains a passage which forms a strange comment upon popes proceedings and is the bitterest sentence that will ever be pronounced upon them falsehood is folly says homer and liars and calumniators at last hurt none but themselves even in this world in the next it is charity to say god have mercy on them they were the devils viceregents upon earth who is the father of lies and i fear has a right to dispose of his children  on june 12 1713 pope wrote to caryll as i hope and would flatter myself that you know me and my thoughts so entirely as never to be mistaken in either so it is a pleasure to me that you guessed so right in regard to the author of that guardian you mentioned on june 23 he wrote again and said your last is the more obliging as it hints at some little niceties in my conduct which your candour and affection prompt you to recommend to me both these sentences are inserted in an undated letter to addison which is compiled from three letters to caryll and no one could credit that caryll and addison had independently and almost simultaneously communicated their guesses to pope that he was the author of a particular essay in the guardian and at the same time hinted at little niceties in his conduct the remainder of the letter to addison is full of inconsistencies the result of the imposition is to confound dates events opinions and persons addison knows pope and his thoughts so entirely as never to be mistaken in either addisons candour and affection prompt him to advise pope in little niceties of conduct and the perfect knowledge the affection the candour and the advice which are represented as proceeding from the most exquisite genius of the age all appertain to an obscure country gentleman whose intimacy could not confer in the eyes of the world any lustre upon his friend the whole of the letters to addison are an absolute fiction four out of the five are from the caryll correspondence and the internal evidence is opposed to the genuineness of the fifth the deception is aggravated by the erroneous aspect it imparts to the celebrated quarrel in the letters which preceded the commencing rupture pope appears as the zealous champion and bosom associate of the man he afterwards maligned and we are left to suppose that the vaunted generosity on one side had been met by envy and hostility on the other it is of virtual forgeries like these which were specially concocted for the public that the poet had the hardihood to say in his preface many of them having been written on the most trying occasions and all in the openness of friendship are a proof what were his real sentiments as they flowed warm from his heart without the least thought that ever the world should be witness to them he not only pretended that they derived a value from being the spontaneous expression of his feelings as they rose but pledged his word that his motive in treasuring them up was to supply an authentic register of historical literary and personal events and especially to provide a corrective to the misrepresentations of less scrupulous chroniclers i think more and more of it he said to lord oxford september 15 1729 when dwelling upon the value of the collected letters and the importance of preserving them as finding what a number of facts they will settle the truth of both relating to history and criticism and parts of private life and character of the eminent men of my time in the preface to the quarto of 1737 he made a statement of the same nature and protested that the letters he kept were selected from the letters he destroyed merely as they preserved the memory of some friendships which would be ever dear to him or set in a true light some matters of fact from which the scribblers of the times had taken occasion to asperse either his friends or himself he volunteered the declaration to lord oxford when he was engaged in the manufacture of the correspondence which was to falsify the facts he pretended it would settle the truth of and he renewed the assertion in public as a prelude to the fabrications themselves  the wycherley correspondence furnishes fresh illustrations of the malpractices of the poet for popes own share in it the published version is our only authority the originals of wycherleys part in it were placed in lord oxfords library in october 1729 and withdrawn in june 1735 but there still exist among the oxford papers copies of six out of the eighteen published letters besides six which are unpublished167 imperfect as is the series it is sufficient to show the infidelity of the work pope put forth to the world the letter borrowed from the caryll group may conveniently be considered in connection with the rest it was probably not included in the original volume of the wycherley correspondence which pope published in 1729 for it is printed in the edition of 1735 on an interpolated half sheet signed  c this is placed between sheet b and sheet c and the numbers of its four pages11 to 14are repeated on sheet c the space being greater than was required the letter has been divided into an unusual number of paragraphs which are double the ordinary distance from each other and as this device for spreading out the matter only brought it three or four lines over the top of the fourth page the remainder is left blank contrary to the plan adopted in the rest of the book168 pope we may presume had not completed in 1729 his task of reconstructing his letters to caryll and first introduced the manufactured letter into the old sheets of the wycherley when he incorporated them into the volume of 1735 a single circumstance is enough to prove that the letter is fictitious it is made up of extracts from two letters to caryll of july 31 1710 and january 25 1711 and in the former of the two the poet quotes a remark from the tatler on the reason why women are vainer than men the passage is repeated in the letter to wycherley which is dated june 23 1705 nearly four years before the tatler commenced and pope imagined he had obliterated the anachronism by changing the phrase the tatler observes of women into the general formula it is observed of women  the concoction of the letter to wycherley out of the letters to caryll is attended by the usual distortion of facts the extract from the letter of july 31 is an expostulation against carylls extravagant compliments a few months after the date which pope assigned to the passage when he applied it to wycherley the old dramatist had addressed a kindred remonstrance to pope i must confess he wrote march 22 17056 you try my patience as you say in the beginning of your letter not by the many lines in it but the too many compliments you make me for nothing in which you prove yourself though a sincere friend a man of too much fiction for i have not seen so much poetry in prose a great while since your letter is filled with so many fine words and acknowledgments of your obligations to me the only asseverations of yours i dare contradict for i must tell you your letter is like an authors epistle before his bookwritten more to show his wit to the world than his sincerity or gratitude to his friend whom he libels with praise so that you have provoked my modesty even whilst you have soothed my vanity for i know not whether i am more complimented than abused since too much praise turns irony as too great thanks for small favours turns ingratitude or too much ceremony in religion hypocrisy169 pope thought fit in the published letters to reverse the parts he ascribed the adulation to wycherley and the rebuke of it to himself he gives a false air of manly independence to his youthful character and does it at the expense of his friend  the extract from the letter to caryll of january 25 1711 which forms the second portion of the madeup letter to wycherley of june 23 1705 is a comment on the eulogy lavished by caryll on some verses of the poet the change of name and date flattered in a double manner the vanity of popethe applause appeared to proceed from a celebrated wit instead of from a country squire and to be bestowed upon a lad of seventeen instead of upon a man who was nearly twentythree he always aspired to the credit of precocity and some of his falsifications seem to have had no other purpose than to exaggerate his juvenile fame wycherley wrote to him on february 19 17089 and spoke of the genius which promised him immortality of his great vigorous and active mind in a postscript it is mentioned that the miscellany which contained popes pastorals would not be out for three weeks170 pope suppressed amongst other passages the allusion which fixed the period at which the panegyric was penned and altered the year to 17067 for no perceptible reason except that he wished to antedate the praise there can be little doubt that his opening letter to wycherley was manufactured or misplaced with a similar object it is printed in the edition of 1735 on an interpolated half sheet marked b the pages of which are correctly numbered from 1 to 4 as the first page of sheet b which follows is numbered 3 it is evident that it was originally preceded by only two pages which must have been cancelled and the present letter put in their place171 this new letter is dated december 26 1704 and contains his reflections on a compliment which he alleges had been paid to him by wycherleythat his compositions were above the attacks of envious critics it is pleasant to remark says dr johnson how soon pope learned the cant of an author and began to treat critics with contempt though he had yet suffered nothing from them172 he did not in fact publish a single line till more than four years later and with our present evidence that the letter was an interpolated afterthought we cannot but suspect that wycherleys premature compliment and popes premature cant both belonged to a subsequent period or perhaps were fabricated for the press the authors age then sixteen says the poet in a note and in this ostentatious announcement we have the motive to the act the opinion of warburton that the letters of the boy displayed all the characteristics of the man is an argument the more that they were the productions of the man and not of the boy  i have received writes wycherley in an unpublished letter dated december 6 1707 yours of the 29th of november which has so much overpaid mine in kindness that as voiture says i doubt whether the best effects of those fine expressions of your friendship to me can be more obliging than they themselves and for my humility you talk of you have lessened while you magnify it as by commending my good nature with so much more of yours you have made me almost incapable of being grateful to you for you have said so many kind things of me you have hardly left me anything of the same kind to return you and the best actions are not capable of making you amends for so many good words you have given me by which you justly magnify them and yourself by saying they are sincere so that you have obliged me to be vain rather than not think you a plain dealer thus even against your own opinion your freedom with me proves not you a fool but me so especially if i could think half the good you say of me my due as for the good book you sent me i took it as kindly as the reprimand from the good man which i think you heard and was that i should not stand in my own light173 pope printed his letter of november 29 to which this letter was a reply and it touches upon none of the topics to which wycherley refers there are none of the fine expressions of friendship none of the many honied words none of the encomiums on his correspondents good nature and humility he reproves him on the contrary in rather a lofty tone for his excessive acknowledgments for trifling services tells him he will continue the revision of the poems the old dramatist had submitted to him insists that he must be permitted to alter and add as well as omit and in answer to an observation of wycherley that the sprightliness of wit despises method assures him that if method is neglected his verses had better be converted into separate maxims in prose as popes letter does not contain one syllable upon the subjects to which wycherley alludes in his reply so the reply takes no notice of the subjects which monopolise the epistle of pope though he had discoursed exclusively upon the remodelling of wycherleys poems wycherley himself disdains to offer in return a single word of thanks of encouragement of acquiescence or dissent the omission cannot be explained by the supposition that the copy was abridged whatever passages might have been left out those would certainly have been retained which confirmed under wycherleys own hand the particulars which were popes professed justification for printing the letters and his excuse for depositing them in the library of lord oxford  the wycherley correspondence concludes with a letter from pope dated may 2 1710 a coldness then ensued of which dr johnson gives this account the fondness of wycherley was too violent to last his esteem of pope was such that he submitted some poems to his revision and when pope perhaps proud of such confidence was sufficiently bold in his criticisms and liberal in his alterations the old scribbler was angry to see his pages defaced and felt more pain from the detection than content from the amendment of his faults they parted but pope always considered him with kindness and visited him a little time before he died174 the statement is incomplete pope engaged in the revision as early as april 1706 when he describes to wycherley the nature of the emendations he has made some parts i have contracted as we do sunbeams to improve their energy and force some i have taken quite away as we take branches from a tree to add to the fruit others i have entirely new expressed and turned more into poetry in november 1707 he informs his friend that he has subjected the poem on dullness to the same process that he has condensed the piece one half suppressed deficiencies heightened the language and smoothed the versification far from being angry at these bold criticisms and liberal alterations the old scribbler was profuse in his thanks and replied to popes request that he would keep the assistance a secret by declaring that he always does and always will own to whose genius and judgment he is indebted for the improvement of his unmusical numbers and harsher sense between three and four years afterwards he submitted a fresh set of poems to popes castigation and in two successive letters of april 1 and april 11 1710 entreats him to show no mercy in his corrections for i had rather he says be condemned by my friend in private than exposed to my foes in public pope answered that the repetitions were more numerous than he anticipated and that crossing them out defaced the copy to a degree that he feared would be displeasing let me know he added if i am to go on at this rate or if you would prescribe any other method wycherley rejoined that tautology was the last fault of which he would be guilty that he thought with care he could remove the blemish and that he would not occupy pope in a task which might prevent his writing on new subjects of his own all he continues that i desire of you is to mark in the margin without defacing the copy at all any repetition of words matter or sense which if you will be so kind as to do for me you will supply my want of memory with your good one and my deficiencies of sense with the infallibilities of yourswhich if you do you will most infinitely oblige me who almost repent the trouble i have given you since so much the comment on popes strong criticism is equally cordial as to what you call freedom with me which you desire me to forgive you may be assured i would not forgive you unless you did use it for i am so far from thinking your plainness a fault or an offence to me that i think it a charity and an obligation which i shall always acknowledge with all sort of gratitude to you for it who am therefore dear mr pope your most obliged humble servant dr johnson overlooked the rude ordeal to which wycherleys vanity had been exposed in april 1706 and the proof he then gave that he had not in his character the slightest tincture of irritable impatience at the wholesale correction of his works he implored a renewal of the rigour when he invoked with full experience of the treatment he was to expect the same good offices in april 1710 and the anger which johnson imputes to him on that occasion at the detection of his faults is not only in singular contradiction to the whole of his previous conduct but is belied as we have seen by his letter to pope the notion that he was offended at the freedom of his friends remarks was an inference drawn from the tone of popes reply and not from the language of wycherley himself  i am sorry pope commences you persist to take ill my not accepting your invitation and to find if i mistake not your exception not unmixed with some suspicion the letter of wycherley is dated april 27 1710 and if the contents of the letter of pope which is dated may 2 did not show that it was the answer all doubt would be removed by the fact that it was headed the answer by the poet both in the octavo of 1735 and the quarto of 1737 this led to the conclusion that wycherley while professing to receive the strictures on his verses with kindness had at the same time manifested in his letter some displeasure which his friend thought proper to omit and which connected their quarrel with the secret soreness of the author at the candour of the critic175 pope did indeed suppress the beginning and the end of wycherleys communication but the passages he kept back betray the falsity of his own insinuation i answered the letter begins yours of the 15th which i think was the last i had from you about three days after my receiving it but having not yet received any answer to it from you i doubt your old pain of the headache has prevented it which gives me a great deal of concern for you insomuch that i have had thoughts of making you a visit before my journey into shropshire which has been delayed by delays and disappointments to me out of the country the end is as follows my most humble service pray to sir william trumbull and your good father and mother whilst i can assure you from hence all the world here are your servants and friends i know not but i may see you very suddenly at binfield after all my broken promises176 instead therefore of wycherley being annoyed at popes refusal to accept his invitation it was wycherley who was designing to visit pope and instead of his persisting to take ill any part of his friends conduct his language was throughout expressive of cordiality and kindness  the first intimation of a rupture is in a letter of pope to cromwell on august 21 1710 in which he says since mr wycherley left london i have not heard a word from him though just before and once since i writ to him and though i know myself guilty of no offence but of doing sincerely just what he bid me on october 28 he reverts to the subject and protests by everything that is holy that he is not acquainted with the cause of the estrangement he goes on however to state that he did not suppose any man could have been so suspicious as not to credit his own experience of a friend and avers that he had done nothing which deserved to be concealeda defence which seems to indicate a consciousness that wycherley had heard some disparaging report it was subsequently asserted by popes enemies and never contradicted by pope that the alienation was produced by a copy of satirical verses he had written on the man he affected to caress his offensive reply of may 2 to the genial letter of april 27 might alone explain the resentment of wycherley if the ungracious answer in its printed shape could be received as authentic but i have shown that the opening sentence in which pope regrets that his correspondent persisted in taking ill his not accepting an invitation is altogether fictitious and with the evidence before us in the critical epistle of november 29 1707 that he replaced his complimentary effusions by unvarnished truths we may suspect that the uncompromising tone of his final letter was softened in the original and that the published version is merely another instance of his anxiety to conceal the deference he had shown to wycherley before the celebrity of the old dramatist had been eclipsed by the fame of the youthful poet the almost eastern style which pope adopted towards him a year and a half after the close of their correspondence may be seen in one of his genuine epistles to cromwell which was printed by curll i am highly pleased the poet writes november 12 1711 with the knowledge you give me of mr wycherleys present temper which seems so favourable to me i shall ever have such a fund of affection for him as to be agreeable to myself when i am so to him and cannot but be gay when he is in good humour as the surface of the earth if you will pardon a poetical similitude is clearer or gloomier just as the sun is brighter or more overcast whatever may have caused the sun to be overcast there could have been little ground of complaint against wycherley or pope would not have fabricated the pretence that he had provoked his anger by declining an invitation  on the appearance of theobalds edition of the posthumous works of wycherley the poet poured out his indignation to lord oxford i foresaw he said october 6 1729 some dirty trick in connection with my friend wycherleys papers which they were publishing and nothing can at once do justice so well to him and to me who was by him employed in them as the divulging of some parts of his and my letters at the moment that he was penning this denunciation against dirty tricks in relation to wycherleys papers though no trick had been practised he was busily engaged in aspersing his friend by garbling the papers he professed to divulge out of justice to his memory his motives were not malignant he was simply desirous to do credit to himself but to effect this end he did not scruple to falsify their private correspondence and under the plea of justifying a man who was in his grave took advantage of his death to libel him in safety when with our scanty means of testing the fidelity of the letters we find that part of them were misplaced distorted and invented the rest of the series must be received with distrust and some which cannot be proved to be fabricated are among the most suspicious of the whole  where the originals of popes letters were in hostile hands as was the case with his letters to cromwell and to lady mary wortley montagu he was compelled to be sparing in his operations he omitted sentences and altered phrases but could not venture upon wholesale perversions of the truth of the bulk of the letters he published we have neither the originals nor reliable copies but when we chance to light upon the materials from which he worked we find as might be expected that he was not more conscientious in his use of them than in his reckless falsification of his correspondence with wycherley and caryll the volume of 1735 concludes with a letter from arbuthnot dated july 17 1734 and in the quarto of 1737 we have the pretended reply of the poet among the arbuthnot papers in the possession of mr baillie is the actual answer sent by pope and it turns out that the printed substitute is an elaborate composition that has hardly any resemblance to the genuine text he must have revised the letter of arbuthnot as well as remodelled his own i am almost displeased he remarks in the real not in the counterfeit reply at your expression scarcely any of those suspicions or jealousies which affect the truest friendships for i know of not one on my part he accordingly erased from arbuthnots letter the expression he disapproved and fathered upon him the unqualified assertion i think since our first acquaintance there has not been any of those little suspicions or jealousies that often affect the sincerest friendships to what extent he may have carried this principle of altering the opinions of his correspondents to fit his personal views cannot be discovered a single instance of the artifice in a man so unscrupulous destroys all confidence in the documents which rest on his unsupported authority and there is often reason to suspect that he gives us not what others said but what he thought it advantageous to himself that they should say  in comparison with this perversion of facts the attempt of pope to improve his letters regarded as literary productions would be of trifling moment if it did not present another example of the audacious falsehoods he imposed upon the world speaking in the preface to the quarto of 1737 of the correspondence he reprinted from what he calls the surreptitious editions he says for the chasms in it we had not the means to supply them the author having destroyed too many letters to preserve a series he intends us to infer that the selection was not his own though the passage is virtually an admission that the collection of p t was the collection deposited with lord oxford or there could not have been such an identity between them as that none of the gaps in the p t volume could be filled up from the bound book in the oxford library nor he continues would he go about to amend them except by the omission of some passages improper or at least impertinent to be divulged to the public or of such entire letters as were either not his or not approved of by him he would have us believe that they had been dragged before the world in their first crude state without a single subsequent touch from his pen though he had previously amended them with studious carehad culled the best passages blended extracts from two or three letters into one and constantly corrected composition which had been originally laboured some of his ambitious epistles like his letter to arbuthnot of july 26 1734 were no doubt mere essays which were only written when they were committed to the press in the quarto of 1741 he repeated the device he had employed in the quarto of 1737 he pretended in both cases that the correspondence he printed himself had been printed by others without his knowledge and in defiance of his wish he next adopted and republished the letters he affected to repudiate and having already revised them to the uttermost asserted that he could not be induced to revise them at all so completely had truth with him been swallowed up in vanity had he he tells us in the preface to the quarto of 1737 sat down with a design to draw his own picture he could not have done it so truly for whoever sits for it whether to himself or another will inevitably find his features more composed than his appear in these letters but if an authors hand like a painters be more distinguishable in a slight sketch than a finished picture this very carelessness will make them the better known from such counterfeits as have been and may be imputed to him he did everything he professed to have left undone the careless sketch was a studied portrait got up for exhibition and the minutest details had been disposed with a view to flatter the likeness and increase the effect  in the conduct of pope to bolingbroke there are points of resemblance to his conduct in the case of the correspondence which render the evidence a material supplement to the present inquiry bolingbroke allowed him to get put into type the political letters on the spirit of patriotism on the idea of a patriot king and on the state of parties under the promise that the pamphlet should be confined to five or six persons who were named by the author pope fulfilled his pledge by causing a separate edition of 1500 copies to be struck off and enjoined the printer to lay by the sheets with great secresy till further orders177 in the dangerous manoeuvre of printing covertly the original volume of the swift correspondence which he sent to the dean he may perhaps have remained concealed from the inferior agents and have conducted the details of the business through the medium of worsdale in the instance of the pamphlet he was not afraid to put himself into the power of the printer who says bolingbroke kept his word with him better than he kept his with his friend178 the poet not only committed a breach of trust in preparing a work for sale which he received upon the condition that it should remain strictly private but he had the boldness to tamper with the substance of the work and in the impression which was ultimately designed for the public he took upon him to divide the subject and to alter and omit passages according to the suggestions of his own fancy179 from warburton we learn that pope frequently told his acquaintance that lord bolingbroke would at his death leave his writings to his disposal180 and the changes he introduced by anticipation into the single instalment within his power show the manner in which he designed to discharge his functions and strengthen the suspicion that he may have falsified the letters of his correspondents as well as his own johnson in censuring lyttelton for publishing the posthumous edition of thomsons poem on liberty in an abridged form condemns a practice which as it has a manifest tendency to lessen the confidence of society and to confound the characters of authors by making one man write by the judgment of another cannot be justified by any supposed propriety of the alteration or kindness of the friend181 the freedom used by pope was especially reprehensible from the concealment he practised the copy of the pamphlet which he sent to bolingbroke and the other privileged persons did not exhibit the modified text and though the occurrence took place several years before the death of the poet he never in all that time whispered one word upon the subject to the author of the tracts from which it is clear that he neither intended him to learn what he had done nor expected him to approve the changes he had made it was not till he was in his grave that his deception was divulged by the application of the printer to bolingbroke for instructions how to dispose of the impression warburton argued that pope must have wished his friend to have a knowledge of the clandestine edition and clandestine alterations or he would have ordered the work to be destroyed during his final illness182 as if in the lingering hope that life would be protracted a little longer it had not happened times out of number that men had deferred burning taletelling papers till their minds were diverted from the duty by the lassitude of sickness and as if such procrastination was not in the highest degree probable when the poet had been first at the pains of revising the work and next at the cost of an edition of 1500 copies183 he may even have believed that his secret under any circumstances was safe with the printer a theory which has been verified by endless examples is a more credible alternative than to assume that pope had designed to leave behind him evidences of a dishonesty which he had not dared to disclose during years of familiar intercourse and which notwithstanding that bolingbroke was perpetually at his side he did not venture to reveal in his dying hours when he might have palliated his motives and obtained pardon for his fault but if we admit the supposition of warburton and allow that he had ultimately arrived at the resolution of suffering the course of events to betray the misdoings he had not the courage to confess there will still remain the facts which warburton never questioned that he pretended to bolingbroke that some half dozen copies had alone been printed when he had printed a distinct edition of 1500 that he handed an impression to the author which was taken faithfully from the manuscript while the impression he hid from him was garbled and adulterated and that having concealed the double treachery for years he left the world without an allusion to the wrongful act he had committed johnson justly considered that the resentment of bolingbroke at this violation of faith was with reason more acrimonious in proportion as the violator had been more trusted or loved for the professions which win confidence increase the baseness of betraying it but with equal justice johnson condemned the thirst for vengeance which excited bolingbroke to blast the memory of the man who had lived with him in a constant interchange of affection and who both in public and private had paid him the tribute of his heartiest homage and applause184  the scrutiny to which the lives of celebrated men are subjected is one of the severest penalties they pay for fame their private weaknesses have often been exposed with wanton cruelty but the delinquencies of pope are public acts by which he himself has challenged inquiry he endeavoured to pass off a sophisticated correspondence for genuine and the interests of truth demand that the deception should be exposed he laboured to throw his own misdoings upon innocent men and justice requires that his victims should be absolved and the discredit augmented beyond measure by the perfidy and deceit be laid where it is due he was the bitter satirist of individuals out of an assumed indignation at everything base and his claim to adopt this lofty strain his sincerity in it and his fairness are all involved in his personal dealings the office of an editor is neither that of an advocate nor of an accuser he is a judge whose only client is truth i have endeavoured to investigate the facts with impartiality and narrate them with fidelity and if i have anywhere failed it is from unconscious not from wilful error but having once been satisfied of the guilt of pope i do not pretend to think that genius is an extenuation of rascality he rightly refused others the benefit of the plea and said in the essay on man whoever is wickedly wise is but the more a fool the more a knave the sketch which lord macaulay has given of his character when describing his conduct on the appearance of tickells version of the first book of the iliad is not too severe for the treacheries and falsehoods which were the instruments of his malevolence cowardice and vanity an odious suspicion had sprung up in the mind of pope he fancied and he soon firmly believed that there was a deep conspiracy against his fame and his fortunes the work on which he had staked his reputation was to be depreciated the subscription on which rested his hopes of a competence was to be defeated with this view addison had made a rival translation tickell had consented to father it and the wits at buttons had consented to puff it we do not accuse pope of bringing an accusation which he knew to be false we have not the smallest doubt that he believed it to be true and the evidence on which he believed it he found in his own bad heart his own life was one long series of tricks as mean and as malicious as that of which he had suspected addison and tickell he was all stiletto and mask to injure to insult and to save himself from the consequences of injury and insult by lying and equivocating was the habit of his life he published a lampoon on the duke of chandos he was taxed with it and he lied and equivocated he published a lampoon on aaron hill he was taxed with it and he lied and equivocated he published a still fouler lampoon on lady mary wortley montagu he was taxed with it and he lied with more than usual effrontery and vehemence he puffed himself and abused his enemies under feigned names he robbed himself of his own letters and then raised the hue and cry after them besides his frauds of malignity of fear of interest and of vanity there were frauds which he seems to have committed from a love of fraud alone he had a habit of stratagem a pleasure in outwitting all who came near him whatever his object might be the indirect road to it was that which he preferred for bolingbroke pope undoubtedly felt as much love and veneration as it was in his nature to feel for any human being yet pope was scarcely dead when it was discovered that from no motive except the mere love of artifice he had been guilty of an act of gross perfidy to bolingbroke185 many of the falsehoods and perfidies i have detailed have come to light since macaulay wrote and there are more behind which will appear in their proper place in popes life and works there have been no lack of men whose moral conduct was in an almost inverse ratio with their intellectual gifts but there never was an author of equal genius who habitually practised such despicable deceptions for such paltry purposes      who for this end would earn a lasting name     join moral infamy to mental fame     would tear aside the friendly veil of night     to stand degraded in a blaze of light  his crooked policy was ineffectual even when his worst devices were undetected few believed that he was vexed at the publication of his letters or that they were careless effusions or that the virtues he paraded in them were the just reflection of his mind both men and compositions will seem to be what they are and the poets protestations did not prevent the world from discovering that his epistles were laboured that many of his sentiments were feigned and that he eagerly promoted the publications he pretended to deplore  having finished a discussion which from its nature will be dull to many and from its length will be wearisome to all i turn to speak of the present edition of the correspondence the last edition published in the lifetime of pope comprised according to mr crokers calculation 354 letters these mr croker states were increased by warburton to 384 by warton to 502 by bowles to 644 and by roscoe to 708 or exactly double the number that were included in the last edition of the poet the present edition will contain more new letters than were collected by warburton warton bowles and roscoe combined and many of them are of immeasurably greater importance in determining the character and conduct of pope than any which have previously appeared there are others among them which under ordinary circumstances would be too trivial to be printed but particulars which are separately insignificant have assisted in dispelling some of the mystery or exposing some of the deceptions in which it was the poets pleasure to involve his life and as nobody can pronounce with certainty what facts may be of service to future inquirers i have thought it better to add a few superfluous pages than to run the risk of rejecting materials which may prove useful hereafter i have in like manner admitted letters which had a biographical value although they were neither written by pope nor to him secondhand statements cannot supply the place of authentic documents and to have dissociated the subsidiary from the main correspondence would have frequently deprived both of the increased importance they derive from being read in connection  in popes own and every succeeding edition the letters are divided into groups the arrangement of the entire collection in one consecutive chronological series is in his case neither desirable nor possible it is not desirable because a unity of subject often runs through his intercourse with particular persons and the interposition of the topics upon which he touched with other friends far from presenting a connected view of his thoughts and actions would reduce the whole to a medley of disjointed fragments it is not possible because many of his letters are undated and though we can frequently determine their place in each class there are no means of settling their order when all the letters of doubtful date are thrown together in numerous instances the year in which they were written can at most be discovered and the attempt to fix their precedency within that period would be attended with as much uncertainty as if they were shuffled like a pack of cards  the liberties which pope took with his correspondence in preparing it for publication diminish the authority of that extensive portion of it which we owe to his printed or manuscript copies alone and have rendered it essential to specify the source from which every letter is derived where the letter was sent to one person and was published by pope as if it had been addressed to another it is inserted in its proper place and again in the group to which it was falsely assigned by the writer unless the correspondence was exhibited in its double form a just idea could not easily be obtained of the shape and colour he imparted to it or of the relations which he pretended to have maintained with his contemporaries where the direction was not changed and we possess both the genuine and the corrected letter the true version is given in the text and any variations in his amended version which seemed worthy of notice are pointed out in the notes even here from the nature and extent of the alterations it has sometimes been necessary to preserve a letter in its twofold state  the greater part of the collection of 1735 was reproduced in the quarto of 1737 but as the texts are not always identical the earliest has been followed except where there is manifestly an error of the press or where the quarto supplies passages which are not in the volume of p t i had once intended to subjoin the whole of the various readings at the foot of the page i abandoned the design upon finding that the vast majority of them were verbal and apparently unimportant changes which could only have interested the few curious inquirers who would always have recourse to the original editions i have not the less carefully collated these original editions throughout and have thus got rid of numerous mistakes which had become traditional in the subsequent reprints the notes signed pope 1735 were first published in the p t collection with the exception of a few in the wycherley group which though they are only known to us through the p t volume had undoubtedly appeared in 1729 many of the p t notes were transferred to the authorised impression of 1737 and they were nearly all in the copies which the poet delivered to warburton for posthumous publication the notes signed pope 1737 were added in the quarto of that year and those signed cooper 1737 are from the octavos which bear the name of this bookseller on the titlepage  language was current in popes day which would be considered grossly indelicate in ours and though he abounds in refined and elevated strains he was yet among the worst offenders of his time he and swift says dr johnson had an unnatural delight in ideas physically impure such as every other tongue utters with unwillingness and of which every ear shrinks from the mention his correspondence is not altogether free from the defect but no editor can now efface the blots which warburton warton and bowles felt bound to preserve roscoe set aside a few sentences and showed by his inconsistency the uselessness of the process he confined his expurgations to the part of popes works which were little read and where the omissions in consequence would rarely be remarked but did not venture to disturb a single syllable of the far more numerous and more objectionable passages which occur in the pieces that are in the hands of all the world the stains which sully so much of our beautiful literature are unhappily indelible and it could answer no useful end to adopt the capricious principle of roscoe in removing the lesser blemishes which are seldom noticed and leaving the worst and most conspicuous defilements undisturbed more freedom may be used with the unpublished letters but i have exercised the discretion very sparingly and have not excluded every coarse word phrase or idea when it was characteristic of the age the man and his writings and when though an offence against taste it could not be injurious to morals  i have mentioned at the several places where their contributions are inserted the numerous persons to whose liberality mr croker and myself have been obliged for materials and assistance the services rendered by mr dilke require to be noticed here until he published his articles in the athenæum little had been added to our knowledge of pope since johnson produced his masterly life the truths which mr dilke established and the errors he dissipated were not more important than the change he gave to the former superficial investigations his rigid scrutiny became the standard for every subsequent inquirer he loved his studies for their own sake and never did a man of letters work less for personal ends he at once placed at my disposal his caryll correspondence which he had carefully annotated and the explanation of all its obscure allusions are due to him he supplied me with a multitude of letters which were widely scattered through books and periodicals and collated others with the originals in the british museum and bodleian library large masses of the letters are undated or dated falsely and he was at the labour of fixing dates which sometimes appeared to defy conjecture he lent me his rare editions was unwearied in answering questions in solving difficulties in revising proofs and in communicating without reserve his stores of information he was then suffering from a long and painful illness and he died when only the first volume of correspondence was printed or i should have had his generous and invaluable aid to the end  mr bowles remarked in the course of the skirmish of pamphlets he provoked that the editorship of popes works had been to no one a bed of roses for the larger part of the discomforts his commentators may have endured pope himself was responsible his mysteries his doubledealings his falsifications and his quarrels have rendered half the acts of his life a fertile theme for debate none of the angry controversialists who mingled fifty years ago in the fray had prepared properly for the contest and the insolence and assumption the virulence and the dogmatism were commonly greatest with the persons whose acquaintance with the subject was the least the intemperate and usually ignorant warfare left nearly all the vexed questions in confusion and it is only in recent years that a new generation of dispassionate students have begun to replace the blunders of sciolism by facts in the many battles yet to be fought over pope there will be this advantage which will be certain to produce solid results that the critic will be in possession of the materials for judgment and will not have to write without knowledge of his cause  footnotes  footnote 1 johnson lives of the poets ed cunningham

footnote 78 the athenæum of sept 8 1860  footnote 79 when pope put forth his preface to the quarto he could not have intended to disguise that he was the writer of the narrative or he would have been at greater pains to vary his language if the general resemblance had been less marked an invention common to both productions would reveal their common origin in the narrative we are informed that the complete collection of popes had been copied into a couple of books before theobald published his edition of wycherleys posthumous works and that it was from these manuscript books that the wycherley correspondence was transcribed for press this assertion was untrue theobalds volume came out in 1728 while popes collection as appears from his announcements to lord oxford was still in the process of formation in september 1729 and he was only causing it to be fairly written in october after his own wycherley volume had passed through the press the false account is repeated in the preface to the quarto where we are told that the posthumous works of wycherley were printed the year after the copy of popes collection of letters had been deposited in the library of lord oxford which throws back the deposit of the letters from the close of 1729 to 1727 since the poet revived and authenticated an anonymous fiction respecting his personal acts he may reasonably be supposed to have been the author of it the object of the imposition was to uphold the tale he had advanced in his wycherley volume he had ceased to state openly that the publication was the act of lord oxford but he wished to have it believed that the letters were in the keeping of his noble friend at the time and to leave the impression that the notion of printing them had not originated with himself  footnote 80 vol i

would not use the new letters without his unfailing pretext that they were in such hands as to be in imminent danger of being printed  footnote 114 these particulars are derived from the chancery bill

undated and was published without any date by curll when pope reproduced it in the quarto of 1737 he dated it august 1723 and in the quarto of 1741 he changed the date to january 1723 which must be incorrect since bolingbroke was then abroad and did not return to england till june swifts reply is dated september 20 and as it was between this period and june that the joint letter must have been written august is either the true date or a close approximation to it  footnote 131 pope to lord orrery march 1737  footnote 132 mrs whiteway to lord orrery  footnote 133 it is stated in a note to the

pope oct 4 1738  footnote 135 pope to mr nugent august 14 1740 this letter was first published in the gentlemans magazine for august 1849 it is printed together with the other letters on the subject among the pope and swift correspondence in this edition  footnote 136 the earliest of the three letters bears in the body of the work the heading mr gay to dr swift but in the table of contents it is entitled from mr gay and mr pope and the language in portions of the letter itself shows that it was the production of both  footnote 137 i never said the poet to caryll november 19 1712 kept any copies of such stuff as i write which would be decisive of his custom at that early date if much reliance could be placed on his word in 1716 he commenced correspondence with lady mary wortley montagu and afterwards published several of the letters among his letters to ladies he was then at enmity with her and as she retained the originals he must either have borrowed them prior to the quarrel for the purpose of copying them or else must have copied them before they were sent there is no direct evidence to show at what time he commenced the practice of transcribing letters but at the close of 1726 he began to compile the collection of 1735 and thenceforward he was sure to let nothing escape which could contribute to his design  footnote 138 mrs whiteway to lord orrery  footnote 139 dr hawkesworth published a letter from swift to pope introducing his cousin mr d swift and three more were published by mr d swift himself he does not say by what means he obtained them but they form part of a collection of some seventy stray letters addressed by swift to thirty or forty different persons who had certainly not returned them  footnote 140 pope to lord oxford dec 14 1725  footnote

339 when mr gerrard was about to return to ireland from bath pope wrote to him may 17 1740 to say that he had found another conveyance for the letter he had intended to send by him to swift mr gerrard may nevertheless have carried over the printed correspondence which would not have been openly entrusted to him by pope who professed to know nothing about it the poet may have thought upon reflection that it would look less suspicious if his avowed letter and the anonymous parcel were not transmitted by the same bearer  footnote 144 mrs whiteway to lord orrery  footnote 145 pope to mr nugent march

after popes death  footnote 148 millar v taylor burrows reports vol iv p 2397  footnote 149 athenæum for sept 15 1860  footnote 150 whereas there is an impression of certain letters between dr swift and mr pope openly printed in dublin without mr popes consent and there is reason to think the same hath been or will be done clandestinely in london notice is hereby given that they will be speedily published with several additional letters c composing altogether a second volume of his works in proselondon daily post for march 24 1741 quoted in the athenæum for september 15 1860 the advertisement displays the same cautious phraseology as was employed in the prefatory notice to the quarto and speaks of the dublin volume as only printed not published one motive which probably induced faulkner to delay it was that the work would have been incomplete without the additional letters  footnote 151 page 89 in the quarto bears in the cancelled division the signature m and the later page 89 has the signature n the cause of the difference is plain it is the ordinary habit to begin the body of a work on sheet b and reserve the signature a for the preliminary matter this is the method adopted with the three previous quarto volumes of popes works and was followed in the original quarto impression of the correspondence but after the poet had cancelled the beginning of the volume the sheet commonly marked b was in the second state of the quarto marked a which occasioned the usual sheet n to become m the discrepancy is an additional proof that the opening sheets had been cancelled and reprinted  footnote 152 there were probably minor cancels which did not disturb the general arrangement as at page 124 where there is a note which purports to be copied from the dublin edition the final sheet of all was evidently printed after faulkners volume was in type  footnote 153 pope to lord orrery march 1737  footnote 154 curll who delivered his answer upon oath was no doubt aware that the work was not first published in dublin he therefore used the evasive word printed and left it to his opponents to detect the fallacy the methods however by which pope had obtained his priority would not permit him to plead it nor was he likely by mooting the question to risk the revelation of his plot  footnote 155 atkynss reports vol ii p 342  footnote 156 the other counsel were sir dudley ryder then attorneygeneral and mr noel they all paid pope the tribute of refusing their fees  footnote 157 tonson v collins blackstones reports vol i p 311  footnote 158 millar v taylor burrows reports vol iv p 2396 i know lord mansfield observed that mr pope had no paper upon which the letters were written which means that he had received this assurance from pope and supposed it to be true in one particular the memory of lord mansfield deceived him blackstone on the authority of the preface to the quarto of 1741 stated while arguing the case of tonson v collins that the letters were published with the connivance at least if not under the direction of swift to which lord mansfield replied certainly not dr swift disclaimed it and was extremely angry but this is opposed to the united evidence of mrs whiteway faulkner and pope who all concur in testifying that swift consented to the publication  footnote 159 mrs whiteway to lord orrery  footnote 160 pope to caryll feb 3 1729 pope to swift march 23 1737  footnote 161 to lord orrery march 1737 his humanity his charity his condescension his candour are equal to his wit and require as good and true a taste to be equally valued when all this must die i would gladly have been the recorder of so great a part of it as shines in his letters to me and of which my own are but as so many acknowledgements  footnote 162 pope to nugent august 14 1740  footnote 163 the statement is recorded by dr birch in his journal may 14 1751 he received the information from dr heberden who was then attending lord bolingbroke in his last illness  footnote 164 alls well that ends well act ii scene 2  footnote 165 in september 1725 arbuthnot had an illness which was expected to prove mortal pope in announcing his recovery to swift on october 15 added he goes abroad again and is more cheerful than even health can make a man he meant that arbuthnot was able to go about again which was still one of the commonest significations of the phrase arbuthnot did not leave england and from his letter to swift on october 17 it is clear that he had never entertained the design  footnote 166 roscoe dated the letter 1726 without recapitulating the circumstances which are fatal to the conjecture it is enough to say that on september 10 1726 pope was unable to hold a pen owing to the injury he had received a day or two before when he was upset in bolingbrokes carriage it was several weeks before he recovered the use of his hand in the case of digby there is the additional difficulty that as the nurse did not die till after september 1725 so he himself was dead before september 1726  footnote 167 i did not discover the letters of wycherley at longleat till after his correspondence with pope had been printed off  footnote 168 notes

of the letter is taken up with an account of some religious fanatics  footnote 174 lives of the poets vol iii p 10  footnote 175 the general impression produced by the correspondence was expressed by spence when he observed to pope people have pitied you extremely on reading your letters to wycherley surely it was a very difficult thing for you to keep well with him the most difficult thing in the world was popes reply on another occasion he said to spence wycherley was really angry with me for correcting his verses so much i was extremely plagued up and down for almost two years with them however it went off pretty well at last when pope tampered with the written records which he cited as evidence upon the question we can place no reliance on his passing words  footnote 176 oxford mss  footnote 177 this statement is from the edition of the pamphlet published in 1749 mallet was the nominal and bolingbroke the real editor the particulars of popes misconduct are related with much asperity in a preliminary advertisement of which the original corrected by bolingbroke is in the british museum  footnote 178 advertisement to the edition of 1749  footnote 179 advertisement to the edition of 1749 in the same year warburton put forth a short pamphlet entitled a letter to the editor of the letters on the spirit of patriotism c which was reprinted in 1769 in the appendix to ruffheads life of pope in this reply warburton extenuates without justifying the act of his friend and is more successful in his attack upon bolingbroke for exposing the treachery than in his defence of pope for perpetrating it the letter to the editor of the letters is chiefly valuable for its admission of the principal charges against the poet his advocate who had seen both the genuine and corrupted edition of the phamphlet allows that he had tampered with the text bolingbroke had only specified alterations and ommissions warburton goes further and speaks of interpolations in the body of ruffheads work it is stated that pope altered nothing and only struck out some insults on the throne and the then reigning monarch but this is opposed to the language of warburton twenty years

one of the best      pieces of prose in our language it abounds in strong good      sense and profound knowledge of life it is written with      such simplicity that scarcely a single metaphor is to be      found in itwarton   this preface first appeared in the works of pope 4to 1717 the poet submitted the manuscript to atterbury and the bishop thus replied in december 1716 i return the preface which i have read twice with pleasure the modesty and good sense there is in it must please every one that reads it and since there is as i said nothing that can offend i see not why you should balance a moment about printing it always provided that there is nothing said there which you have occasion to unsay hereafter of which you yourself are the best and the only judge this is my sincere opinion which i give because you ask it and which i would not give though asked but to a man i value as much as i do you being sensible how improper it is on many accounts for me to interpose in things of this nature which i never understood well and now understand somewhat less than ever i did the suspicion which atterbury hinted to his friend that some of the sentiments expressed in the preface might hereafter be quoted against him probably referred to the vaunts in the concluding paragraphs the poet paid no regard to the warning and lived to violate nearly all his professions johnson says that the preface is written with great sprightliness and elegance but the praise of warton is hyperbolical when he terms it one of the best pieces of prose in our language the style is often faulty and never rises to any extraordinary pitch of excellence the knowledge of life which warton calls profound is such as a little experience would supply and the strong good sense is interspersed with obvious thoughts and erroneous maxims the language of atterbury is sober and even in writing to the author he was not betrayed by the partiality of friendship into the exaggerations of warton     the authors preface   i am inclined to think that both the writers of books and the readers of them are generally not a little unreasonable in their expectations the first seem to fancy that the world must approve whatever they produce and the latter to imagine that authors are obliged to please them at any rate methinks as on the one hand no single man is born with a right of controlling the opinions of all the rest so on the other the world has no title to demand that the whole care and time of any particular person should be sacrificed to its entertainment therefore i cannot but believe that writers and readers are under equal obligations for as much fame or pleasure as each affords the other  every one acknowledges it would be a wild notion to expect perfection in any work of man and yet one would think the contrary was taken for granted by the judgment commonly passed upon poems a critic supposes he has done his part if he proves a writer to have failed in an expression or erred in any particular point and can it then be wondered at if the poets in general seem resolved not to own themselves in any error for as long as one side will make no allowances the other will be brought to no acknowledgments1  i am afraid this extreme zeal on both sides is illplaced poetry and criticism being by no means the universal concern of the world but only the affair of idle men who write in their closets and of idle men who read there yet sure upon the whole a bad author deserves better usage than a bad critic for a writers endeavour for the most part is to please his readers and he fails merely through the misfortune of an ill judgment but such a critics is to put them out of humour a design he could never go upon without both that and an ill temper2  i think a good deal may be said to extenuate the fault of bad poets what we call a genius is hard to be distinguished by a man himself from a strong inclination and if his genius be ever so great he cannot at first discover it any other way than by giving way to that prevalent propensity which renders him the more liable to be mistaken the only method he has is to make the experiment by writing and appealing to the judgment of others now if he happens to write ill which is certainly no sin in itself he is immediately made an object of ridicule i wish we had the humanity to reflect that even the worst authors might in their endeavour to please us deserve something at our hands we have no cause to quarrel with them but for their obstinacy in persisting to write and this too may admit of alleviating circumstances their particular friends may be either ignorant or insincere and the rest of the world in general is too wellbred to shock them with a truth which generally their booksellers are the first that inform them of this happens not till they have spent too much of their time to apply to any profession which might better fit their talents and till such talents as they have are so far discredited as to be but of small service to them for what is the hardest case imaginable the reputation of a man generally depends upon the first steps he makes in the world and people will establish their opinion of us from what we do at that season when we have least judgment to direct us  on the other hand a good poet no sooner communicates his works with the same desire of information but it is imagined he is a vain young creature given up to the ambition of fame when perhaps the poor man is all the while trembling with the fear of being ridiculous if he is made to hope he may please the world he falls under very unlucky circumstances for from the moment he prints he must expect to hear no more truth than if he were a prince or a beauty if he has not very good sense and indeed there are twenty men of wit for one man of sense his living thus in a course of flattery may put him in no small danger of becoming a coxcomb if he has he will consequently have so much diffidence as not to reap any great satisfaction from his praise since if it be given to his face it can scarce be distinguished from flattery and if in his absence it is hard to be certain of it were he sure to be commended by the best and most knowing he is as sure of being envied by the worst and most ignorant which are the majority3 for it is with a fine genius as with a fine fashion all those are displeased at it who are not able to follow it and it is to be feared that esteem will seldom do any man so much good as illwill does him harm then there is a third class of people who make the largest part of mankindthose of ordinary or indifferent capacities and these to a man will hate or suspect him a hundred honest gentlemen will dread him as a wit and a hundred innocent women as a satirist in a word whatever be his fate in poetry it is ten to one but he must give up all the reasonable aims of life for it there are indeed some advantages accruing from a genius to poetry and they are all i can think ofthe agreeable power of selfamusement when a man is idle or alone the privilege of being admitted into the best company and the freedom of saying as many careless things as other people without being so severely remarked upon4  5i believe if any one early in his life should contemplate the dangerous fate of authors he would scarce be of their number on any consideration the life of a wit is a warfare upon earth and the present spirit of the learned world is such that to attempt to serve it any way one must have the constancy of a martyr and a resolution to suffer for its sake i could wish people would believe what i am pretty certain they will not that i have been much less concerned about fame than i durst declare till this occasion when methinks i should find more credit than i could heretofore since my writings have had their fate already and it is too late to think of prepossessing the reader in their favour i would plead it as some merit in me that the world has never been prepared for these trifles by prefaces6 biassed by recommendations dazzled with the names of great patrons7 wheedled with fine reasons and pretences or troubled with excuses8 i confess it was want of consideration that made me an author i writ because it amused me i corrected because it was as pleasant to me to correct as to write and i published because i was told i might please such as it was a credit to please to what degree i have done this i am really ignorant i had too much fondness for my productions to judge of them at first and too much judgment to be pleased with them at last but i have reason to think they can have no reputation which will continue long or which deserves to do so9 for they have always fallen short not only of what i read of others but even of my own ideas of poetry  if any one should imagine i am not in earnest i desire him to reflect that the ancients to say the least of them had as much genius as we and that to take more pains and employ more time cannot fail to produce more complete pieces they constantly applied themselves not only to that art but to that single branch of an art to which their talent was most powerfully bent and it was the business of their lives to correct and finish their works for posterity10 if we can pretend to have used the same industry let us expect the same immortality though if we took the same care we should still lie under a further misfortune they writ in languages that became universal and everlasting while ours are extremely limited both in extent and in duration a mighty foundation for our pride when the utmost we can hope11 is but to be read in one island and to be thrown aside at the end of one age  all that is left us is to recommend our productions by the imitation of the ancients12 and it will be found true that in every age the highest character for sense and learning has been obtained by those who have been most indebted to them for to say truth whatever is very good sense must have been common sense in all times and what we call learning is but the knowledge of the sense of our predecessors therefore they who say our thoughts are not our own because they resemble the ancients may as well say our faces are not our own because they are like our fathers and indeed it is very unreasonable that people should expect us to be scholars and yet be angry to find us so13  i fairly confess that i have served myself all i could by reading that i made use of the judgment of authors dead and living that i omitted no means in my power to be informed of my errors both by my friends and enemies14 but the true reason these pieces are not more correct is owing to the consideration how short a time they and i have to live15 one may be ashamed to consume half ones days in bringing sense and rhyme together and what critic can be so unreasonable as not to leave a man time enough for any more serious employment or more agreeable amusement  the only plea i shall use for the favour of the public is that i have as great a respect for it as most authors have for themselves and that i have sacrificed much of my own selflove for its sake in preventing not only many mean things from seeing the light but many which i thought tolerable i would not be like those authors who forgive themselves some particular lines for the sake of a whole poem and vice versâ a whole poem for the sake of some particular lines16 i believe no one qualification is so likely to make a good writer as the power of rejecting his own thoughts and it must be this if any thing that can give me a chance to be one for what i have published i can only hope to be pardoned but for what i have burned i deserve to be praised on this account the world is under some obligation to me and owes me the justice in return to look upon no verses as mine that are not inserted in this collection17 and perhaps nothing could make it worth my while to own what are really so but to avoid the imputation of so many dull and immoral things as partly by malice and partly by ignorance have been ascribed to me i must further acquit myself of the presumption of having lent my name to recommend any miscellanies18 or works of other men19 a thing i never thought becoming a person who has hardly credit enough to answer for his own  in this office of collecting my pieces i am altogether uncertain whether to look upon myself as a man building a monument20 or burying the dead if time shall make it the former may these poems as long as they last remain as a testimony that their author never made his talents subservient to the mean and unworthy ends of party or selfinterest the gratification of public prejudices or private passions the flattery of the undeserving or the insult of the unfortunate if i have written well let it be considered that it is what no man can do without good sense a quality that not only renders one capable of being a good writer but a good man and if i have made any acquisition in the opinion of any one under the notion of the former let it be continued to me under no other title than that of the latter21  but if this publication be only a more solemn funeral of my remains i desire it may be known that i die in charity and in my senses without any murmurs against the justice of this age or any mad appeals to posterity i declare i shall think the world in the right and quietly submit to every truth which time shall discover to the prejudice of these writings not so much as wishing so irrational a thing as that every body should be deceived merely for my credit however i desire it may then be considered that there are very few things in this collection which were not written under the age of fiveandtwenty so that my youth may be made as it never fails to be in executions a case of compassion that i was never so concerned about my works as to vindicate them in print believing if any thing was good it would defend itself and what was bad could never be defended that i used no artifice to raise or continue a reputation depreciated no dead author i was obliged to bribed no living one with unjust praise insulted no adversary with ill language22 or when i could not attack a rivals works encouraged reports against his morals to conclude if this volume perish let it serve as a warning to the critics not to take too much pains for the future to destroy such things as will die of themselves and a memento mori to some of my vain contemporaries the poets to teach them that when real merit is wanting it avails nothing to have been encouraged by the great commended by the eminent and favoured by the public in general23                                                  nov 10 1716  footnotes  footnote 1 in all editions till that of warburton it was thus for as long as one side despises a well meant endeavour the other will not be satisfied with a moderate approbation the first sentence of the next paragraph is expanded in the manuscript indeed they both proceed in such a manner as if they really believed that poetry was immediate inspiration it were to be wished they would reflect that this extraordinary zeal and fury is ill placed poetry and criticism being by no means the universal concern of the world i do not say this to imitate those people who make a merit of undervaluing the arts and qualifications without which they had never been taken notice of i think poetry as useful as any other art because it is as entertaining and therefore as well deserving of mankind  footnote 2 until the edition of warburton the reading was slightly different yet sure upon the whole a bad author deserves better usage than a bad critic a man may be the former merely through the misfortune of an ill judgment but he cannot be the latter without both that and an ill temper  footnote 3 the instance of pope himself is a refutation of his theory that the world was almost exclusively composed of flatterers and detractors and chiefly of the last where he could count the deniers of his genius by tens he could number his admirers by thousands  footnote 4 what is here said of the privileges of the poetic character will not i believe bear the test of truth and experience surely a poet is not particularly allowed the freedom of saying careless things and his moral character and manners are to be estimated as well as his talents before he is entitled to a certain station in societybowles  footnote 5 in the ms it followed thus for my part i confess had i seen things in this view at first the public had never been troubled either with my writings or with this apology for them i am sensible how difficult it is to speak of ones self with decency but when a man must speak of himself the best way is to speak truth of himself or he may depend upon it others will do it for him i will therefore make this preface a general confession of all my thoughts of my own poetry resolving with the same freedom to expose myself as it is in the power of any other to expose them in the first place i thank god and nature that i was born with a love to poetry for nothing more conduces to fill up all the intervals of our time or if rightly used to make the whole course of life entertaining cantantes licet usque minus via lædet it is a vast happiness to possess the pleasures of the head the only pleasures in which a man is sufficient to himself and the only part of him which to his satisfaction he can employ all day long the muses are amicæ omnium horarum and like our gay acquaintance the best company in the world as long as one expects no real service from them i confess there was a time when i was in love with myself and my first productions were the children of selflove upon innocence i had made an epic poem and panegyrics on all the princes in europe and thought myself the greatest genius that ever was i cannot but regret those delightful visions of my childhood which like the fine colours we see when our eyes are shut are vanished for ever many trials and sad experience have so undeceived me by degrees that i am utterly at a loss at what rate to value myself as for fame i shall be glad of any i can get and not repine at any i miss and as for vanity i have enough to keep me from hanging myself or even from wishing those hanged who would take it away it was this that made me write the sense of my faults made me correct besides that it was as pleasant to me to correct as to writewarburton  spence relates that pope said to mr saville if i was to begin the world again and knew just what i do now i would never write a verse in the passage from his manuscript preface he intimates that he would have amused himself by writing poetry but would have forborne to publish what he wrote either he was not honest in the opinion or he was selfdeceived he valued his fame above all things and left no means untried to protect and promote it  footnote 6 as was the practice of his master dryden who is severely lashed for this in the tale of a tubwarton  footnote 7 pope was not justified in his boast he dropped the practice of fulsome dedications but he made the most of his distinguished friends in the body of his pieces and though no names of great patrons are given in this preface he could not abstain from announcing in the final sentence how much they had countenanced him this moreover was to proclaim the recommendations he repudiated and in every issue of his works the preface which contained the inconsistency was followed in addition by a series of recommendatory poems  footnote 8 the passage in inverted commas was first added in 1736  footnote 9 one of popes favourite topics is contempt for his own poetry for this if it had been real he would deserve no commendation and in this he was certainly not sincere for his value of himself was sufficiently observed and of what could he be proud but of his poetry he writes he says when he has just nothing else to do yet swift complains that he was never at leisure for conversation because he had always some poetical scheme in his head it was punctually required that his writingbox should be set upon his bed before he rose and lord oxfords domestic related that in the dreadful winter of 1740 she was called from her bed by him four times in one night to supply him with paper lest he should lose a thoughtdr johnson  footnote 10 for the next sentence the manuscript has this passage but i fear it is far otherwise with modern poets we must bring our wit to the press as gardeners do their flowers to the market which if they cannot vend in the morning are sure to die before night were we animated by the same noble ambition and ready to prosecute it with equal ardour our languages are not only confined to a narrow extent of country but are in a perpetual flux not so much as fixed by an acknowledged grammar while theirs were such as time and fate conspired to make universal and everlasting  footnote 11 in place of the remainder of the sentence he had written in the manuscript is but to live twenty years longer than quarles or withers or dennis the doctrine of pope was unworthy the countryman of chaucer shakespeare spenser and milton the first three had not been thrown aside at the end of one age and no one who was capable of comprehending the last could seriously believe that his reputation would be ephemeral the hypothesis that the writers in a dead tongue can alone secure a worthy audience is altogether chimerical the literature of living languages has the ascendancy and shakespeare is more read and better appreciated than Æschylus and sophocles  footnote 12 i have frequently heard dr young speak with great disapprobation of the doctrine contained in this passage with a view to which he wrote his discourse on original compositionwarton  the assertion of pope is in the face of the facts all the greatest names in modern literature have a marked originality and those authors who have imitated the ancients except in subordinate circumstances have usually produced tame and lifeless compositions which were speedily forgotten  footnote 13 the sophistry is transparent a man may be a scholar without being a plagiarist or an imitator  footnote 14 here followed in the first edition and that i expect not to be excused in any negligence on account of youth want of leisure or any other idle allegations this was inconsistent with his request at the conclusion of his preface that those who condemned his poems would remember his youth when he composed them after the omitted sentence he had added in the manuscript i have ever been fearful of making an ill present to the world for which i have as much respect as most poets have for themselves what i thought incorrect i suppressed and what i thought most finished i never published but with fear and trembling  footnote 15 from hence to the end of the paragraph the manuscript continues thus a man that can expect but sixty years may be ashamed to employ thirty in measuring syllables and bringing sense and rhyme together we spend our youth in the pursuit of riches or fame in hopes to enjoy them when we are old and when we are old we find it is too late to enjoy anything i have got over the mistake pretty early i therefore hope the wits will pardon me if i leave myself time enough to save my soul and some wise men will be of my opinion even if i should think a part of it better spent in the enjoyment of life than in pleasing the critics  footnote 16 this sentence was in the manuscript but pope omitted it in the edition of 1717 and restored it in 1736  footnote 17 in the manuscript he added which indeed was my chief view in making it for in the present liberty of the press a man is forced to appear as bad as he is not to be thought worse the assertion is qualified in the text but he could not entirely abandon the affectation of pretending that he collected his works to escape the disgrace of the pieces which were falsely attributed to him and not to obtain credit from his own performances  footnote 18 i am always highly delighted said addison in the spectator no 523 oct 30 1712 with the discovery of any rising genius among my countrymen for this reason i have read over with great pleasure the late miscellany published by mr pope in which there are many excellent compositions of that ingenious gentleman the announcement referred to the first edition of lintots miscellany and from the literary intercourse which existed between addison steele and pope at the time the compilation was not likely to have been ascribed to the latter in the spectator without sufficient authority the language of pope seems carefully selected to avoid the direct denial that he was the editor the work was published anonymously and he only asserts that he had never lent his name to recommend any miscellanies the disclaimer was probably directed against the device adopted by lintot in the second edition 1 vol 8vo 1714 which bore this title miscellaneous poems and translations by several hands particularly etc here followed a list of popes contributions and his alone underneath the list a line was drawn across the page and below this line was printed in capital letters by mr pope the complete separation between the list of pieces and the name of the poet disconnected them to the eye and left the impression that pope was the editor of the entire work the same plan was continued till the fifth edition 2 vols 12mo 1727 when lintot grew bolder and inserted bastard titlepages with the words mr popes miscellany the poet who corrected the proofs of his own pieces for the fifth edition assured christopher pitt in a letter of july 23 1726 that he had never had anything to do with the remainder of the work but the private assurance after many years of a man who had no regard for truth does not outweigh the assertion in the spectator when coupled with the peculiar wording by which he evaded the public contradiction of the statement  footnote 19 in 1721 he broke through his rule by recommending the poems of parnell to lord oxford in an epistle in versecunningham  footnote 20 a few sentences before he had said for what i have published i can only hope to be pardoned and already he has forgotten his mock modesty and admits he has a hope that his works may prove a monument  footnote 21 the commendation of his own goodness is a theme which constantly recurs in pope as if he hoped to conceal his delinquencies by his loud profession of the contrary qualities the topic is introduced into this preface in a forced manner and treated with singular weakness intellectual capacity and literary preeminence are no security for moral excellence and it was idle to ask the public to forget his reputation as a poet which was his sole claim to fame and to commemorate him for virtues of which the world had no proof and which if they were real he shared with thousands  footnote 22 this was written in 1716 did our author recollect this sentiment in 17298warton  warton alludes to the dunciad but to have insulted adversaries with ill language was only one out of several particulars in which popes subsequent career belied the protestations in his preface  footnote 23 this farfetched excuse of pope for rebuking the vanity of contemporary poets was a clumsy expedient to gratify his own vanity in proclaiming to the world that he had been encouraged by the great and commended by the eminent he had not much title to reprove the vanity of his brethren when in the same sentence he recorded the praise which the different orders of mankind had bestowed upon himself     preface to popes works  vol ii 4to 1735  the author to the reader   all i had to say of my writings is contained in my preface to the first of these volumes printed for j tonson and b lintot in quarto and folio in the year 1717 and all i have to say of myself will be found in my last epistle1 i have nothing to add but that this volume and the abovementioned contain whatsoever i have written and2 designed for the press except my translation of the iliad with my preface and notes of twelve books of the odyssey with the postscript not the notes the preface to shakespeare and a few spectators3 and guardians whatever besides i have written or joined in writing with dr swift dr arbuthnot or mr gay the only persons with whom i ever wrote in conjunction are to be found in the four volumes of miscellanies by us published4 i think them too inconsiderable to be separated and reprinted here nevertheless that none of my faults may be imputed to another i must own that of the prose part the thoughts on various subjects at the end of the second volume were wholly mine and of the verses the happy life of a country parson the alley in imitation of spenser the characters of macer artimesia and phryne the verses to mrs martha blount on her birthday and a few epigrams5 it will be but justice to me to believe that nothing more is mine notwithstanding all that has been published in my name or added to my6 miscellanies since 17177 by any bookseller whatsoever

1740 he again inserted them and omitted the words and designed for the press  footnote 3 the messiah was first published in the spectator but as it was also inserted in the quarto of 1717 the poet cannot have included it among the pieces which were not contained in either the first or second volume of his works his only other known contribution to the spectator was a short letter in no 532 nov 10 1712 on the verses which the emperor hadrian spoke when he was dying the few spectators to which pope referred have not been identified and since he never reproduced or particularised them it may be taken for granted that they were of slight importance  footnote 4 in the edition of 1740 pope affixed to this sentence the clause or make part of the memoirs of scriblerus not yet printed his enumeration of the scriblerus among his genuine productions was doubtless the consequence of his resolution to publish it and it accordingly appeared in 1741 in the second volume of his prose works  footnote 5 the passage from i think down to epigrams was left out in 1740 for pope soon admitted into his collected works those pieces in the miscellanies which he here said were too inconsiderable to be reprinted  footnote 6 any in the edition of 1740  footnote 7 he omitted 1717 in 1740 his insinuation that none of the other pieces ascribed to him were genuine is in his ordinary style of

footnotes  footnote 1 the recommendatory poems addressed to pope are without exception dull insipid productions which never rise above mediocrity and sometimes fall below it only those are reprinted here which he himself prefixed to his works the first seven appeared in the quarto of 1717 and the remaining two in the octavo of 1736  footnote 2 legally speaking of buckinghamshire for he would not take the title of buckingham under a fear that there was lurking somewhere or other a claim to that title amongst the connections of the villiers family he was a pompous grandee who lived in uneasy splendour and as a writer most extravagantly overrated accordingly he is now forgotten such was his vanity and his ridiculous mania for allying himself with royalty that he first of all had the presumption to court the princess afterwards queen anne being rejected he then offered himself to the illegitimate daughter of james ii by the daughter of sir charles sedley she was as ostentatious as himself and accepted himde quincey  pope commenced the interchange of praise with the duke of buckingham by celebrating him in the essay on criticism the return verses of the duke are little better than drivelling his essay on satire and essay on poetry are his principal works but though one was retouched by dryden and the other by pope they are very secondrate performances the duke died in february 1721 aged 72  footnote 3 anne wife of heneage fifth earl of winchelsea and daughter of sir william kingsmill she died on aug 5 1720croker  she wrote a tragedy called aristomenes or the royal shepherd to which pope may be supposed to allude in his letter to caryll of dec 15 1713 where he says i was invited to dinner to my lady winchelsea and after dinner to hear a play read at both which i sat in great disorder with sickness at my head and stomach pope omitted her rugged bald prosaic verses in 1736 probably because they were intrinsically worthless and because the name of the author had ceased to carry any weight in 1727 and 1732 they were printed with popes poems in lintots miscellany and doubtless with the sanction of pope himself  footnote 4 these verses with the heading to my friend mr pope on his pastorals originally appeared in 1709 in the same volume of tonsons miscellany which contained the pastorals themselves in the fifth edition of lintots miscellany 1727 and in the sixth edition 1732 the poem of wycherley who was then dead is prefixed to popes pieces and bears the title to mr pope at sixteen years old on occasion of his pastorals this was untrue and seems designed to convey a false idea of popes precocity the lines were not addressed to him till he was twenty as appears from wycherleys letter of may 18 1708 in which he says i have made a compliment in verse upon the printing your pastorals which you shall see when you see me dennis and others accused pope of being the author of the flattering tribute the poet appealed in refutation of the charge to wycherleys letters and added that the first draught and corrected copy of the panegyric which were still extant in the harley library in wycherleys handwriting would show that if they received any alteration from mr pope it was in the omission of some of his own praises documents to which nobody had access proved nothing mr croker considered that there was strong internal evidence from the smoothness of the rhythm the antithetical style and the nature of the commendation that pope must have assisted in reducing the lines to their present shape the mannerism of both authors can be clearly traced in them they have the stamp of wycherley improved by pope  footnote 5 if wycherley had been capable of anything of the kind this and the previous couplet might have been written after the essay on criticism but surely could not have been inspired by a perusal of the manuscript of the pastoralscroker  footnote 6 this line was omitted by pope in 1736  footnote 7 from boileaus art of

demy of magdalen collegecunningham  he graduated ma april 30 1695 and as he could hardly have been an ma before he was twentyfive he would have been fortyfive at the date of these verses there is a rhyming epistle to mr b by mr fr knapp of magdalen college in oxford in tonsons fourth miscellanycroker  he died in or before 1727 for in one of lintots advertisements of that year he is described as the late rev mr francis knapp dean of killala  footnote 10 there are several lines in this copy of verses which could not be endured in a common magazine so much is the public ear and public taste improvedwarton  footnote 11 the next six lines were left out by pope in 1736  footnote 12 hough was chosen president of magdalen college in april 1687 in defiance of the mandate sent by james ii to the fellows requiring them to elect farmer a profligate and a papist the illegal proceedings of the king in dispossessing the protestants and filling the college with romanists alarmed and enraged the country and contributed largely to the revolution of 1688 in may 1690 hough became bishop of oxford he was translated to lichfield and coventry in 1699 and to worcester in 1717 where he remained till his death in may 1743 at the age of ninetythree  footnote 13 by far the most elegant and best turned compliment of all addressed to our author happily borrowed from a fine greek epigram and most gracefully appliedwarton  there is little merit in borrowing a compliment from the anthology and the felicity of its application in the present instance may be questioned notwithstanding the emphatic praise of warton the mythological basis of the lines which is appropriate in the greek becomes childish when adopted by an english poet and the point of the piece which turns upon the assumption that popes translation was vastly superior to the original is too extravagant to be pleasing fenton was a scholar and could not have thought what he said  footnote 14 i would add says dr johnson in his life of parnell that the description of barrenness in his verses to pope was borrowed from secundus but lately searching for the passage which i had formerly read i could not find it the borrowed description is the only tolerable part of the poem which is in a clumsy strain unlike the usual easy style of parnell  footnote 15 he was only son to the lord chancellor harcourt and died in 1720roscoe  footnote 16 it was paying pitiful homage to rank to call an indifferent versifier like the duke of buckingham great sheffield and pretend that he was the instructor and model of pope  footnote 17 the comparison of the three graces admiring the reflection of themselves in popes works to narcissus enamoured of his own face in the stream is a ludicrous conceit and the execution is on a par with the idea  footnote 18 this paragraph refers to popes temple of fame  footnote 19 popes genius was not epic and the only epic poem he composed was his juvenile effort alcander which he burnt because it was too worthless to be preserved  footnote 20 this and the concluding verse are from the temple of fame  footnote 21 these lines first appeared in 1726 in the translation of the odyssey where they were appended by broome to the final note pope inserted them in the 8vo edition of his works in 1736  footnote 22 this was a compliment our author could not take much pleasure in reading for he could not value himself on his edition of shakespearewarton  footnote 23 the comparison on both sides is wanting in truth the superficial researches and meagre notes of pope did not renovate shakespeare and no second raphael has repainted the pictures of raphael the first fitness of praise was a merit which the writers of commendatory verses commonly despised their study was to outvie each other in the grossness and insincerity of their flattery  footnote 24 odyssey lib xvibroome  footnote 25 pope inserted this tribute among the recommendatory poems prefixed to the 8vo edition of his works 1736 lyttelton was not raised to the peerage till november 1757 twentyseven years after the date of his verses  footnote 26 warton prefers fentons verses but in my opinion these lines of lord lytteltons are much superior to all the other recommendatory verses they are as elegant and correct in themselves as the sentiments they convey appear sincere and worthy an ingenuous cultivated and liberal mind there is a small inaccuracy in one or two expressions and perhaps it would have been better if virgils speech which forms the conclusion had been compressedbowles     translations     advertisement   the following translations were selected from many others done by the author in his youth for the most part indeed but a sort of exercises while he was improving himself in the languages and carried by his early bent to poetry to perform them rather in verse than prose mr drydens fables came out about that time1 which occasioned the translations from chaucer they were first separately printed in miscellanies by j tonson and b lintot and afterwards collected in the quarto edition of 1717 the imitations of english authors which are added at the end were done as early some of them at fourteen or fifteen years old but having also got into miscellanies we have put them here together to complete this juvenile volume2  footnotes  footnote 1 in the year 1700 they were the most popular of drydens works and were in the hands of every reader when pope was learning his art  footnote 2 this advertisement was first prefixed by pope to vol iii of his works 8vo 1736 the contents of the juvenile volume were the temple of fame sappho to phaon vertumnus and pomona the fable of dryope the first book of statiuss thebais january and may the wife of baths prologue and the imitations of english poets pope apologises for printing the imitations by saying that they had got into miscellanies which is an insinuation that the pieces had found their way to the press without his consent it was he himself who published them they are inserted in the present edition among the minor poems     the  first book of statius  his  thebais  translated in the year 1703   the translator hopes he need not apologise for his choice of this piece which was made almost in his childhood but finding the version better upon review than he expected from those years he was easily prevailed on to give it some correction the rather because no part of this author at least that he knows of has been tolerably turned into our language1pope  it was in his childhood only that pope could make choice of so injudicious a writer as statius to translate it were to be wished that no youth of genius were suffered ever to look into statius lucan claudian or seneca the tragedianauthors who by their forced conceits by their violent metaphors by their swelling epithets by their want of a just decorum have a strong tendency to dazzle and to mislead inexperienced minds and tastes unformed from the true relish of possibility propriety simplicity and nature statius had undoubtedly invention ability and spirit but his images are gigantic and outrageous and his sentiments tortured and hyperbolical one cannot forbear reflecting on the short duration of a true taste in poetry among the romans from the time of lucretius to that of statius was no more than about one hundred and fortyseven years and if i might venture to pronounce so rigorous a sentence i would say that the romans can boast of but eight poets who are unexceptionably excellentnamely terence lucretius catullus virgil horace tibullus propertius phædrus these only can be called legitimate models of just thinking and writing succeeding authors as it happens in all countries resolving to be original and new and to avoid the imputation of copying become distorted and unnatural by endeavouring to open an unbeaten path they deserted simplicity and truth weary of common and obvious beauties they must needs hunt for remote and artificial decorations  it is plain that pope was not blind to the faults of statius many of which he points out with judgment and truth in a letter to mr cromwell written in 17089 after this censure of statiuss manner it is but justice to add that in the thebais there are many strokes of a strong imagination and indeed the picture of amphiaraus swallowed up suddenly by a chasm that opened in the ground is truly sublimewarton  statius was a favourite writer with the poets of the middle ages his bloated magnificence of description gigantic images and pompous diction suited their taste and were somewhat of a piece with the romances they so much admired they neglected the gentler and genuine graces of virgil which they could not relish his pictures were too correctly and chastely drawn to take their fancies and truth of design elegance of expression and the arts of composition were not their objectt warton  in this translation there are some excellent passages particularly those pointed out by dr wartono father phoebus v 829 and the exquisite lines descriptive of evening twas now the time c 474 but some of the most striking images are omitted some added and some misunderstood let us however confess that the versification is truly wonderful considering the age of the author it would be endless to point out more particularly occasional errors and inaccuracies in a composition which can be considered no otherwise than as an extraordinary specimen of versification before the writers judgment and taste were maturedbowles  according to the information which pope gave to spence he commenced an epic poem at thirteen and wrote four books of about a thousand verses each2 as his taste and judgment improved he discovered the crudeness of his early flights and for a while he almost relinquished his attempts at original composition my first taking to imitating he said was not out of vanity but humility i saw how defective my own things were and i endeavoured to mend my manner by copying good strokes from others3 in my rambles through the poets he said again when i met with a passage or story that pleased me more than ordinary i used to endeavour to imitate it or translate it into english and this gave rise to my imitations published so long after4 in speaking of popes youthful efforts spence uses the word imitation as synonymous with translation some of his first exercises he says were imitations of the stories that pleased him most in ovid or any other poet that he was reading i have one of these original exercises now by me in his own hand it is the story of acis and galatea from ovid and was translated when he was but fourteen years old5 pope appears to have sometimes employed the term imitation with the same latitude and probably meant by it that he endeavoured to imitate in the english turn of expression the distinctive beauties of the original latin or greek in the scattered lessons i used to set myself he said i translated above a quarter of the metamorphoses and that part of statius which was afterwards printed with the corrections of walsh6 the notion in which bowles and others acquiesced that the published translations are a true index of popes skill at fourteen will not bear investigation of the metamorphoses he brought out only two little fragments which appeared many years later when they had undergone a thorough revision the rest of the manuscript would not have been sacrificed if the version had been fit for the public eye without the toil of recasting it spence who possessed the acis and galatea did not think it worth printing as a specimen of popes boyish abilities even when the curiosity respecting his works was at its height the suppression of all his early pieces which had not been submitted to a subsequent renovation is a plain proof of their inferiority the first translation which he gave to the world was the episode of sarpedon from the twelfth and sixteenth books of homers iliads this and his pastorals appeared together in may 1709 in tonsons sixth miscellany and pope was then twentyone  the fragment from homer included the speech of sarpedon to glaucus it has said the poet been rendered in english by sir john denham after whom the translator had not the vanity to attempt it for any other reason than that the episode must have been very imperfect without so noble a part of it denham at that period had a much more brilliant reputation than he afterwards retained and though pope adopted the language of humility he must have felt an inward pride in the consciousness that he had distanced so famous a name his great superiority did not admit of a question and he must have been well aware that it was his interest to invite a comparison the specimen was shown in manuscript to trumbull who in his admiration urged pope to give a complete translation of the iliad the exhortations of trumbull did not bear fruit till 1713 i cannot pope wrote to him in the november of that year deny myself the pleasure of acquainting you how great a proof i have given of my deference to your opinion and judgment which has at last moved me to undertake the translation of homer i can honestly say sir william trumbull was not only the first that put this into my thoughts but the principal encourager i had in it and though now almost all the distinguished names of quality or learning in the nation have subscribed to it there is not one of which i am so proud as of yours when the first volume of the translation appeared in 1715 pope paid his acknowledgments in the preface to the eminent men who had specially patronised the work not only does he make no mention of trumbull but he professes to have yielded to the counsel of a greater authority and says mr addison was the first whose advice determined me to undertake the task either the statement in the preface or the statement in the letter must be inaccurate though both addison and trumbull may have recommended the scheme  the episode of sarpedon is now incorporated in the complete translation to which it led the way it was not till three years after he had published the fragment from homer that pope brought out his translations from the latin of which the most ambitious is his version of the first book of the thebais he told spence that in his boyhood he liked extremely a translation of a part of statius by some very bad hand this work bore the title of an essay upon statius or the five first books of p p statius his thebais done into english verse by thomas stephens london 1648 the verse into which stephens did his author was for the most part rugged and prosaic but a few passages are happily turned and his successor did not disdain to borrow some lines and phrases from him the principal advantage however to pope of stephenss attempt was that it enabled him to interpret the original for his classical education had been defective and it is clear from his own account that he could not without assistance have construed the thebais correctly at eight years of age he was taught his accidence by a priest7 he afterwards went to a couple of small schools where he lost what he had gained from his first instructor8 when i came he said from the last of them all the acquisition i had made was to be able to construe a little of tullys offices9 for a few months he had another priest for his tutor and was then left between twelve and thirteen to his own resources10 the foundation was slight and he proceeded to raise upon it a hasty superstructure i did not he said follow the grammar but rather hunted in the authors for a syntax of my own and then began translating any parts that pleased me particularly in the best greek and latin poets i got the languages by hunting after the stories in the several poets i read rather than read the books to get the language11 he on another occasion told spence that he thought himself the better in some respects for not having had a regular education since it caused him to read for the sense whereas schoolboys were taught to read for words12 the process was fatal to scholarship ignorant in a great degree of the rules and idioms of the latin tongue it was impossible he should translate with ease or accuracy but his peculiar training doubtless favoured the early development of his poetic powers he devoted his boyish years when the mind was most pliable to the cultivation of his art and this incessant practice of versification from childhood was the cause of his precocious excellence  popes admiration for statius continued throughout his later boyhood and he preferred him to all the latin poets by much next to virgil13 he soon began to turn the thebais into english and he affirms that his version of the first book was made in 1703 in a note to his letter to cromwell of jan 22 1709 he placed it earlier still and declares that it was done when the author was but fourteen years old these statements convey an erroneous impression it appears from the correspondence with cromwell that more than onethird of the translation was not in existence by january 1709 when pope was in his twentyfirst year the piece was not published till 1712 when it came out in lintots miscellany and the poet at that period was twentyfour the portions which were not recently translated were newly corrected and the whole represents the powers of the man who completed the task and not of the boy who commenced it  the translation of the first book of the thebais must be more highly estimated as a specimen of versification than as an adequate representation of the original the harmony and phraseology of particular passages are delicious and verse and language throughout are polished in a high degree there is one pervading exception to popes metrical skill he has recourse incessantly to an unnatural order of words and especially he produces his rhymes by placing the verb after the noun it ought to precede of this license dryden says we were whipped at westminster if we used it twice together i should judge him to have little command of english whom the necessity of a rhyme should force upon this rock though sometimes it cannot easily be avoided pope availed himself of the false construction with a freedom which seriously deforms and enfeebles much of his poetry he fell into the error before he had discrimination to perceive the blemish and when his judgment was more mature habit had reconciled him to the distortion  warton has not exaggerated the defects of statius but he has underrated his merits the descriptions in the thebais are vivid and abound in picturesque circumstances and natural traits of character popes translation is more vague his narrative is less perspicuous less dramatic less spirited and less lifelike than the original there are numberless particulars blameworthy in our author pope wrote to cromwell which i have tried to soften in the version14 he was not successful in this attempt where he departs from his text he seldom tempers an extravagance and has more often rejected a beauty or smoothed it down into insipidity his juvenile taste was for polished generalities and he shunned circumstantial nature he had still less relish for primitive simplicity and he thought that some of the incidents in the thebais were too humble to be endured  when statius he says comes to the scene of his poem and the prize in dispute between the brothers he gives us a very mean opinion of itpugna est de paupere regnovery different from the conduct of his master virgil who at the entrance of his poem informs the reader of the greatness of his subject15 pope was led astray by the equivocal meaning of a word there is no connection between the greatness of a kingdom and the greatness of a theme for poetic purposes the poverty of scotland did not detract from the tragic grandeur of macbeth when the fugitive princes in the thebais quarrel in the vestibule where they have taken shelter from the storm and fight with their fists pope confused the narrative by omitting the whole account as inconsistent with epic dignity and sacrificed the characteristics of the original to assimilate the manners to modern usages if his criticisms had been well founded he should yet have kept to his text the sense of an author says dryden is generally speaking to be sacred and inviolable if the fancy of ovid be luxuriant it is his character to be so and if i retrench it he is no longer ovid it will be replied that he receives advantage by this lopping of his superfluous branches but i rejoin that a translator has no such right when a painter copies from the life i suppose he has no privilege to alter features and lineaments under pretence that his picture will look better perhaps the face which he has drawn would be more exact if the eyes or nose were altered but it is his business to make it resemble the original pope has rendered a few passages with equal beauty and truth but on the whole the antique colouring the dramatic traits and picturesque details are very imperfectly preserved  footnotes  footnote 1 this brief

footnotes  footnote 1 dire in the latin sense of illomened  footnote 2 when jupiter had carried off europa her father agenor sent her brother cadmus to seek her and commanded him not to return without his sister unable to find her he settled at thebes and built the city he slew the dragon which guarded a neighbouring well and a portion of the armed men who sprung up from its teeth were reputed to be the ancestors of the thebans  footnote 3 a second legend ascribed the building of the city to the wonderworking music of amphion which caused the stones to pile themselves together both legends were subsequently blended and cadmus had the credit of the upper part of the city and amphion of the lower  footnote 4 juno visited athamas king of thebes with madness and in his frenzy he shot his own son learchus whom he took for a young lion upon this his wife ino who was a daughter of cadmus fled with her second son melicertes and threw herself and her boy into the sea  footnote 5 domitian the panegyric on this timid and cruel tyrant was disgraceful flattery the boasted victories over the dacians were in reality defeats they compelled the emperor to sue for an inglorious peace which was only purchased by the promise of an immediate ransom and an annual tribute most of his pretended triumphs were of a similar character and led pliny the younger to remark that they were always the token of some advantage obtained by the enemies of rome  footnote 6 during the contest between vespasian and vitellius for the empire domitian at the age of eighteen took refuge in the temple of the capitol to escape from the fury of the soldiers opposed to his father it was selfpreservation and not daring which impelled him and when the temple of jupiter was set on fire he again fled and hid himself until the party of vespasian prevailed  footnote 7 this line is very obscure there is nothing corresponding to it in the latin  footnote 8 from the translation of stephens      the time may come when a divinor rage  footnote 9 pope is closer to stephens than to the original                          funeral flames     divided like the souls they carry  the rival brothers ultimately engaged in single combat and both fell the body of polynices was placed by mistake upon the funeral pile of eteocles and the flames rose upwards in diverging currents  footnote 10 stephenss translation      when dirce blushed being stained with grecian blood  footnote 11 the dirce ran on one side of thebes the ismenus on the other and they afterwards united in a common stream both were mere watercourses which were only filled by the rains of winter  footnote 12 the thebans are subsequently represented by statius as driven into the ismenus by the greeks and the hosts which were killed or drowned were carried by the river into the sea  footnote 13 what hero that is of the famous seven who went up against thebes to dispossess eteocles for violating the compact to reign alternately with polynices the five persons whom statius enumerates as joining with polynices and adrastus king of argos are tydeus amphiaraus hippomedon parthenopæus and capaneus  footnote 14 when tydeus had received his deathwound from a javelin hurled by menalippus he gathered up his failing strength and flung a dart by which he mortally wounded menalippus in turn full of revengeful spite tydeus begged that the head of menalippus might be brought to him he grasped it with his dying hand gazed at it with malignant joy gnawed it in his frenzy and refused to relinquish his hold this was the rage of tydeus which statius says the greeks themselves condemned as exceeding the recognised latitude of hate  footnote 15 the prophet was amphiaraus who predicted that all who took part in the expedition except adrastus would be destroyed the earth opened while amphiaraus was fighting and swallowed up him and his chariot statius paints him sinking calmly into the yawning gulf without dropping his weapons or the reins and with his eyes fixed on the heavens  footnote 16 hippomedon is made by statius the hero of the conflict in the river ismenus where he at last succumbs to the god of the river the piles of dead formed a dike which turned back the waters  footnote 17 parthenopæuspope  footnote 18 he declared that jupiter himself should not keep him from ascending the walls of thebes jupiter punished his defiance by setting him on fire with lightning on the scaling ladder and he was burnt to death  footnote 19 oedipus did not strike his wounds he struck the ground which was the usage in invoking the infernal deities since their kingdom was in the bowels of the earth  footnote 20 one of the three principal furies or avengers of crime who inhabited the world of condemned spirits  footnote 21 the great difference between raising horror and terror is perceived and felt from the reserved manner in which sophocles speaks of the dreadful incest of oedipus and from the manner in which statius has enlarged and dwelt upon it in which he has been very unnaturally and injudiciously imitated by dryden and lee who introduce this most unfortunate prince not only describing but arguing on the dreadful crime he had committedwarton  footnote 22 laius king of thebes warned by the oracle that he would be killed by his own offspring exposed his son oedipus on mount cithæron the infant was found by a shepherd and carried to polybus king of corinth who adopted him arrived at mans estate he too was informed by the oracle that he would take the life of his father and commit incest with his mother believing that the king and queen who brought him up were his parents he determined not to go back to corinth and in attempting to avert his destiny he fulfilled it as he journeyed towards thebes he met his real father laius and slew him in a conflict which grew out of a dispute with his charioteer  footnote 23 or the temple at delphi where oedipus went to consult the oracle  footnote 24 the sphinx sat upon a rock near thebes propounding a riddle to every one who passed by and destroying all who were unable to explain it the thebans proclaimed that whoever would rid the kingdom of this scourge should marry the widow of laius and succeed to the vacant throne oedipus by solving the riddle drove the sphinx to commit suicide and in accepting the reward he unconsciously verified the remainder of the oracle  footnote 25 oedipus behaves with the fury of a blustering bully instead of that patient submission and pathetic remorse which are so suited to his conditionwarton  footnote 26 in the first edition he had written      which shall oer long posterity prevail  the more forcible phrase which he substituted for long posterity was from drydens virg Æn iii 132      and childrens children shall the crown sustain  footnote 27 this couplet follows closely the translation of stephens      put on that diadem besmeared with gore     which from my fathers head these fingers tore  footnote 28 drydens virg Æn iii 78      broke evry bond of nature and of truth  footnote 29 pope uses preventing in the then common but now obsolete sense of anticipating  footnote 30 a river in the lower world  footnote 31 great is the force and the spirit of these lines down to verse 183 and indeed they are a surprising effort in a writer so young as when he translated them see particularly lines 150 to 160warton  footnote 32 the entrance to the infernal regions was said to be through a cave in the tænarian promontory which formed the southern extremity of greece  footnote 33 pope has judiciously tamed the bombast image caligantes animarum examine campos the plains darkened with a swarm of ghosts lucentes equos he translates fair glories omitting the image entirely to mount atlas he has added an idea which makes the passage more ridiculous than sublime it is poorly expressed in the original in the translation it is ludicrous and shook the heavens and gods he bore there are many images which if indistinctly seen are sublime if particularised they become quite the contrary however the translation is certainly wonderful when the age of the author is considered it shows his powers of metrical language at so early a period of his poetical studies though it is very unfaithful in particular passagesbowles  footnote 34 popes acquaintance with latin prosody from his confined education was probably very small or he would not have used malea instead of malea with the line of statius before himbowles  footnote 35 wellknown because the fury had before visited the theban palace to instigate the crimes and passions of which it had been the scene the haste with which she goes and her preference for the terrestrial journey even over the haunts of her own tartarus indicate the signal malevolence of the mission hence the delight she takes in it  footnote 36 the original is more forcible and less extravagant the sunken eyes of the fury glared with a light like that of redhot ironferrea lux  footnote 37 this expression which is not in statius is common with dryden as in his virg Æn x 582      and from strymonius hewed his better hand  footnote 38 statius depicts the frenzied virulence of the fury by saying that she lashed the air with the serpent pope has marred the description by representing the lashing of the air as the act of the serpent itself  footnote 39 after ino had drowned herself and her son melicertes they became marine divinities and their names were changed to leucothea and palæmon statius is more picturesque than pope when the apparition of the fury announced terrible evils to come the sea was stirred to its depths on the outburst of the tempest palæmon was sailing about on the back of a dolphin and it was then that his mother snatched him up in her alarm and pressed him to her bosom to convey an idea of the tremendous nature of the storm statius says that the corinthian isthmus could hardly resist the violence of the waves which dashed against each of its shores this circumstance is justly styled by pope most extravagantly hyperbolical but a translator should not have omitted it  footnote 40 a great image and highly improved from the original assueta nubewarton  the first edition had a feeble prosaic line in place of the image which warton admired      headlong from thence the fury urged her flight     and at the theban palace did alight  footnote 41 ruptæque vices in the original which pope translates and all the ties of nature broke but by vices is indicated the alternate reign of the two brothers as ratified by mutual oaths and subsequently violated by eteoclesde quincey  footnote 42 the felicities of this translation are at times perfectly astonishing and it would be scarcely possible to express more nervously or amply the words                          jurisque secundi     ambitus impatiens et summo dulcius unum     stare loco  than by popes couplet which most judiciously by reversing the two clauses gains the power of fusing them into connectionde quincey  footnote 43 bound is an improper verb as applied to steers besides the simile is not exactly understood there is nothing about reins or bounding in the original what is meant is that the steers do not draw even pope confounded the image of the young bullocks with that of a horse and he therefore introduces reins and boundingbowles  footnote 44 for armour wait the first edition had arms did wait  footnote 45 charger is used in its old sense of a dish  footnote 46 statius to point the folly of the criminal ambition goes on to represent that the contest was only for naked unadorned dominion in a povertystricken kingdoma battle for which should cultivate the barren territory on the banks of a petty streamand for this empty privilege the brothers sacrificed everything which was of good report in life or death pope weakened the moral of statius and the lines which follow to the end of the paragraph are also very inferior in force to the original  footnote 47 in the first edition      not all those realms could for such crimes suffice  pope might have done more to improve this prosaic couplet  footnote 48 pope borrowed from the translation of stephens                            how wast thou lost     in thine own joys proud tyrant then when all     about thee were thy slaves  footnote 49 it should be discontentedwarton  footnote 50 this couplet was interpolated by pope and seems to have been suggested by his hostility to the revolution of 1688 nor does statius call the populace vile or say that they are always discontented or that they are still prone to change though still the slaves of state neither does he say that they are sure to hate the monarch they have but he says that their custom is to love his successor which is a sentiment more in accordance with experience  footnote 51 exiled because the king who was not reigning had to leave the country during his brothers year of power  footnote 52 the warriors who were the produce of the dragons teeth sown by cadmus fought among themselves till only five were left  footnote 53 unrivalled as the context shows is not here a term of commendation but merely signifies that the monarch had no equal in rank or power  footnote 54 placido quatiens tamen omnia vultu is the common reading i believe it should be nutu with reference to the word quatienspope  footnote 55 pope was manifestly unable to extract any sense from the original it is there said that jupiter at his first entrance seats himself upon his starry throne but that the other gods did not presume to sit down protinus that is in immediate succession to jupiter and interpreting his example as a tacit license to do so until by a gentle wave of his hand the supreme father signifies his express permission to take their seats in popes translation the whole picturesque solemnity of the celestial ritual melts into the vaguest generalitiesde quincey  de quincey was mistaken in his inference that pope was unable to understand the passage for he had the assistance of the translation of stephens which gives the meaning correctly                                  anon     he sets him down on his bespangled throne     the rest stand and expect not one presumed     to sit till leave was beckoned  footnote 56 the winds would have been inconvenient members of a deliberative assembly if they had taken to howling whistling and sighing nevertheless their propensity to blow was so inveterate that in statius they are only kept quiet by their fear of jove  footnote 57 our author is perpetually grasping at the wonderful and the vast but most frequently falls gradually from the terrible to the contemptiblewarton  by our author warton meant statius and the expression he criticised as hyberbolical was the eluded rage of jovean exaggeration for which pope alone was responsible  footnote 58 hiera one of the Æolian islands in the neighbourhood of sicily was supposed to be the workshop of vulcan the island was volcanic and the underground noises were ascribed to vulcan and his assistants the cyclopes as they plied their trade the circumstance that the fires of the Æolian forge were exhausted was doubtless introduced by statius because in his day the eruptions had ceased in hiera  footnote 59 agave the daughter of cadmus her son pentheus appeared among the women who were celebrating the bacchic revelries on mount cithæron and his mother mistaking him in her frenzy for a wild beast like a wild beast tore him to pieces  footnote 60 there is no mention of the direful banquet in the original the savage hunter alludes to athamas chasing and slaying his son under the delusion that he was a lion  footnote 61 the king of argos  footnote 62 tantalus king of argos invited the gods to a banquet and served up the boiled flesh of his own son pelops  footnote 63 phoroneus was commonly reputed to have been the founder of the city of argos  footnote 64 juno employed argus to keep guard over io transformed by jupiter into a cow mercury being sent by jupiter to rescue io lulled argus to sleep by melodious airs on the flute and then cut off his head  footnote 65 an oracle announced to acrisius king of argos that he would die by the hands of his grandson the king endeavoured to escape his fate by imprisoning his daughter danae in a brazen tower but jupiter obtained access to her in the shape of a shower of gold and she became the mother of perseus who fulfilled the prediction according to the established legendary usage  footnote 66 the force of this taunt is weakened in popes translation by the change from the second person to the third as though the invectives of juno had not been addressed to jupiter himself  footnote 67 jupiter visited semele the daughter of cadmus in all the majesty of the thunderer and she was consumed by the lightning  footnote 68 homer makes juno say that there are three cities preeminently dear to herargos sparta and mycenæ samos had no less title to the distinction it was one of the localities which contended for the renown of having given her birth and was with argos the principal seat of her worship virgil ranks samos second among the places she delighted to honour  footnote 69 the river alpheus which takes its rise in arcadia loses itself underground in parts of its course and again reappears this suggested the fiction that it ran in a subterranean channel below the bottom of the sea to the fountain of arethusa in sicily where it once more emerged to day pope had less regard to the text of statius than to drydens translation of virgils lines on the same legend in ecl x 5      so may thy silver streams beneath the tide     unmixed with briny seas securely glide  footnote 70 the arcadians celebrated the worship of jupiter with human sacrifices  footnote 71 he was king of pisa in elis where was the celebrated olympia with its temple of jupiter oenomaus had ascertained from an oracle that he would perish by the agency of his soninlaw and he was anxious in selfdefence to keep his daughter hippodamia from marrying as he possessed the swiftest horses in the world he required her suitors to contend with him in a chariotrace which allowed them no chance of success the prize of victory was to be his daughter the penalty of defeat was death and the bones which laid unburied in the neighbourhood of jupiters temple were those of the lovers of hippodamia  footnote 72 the cretans claimed to possess both the birthplace and burialplace of jupiter  footnote

for the isthmus of corinth is full five miles over and he calls the introduction of the circumstance a geographical error it was his own geography that was at fault the width of the isthmus is only three miles and a half pope spoilt the incident when he transferred it to the scironian rock sciron was a robber and murderer who compelled his victims to wash his feet upon the cliff and while they were engaged in the operation he kicked them over into the sea  footnote 83 we have scarcely in our language eight more beautiful lines than these down to human care ver 481warton  footnote 84 pope owed some happy expressions to the translation of stephens                    the silent world does view     her airy chariot pearled with drops of dew  footnote 85 he again borrowed from stephens

the kingdom of the sky  footnote 87 showers is an inappropriate word to denote the deluge of rain which flooded the earth and swept herds and hinds and houses to the main  footnote 88 the inachus and the erasinus were rivers in the plain of argos  footnote 89 the waters of the lerna were infected by the venom from the serpent hydra which hercules slew  footnote 90 the storm by blowing down trees or branches made an opening in the dense foliage through which the sun had never penetrated  footnote 91 in the first edition      the prince with wonder did the waste behold     while from torn rocks

bore houses herds and labring hinds away  footnote 94 statius represents polynices as terrified by the tempest pope appears to have thought that this was derogatory to the character of the fugitive king and he calls him when gazing on the ravages caused by the storm the intrepid theban which conveys the impression that he was undaunted by the spectacle in the same spirit pope at ver 527 has the line thus still his courage with his toils increased where the original says that the stimulus which urged him on was fear but while pope has obliterated the alarm which was generated by the tempest he has introduced in its place an alarm which had no existence in the midst of the havoc worked by the elements the recollection of his brother wings the feet of the intrepid theban with fears though he is beyond his brothers reach and has no suspicion at present that he designs to break the compact to reign alternately the influence which the remembrance of eteocles exercised over the mind of the wanderer is expressly distinguished by statius from the fear and means no more than that since polynices was an exile from thebes he was compelled to proceed onwards till he could find an asylum in another state  footnote 95 a mountain on which stood the citadel of argos  footnote 96 the temple at prosymna was dedicated to juno  footnote 97 pope took the expression from dryden virg Æn vii 79

incapable of interpretation before it was fulfilled  footnote 100 calydon of which his father oeneus was king  footnote 101 the mode in which the two fugitives became known to the king and gained admission to the palace is not told by pope who has left upwards of seventy lines untranslated and by the mutilation rendered the incidents improbable polynices reaches the palace first and lies down worn out on the pavement of the vestibule tydeus arrives at the same spot and polynices is unwilling that he should share the shelter a quarrel ensues and from words they proceed to blows the king is disturbed by the uproar he issues forth from the palace with attendants and torches to ascertain the cause explanations follow and these result in tydeus and polynices becoming the guests of adrastus there is an odd account pope says to cromwell of an unmannerly battle at fistycuffs between the two princes on a very slight occasion and at a time when one would think the fatigue of their journey in so tempestuous a night might have rendered them very unfit for such a scuffle this i had actually translated but was very ill satisfied with it even in my own words to which an author cannot but be partial enough of conscience  footnote 102 before the victory of hercules over the nemean lion he is said by statius to have worn the skin of a lion which he slew in the neighbourhood of mount temessus  footnote 103 horror at the thought of the dreadful forebodings which had been suggested by the literal language of the oracle glad because of the manner in which the prediction was verified jortin in a note on another passage of the thebais says statius could not help falling into his beloved fault of joining contraries together he is too apt to seek this opposition in his words he never indeed misses this favourite figure when he can bring it in  footnote 104 firm for confirm was sanctioned by the frequent example of dryden from whose translation of virg Æn viii 107 pope has borrowed the entire couplet      but oh be present to thy peoples aid     and firm the gracious promise thou hast made  footnote 105 in the first edition this verse was an alexandrine ending with and wake the sleeping fires which pope took from dryden virg Æn viii 720      and on his altars waked the sleeping fires  footnote 106 fry was the reading of all the editions till that of 1736 when fly was substituted by an evident error of the press and has been retained ever since  footnote 107 tutress in the first edition acestis had been the nurse and was now the duenna of the two daughters of adrastus  footnote 108 the gorgon medusa changed every one who saw her to stone perseus avoided the penalty by only looking at her reflection in a mirror as he cut off her head while she slept being the grandson of a king of argos he was an argive hero whence his triumph was engraved upon the royal goblet the artist had selected the moment when perseus is darting into the air with the head of the gorgon which newly separated from the body still retained the traces of expiring life  footnote 109 on account of the beauty of ganymede jove sent an eagle to convey him from the earth to the habitations of the gods there he was appointed cupbearer which rendered the incident appropriate to a drinkingvessel  footnote 110 he has omitted some forcible expressions of the original septematristerentemnigrocentum per jugeraall of them picturesque epithetswarton  statius says that the huge serpent while alive encircled delphi seven times with its dark coils and that when dead and barely unrolled its body spread over a hundred acres  footnote 111 the water was not itself poisonous but it turned to venom in the serpent  footnote 112 stephens is more literal and at the same time more poetical                      earth prepares thy room     garnished with flowry beds and thatched above     with oaken leaves close woven whilst the grove     lends bark to make thy garments

descendants had reigned for some generations the throne was seized by danaus  footnote 117 death cutting off the fatal thread with a scythe is not a very sublime or congruous image pope has blended modern ideas with classical in the original it is ense metitmows with his sword pope has introduced a scythe to preserve more accurately the metaphor but it has a bad effectbowles  footnote 118 choroebus  footnote 119 statius states that choroebus withdrew having obtained his end and says nothing of his being unwilling by which pope seems to mean that he was unwilling to accept his life this deviation from the original destroys the generous heroism of choroebus for if he was weary of his existence there was no merit in his braving death statius indeed had previously said that apollo granted choroebus the sad boon of life out of admiration for his magnanimity but this phrase only signifies that life is sorrowful and not that choroebus would have preferred to die  footnote 120 some of the most finished lines he has ever written down to verse 854warton  footnote 121 apollo was specially worshipped by the lycians  footnote 122 the celebrated fountain sacred to apollo on parnassus  footnote 123 apollo was surnamed the cynthian from mount cynthus in the island of delos which was the place of his birth and the most revered of all the localities set apart for his worship the island which had previously floated over the ocean was according to one version of the legend rendered stationary by jupiter when apollo was born according to another version it was subsequently fixed by apollo himself  footnote 124 the walls of troy were the work of apollo and neptune  footnote 125 in the first edition it was      thou dost the seeds of future wars foreknow  footnote 126 the phrygian was marsyas who contended on the flute against apollo with his lyre when the umpires decided in favour of the god he flayed marsyas for his presumption  footnote 127 tityus assaulted the mother of apollo and her son shot the offender  footnote 128 niobe because she had seven sons and seven daughters thought herself superior to latona who had only one son and one daughterapollo and diana these divinities in revenge destroyed the fourteen children of niobe  footnote 129 in the first edition      he views his food would taste yet dares not try     but dreads the mouldring rock that trembles from on high  apollo intrigued with coronis the daughter of phlegyas her enraged father retaliated by firing the temple of apollo and was consigned for his rebellion to perpetual torture in the infernal regions his terror lest the impending rock should crush him is a circumstance interpolated by pope from virgils description of the punishment of pirithous and ixion and the expression mouldring rock is taken from drydens translation of the passage Æn vi 816      high oer their heads a mouldring rock is placed     that promises a fall and shakes at evry blast  the revolting nature of the food itself is the reason assigned by statius why phlegyas forebore to partake of it and preferred to endure the pangs of hunger  footnote 130 after apollo in the later mythology had been identified with the sun all the names personifying the sun of which titan was one became applicable to apollo  footnote 131 diodorus maintained that the osiris of the egyptians was their god of the sun and statius has adopted this erroneous view according to the statement of herodotus osiris answered to the grecian bacchus and there is little doubt that the old historian was right  footnote 132 mithras was the persian god of the sun he was worshipped in caves or as pope has it in hollow rocks because the spherical form of the cave symbolised the universe of which mithras was the maker the blaze of light which adorns his head in popes version makes no part of the description in the original the final line is explained by several ancient works of art in which a man wearing a phrygian cap is depicted cutting the throat of a bull he has flung to the ground the man is said by an old scholiast on statius to typify the sun the bull the moon and the intention he states is to represent the superiority of the sun over the moon statius speaks of the bull as indignant at being compelled to follow mithrasan idea which suits ill with the tranquil aspect of the moon as it floats through the heavens     translations  from  ovid   great is the change in passing from statius to ovid from force to facility of style from thoughts and images which are too much studied and unnatural to such as are obvious careless and familiar ovid seems to have had the merit of inventing this beautiful species of writing epistles under feigned names it is a high improvement on the greek elegy to which its dramatic form renders it much superior the judgment of the writer must chiefly appear by opening the complaint of the person introduced just at such a period of time as will give occasion for the most tender sentiments and the most sudden and violent turns of passion to be displayed ovid may perhaps be blamed for a sameness of subjects in these epistles of his heroines and his epistles are likewise too long which circumstance has forced him into a repetition and languor in the sentiments on the whole the epistle before us is translated by pope with faithfulness and with elegance and much excels any dryden translated in the volume he published several of which were done by some of the mob of gentlemen that wrote with easethat is sir c scrope caryll pooly wright tate buckingham cooper and other careless rhymers lord somers translated dido to Æneas and ariadne to theseus though i regret the hours our poet spent in translating ovid and statius yet it has given us an opportunity of admiring his good sense and judgment in not suffering his taste and style in his succeeding works to be infected with the faults of these two writerswarton  warton says the judgment of the writer must chiefly appear by opening the complaint of the person introduced at such a period of time as will give occasion for the most tender sentiments how beautifully is this displayed in popes epistle to abelard a poem that has another most interesting circumstance which ovid appears as well as our drayton to have neglectedi mean the introduction of appropriate and descriptive imagery which relieves and recreates the fancy by the pictures and by the landscapes which accompany the characters ovid in this epistle seems not insensible to the effect of the introduction of such scenes and the leucadian rock the antra nemusque the aquatic lotus the sacred pellucid fountain and particularly the genius of the place the naiad addressing the despairing sappho which circumstance pope has beautifully imitated and improved in eloisa are in the genuine spirit of poetical taste dr warton observes that this translation is superior to any of drydens if indeed we compare popes translations with those of any other writer their superiority must be strikingly apparent there is a finish in them a correctness a natural flow and a tone of originality added to a wonderful propriety and beauty of expression and language if he ever fails it is where he generalises too much this is particularly objectionable where in the original there is any marked distinct and beautiful picture so ver 253 pope only says      cupid for thee shall spread the swelling sail  whereas in ovid cupid appears before us in the very act of guiding the vessel seated as the pilot and with his tender hand tenerâ manu contracting or letting flow the sail i need not point out another beauty in the originalthe repetition of the word ipsebowles  richardson has appended this note to the epistle of sappho to phaon in his copy of the quarto of 1717 corrected by the first copy written out elegantly as all his mss to show friends with their remarks in the margin the present reading for the most part the effect of them the remarks in the margin are mere exclamations such as pulchre bene optime recte bella paraphrasis longe præstas scrope meo judicio minus placet c they are doubtless from the pen of cromwell since it appeals from popes letter to him on june 10 1709 that he had jotted down the same phrases on the margin of the translation of statius bowles having quoted the observation of warton that he had seen compositions of youths of sixteen years old far beyond the pastorals in point of genius and imagination adds i fear not to assert that he never could have seen any compositions of boys of that age so perfect in versification so copious yet so nice in expression so correct so spirited and so finished as the translation of the epistle of sappho to phaon the remark was made by bowles in the belief that the version was the production of the poets fourteenth year pope himself records on his manuscript that it was written first 1707 he was then nineteen and when the epistle was published in 1712 in tonsons ovid he was twentyfour  ovid says dryden often writ too pointedly for his subject and made his persons speak more eloquently than the violence of their passions would admit passion is sometimes highly eloquent feeling strongly it expresses itself forcibly and dryden meant that the characters in ovid by their numerous strokes of studied brilliancy seemed to be carried away less by their emotions than by the ambition to shine these glittering artifices were formerly called wit and dryden complains that ovid is frequently witty out of season but they are not wit in our present sense of the word occasionally they are the farfetched or affected prettinesses which are properly called conceits and more commonly they consist in terse antithesis and a sparkle of words produced by the balanced repetition of a phrase they are often as appropriate as they are showy and if they are among the blemishes they are conspicuous among the beauties of ovid his writings are marked by opposite qualities he is sometimes too artificial in his expression of the passions and sometimes he is natural glowing and pathetic he abounds in pointed sentences and is not less distinguished for the easy spontaneous flow of his language he is at once prolix and concise indulging in a single vein of thought till the monotony becomes tedious and yet enunciating his ideas with sententious brevity the condensation of the latin in many places cannot be preserved in the diffuser idioms of our english tongue but if we overlook a few weak couplets pope has translated the epistle of sappho to phaon with rare felicity and notwithstanding the inevitable loss of some happy turns of expression he has managed to retain both the passion and the poetry effusions of sentiment were better adapted to his genius than the heroic narrative of the thebais and his limpid measure which neither resembled the numerous and robuster verse of statius nor was suited to an epic theme accorded with the sweetness and uniformity of ovids verse and with the outpourings of grief and tenderness which are the staple of these epistolary strains there is no ground for the regret of warton that pope should have spent a little time in translating portions of ovid and statius it would be as reasonable to lament that he stooped to the preliminary discipline which made him a poet he has related that he did not take to translation till he found himself unequal to original composition and like all who excel in any department he learnt by copying his predecessors to rival them     sappho to phaon1       say lovely youth2 that dost my heart command     can phaons eyes forget his sapphos hand     must then her name the wretched writer prove     to thy remembrance lost as to thy

female fears submit to female fires     to rocks and seas i fly from phaons hate                           205     and hope from seas and rocks a milder fate     ye gentle gales beneath my body blow

distant seas must tender sappho fly34     thy charms than those may far more powrful be                      220     and phoebus self is less a god to me35     ah canst thou doom me to the rocks and

not so closely copied from scrope is decidedly inferior to the text      i burn i burn as when fierce whirlwinds raise     the spreading flames and crackling harvests blaze  footnote 5 a childish

sent to prey upon man and beast in the dominions of cepheus to atone for her mothers vanity and rid the land of the scourge cepheus agreed to offer up andromeda to the monster she was chained to a rock on the coast where perseus saw her at the critical moment when she was about to be devoured captivated by her charms he engaged and slew the monster and made andromeda his wife  footnote 10 this

who truly love remember allbowles  footnote 11 this line is another of the embellishments which pope engrafted on the original  footnote 12 the first line of this couplet is faulty in point of versification and to use our bards own remark ten low words creep in one dull line as to the last line it is wholly redundant and has no place in the originalruffhead  footnote 13 in the original

lines the remark of cromwell remains true  footnote 19 ruffhead observes that this line is superior to the original      aspice quam sit in hoc multa litura loco  which he thinks flat and languid but the simplicity of the appeal to the blot on her paper is admirable and should be only mentioned as a fact the imitator has destroyed the whole beauty of the line by a quaint antithesis and a laboured arrangement of words which are not natural in affliction scropes translation again excels popes      my constant falling tears the paper stain     and my weak hand etcbowles  footnote 20 the parenthesis is an interpolation says a note transcribed by richardson from popes manuscript and the remark is equally applicable to the next line  footnote 21 in the first edition      no gift on thee thy sappho could confer  the original couplet in the ms was      no pledge you left me faithless and unkind     nothing with me but wrongs was left behind  jejune flat and ill expressed is written

30 the sappho of ovid only says that she laid down upon the bank worn out with weeping pope is answerable for the extravagant conceit of her swelling the flood with her tears in the next verse pope calls the naiad a watery virginan expression which borders on the ludicrous  footnote 31 there was a promontory in acarnania called leucate on the top of which was a little temple dedicated to apollo in this temple it was usual for despairing lovers to make their vows in secret and afterwards to fling themselves from the top of the precipice into the sea for it was an established opinion that all those who were taken up alive would be cured of their former passion sappho tried the remedy but perished in the experimentfawkes  footnote 32 aleæus arrived at the promontory of leucate that very evening in order to take the leap on her account but hearing that her body could not be found he very generously lamented her fall and is said to have written his 215th ode on that occasionwarton  the entire story was probably a legend  footnote 33 these two lines have been quoted as the most smooth and mellifluous in our language and they are supposed to derive their sweetness and harmony from the mixture of so many iambics pope himself preferred the following line to all he had written with respect to harmony      lo where mæotis sleeps and hardly flowswarton  dryden in his annus mirabilis

art all the gods to me  another version ran thus      wouldst thou return oh more than phoebus fair     no god like thee could ease thy sapphos care  footnote 36 liked seems a very unsuitable

pleasing with him fled     is gone and with him your delights are fled  footnote 38 of ver 242 and v 244 pope says in the ms so at first as printed but objected against as tautological sic recte as in the margin but carried afterwards as at first sighs was thought to be too nearly synonymous with prayers and pope altered the lines by erasing the expressions no sighs and my sighs and affixing the epithet tender in both verses to numbers  footnote 39 in the ms      oh when shall kinder more auspicious gales     waft to these eyes thy longexpected sails  pleonasm says a note on the manuscript kinder and more auspicious too much  footnote 40 this image is very inferior to the original as it is more vague and general the picture in the original is strikingly beautiful the circumstances which make it so are omitted by pope      ipse gubernabit residens in puppe cupido       ipse dabit tenera vela legetque manubowles  the objection of bowles would not have applied to the manuscript where this admirable couplet which pope unwisely omitted follows the lines in the text      shall take the rudder in his tender hand     and steer thee safe to this forsaken land  there is a second but inferior rendering      shall sit presiding on the painted prore     and steer thy ship to this forsaken shore  cromwell applied the words of horace quæ desperat nitescere posse relinquit which seems intended to intimate that it was impossible to give a poetical translation of the original pope deferred to the mistaken criticism     the fable of dryope1  from the ninth book of ovids metamorphoses

fragrant myrtles crowned     these shades unknowing of the fates she sought     and to the naiads flowry garlands brought     her smiling babe a pleasing charge she pressed     within her arms and nourished at her breast                         20     nor distant far a watry lotos grows     the spring was new and all the verdant boughs     adorned with blossoms promised fruits that vie     in

found     her stiffning feet were rooted in the ground                        40     in vain to free her fastened feet she strove     and as she struggles only moves above     she feels th encroaching

chaucer   this translation was done at sixteen or seventeen years of agepope  the story of january and may now before us is of the comic kind and the character of a fond old dotard betrayed into disgrace by an unsuitable match is supported in a lively manner pope has nowhere copied the free and easy versification and the narrative style of drydens fables so happily as in this pleasant tale he has endeavoured suitably to familiarise the stateliness of our heroic measure but after all his pains this measure is not adapted to such subjects so well as the lines of four feet or the french numbers of fontaine fontaine is in truth the capital and unrivalled writer of comic tales he generally took his subjects from boccacio poggius and ariosto but adorned them with so many natural strokes with such quaintness in his reflections and such a dryness and archness of humour as cannot fail to excite laughter our prior has happily caught his manner in many of his lighter tales particularly in hans carvel of the tale before us mr tyrwhitt gives the following accountthe scene of the merchants tale is laid in italy but none of the names except damian and justin seem to be italian but rather made at pleasure so that i doubt whether the story be really of italian growth the adventure of the peartree i find in a small collection of latin fables written by one adolphus in elegiac verses of his fashion in the year 1315 this fable has never been printed but once and in a book not commonly to be met with whatever was the real original of this tale the machinery of the fairies which chaucer has used so happily was probably added by himself and indeed i cannot help thinking that his pluto and proserpine were the true progenitors of oberon and titania or rather that they themselves have once at least deigned to revisit our poetical system under the latter names in the history of english poetry this is said to be an old lombard story but many passages in it are evidently taken from the polycraticon of john of salisbury de molestiis et oneribus conjugiorum secundum hieronymum et alios philosophoset de pernicie libidiniset de mulieris ephesinæ et similium fide and by the way about forty verses belonging to this argument are translated from the same chapter of the polycraticon in the wife of baths prologue in the meantime it is not improbable that this tale might have originally been oriental a persian tale is just published which it extremely resembles and it has much of the allegory of an eastern apologuewarton  in the art of telling a story in verse pope is peculiarly happy we almost forget the grossness of the subject of this tale while we are struck by the uncommon ease and readiness of the verse the suitableness of the expressions and the spirit and happiness of the whole i think dr warton injudiciously censures the verse which appears to me to be very suitably employed pope has introduced triplets in many places no doubt for greater effect which they certainly have there is generally two together ended with an alexandrine this is common in drydens fables on which pope evidently formed his style in these narrative pieces when i say that dr warton injudiciously objects to the verse it should be remembered that there is a mockelevation in the speeches descriptions c of this story and even poetry in the fairy revels for which the versification pope has chosen is more proper than it would be for priors burlesque and less poetical ribaldry the mixture of classical and gothic imagery such as chaucer uses in making pluto and proserpine instead of spirits like oberon and titania the king and queen of the yellowskirted fays is very common in our early poets who derived the combination from the old romances and ovidbowles  when dryden published his version of some of chaucers tales he gave in his preface an excellent account of the characteristics of the original as chaucer he said is the father of english poetry so i hold him in the same degree of veneration as the grecians held homer or the romans virgil he is a perpetual fountain of good senselearned in all sciences and therefore speaks properly on all subjects he must have been a man of a most wonderful comprehensive nature because as it has been truly observed of him he has taken into the compass of his canterbury tales the various manners and humours as we now call them of the whole english nation in his age not a single character has escaped him all his pilgrims are severally distinguished from each other and not only in their inclinations but in their very physiognomies and persons i see them as perfectly before metheir humours their features and their very dressas distinctly as if i had supped with them at the tabard in southwark the matter and manner of their tales and of their telling are so suited to their different educations humours and callings that each of them would be improper in any other mouth even the grave and serious characters are distinguished by their several sorts of gravity their discourses are such as belong to their age their calling and their breedingsuch as are becoming of them and of them only some of his persons are vicious and some virtuous some are unlearned or as chaucer calls them lewd and some are learned even the ribaldry of the low characters is different the reeve the miller and the cook are several men and distinguished from each other as much as the mincing lady prioress and the broadspeaking gaptoothed wife of bath we have our forefathers and great granddames all before us as they were in chaucers days their general characters are still remaining in mankind and even in england though they are called by other names than those of monks and friars and canons and lady abesses and nuns for mankind is ever the same and nothing lost out of nature though everything is altered there were two classes of readers who exclaimed against the attempt to renovate the originalthose who held that it was too bad to be reproduced and those who considered it too excellent to be remodelled without being spoiled i find writes dryden some people are offended that i have turned these tales into modern english because they think them unworthy of my pains and look on chaucer as a dry oldfashioned wit not worth reviving i have often heard the late earl of leicester say that mr cowley himself was of that opinion who having read him over at my lords request declared he had no taste of him being shocked perhaps with his old style he never examined into the depth of his good sense chaucer i confess is a rough diamond and must first be polished ere he shines but there are other judges who think i ought not to have translated him into english out of a quite contrary notion they suppose there is a certain veneration due to his old language and that it is little less than profanation and sacrilege to alter it they are further of opinion that somewhat of his good sense will suffer in the transfusion and much of the beauty of his thoughts will infallibly be lost which appear with more grace in their old habit of this opinion was the earl of leicester who valued chaucer as much as mr cowley despised him dryden replied that his version was only intended for those to whom the original was unintelligible and while allowing that the original was superior to the copy he contended that the copy was to be preferred to a blank if he had confined himself simply to modernising his author there would have been little force in his plea the phraseology of chaucer is readily mastered and any departure from his words destroys a large part of the charm there is a native simplicity in the mediæval works of genius which pleases like the artless manners of children but which would be as ridiculous in a modern dress as the manners of the child in a grownup person nor must we overlook the superior interest which attaches to the notions usages and characters of our ancestors when the picture is painted by themselves a copy in which costumes and colouring have been completely changed is but an adulterate representation the antique peculiarities and primitive freshness are gone the real justification of drydens undertaking was not that his version was a substitute for the original but that it was a glorious supplement little as he scrupled to assert his own merits he could not press this argument to its full extent though he was evidently conscious of the truth he states that as the old poet was occasionally diffuse and more often undignified he had curtailed the redundancies and rejected the trivialities he did not stop at the easy office of omission i dare he says to add that what beauties i lose in some places i give to others which had them not originally if i have altered chaucer anywhere for the better i must at the same time acknowledge that i could have done nothing without him facile est inventis addere is no great commendation and i am not so vain to think i have deserved a greater in dramatic power and pathos which are chaucers strongest points dryden has not improved upon him but upon the whole he has narrated the tales in a higher strain of poetry in richer and more felicitous language and with the addition of many new and happy ideas a few short examples will show the nature of the changes he introduced into numerous passages in the process of recasting them the wife of baths tale commences with these lines      in olde dayes of the king arthour     of which that britains speken great honour     all was this land fulfillèd of fairie     the elfqueen with her jolly company     dancèd full oft in many a greene mead     this was the old opinion as i read     i speak of many hundred year ago     but now can no man see none elves mo     for now the greate charity and prayers     of limitours and other holy freres     that seeken every land and every stream     as thick as motes in the sunnebeam     blessing halls chambers kitchenes and bowers     cities and boroughs castles high and towers     thorpes and barnes sheepnes and daieries     that maketh that there be no faieries  this is one of the prettiest pieces of verse in the canterbury tales dryden has expanded and excelled it      in days of old when arthur filled the throne     whose acts and fame to foreign lands were blown     the king of elfs and little fairy queen     gambolled on heaths and danced on every green     and where the jolly troop had led the round     the grass unbidden rose and marked the ground     nor darkling did they dance the silver light                   of phoebe served to guide their steps aright                   and with their tripping pleased prolonged the night          her beams they followed where at full she played               nor longer than she shed her horns they stayed                 from thence with airy flight to foreign lands conveyed         above the rest our britain held they dear                      more solemnly they kept their sabbaths here                    and made more spacious rings and revelled half the year       i speak of ancient times for now the swain                    returning late may pass the woods in vain                     and never hope to see the nightly train                                                 for priests with prayers and other godly gear     have made the merry goblins disappear     and where they played their merry pranks before     have sprinkled holy water on the floor     and friars that through the wealthy regions run     thick as the motes that twinkle in the sun     resort to farmers rich and bless their halls     and exorcise the beds and cross the walls     this makes the fairy choirs forsake the place     when once tis hallowed with the rites of grace  he sometimes carries his innovations further and the splendour of his paraphrase entirely eclipses the primitive idea chaucer says in the tale of the nuns priest that          swevens be but vanities and japes     men dream all day of owles and of apes     and eke of many a mase therewithall     men dream of thinges that never be shall  chaucers hint which is scarcely more than if the speaker had said in plain prose i have no faith in dreams for they are wild visions which never come true is transformed by dryden into this exquisite passage      dreams are but interludes which fancy makes     when monarchreason sleeps this mimic wakes     compounds a medley of disjointed things     a mob of cobblers and a court of kings     light fumes are merry grosser fumes are sad     both are the reasonable soul run mad     and many monstrous forms in sleep we see     that neither were nor are nor eer can be     sometimes forgotten things long cast behind     rush forward in the brain and come to mind     the nurses legends are for truths received     and the man dreams but what the boy believed     sometimes we but rehearse a former play           the night restores our actions done by day        as hounds in sleep will open for their prey    among the characteristics of the poor parson chaucer mentions that      he was a shepherd and no mercenary  which is the only warrant the text afforded for these beautiful lines in the paraphrase of dryden      the prelate for his holy life he prized     the worldly pomp of prelacy despised     his saviour came not with a gaudy show     nor was his kingdom of the world below     patience in want and poverty of mind                  these marks of church and churchmen he designed        and living taught and dying left behind               the crown he wore was of the pointed thorn     in purple he was crucified not born     they who contend for place and high degree     are not his sons but those of zebedee  having gained so much from the masculine and buoyant genius of dryden the newly fashioned tales took their rank as independent works and were rather valued for their want of resemblance to chaucer than because they were a true reflection of him there are defects in the modern version the language is sometimes too colloquial and there are many careless lines but in the main the verse bounds and dances along with equal strength facility and grace exhibiting one of the most wonderful specimens in literature of the power spirit and abundance of the simplest english when moulded by a master the flower and the leaf which might have been written in the fairy land it describes is preeminent above the rest for its bright unceasing flow of delicious poetry for its chaste yet luxuriant diction for its sustained and various melody for its lovely pictures both earthly and ethereal for its pure refined and elevating sentiment  by drydens fables says johnson which had then been not long published and were much in the hands of poetical readers pope was tempted to try his own skill in giving chaucer a more fashionable appearance and put january and may and the prologue of the wife of bath into modern english january and may which the poet says was translated when he was sixteen or seventeen was not published till he was nearly twentyone having first appeared on may 2 1709 in the sixth volume of tonsons miscellany he imitated dryden in abridging chaucer but his only addition of any moment to the merchants tale is in the description of the fairies which was borrowed from dryden himself his attempt was substantially limited to epitomising the original in refined language and musical numbers in this he succeeded and more could not be expected of a youth if he had aspired higher he could not at twenty have competed with his mighty predecessor drydens tales are the productions of a great poetic genius the january of pope is the production of a clever versifier the relative position which their respective translations of chaucer occupy in their works accords with the difference in their execution the adaptations of dryden are commonly numbered among his choicest effusions the versions of pope hold a subordinate place among his writings and are hardly taken into account in the estimate of his powers the result vindicates the opinion of lord leicester that in the conversion of chaucer into modern english the loss exceeds the gain pope was not insensible to the dramatic qualities of his author i read him still he said to spence with as much pleasure as almost any of our poets he is a master of manners of description and the first taleteller in the true enlivened natural way but in polishing him something of the nature and liveliness was inevitably obliterated he was in many of his stories an admirable novelist in verse and he adopted a familiar style which permitted him to relate in rhyme with the freedom of prose the common talk of common men his traits are in the highest degree colloquial individual and lifelike and his strong strokes are weakened and his dramatic vivacity tamed down when he is turned into smooth harmonious elegant poetry the refinement in the form is not a compensation for the sacrifices in the substance especially when the antique form is itself essential to teach us how our forefathers spoke thought and acted five hundred years ago every touch which renders the picture more modern makes it less true the translation of pope is skilfully executed but it is inferior in raciness and interest to an original which can be read by any educated englishman a few gratuitous defects have been imported into the modernised january and may chaucer says dryden followed nature everywhere but was never so bold to go beyond her pope has sometimes overstepped the limits he has here and there exaggerated his original and the truth and keeping of the characters are invariably injured by the change  i have confined my choice said dryden to such tales of chaucer as savour nothing of immodesty if i had desired more to please than to instruct the reeve the miller the shipman the merchant the sumner and above all the wife of bath in the prologue to her tale would have procured me as many friends and readers as there are beaus and ladies of pleasure in town but i will no more offend against good manners i am sensible as i ought to be of the scandal i have given by my loose writings and make what reparation i am able by this public acknowledgment both the pieces which pope selected were among the number which dryden put under a ban and the younger poet perhaps considered that when he had purified them from part of their coarseness the objection would no longer apply the apology which chaucer urged for his plain speaking was that in telling a tale he must repeat it correctly and not surrender truth to delicacy yet if a man replies dryden should have enquired of him what need he had of introducing such characters where obscene words were proper in their mouths but very indecent to be heard i know not what answer he could have made none was possible the offence nevertheless was not what dryden assumes the same chaucer who in his carefulness to keep to nature will have all his dramatis personæ talk according to their rank and callings assuredly did not violate nature when he represented the religious and refined prioress together with the other highbred and decorous members of the party as willing auditors of the broad and uncompromising language of their ruder companions the presence of ladies and ecclesiastics was not the slightest check upon the tongues of the pilgrims and it is evident that in ordinary social life there was hardly any limit to the freedom of expression but in every age a latitude is allowed in conversation which would be condemned in books and chaucer merely excused himself for recording in poetry the common colloquial terms of his day usage had rendered them inoffensive and in themselves they argued no more impurity of thought than the equivalent circumlocutions of our own generation the greater or less plainness of speech which has prevailed at different eras is often rather a question of manners than of morality if pope or dryden had retained in this particular the phraseology of chaucer the adherence to the letter of the original would have completely falsified its spirit just as words which are uttered with innocence by rustics in a cottage would be an evidence of the utmost depravity when spoken by a man of education in a drawingroom the intention influences the effect and the grossness of our early writers has not the taint to a reader of the present day which would attach to similar language when employed by corrupt minds in civilized times all the expurgations of pope were insufficient to make his version as little exceptionable in the eighteenth century as was the original of chaucer to the world of the fourteenth century a merchant in the reign of queen anne would not have ventured to recite the modernised story in a mixed company where ladies like the prioress and the nuns were present the tone of the work is even lowered in places in the looser literature of popes youth and especially in comedies adultery in a wife only furnished food for laughter against the husband this is the aspect which is imparted to the translation of january and may and it cannot be denied that chaucer himself in some of his other stories is open to the charge of treating vice as a jest but he did not fall into the error in the merchants tale where the supposed narrator in accordance with his character reprobates the criminal conduct of the treacherous squire and the faithless wife at the same time that he exposes the doating folly of the amorous knight     january and may  or the  merchants tale       there lived in lombardy as authors write     in days of old a wise and worthy knight     of gentle manners as of genrous race     blest with much sense1 more riches and some grace     yet led astray by venus soft delights                                 5     he scarce could rule some idle

pleasures of a lawful bed     this was his nightly dream his daily care                           15     and to the heavnly powrs his constant prayer     once ere he died to taste the blissful life

theme on which they all declaimed     some praised with wit and some with reason blamed     till what with proofs objections and replies     each wondrous positive and wondrous wise     there fell between his brothers a debate                            145     placebo this was called and justin that       first to the knight placebo thus begun     mild were his looks and pleasing was his tone     such prudence sir in all your words appears     as plainly proves experience dwells with years                     150     yet you pursue sage solomons advice     to work by counsel when affairs are nice     but with the wise mans leave i must protest       so may my soul arrive at ease and rest               as still i hold your own advice the best                           155       sir i have lived a courtier all my days     and studied men their manners and their ways     and have observed this useful maxim still     to let my betters always have their will     nay if my lord affirmed that black was white                       160     my word was this your honours in the right     th assuming wit who deems himself so wise     as his mistaken patron to advise     let tirm

declining days     indulge the vigour of your mounting blood     and let grey fools be indolently good     who past all pleasure damn the joys of sense     with revrend dulness and grave impotence17                       175       justin who silent sat and heard the man     thus with a philosophic frown began       a heathen author18 of the first degree     who though not faith had sense as well as we     bids us be certain our concerns to trust                             180     to those of genrous principles and just     the ventures greater ill presume to say     to give your person than

this world much less in womankind     but if her virtues prove the larger share     bless the kind fates and think your fortune rare     ah gentle sir take warning of a friend     who knows too well the state you thus commend                       195     and spite of all its praises must declare     all he can find is bondage cost and care     heavn knows i shed full many a private tear     and sigh in silence lest the world should hear     while all my friends applaud my blissful life                       200     and swear no mortals happier in a wife     demure and chaste as any vestal nun     the meekest creature that beholds the sun     but by th immortal powers i feel the pain     and he that smarts has reason to complain                           205     do what you list for me

                      210     would busy the most vigrous of us all     and trust me sir the chastest you can chuse     will ask observance and exact her dues     if what i speak my noble lord offend     my tedious sermon here is at an end21                             215       tis well tis wondrous well the knight replies     most worthy kinsman faith youre mighty wise     we sirs are fools and must resign the cause     to heathnish authors proverbs and old saws     he spoke with scorn and turned another way                       220     what does my friend my dear placebo say       i say quoth he by heavn the mans to blame     to slander wives and wedlocks holy name       at this the council rose without delay     each in his own opinion went his way                              225     with full consent that all disputes appeased     the knight should marry when and where he pleased       who now but january exults with joy     the charms of wedlock all his soul employ     each nymph by turns his wavring mind possessed                     230     and reigned the shortlived tyrant of his breast     whilst fancy pictured evry lively part     and each bright image wandered oer his heart     thus in some public forum fixed on high     a mirror shows the figures moving by                                235     still one by one in swift succession pass     the gliding shadows oer the polished glass     this ladys charms the nicest could not blame     but vile suspicions had aspersed her fame     that was with sense but not with virtue blest                     240     and one had grace that wanted all the rest     thus doubting long what nymph he should obey     he fixed at last upon the youthful may     her faults he knew not love is always blind     but evry charm revolved within his mind                            245     her tender age her form divinely fair     her easy motion her attractive air     her sweet behaviour her enchanting face     her moving softness and majestic grace22       much in his prudence did our knight rejoice                       250     and thought no mortal could dispute his choice23     once more in haste he summoned evry friend     and told them all their pains were at an end24     heavn that said he inspired me first to wed     provides a consort worthy of my bed                                 255     let none

i may possess alone     the lovely prize and share my bliss with none                      265     if you my friends this virgin can procure     my joys are full my happiness is sure       one only doubt remains full oft ive heard     by casuists grave and deep divines averred     that tis too much for human race to know                            270     the bliss of heavn above and earth below     now should the nuptial pleasures prove so great     to match the blessings of the future state     those endless joys were ill exchanged for these     then clear this doubt and set my mind at ease27                  275       this justin heard nor could his spleen controul     touched to the quick and tickled at the soul     sir knight he cried if this be all your dread     heavn put it past your doubt wheneer you wed     and to my fervent prayers so far consent                            280     that ere the rites are oer you may repent     good heavn no doubt the nuptial state approves     since it chastises still what best it loves       then be not sir abandoned to despair          seek and perhaps youll find among the fair                       285     one that may do your business to a hair          not evn in wish your happiness delay     but prove the scourge to lash you on your way     then to the skies your mounting soul shall go     swift as an arrow soaring

would soon comply     the old have intrest ever in their eye     nor was it hard to move the ladys mind     when fortune favours still the fair are kind29       i pass each previous settlement and deed                          305     too long for me to write or you to read     nor will with quaint impertinence display     the pomp the pageantry the proud array30     the time approached to church the parties went     at once with carnal and devout intent31                           310     forth came the priest and bade th obedient wife     like sarah or rebecca lead her life     then prayed the powrs the fruitful bed to bless     and made all sure enough with holiness       and now the palacegates are opened wide                         315     the guests appear in order side by side                   and placed in state the bridegroom and the bride32      the breathing flutes soft notes are heard around     and the shrill trumpets mix their silver sound     the vaulted roofs with echoing music ring                           320     these touch the vocal stops and those the trembling string     not thus amphion tuned the warbling lyre     nor joab the sounding clarion could inspire     nor fierce theodomas33 whose sprightly strain     could swell the soul to rage and fire the martial train            325       bacchus himself the nuptial feast to grace     so poets sing was present on the place     and lovely venus goddess of delight               shook high her flaming torch in open sight         and danced around and smiled on evry knight                      330     pleased her best servant would his courage try     no less in wedlock than in liberty     full many an age old hymen had not spied     so kind a bridegroom or so bright a bride     ye bards renowned among the tuneful throng                          335     for gentle lays and joyous nuptial song     think not your softest numbers can display     the matchless glories of this blissful day     the joys are such as far transcend your rage     when tender youth has wedded stooping age                           340       the beauteous dame sate smiling at the board     and darted amrous glances at her lord     not hesters self whose charms the hebrews sing     eer looked so lovely on her persian king     bright as the rising sun in summers day                           345     and fresh and blooming as the month of may     the joyful knight surveyed her by his side     nor envied paris with his spartan bride     still as his mind revolved with vast delight     th entrancing raptures of th approaching night                    350     restless he sate invoking evry powr     to speed his bliss and haste the happy hour     mean time the vigrous dancers beat the ground     and songs were sung and flowing bowls went round     with odrous spices they perfumed the place                         355     and mirth and pleasure shone in evry face       damian alone of all the menial train     sad in the midst of triumphs sighed for pain     damian alone the knights obsequious squire     consumed at heart and fed a secret fire                            360     his lovely mistress all his soul possest     he looked he languished and could take no rest     his task performed he sadly went his way     fell on his bed and loathed the light of day     there let him lie till his relenting dame                           365     weep in her turn and waste in equal flame       the weary sun as learned poets write     forsook th horizon and rolled down the light     while glittring stars his absent beams supply     and nights dark mantle overspread the sky                          370     then rose the guests and as the time required     each paid his thanks and decently retired       the foe once gone our knight prepared t undress     so keen he was and eager to possess     but first thought fit th assistance to receive                     375     which grave physicians scruple not to give     satyrion near with hot eringos stood     cantharides to fire the lazy blood     whose use old bards describe in luscious rhymes     and critics learnd explain to modern times                         380       by this the sheets were spread the bride undressed     the room was sprinkled and the bed was blessed34     what next ensued beseems not me to say35     tis sung he laboured till the dawning day     then briskly sprung from bed with heart so light                  385     as all were nothing he had done by night               and sipped his cordial as he sat upright               he kissed his balmy spouse with wanton play     and feebly sung a lusty roundelay36     then on the couch his weary limbs he cast                           390     for evry labour must have rest at last       but anxious cares the pensive squire oppressed     sleep fled his eyes and peace forsook his breast     the raging flames that in his bosom dwell     he wanted art to hide and means to tell                            395     yet hoping time th occasion might betray     composed a sonnet to the lovely may     which writ and folded with the nicest art     he wrapped in silk and laid upon his heart       when now the fourth revolving day was run                         400     twas june and cancer had received the sun     forth from her chamber came the beauteous bride     the good old knight moved slowly by her side     high mass was sung they feasted in the hall37     the servants round stood ready at their call                        405     the squire alone was absent from the board     and much his sickness grieved his worthy lord     who prayed his spouse attended with her train     to visit damian and divert his pain38     th obliging dames obeyed with one consent                          410     they left the hall and to his lodging went     the female tribe surround him as he lay     and close beside him sat the gentle may     where as she tried his pulse he softly drew     a heaving sigh39 and cast a mournful view                        415     then gave his bill and bribed the powrs divine     with secret vows to favour his design40       who studies now but discontented may     on her soft couch uneasily she lay     the lumpish husband snored away the night                           420     till coughs awaked him near the morning light     what then he did ill not presume to tell     nor if she thought herself in heavn or hell     honest and dull in nuptial bed they lay     till the bell tolled and all arose to pray                         425       were it by forceful destiny decreed     or did from chance or natures power proceed     or that some star with aspect kind to love     shed its selectest influence from above     whatever was the cause the tender dame                              430     felt the first motions of an infant flame     received th impressions of the lovesick squire     and wasted in the soft infectious fire     ye fair draw near let mays example move     your gentle minds to pity those who love                            435     had some fierce tyrant in her stead been found     the poor adorer sure had hanged or drowned     but she your sexs mirrour free from pride     was much too meek to prove a homicide41       but to my tale some sages42 have defined                        440     pleasure the sovreign bliss of humankind     our knight who studied much we may suppose     derived his high philosophy from those     for like a prince he bore the vast expense     of lavish pomp and proud magnificence                              445     his house was stately his retinue gay     large was his train and gorgeous his array     his spacious garden made to yield to none     was compassed round with walls of solid stone     priapus could not half describe the grace                            450     though god of gardens of this charming place     a place to tire the rambling wits of france     in long descriptions and exceed romance     enough to shame the gentlest bard that sings     of painted meadows and of purling springs43                      455       full in the centre of the flowry ground            a crystal fountain spread its streams around          the fruitful banks with verdant laurels crowned       about this spring if ancient fame say true     the dapper elves their moonlight sports pursue                      460     their pigmy king and little fairy queen44     in circling dances gambolled on the green     while tuneful sprites a merry concert made     and airy music warbled through the shade       hither the noble knight would oft repair                          465     his scene of pleasure and peculiar care     for this he held it dear and always bore     the silver key that locked the garden door     to this sweet place in summers sultry heat     he used from noise and busness to retreat                          470     and here in dalliance spend the livelong day     solus cum sola with his sprightly may     for whateer work was undischarged abed     the duteous knight in this fair garden sped       45but ah what mortal lives of bliss secure                     475     how short a space our worldly joys endure     o fortune fair like all thy treachrous kind     but faithless still and wayring as the wind     o painted monster formed mankind to cheat     with pleasing poison and with soft deceit                          480     this rich this amrous venerable knight     amidst his ease his solace and delight     struck blind by thee resigns his days to grief     and calls on death the wretchs last relief46       the rage of jealousy then seized his mind                         485     for much he feared the faith of womankind47     his wife not suffered from his side to stray        was captive kept he watched her night and day       abridged her pleasures and confined her sway        full oft in tears did hapless may complain                          490     and sighed full oft but sighed and wept in vain     she looked on damian with a lovers eye     for oh twas fixed she must possess or die     nor less impatience vexed her amrous squire     wild with delay and burning with desire                            495     watched as she was yet could he not refrain     by secret writing to disclose his pain     the dame by signs revealed her kind intent     till both were conscious what each other meant       ah gentle knight what would thy eyes avail                      500     though they could see as far as ships can sail     tis better sure when blind deceived to be     than be deluded when a man can see48       argus himself so cautious and so wise     was overwatched for all his hundred eyes                          505     so many an honest husband may tis known     who wisely never thinks the case his own       the dame at last by diligence and care     procured the key her knight was wont to bear     she took the wards in wax before the fire                           510     and gave th impression to the trusty squire     by means of this some wonder shall appear     which in due place and season you may hear     well sung sweet ovid in the days of yore     what sleight is that which love will not explore                   515     and

damian straight a sign she made                    535     to haste before the gentle squire obeyed     secret and undescried he took his way     and ambushed close behind an arbour lay       it was not long ere january came     and hand in hand with him his lovely dame                          540     blind as he was not doubting all was sure     he turned the key and made the gate secure       here let us walk he said observed by none     conscious of pleasures to the world unknown     so may my soul have joy as thou my wife                             545     art far the dearest solace of my life     and rather would i chuse by heavn above     to die this instant than to lose thy love51     reflect what truth was in my passion shown         when unendowed i took thee for my own                            550     and sought no treasure but thy heart alone         old as i am and now deprived of sight               whilst thou art faithful to thy own true knight      nor age nor blindness rob me of delight            each other loss with patience i can bear                            555     the loss of thee is what i only fear       consider then my lady and my wife     the solid comforts of a virtuous life     as first the love of christ himself you gain     next your own honour undefiled maintain                            560     and lastly that which sure your mind

thoughts engage     and joined to them my own unequal age54                           570     from thy dear side i have no powr to part     such secret transports warm my melting heart     for who that once possessed those heavnly charms     could live one moment absent from thy arms       he ceased and may with modest grace replied                      575     weak was her voice as while she spoke she cried     heavn knows with that a tender sigh she drew     i have a soul to save as well as you     and what no less you to my charge commend     my dearest honour will to death defend                             580     to you in holy church i gave my hand     and joined my heart in wedlocks sacred band     yet after this if you distrust my care     then hear my lord and witness what i swear       first may the yawning earth her bosom rend                        585     and let me hence to hell alive descend55     or die the death i dread no less than hell     sewed in a sack and plunged into a well56     ere i my fame by one lewd act disgrace     or once renounce the honour of my race                              590     for know sir knight of gentle blood i came     i loath a whore and startle at the name     but jealous men on their own crimes reflect     and learn from thence their ladies to suspect     else why these needless cautions sir to me                        595     these doubts and fears of female constancy     this chime still rings in evry ladys ear     the only strain a wife must hope to hear       thus while she spoke a sidelong glance she cast     where damian kneeling worshipped as she passed57                600     she saw him watch the motions of her eye     and singled out a peartree planted nigh58     twas charged with fruit that made a goodly show     and hung with dangling pears was evry bough     thither th obsequious squire addressed his pace                    605     and climbing in the summit took his place     the knight and lady walked beneath in view     where let us leave them and our tale pursue       twas now the season when the glorious sun     his heavnly progress through the twins had run                     610     and jove exalted his mild influence yields     to glad the glebe and paint the flowry fields     clear was the day and phoebus rising bright     had streaked the azure firmament with light     he pierced the glittring clouds with golden streams                615     and warmed the womb of earth with genial beams       it so befel in that fair morning tide           the fairies sported on the garden side             and in the midst their monarch and his bride       so featly tripped the lightfoot ladies round                      620     the knights so nimbly oer the greensward bound                  that scarce they bent the flowrs or touched the ground59      the dances ended all the fairy train     for pinks and daisies searched the flowry plain     while on a bank reclined of rising green                            625     thus with a frown the king bespoke his queen       tis too apparent argue what you can     the treachery you women use to man     a thousand authors have this truth made out     and sad experience leaves no room for doubt                         630       heavn rest thy spirit noble solomon     a wiser monarch never saw the sun     all wealth all honours the supreme degree     of earthly bliss was well bestowed on thee     for sagely hast thou said of all mankind                           635     one only just and righteous hope to find     but shouldst thou search the spacious world around     yet one good woman is not to be found       thus says the king who knew your wickedness     the son of sirach60 testifies no less                             640     so may some wildfire on your bodies fall     or some devouring plague consume you all     as well you view the lecher in the tree     and well this honourable knight you see     but since hes blind and old a helpless case                       645     his squire shall cuckold him before your face       now by my own dread majesty i swear     and by this awful sceptre which i bear     no impious wretch shall scape unpunished long     that in my presence offers such a wrong                             650     i will this instant undeceive the knight     and in the very act restore his sight     and set the strumpet here in open view                a warning to these ladies61 and to you             and all the faithless sex for ever to be true                     655       and will you so replied the queen indeed       now by my mothers soul it is decreed             she shall not want an answer at her need           for her and for her daughters ill engage     and all the sex in each succeeding age                              660     art shall be theirs to varnish an offence     and fortify their crimes with confidence     nay were they taken in a strict embrace     seen with both eyes and pinioned on the place     all they shall need is to protest and swear                         665     breathe a soft sigh and drop a tender tear62     till their wise husbands gulled by arts like these     grow gentle tractable and tame as geese       what though this slandrous jew this solomon     called women fools and knew full many a one                        670     the wiser wits of later times declare     how constant chaste and virtuous women are     witness the martyrs who resigned their breath     serene in torments unconcerned in death63     and witness next what roman authors tell                            675     how arria portia and lucretia fell       but since the sacred leaves to all are free     and men interpret texts why should not we     by this no more was meant than to have shown         that sovreign goodness dwells in him alone                         680     who only is and is but only one64                  but grant the worst shall women then be weighed     by evry word that solomon has said     what though this king as ancient story boasts     built a fair temple to the lord of hosts                            685     he ceased at last his maker to adore     and did as much for idol gods or more     beware what lavish praises you confer     on a rank lecher and idolater     whose reign indulgent god says holy writ                           690     did but for davids righteous sake permit     david the monarch after heavns own mind     who loved our sex and honoured all our kind       well im a woman and as such must speak     silence would swell me and my heart would break                    695     know then i scorn your dull authorities     your idle wits and all their learned lies     by heavn those authors are our sexs foes     whom in our right i must and will oppose       nay quoth the king dear madam be not wroth                     700     i yield it up but since i gave my oath     that this much injured knight again should see     it must be donei am a king said he     and one whose faith has ever sacred been       and so has mine she said i am a queen                           705     her answer she shall have i undertake     and thus an end of all dispute i make     try when you list and you shall find my lord     it is not in our sex to break our word65       we leave them here in this heroic strain                          710     and to the knight our story turns again     who in the garden with his lovely may     sung merrier than the cuckoo or the jay     this was his song oh kind and constant be     constant and kind ill ever prove to thee                          715       thus singing as he went at last he drew     by easy steps to where the peartree grew     the longing dame looked up and spied her love     full fairly perched among the boughs above     she stopped and sighing oh good gods she cried                  720     what pangs what sudden shoots distend my side     oh for that tempting fruit so fresh so green     help for the love of heavns immortal queen     help dearest lord and save at once the life     of thy poor infant and thy longing wife66                        725       sore sighed the knight to hear his ladys cry     but could not climb and had no servant nigh     old as he was and void of eyesight too     what could alas a helpless husband do     and must i languish then she said and die                         730     yet view the lovely fruit before my eye     at least kind sir for charitys sweet sake     vouchsafe the trunk between your arms to take     then from your back i might ascend the tree     do you but stoop and leave the rest to me                          735       with all my soul he thus replied again     id spend my dearest blood to ease thy pain     with that his back against the trunk he bent     she seized a twig and up the tree she went       now prove your patience gentle ladies all                        740     nor let on me your heavy anger fall     tis truth i tell though not in phrase refined     though blunt my tale yet honest is my mind     what feats the lady in the tree might do     i pass as gambols never known to you                                745     but sure it was a merrier fit she swore     than in her life she ever felt before       in that nice moment lo the wondring knight     looked out and stood restored to sudden sight     straight on the tree his eager eyes he bent                         750     as one whose thoughts were on his spouse intent     but when he saw his bosomwife so dressed     his rage was such as cannot be expressed     not frantic mothers when their infants die     with louder clamours rend the vaulted sky                           755     he cried he roared he stormed he tore his hair     death hell and furies what dost thou do there       what ails my lord the trembling dame replied     i thought your patience had been better tried     is this your love ungrateful and unkind                           760     this my reward for having cured the blind     why was i taught to make my husband see     by struggling with a man upon a tree     did i for this the powr of magic prove     unhappy wife whose crime was too much love                         765       if this be struggling by this holy light     tis struggling with a vengeance quoth the knight     so heavn preserve the sight it has restored     as with these eyes i plainly saw thee whored     whored by my slaveperfidious wretch may hell                      770     as surely seize thee as i saw too well       guard me good angels cried the gentle may     pray heavn this magic work the proper way     alas my love tis certain could you see     you neer had used these killing words to me                        775     so help me fates as tis no perfect sight     but some faint glimmring of a doubtful light       what i have said quoth he i must maintain     for by th immortal powrs it seemed too plain       by all those powrs some frenzy seized your mind                780     replied the dame are these the thanks i find             wretch that i am that eer i was so kind                 she said a rising sigh expressed her woe     the ready tears apace began to flow     and as they fell she wiped from either eye                           785     the drops for women when they list can cry       the knight was touched and in his looks appeared     signs of remorse while thus his spouse he cheered     madam tis past and my short anger oer     come down and vex your tender heart no more                        790     excuse me dear if aught amiss was said     for on my soul amends shall soon be made     let my repentance your forgiveness draw     by heavn i swore but what i thought i saw       ah my loved lord twas much unkind she cried                   795     on bare suspicion thus to treat your bride     but till your sights established for awhile     imperfect objects may your sense beguile     thus when from sleep we first our eyes display      the balls are wounded with the piercing ray                        800     and dusky vapours rise and intercept the day       so just recovring from the shades of night                     your swimming eyes are drunk with sudden light                  strange phantoms dance around and skim before your sight       then sir be cautious nor too rashly deem                         805     heavn knows how seldom things are what they seem     consult your reason

with that she leaped into her lords embrace     with welldissembled virtue in her face     he hugged her close and kissed her oer and oer     disturbed with doubts and jealousies no more     both pleased and blessed renewed their mutual vows                815     a fruitful wife and a believing spouse       thus ends our tale whose moral next to make     let all wise husbands hence example take     and pray to crown the pleasure of their lives     to be so well deluded by their wives67                            820  footnotes  footnote 1 pope in this particular has not followed chaucer the story is told by the merchant who announces in the prologue that he has been two months married and that in this brief space he has endured more misery from the fiendishness of his wife than a bachelor could undergo in an entire lifetime from the enmity of the world he lays it down for a general maxim that      we wedded men live in sorwe and care     assay it whoso will and he shall find     that i say sooth by saint thomas of inde     as for the more part i say not all     god shielde that it shoulde so befall  the host begs that since the merchant knows so much of the trials of matrimony he will instruct the company in some of them      gladly quoth he but of mine owne sore     for sorry heart i telle may no more  he accordingly relates the adventures of january and may in illustration of the misfortunes of the wedded state and commences with the panegyric of january upon its unmixed blessings the merchant then adds      thus said this olde knight that was so wise  which is an ironical comment on what the narrator of the tale considers a delusive dream and a proof of the credulous folly of the speaker the idea of ascribing genuine sense and wisdom to the knight notwithstanding that he was weak enough at the age of sixty to marry a girl is confined to the version of pope and is not in itself unnatural but the character upon the whole is better preserved in chaucer since the entire talk and conduct of january indicate a feeble mind  footnote 2 courage in the original is not used in the modern sense but signifies a hearty desire  footnote 3      and when that he was passed sixty year     were it for holiness or for dotage     i cannot say but such a great courage     hadde this knight to be a wedded man     that day and night he doth all that he can     taspye where that he might wedded be     praying our lord to grante him that he     might ones knowen of that blissful life     that is betwixt a husband and his wife  footnote 4 in the original      and certainly as sooth as god is king     to take a wife it is a glorious thing     and namely when a man is old and hoar     then is a wife the fruit of his tresor  this is another instance that the merchants remarks are sarcastic for no rational person would gravely assert that to wed was especially wise in old age when a man was married for his money alone the whole purport of the tale was to prove that such an alliance ended in discomfiture the vein of satire is continued through the subsequent reflections the merchant represents january as imagining wives to be models of obedience and fidelity who will cleave to a husband through weal and woe and will never be weary of loving and serving him though he is bedridden all his days the example of may to which the description is a preface shows that the praises are meant to be interpreted in an adverse sense  footnote 5 in the original the merchant is quoting an invective against wives from the liber aureolus of theophrastus who had long been dead hence the narrator calls down a curse upon his bones in the name of the advocates of matrimony      this entent and an hundred sithe worse     writeth this man there god his bones curse  sithe signifies times pope has generalised the imprecation and extended it to all bards living or deceased whereby the fitness of invoking a curse upon their bones is destroyed  footnote 6 chaucer would have thought it an anomaly for a christian knight to invoke the heathen deities the original is      a wife ah sainte mary benedicite     how might a man have any adversite     that hath a wife certes i cannot say  the requirements of the metre in this and other passages of chaucer show that benedicite was sometimes contracted in the pronunciation to bencite  footnote 7 the merchant in his account of the motives which actuated the knight dilates more largely in the original and in more enthusiastic language upon the felicity of marriage a wife helps her husband in his work is the careful guardian of his property and is perfect in her submission      she saith nought ones nay when he saith ye     do this saith he all ready sir saith she  consequently the married man      upon his bare knees ought all his life     thanken his god that him hath sent a wife  and if he is not yet possessed of the treasure he ought to pray without ceasing that it may be vouchsafed him for then he is established in safety and      may not be deceived as i guess  from the praise of wives the merchant speaking the views of the knight proceeds to extol the trustworthy advice of women in general and his first instance is rebecca who instructed jacob how to supplant esau the reasoning is purposely rendered inconsistent and the assertion that a married man was secured against deception is immediately followed by an example in which the husband was deluded by the stratagem of the wife  footnote 8      lo judith as the story telle can     by wise counsel she goddes people kept     and slew him holofernes while he slept     lo abigail by good counsel how she     saved her husband nabal when that he     should have been slain  the respite that abigail obtained for nabal was very short he died by a judgment from heaven in about ten days from the time that she went forth to meet david and with presents and persuasions diverted him from his purpose as he was advancing to take vengeance on her husband the striking narrative in the apocryphal book of judith is undoubtedly fabulous the pretended judith was a widow the deceptions by which she is said to have got the captain of the assyrian army into her power are abhorrent to our purer morality but they would have been considered legitimate stratagems of war in the east  footnote 9 dryden juvenal vi 640      the rest are summoned on a point so nice  footnote 10 in chaucer the knight does not ask his friends to choose for him because many heads are wiser than one but because with several people on the look out there is more likelihood that a suitable wife will be found quickly than if he was unassisted in the search  footnote 11 in the original      but one thing warn i you my friendes dear     i will none old wife have in no manere  marriages seem to have taken place in those days at a very early age the wife of bath married at twelve and the knights notion of an old wife it appears five lines further on was a woman of twenty he insists that he will marry nobody that is above sixteen      she shall not passe sixteene year certain     old fish and young flesh that would i have full fain     bet is quoth he a pike than a pikerel     and bet than old beef is the tender veal  bet is for better  footnote 12 chaucers knight assigns it as a motive to wedlock that he may have      children to thonour of god above     and not only for paramour and for love  but a little before he had given a more worldly reason for his desire to have a son and heir and said that he would rather be eaten by dogs than that his inheritance should go to a stranger  footnote 13 the flippancy of this couplet which departs from the original is at variance with the tone of the knight whose speech commenced with the words                   friendes i am hoar and old     and almost god wot at my pittes brink     upon my soule somewhat must i think     i have my body folily dispended     blessed be god that it shall be amended  in the passage for which popes lines are the substitute the knight is enumerating the causes why men should marry and one reason he says is that each person ought to                                  helpen other     in meschief as a sister shall the brother     and live in chastity full holily     but sires by your leave that am not i     for god be thankèd i dare make avaunt     i feel my limbes stark and suffisaunt  the meaning is that when a husband is in meschief or in other words in a state of helpless decrepitude his wife ought to live in holy chastity and nurse him as a sister would a brother but adds the knight thank god i am not decrepit myself and feel my limbs to be still stout which is a very different sentiment from sneering at the saintly life he had just commended  footnote 14 this verse which has no counterpart in the original is altered from a line in drydens flower and leaf      evn when the vital sap retreats below     evn when the hoary head is hid in snow  footnote 15 the infatuation of the knight is more strongly marked in the original he summons his friends to hear his fixed resolution and to beg their assistance he wants no advice and instead of inviting them to speak their minds with freedom he concludes his address with the words      and synnes ye have heard all mine intent     i pray you to my wille ye assent  they do indeed offer him counsel where he solicited help which is a true stroke of nature on both sides  footnote 16 pope gives the real character of placebo but sets probability at defiance in making him parade with boastful effrontery his own systematic fawning and flattery chaucer has not committed the extravagance with him placebo justifies his assentation on the ground that lords are better informed than their inferiors      a full great fool is any counsellor     that serveth any lord of high honour     that dare presume or once thinken it     that his counsel should pass his lordes wit     nay lordes be no fooles by my fay     ye have yourself yspoken here today     so high sentence so holy and so well     that i consent and confirm every dole     your wordes all and your opinion  footnote 17 the last four lines are interpolated by pope and are again inconsistant with the tenor of chaucers narrative the knight had notoriously been a dissolute man and the coarse reflection would be out of place when the avowed object of his projected marriage was that he might live more soberly than he had hitherto done  footnote 18 seneca  footnote 19 the qualities specified by chaucer are whether she is wise sober or given to drink proud or in any other respect unamiable a scold or wasteful rich or poor and all this says justinus asketh leisure to enquire which he urges in reply to the announcement of january that he was determined not to wait  footnote 20 in chaucer justinus does not pronounce decisively against marriage but recommends january to consider well before he enters upon it and especially before he marries a young wife and a fair  footnote 21 this couplet is an addition by pope the manly justinus says nothing in the original about offending his noble lord  footnote 22 chaucer is more particular in his description      he portrayed in his heart and in his thought     her fresche beauty and her age tender     her middle small her armes long and slender     her wise governance her gentilnesse     her womanly bearing and her sadnessebowles  footnote 23      for when that he himself concluded had     he thought each other mannes wit so bad     that impossible it

turn is one of drydens familiar colloquial terms happily used dryden among other excellencies of a varied style was happy in the use of such termswarton  the phrase fails to convey the conception of chaucer that the knight too much smitten by the charms of may to consider anything else of the slightest importance      all were it so she were of small degree     sufficeth him her youth and her beaute  footnote 27 the humour is brought out by chaucer with increased force from his dwelling with greater detail on the fond conviction of january that the only risk he runs in marriage is from the excess of the felicity he says he stands aghast when he contemplates passing his life in that perfect peace and blessedness      as alle wedded men do with their wives  and trembles to think that he shall have his heaven upon earth      this is my dread and ye my brethren twey     assoileth me this question i you pray  footnote 28      and when they saw that it must needis be     they wroughten

no warrant from chaucer  footnote 32 here followed a bad couplet which pope afterwards omitted      expensive dainties load the plenteous boards     the best luxurious italy affords  footnote 33 joab the leader of the israelites in battle blew the trumpet as is recorded in the bible to gather them together theodomas is thought by tyrwhitt to be a character in some fictitious history which was popular in the days of chaucer  footnote 34 chaucer says that the bed was blessed by the priest and the form used on these occasions may be seen in the old latin service books  footnote 35 drydens sigismonda and guiscardo      what thoughts he had beseems me not to say  footnote 36 a circumstance is added by chaucer which brings vividly before the reader the advanced age of the knight      the slacke skin about his necke shaketh     while that he sung  footnote 37 chaucer had previously mentioned that it was the usage for newly married wives to keep their chambers till the fourth day and he repeats the fact here      as custom is unto these nobles all     a bride shall not eaten in the hall     till dayes four or three days atte least     ipassed be then let her go to the feast     the fourthe day complete from noon to noon     when that the highe masse was idoon     in halle sit this january and may     as fresh as is the brighte summers day  footnote 38 in the original january passes a warm panegyric upon the excellent qualities of damian which is meant to display in broader contrast the treachery and infamy of the squire the merchant in his own person denounces the villany of damians conduct and prays that all persons may be protected from the machinations of those deceitful vipers who when fostered in a family employ their opportunities to injure their benefactors pope has omitted every allusion of the kind and has treated the baseness of the squire as if he regarded it in the light of a joke  footnote 39 it was at first speaking sigh which was distinctive heaving is the accompaniment of all sighs and as the sigh of damian was soft did not mark his in an especial degree  footnote 40 there is not a word as may be supposed in chaucer of the squire asking for divine assistance in his wicked schemes  footnote 41 may on her return from the visit which at her husbands desire she paid to damian in his chamber that she might cheer him in his illness read the billet that he had given her covertly and the result is thus told by chaucer in a passage which has not been versified by pope      this gentle may fulfillèd of pite     right of her hand a letter makèd she     in which she granteth him her very grace     there lacked nought but only day and place     and when she saw her time upon a day     to visite this damian goeth may     and subtilely this letter down she thrust     under his pillow read it if him lust     she taketh him by the hand and hard him twist     so secretly that no wight of it wist     and bade him be all whole and forth she went     to january when that he for her sent     up riseth damian the nexte morrow     all passed was his sickness and his sorrow  footnote 42 the epicurean philosophers  footnote 43 addisons letter from italy      my humbler verse demands a softer theme     a painted meadow or a purling stream  footnote 44 pope has here shown his judgment in adopting the lighter fairy race of shakespeare and milton chaucer has king pluto and his queen proserpinabowles  there was not much judgment required they are fairies in chaucer but as was not unusual in his day he called them by names taken from the heathen mythology pope merely dropped the classical appellations which would have been an incongruity when he wrote in the details of his description he did not copy shakespeare or milton but drydens version of chaucers wife of bath      the king of elfs and little fairy queen     gambolled on heaths and danced on evry green  footnote 45 another couplet preceded this in the first edition      thus many a day with ease and plenty blessed     our genrous knight his gentle dame possessed  footnote 46 drydens palamon and arcite      nor art nor natures band can ease my grief     nothing but death the wretchs last relief  footnote 47 there is a natural trait in the original which is not preserved by pope the knight weeps piteously at his sudden calamity      but atte last after a month or tweye     his sorrow gan assuage sooth to say     for when he wist it may not other be     he patiently took his adversitie  this is one of the deeper and more solemn touches which pope systematically rejected although the old man gets reconciled to the loss of his sight his jealousy remains unabated  footnote 48      oh january what might it thee avail     if thou might see as far as shippes sail     for as good is blind deceivèd be     as to be deceivèd when a man may see  footnote 49 chaucer only says that they whispered through the crevice they discovered in the wall which divided the houses of their parents all their kisses were bestowed upon the wall itself or as sandys puts it in his translation of ovid                            their kisses greet     the senseless stones with lips that could not meet  footnote 50 this couplet which is not in the original is in the style of the pastorals which were common in popes youth  footnote 51      thou art the creature that i best love     for by the lord that sit in heaven above     lever i had to dyen on a knife     than thee offende deare trewe wife  footnote 52 by the injudicious interpolation of this parenthesis pope makes the knight express his belief to may that she is more likely to be kept faithful by her love of money than by her sense of honour and religion it is undeniable that covetousness would be the predominant motive with a depraved woman such as was poor old januarys wife but this is not his settled conviction and he would have shrunk from openly admitting the idea  footnote 53 the knights promise was to be performed the next morning his doubt was whether may on her side would fulfil the pledge of perpetual fidelity the ceremony is therefore reversed in the original and january asks her to kiss him in token of her adhesion to the covenant  footnote 54 in the original the knight avows the jealousy which in popes version he denies and excuses his misgivings on the ground of mays beauty and his own age having disclaimed all jealousy there is no longer any meaning in representing him as pleading the inequality of his years to justify his conduct  footnote 55 may in the original is the same wicked shameless woman that she is described by pope but chaucer is content to put into her mouth the wish that she may die a foul death if she breaks her marriage vows there is not a hint of the more frightful imprecation she invokes on herself in expressing the hope that she may descend alive into hell when she commits the crime she is meditating at the moment  footnote 56 infidelity in women is a subject of the severest crimination among the turks when any of these miserable girls are apprehended for the first time they are put to hard labor c but for the second they are recommitted and many at a time tied up in sacks and taken in a boat to the seragliopoint where they are thrown into the tide dallaways constantinoplebowles  footnote 57 the squire kneeling to worship may as she passed by is an exaggerated trait supplied by pope  footnote 58 at the conclusion of the hypocritical rejoinder of may in which she speaks the language of indignant innocence the narrative goes on thus in the original      and with that word she saw where damyan     sat in the bush and coughing she began     and with her fingers signes made she     that damyan should climb upon a tree     that chargèd was with fruit and up he went     for verily he knew all her intent     for in a letter she had told him all     of this mattier how he worke shall  footnote 59 these lines which have no counterpart in chaucer owe their beauty to drydens wife of baths tale      he saw a choir of ladies in a round     that featly footing seemed to skim the ground     thus dancing hand in hand so light they were     he knew not where they trod on earth or air  footnote 60 the author of the apocryphal book of ecclesiasticus chaucer says that he seldom speaks of women with reverence which is correct the statement of pope that the son of sirach asserted like solomon that there was no such thing as a good woman is in direct contradiction to various passages among his precepts  footnote 61 there is no specification of these ladies in chaucer  footnote 62      now by my mother ceres soul i swear     that i shall give her suffisaunt answere     and alle women after for her sake     that though they be in any guilt itake     with face bold they shall themselves excuse     and bear them down that woulde them accuse     for lack of answer none of them shall dyen     all had ye seen a thing with

though he be founde no good woman     yet hath there founde many another man     women full true full good and vertuous     witness on them that dwell in christes house     with martyrdom they proved their constaunce  footnote 64 pluto and proserpine each select that portion of the meaning which is convenient both senses are included in the words of solomon who at once asserts the general wickedness of mankind and the comparative worthlessness of women  footnote 65 the queen has just been boasting that she will endow the sex with the art of ingenious lying to cover the violation of their most solemn vows and now she tauntingly tells her husband that it is not in woman to break her word this contradiction is imported into the story by pope the original is as follows      dame quoth this pluto be no longer wroth     i give it up but since i swore mine oath     that i will grante him his sight again     my word shall stand i warne you certain     i am a king it sit me not to lie     and i quoth she am queen of faierie     her answer shall she have i undertake     let us no more wordes hereof make  footnote 66 the allusion is to the common longing of pregnant women for particular articles of diet may cries out that she shall expire unless she has some of the small green pears to eat and then exclaims anew      i tell you well a woman in my plight     may have to fruit so great an appetite     that she may dyen but she it have  footnote 67 the moral is popes own and is in the dissolute spirit which had descended from the reign of charles ii the comment on the story in chaucer is put into the mouth of the host who begs that he may be preserved from such a wife and inveighs against the craft and misdoings of women     the wife of bath  her prologue   from chaucer   the wife of bath is the other piece of chaucer which pope selected to imitate one cannot but wonder at his choice which perhaps nothing but his youth could excuse dryden who is known not to be nicely scrupulous informs us that he would not versify it on account of its indecency pope however has omitted or softened the grosser and more offensive passages chaucer afforded him many subjects of a more sublime and serious species and it were to be wished pope had exercised his pencil on the pathetic story of the patience of griselda or troilus and cressida or the complaint of the black knight or above all on cambuscan and canace from the accidental circumstance of dryden and pope having copied the gay and ludicrous parts of chaucer the common notion seems to have arisen that chaucers vein of poetry was chiefly turned to the light and the ridiculous but they who look into chaucer will soon be convinced of this prevailing prejudice and will find his comic vein like that of shakespeare to be only like one of mercury imperceptibly mingled with a mine of gold mr hughes withdrew his contributions to a volume of miscellaneous poems published by steele because this prologue was to be inserted in it which he thought too obscene for the gravity of his character the extraordinary length says mr tyrwhitt of the wife of baths prologue as well as the vein of pleasantry that runs through it is very suitable to the character of the speaker the greatest part must have been of chaucers own invention though one may plainly see that he had been reading the popular invectives against marriage and women in general such as the roman de la rose valerius ad rufinum de non ducendâ uxore and particularly hieronymus contra jovinianum the holy father by way of recommending celibacy has exerted all his learning and eloquence and he certainly was not deficient in either to collect together and aggravate whatever he could find to the prejudice of the female sex among other things he has inserted his own translation probably of a long extract from what he calls liber aureolus theophrasti de nuptiis next to him in order of time was the treatise entitled epistola valerii ad rufinum de non ducendâ uxore it has been printed for the similarity of its sentiments i suppose among the works of st jerome though it is evidently of a much later date tanner from woods mss collection attributes it to walter mapes i should not believe it to be older as john of salisbury who has treated of the same subject in his polycrat l viii c xl does not appear to have seen it to these two books jean de meun has been obliged for some of the severest strokes in his roman de la rose and chaucer has transfused the quintessence of all the three works upon the subject of matrimony into his wife of baths prologue and merchants tale  the lines of pope in the piece before us are spirited and easy and have properly enough a free colloquial air the tale to which this is the prologue has been versified by dryden and is supposed to have been of chaucers own invention as is the exquisite vision of the flower and the leaf which has received a thousand new graces from the spirited and harmonious dryden it is to his fables next to his music ode written when he was above seventy years old that dryden will chiefly owe his immortality and among these particularly to the wellconducted tale of palamon and arcite the pathetic picture of sigismunda the wild and terrible graces of theodore and honoria and the sportive pleasantry of cymon and iphigenia the warmth and melody of these pieces has never been excelled in our language i mean in rhyme it is mortifying and surprising to see the cold and contemptuous manner in which dr johnson speaks of these capital pieces which he says require little criticism and seem hardly worth the rejuvenescence as he affectedly calls it which dryden has bestowed upon them it is remarkable that in his criticisms he has not even mentioned the flower and leaf  these pieces of chaucer were not the only ones that were versified by pope mr harte assured me that he was convinced by some circumstances which fenton his friend communicated to him that pope wrote the characters that make the introduction to the canterbury tales published under the name of bettertonwarton  dr warton thinks one cannot but wonder at popes choice from chaucer of these stories when so many more are to be found in him more poetical his observation on chaucers poems is very just but the fact is pope by this very selection showed the bent of his mindthat it was rather turned to satire and ridicule than to the more elevated strains of poetrybowles  the imitations of chaucers january and may and wife of baths prologue are executed with a degree of freedom ease and spirit and at the same time with a judgment and delicacy which not only far exceeds what might have been expected from so young a writer but which leave nothing to be wished for in the mind of the reader the humour of chaucer is translated into the lines of pope almost without suffering any evaporationroscoe  popes version of the prologue of the wife of bath first appeared in a volume of poetical miscellanies published by steele in 1714 the portrait of this repulsive woman is drawn by chaucer with a vigorous hand she is a wealthy cloth manufacturer with a bold countenance and more than masculine freedom of speech she dresses ostentatiously rides with spurs and glorying in her shame openly boasts of the vices which less impudent women would carefully conceal her two predominant characteristics are an inordinate selfwill which makes her resolve to rule her husbands with an absolute despotism and an inordinate sensuality which has completely absorbed every finer sentiment she not only avows her propensities but exults in the deceit the tricks and the violence which she has employed to gratify them as so many testimonies to her cleverness and power she has no compunctious visitings for the frauds she has practised and the misery she has inflicted upon her deceased husbands she speaks of the dead as of the living with brutal insensibility and would think it a weakness to be swayed by a human feeling the impersonation of domineering heartless selfishness her pride is to prevail by tyranny instead of by the gentle graces of feminine tenderness and her pleasure is to indulge in worldly gaiety and the gross gratifications of sense even her jovial good humour is hardly a redeeming feature in her character for it mainly proceeds from her keen relish for physical enjoyments and turns to temper the instant she is thwarted it is difficult to conceive that anybody could be injured by reading her confessions which have nothing alluring but with warton we must condemn the taste which could select the story as a groundwork for the embellishments of modern verse the character may exist in every generation the unblushing candour with which it displays itself belonged to more outspoken times than our own chaucer painted from the life and this portrait of a coarse voluptuous defiant woman of the citizen class finds a place in his gallery because she had a prominent place in the society of the middle ages there was no rational motive for tricking her out in the newest fashion of a period to which she did not belong and she might with advantage have been allowed to remain in her primitive place and garb the indelicacy of the pieces he translated from chaucer was however one of their recommendations to pope and they may have had a further attraction for him from the fact that they held wives up to odium his deformed and insignificant person was an antidote to love and the court he paid to women met with a cold return he retaliated with his pen for the mortification to which they exposed him and he almost always represented them in a frivolous or degrading light he may not improbably have had a pleasure in reproducing from chaucer the caustic sentiments which were congenial to his own and may have found some satisfaction for his wounded spirit in revenging indifference by satire  warton says that pope has softened the more offensive passages in the wife of baths prologue but his version on the other hand is often less decorous than the original he has not justified his choice of the subject by his skill in the treatment of it the adaptation is much inferior to the companion piece of january and may and appears to have been thrown off in haste there are a few a very few happy lines and expressions but the bulk of the versification is not much above mediocrity and is frequently below it he has failed in the substance still more than in the form roscoe was of opinion that the humour of chaucer had hardly suffered any evaporation the admirers of the original have arrived at a different conclusion and have contended with almost one voice that hardly any of the humour has been preserved the genuine prologue is alive with manners passions idiomatic conversations and natural incidents the copy is by comparison a dead insipid dissertation the mode in which pope has abridged the narrative is one of many proofs that he only cared for characters in their broad outline and had either no perception of the subtler workings of the mind or no appreciation of them if ever a reader masters the full sense of an author it must be when he translates him and yet pope has overlooked or rejected many of the happiest traits in chaucer and has falsified others to the invariable injury of the story and sometimes with a total disregard to consistency particular deficiencies are of little moment in the midst of general excellence but in the present instance there is nothing to redeem the blots and the narrative from first to last is a pale and feeble reflection of the original  warton asserts on the authority of harte that fenton believed that the version of the prologue to the canterbury tales which appeared in lintots miscellany under the name of betterton was the work of pope and johnson adds that fenton made pope a gay offer of five pounds if he would show the characters in bettertons hand the celebrated actor certainly left some literary papers behind him if we may assume that a letter from caryll to pope and which was published by the poet himself is a genuine production i am very glad caryll writes may 23 1712 for the sake of the widow and for the credit of the deceased that bettertons remains are fallen into such hands as may render them reputable to the one and beneficial to the other in a note pope states that the remains were the modernised portions of chaucer contained in the miscellany of lintot there was no apparent motive for deception on the subject and the internal evidence supports the conclusion that betterton composed the translation and that pope merely revised it it is a bald worthless production with a few lines or couplets which seem to have proceeded from a more practised versifier than the novice who put together the bulk of the work the choicest parts are very little better than bad for pope was a provident poet and he did not decorate betterton with feathers which would have shone with lustre in his own plumage the great actor on his side has signally failed in the point where his art might have been expected to teach him better he who had such a deep insight into the characters he personated and who gave voice action and gesture to all the passions with such fidelity and power has pared away the dramatic vivacity of chaucer and left only a vapid hybrid compound which is neither modern nor mediæval the sketch of the good parson is omitted altogether doubtless because dryden had already tried his hand upon it and it was thought imprudent to provoke a comparison with his masterly paraphrase     the wife of bath  her prologue       behold the woes of matrimonial life     and hear with revrence an experienced wife     to

wrought to my desires     these three right ancient venerable sires     i told em thus you say and thus you do                           150     and told em false but jenkin swore twas true     i like

   155     and swore the rambles that i took by night     were all to spy what damsels they bedight     that colour brought me many hours of mirth10     for all this wit is given us from our birth     heavn gave to woman the peculiar grace                             160     to spin to weep and cully human race     by this nice conduct and this prudent course     by murmring wheedling stratagem and

is to be sold     with empty hands no tassels you can lure11     but fulsome love for gain we can endure     for gold we love the impotent and old     and heave and pant and kiss and cling for gold

sheepishly you look     approach my spouse and let me kiss thy cheek     thou shouldst be always thus resigned and meek                     185     of jobs great patience since so oft you preach

190     who puts a period to domestic strife     one of us two must rule and one obey                and since in man right reason bears the sway         let that frail thing weak woman have her way

a very woman and a very wife     what sums from these old spouses i could raise     procured young husbands in my riper days     though past my bloom13 not yet decayed was i     wanton and wild and chattered like a pye                           210     in country dances still i bore the bell     and sung as sweet as evning philomel     to clear my quailpipe and refresh my soul     full oft i drained the spicy nutbrown bowl     rich luscious wines that youthful blood improve                    215     and warm the swelling veins to feats of love     for tis as sure as cold ingenders hail

cast     on all the joys of youth and beauty past     to find in pleasures i have had my part     still warms me to the bottom of my heart     this wicked world was once my dear delight                          225     now all my conquests all my charms good night     the flour consumed the best that now i can     is een to make my market of the bran14       my fourth dear spouse was not exceeding true     he kept twas thought a private miss or two                       230     but all that score i paidas how youll say     not with my body in a filthy way     but i so dressed and danced and drank and dined     and viewed a friend with eyes so very kind     as stung his heart and made his marrow fry15                     235     with burning rage and frantic jealousy     his soul i hope enjoys eternal glory     for here on earth i was his purgatory     oft when his shoe the most severely wrung     he put on careless airs and sat and sung                           240     how sore i galled him only heavn could know     and he that felt and i that caused the woe     he died when last from pilgrimage i came     with other gossips from jerusalem16     and now lies buried underneath a rood17                           245     fair to be seen and reared of honest wood     a tomb indeed with fewer sculptures graced     than that mausolus pious widow placed18     or where inshrined the great darius lay     but cost on graves is merely thrown away                            250     the pit filled up with turf we covered oer     so bless the good mans soul i say no more       now for my fifth loved lord the last and best     kind heavn afford him everlasting rest     full hearty was his love and i can shew                             255     the tokens on my ribs in black and blue     yet with a knack my heart he could have won     while yet the smart was shooting in the bone     how quaint an appetite in woman reigns     free gifts we scorn and love what costs us pains                   260     let men avoid us and on them we leap     a glutted market makes provision cheap19       in pure good will i took this jovial spark     of oxford he a most egregious clerk     he boarded with a widow in the town20                             265     a trusty gossip one dame alison     full well the secrets of my soul she knew     better than eer our parish priest could do     to her i told whatever could befall     had but my husband pissed against a wall                            270     or done a thing that might have cost his life     she and my niece and one more worthy wife     had known it all what most he would conceal     to these i made no scruple to reveal     oft has he blushed from ear to ear for shame                        275     that eer he told a secret to his dame      it so befel in holy time of lent     that oft a day i to this gossip went     my husband thank my stars was out of town     from house to house we rambled up and down                          280     this clerk myself and my good neighbour alse     to see be seen to tell and gather tales21     visits to evry church we daily paid     and marched in every holy masquerade     the stations duly22 and the vigils kept                          285     not much we fasted but scarce ever slept     at sermons too i shone in scarlet gay              the wasting moth neer spoiled my best array       the cause was this i wore it evry day             twas when fresh may her early blossoms yields                      290     this clerk and i were walking in the fields     we grew so intimate i cant tell how23     i pawned my honour and engaged my vow     if eer i laid my husband in his urn24     that he and only he should serve my turn                          295     we straight struck hands the bargain was agreed     i still have shifts against a time of need     the mouse that always trusts to one poor hole     can never be a mouse of any soul      i vowed i scarce could sleep since first i knew him                300     and durst be sworn he had bewitched me to him     if eer i slept i dreamed of him alone                     and dreams foretell as learned men have shown              all this i said but dreams sirs i had none               i followed but my crafty cronys lore                               305     who bid me tell this lie and twenty more25      thus day by day and month by month we passed     it pleased the lord to take my spouse at last     i tore my gown i soiled my locks with dust     and beat my breasts as wretched widows must26                    310     before my face my handkerchief i spread     to hide the flood of tears i did not shed     the good mans coffin to the church was borne     around the neighbours and my clerk too mourn     but as he marched good gods he showed a pair                       315     of legs and feet so clean so strong so fair     of twenty winters age he seemed to be     i to say truth was twenty more than he     but vigrous still a lively buxom dame     and had a wondrous gift to quench a flame                          320     a conjror once that deeply could divine     assured me mars in

and a dauntless face     by virtue of this powrful constellation     i followed always my own inclination      but to my tale a month scarce passed away     with dance and song we kept the nuptial day                        330     all i possessed i gave to his command     my goods and chattels money house and land     but oft repented and repent it still27     he proved a rebel to my sovreign will     nay once by heavn he struck me on the face                      335     hear but the fact and judge yourselves the case      stubborn as any lioness was i     and knew full well to raise my voice on high     as true a rambler as i was before     and would be so in spite of all he swore                           340     he against this right sagely would advise     and old examples set before my eyes     tell how the roman matrons led their life     of gracchus mother and duilius wife     and close the sermon as beseemed his wit                           345     with some grave sentence out of holy writ28     oft would he say who builds his house on sands     pricks his blind horse across the fallow lands     or lets his wife abroad with pilgrims roam     deserves a foolscap and long ears at home                        350     all this availed not for whoeer he be     that tells my faults i hate him mortally     and so do numbers more ill boldly say     men women clergy regular and lay       my spouse who was you know to learning bred                    355     a certain treatise oft at evening29 read     where divers authors whom the devil confound     for all their lies were in one volume bound     valerius whole and of st jerome part30     chrysippus and tertullian ovids art                               360     solomons proverbs eloïsas loves31     and many more than sure the church approves32     more legends were there here of wicked wives     than good33 in all the bible and saints lives     who drew the lion vanquished twas a man34                       365     but could we women write as scholars can     men should stand marked with far more wickedness     than all the sons of adam could redress     love seldom haunts the breast where learning lies     and venus sets ere mercury can rise35                            370     those play the scholars who cant play the men     and use that weapon which they have their pen     when old and past the relish of delight     then down they sit and in their dotage write     that not one woman keeps her marriage vow                           375     this by the way but to my purpose now       it chanced my husband on a winters night     read in this book aloud with strange delight     how the first female as the scriptures show     brought her own spouse and all his race to woe36                  380     how sampson fell and he whom dejanire     wrappd in th envenomed shirt and set on fire     how cursed eryphile her lord betrayed     and the dire ambush clytemnestra laid37     but what most pleased him was the cretan dame                       385     and husbandbulloh monstrous fie for shame       he had by heart the whole detail of woe     xantippe made her good man undergo     how oft she scolded in a day he knew     how many pisspots on the sage she threw                            390     who took it patiently and wiped his head     rain follows thunder that was all he said       he read how arius to his friend complained     a fatal tree was growing in his land     on which three wives successively had twined                         395     a sliding noose and wavered in the wind     where grows this plant replied the friend oh where     for better fruit did never orchard bear     give me some slip of this most blissful tree     and in my garden planted shall it be                              400       then how two wives their lords destruction prove     through hatred one and one through too much love     that for her husband mixed a poisnous draught     and this for lust an amrous philtre bought     the nimble juice soon seized his giddy head                         405     frantic at night and in the morning dead38       how some with swords their sleeping lords have slain     and some have hammered nails into their brain     and some have drenched them with a deadly potion     all this he read and read with great devotion                      410       long time i heard and swelled and blushed39 and frowned     but when no end of these vile tales i found     when still he read and laughed and read again     and half the night was thus consumed in vain     provoked to vengeance three large leaves i tore                    415     and with one buffet felled him on the floor     with that my husband in a fury rose     and down he settled me with hearty blows     i groaned and lay extended on my side     oh thou hast slain me for my wealth i cried40                   420     yet i forgive theetake my last embrace     he wept kind soul and stooped to kiss my face     i took him such a box as turned him blue     then sighed and cried adieu my dear adieu41       but after many a hearty struggle past                            425     i condescended to be pleased at last     soon as he said my mistress and my wife     do what you list the term of all your life     i took to heart the merits of the cause     and stood content to rule by wholesome laws                         430     received the reins of absolute command                with all the government of house and land             and empire oer his tongue

above for tortures felt below     that rest they wished for grant them in the grave     and bless those souls my conduct helped to save  footnotes  footnote 1 pope has departed at the outset from the conception of chaucer the purpose of the tale which the wife of bath tells is to show that women love above all things to govern and her personal history which she relates in the prologue is an account of the means by which she reduced her husbands to submission it was not her own matrimonial woes which had been slight enough that she was about to set forth but the miseries of those whom it is her boast to have worried into obedience to her will as pope correctly renders the original she states that the pains referred to the smart she had inflicted on her husbands and far from alleging that dearbought wisdom had taught her that matrimony to a woman was a life of suffering she thanks god that she has been married five times already and declares that directly her fifth mate is dead she will marry a sixth      when my husband is from the world igone     some christian man shall wedde me anon  footnote 2 twelve in the original  footnote 3      beside a welle jesus god and man     spake in reproof of the samaritan     thou hast ihad five husbandes quoth he     and that ilkman which that now hath thee     is not thine husband thus he said certain     what that he meant thereby i cannot sayn     but that i axe why the fithe man     was not husband to the samaritan  the question is addressed to those who deny the validity of second marriages and she asks them to explain upon their theory why the fifth man was not properly the husband of the samaritan woman when there is the authoritative declaration of scripture that he was  footnote 4 pope alone is responsible for the second half of this line which in its present application has an unbecoming levity there was a pardoner in the company a person who got his living by selling indulgences and by displaying the pretended relics of saints who says that he was about to marry but that he shall abandon his intention now that he learns what despotic authority wives exercise over husbands the wife of bath unabashed informs him that what she has told is nothing in comparison with that which is to follow      abide quoth she my tale is not begun     nay thou shalt drinke of another tun     ere that i go shall savour worse than ale     and when that i have told thee forth my tale     of tribulation in marriage     of which i am expert in all my age     that is to say myself hath been the whip     then might thou choose whether thou wilt sip     of thilke tunne that i shall abroach     beware of it ere thou too nigh approach  these dramatic touches omitted by pope give life to the piece and individuality to the characters  footnote 5 in the original      i shall say sooth of husbands that i had     as three of them were good and two were bad  she meant that the two were rebellious in comparison with the three who were her slaves for in speaking of the entire five at the commencement of the prologue she added      and all were worthy men in their degree  pope has fallen into an inconsistency he states that the three old husbands were those who were just tolerable yet when he comes to describe the youngest of the two whom he here calls bad he makes the wife of bath exclaim      now for my fifth loved lord the last and best  in chaucer she distinctly denies that he was the best but says she loved him best and proceeds to explain the reason which is that women always value those most who treat them with harshness or indifference  footnote 6 this trait in the wife of baths character is brought out more distinctly by chaucer      me needeth not no longer doon diligence     to win their love or do them reverence     they loved me so well high god above     that i tolde no deynte of their love     a wise woman will busy her ever in one     to gete her love there she hath none     but synnes i had them wholly in my hand     and synnes they had me given all their land     what should i take keep them for to please     but it were for my profit or mine ease  i tolde no deynte of their love means i set no store by it ever in one is always and take keep is take care  footnote 7 the wife of baths first lesson in the art of domestic government is a panegyric upon the advantages of sturdy lying in which pope has not gone beyond the original      ye wise wives that can understand     thus should ye speak and bear them wrong in hand     for half so boldely can there no man     swere and lie as a woman can  to bear them wrong in hand is to affirm wrongfully or falsely the phrase to bear in hand for to asseverate was still frequently used in the reign of charles ii  footnote 8 the wife of bath accuses her old husbands to their faces of having delivered this kind of railing lecture to her when they had come home at night as drunk as mice the drunkenness and the railing are alike inventions of her own but she appeals to her niece and jenkin the apprentice to bear witness to the truth of her assertions the version of pope is not so vivid so lively or so close to nature as the original and he has nearly passed over one of the most prominent characteristics of the speech when the wife of bath taunts her husband with the reproaches she pretended he had heaped upon her she intersperses her repetition of his objurgations with abusive and disdainful names by way of comment upon his monstrous sentiments old caynard or villain sir old lecher thou very knave lorel or worthless fellow old dotard schrewe or sinner old barrel full of lies sir old fool are some of the appellations by which she marks her opinion of the doctrines she fathers upon him after reciting his alleged complaint that women concealed their vices till they were married she adds that the maxim is worthy of a schrewe or scoundrel when she imputes to him the declaration that no man would wed who was wise or who desired to go to heaven she follows it up with the wish that thunder and lightning would break his wicked neck when he is charged with having said that there were three things that troubled earth and that a wife was one of them she hopes that the life of such a villain will be cut short when she taxes him with quoting the proverb that a house not watertight a smoky chimney and a scolding wife drove men from home she retorts upon him that he is himself a scold and intimates that his years are an aggravation of the vice this is not only natural as the sort of scurrilous language which the wife of bath would have used if the drunken invectives had been real but was part of her plan for bringing her husbands into subjection her indignant recriminations were intended to browbeat them into meekness  footnote 9 she enlarges in the original upon this device which was one of her capital resources she quotes the proverb that he first grinds who comes first to the mill and upon this principle when she had done wrong she began by attacking her husband      or elles i had often time been spilt  the poor man thus suddenly assailed stood upon the defensive

watch her husbands she got the opportunity for indulging in freaks and jollity with her youthful friends      under that colour had i many a mirth     for all such wit is given us of birth     deceipt weeping spinning god hath give     to women kindely while they may live     and thus of one thing i avaunte me     at th end i had the bet in each degree     by sleight or force or of some maner thing

he was commonly obliged to entice them by some bait the tassel or tercel was the male of the peregrine falcon and was noted for its docility and gentleness it would seem as if this species would obey the summons of the trainer without any other inducement for when juliet calls after romeo and he does not instantly reappear she says                        o for a falconers voice     to lure this tasselgentle back again  footnote 12 in chaucer she states that her husbands would grant all her demands to soothe her into good humour      that made me that ever i would them chide     for though

testament     i owe them nought a word that it nis quit     i brought it so aboute by my wit     that they must give it up as for the best     or elles had we never been in rest     for though he looked as a grim lion     yet should he fail of his conclusion  pope has omitted the latter half of the lines and thus obliterated one of those nicer traits of nature with which the original abounds men put on the grimness of the lion and think to prevail by strength but women conquer by pertinacity the majority of men grow weary of perpetual conflict and purchase peace by concession but women of the stamp of the wife of bath wilt wrangle for ever and prefer endless discord to the subjugation of selfwill dryden adding to virgils thought has expressed the idea Æn v 1024      evn jove is thwarted by his haughty wife     still vanquished yet she still renews the strife  footnote 13 chaucer represents her as still youthful      and i was young and full of ragerie     stubborn and strong and jolly as a pye  footnote 14      the flour is gone there nis no more to tell     the bran as i best can now must i sell  footnote 15 in the original she does not say that she set his marrow frying but that she fried him in his own grease by stirring up in him the tormenting jealousy which his faithlessness had first engendered in herself      i made him of the same wood a cross     not of my body in no foul manere     but certainly i made folk such cheer     that in his owne grease i made him fry     for anger and for very jealousy     by god in earth i was his purgatory     for which i hope his soule be in glory     for god it wot he sat full still and sung     when that his shoe full bitterly him wrung     there was no wight save god and he that wist     in many wyse how sore i him twist  this is a lifelike portrait of a man tortured by inward pangs and affecting an air of indifference while he did not dare to complain from the consciousness that his greater offence would expose him to a crushing retort  footnote 16 in the character which chaucer gives of the wife of bath he says      and thrice had she been at jerusalem     she hadde passed many a strange stream     at rome she hadde been and at boulogne     in galice at saint jame and at cologne  the reputed tomb of saint james was at compostella in galicia and was a favourite resort of pilgrims the wife of bath may be supposed to have joined these expeditions quite as much from a love of roving and novelty as from superstitious motives  footnote 17 chaucer says he was buried under the roodbeam or as it is usually called the roodloft which was placed on the top of the screen that separated the chancel from the nave the name was derived from the rood or cross that stood in the centre with the effigy of our crucified lord and having on one side an image of the virgin and on the other of the apostle john pope buries the deceased husband in the churchyard and the root is a wooden cross which has been erected upon his grave  footnote 18 artemisia wife of mausolus king of caria on the death of her husband 352 bc she erected a monument to him at halicarnassus which from the beauty of its architecture and sculpture was considered one of the seven wonders of the world the romans says pausanias called all their most magnificent tombs mausolea after this monument to mausolua and hence our modern term mausoleum there is no mention of the tomb of mausolus in chaucer  footnote 19      i trow i loved him beste for that he     was of his love daungerous to me     we women have if that i shall not lie     in this matter a queynte fantasy     wayte what thing we may not lightly have     thereafter will we soonest cry and crave     forbid us thing and that desire we     press on us fast and thenne will we flee     with danger outen alle we our ware     great press at market maketh dear chaffare  daungerous in the second line means sparing and in the last line but one with danger signifies with a scarcity then says the wife of bath we must produce all our own wares to give in exchange at the date of her fifth marriage she was forty and the bridegroom was only twenty everything is now reversed her first husbands had endowed her with all their property that they might buy a young wife in their old age she in turn that she may procure a young husband gives him                      all the land and fee     that ever was me give therebefore     but afterward repented me full sore  her aged mates had worshipped her and she repaid them with disdain in her mature years she is infatuated by a youth and he who has no relish for the homage of a matron of forty slights her just as she had done her early husbands under similar circumstances  footnote 20 it would seem from chaucer that the youth was a native of bath and had returned there when he had completed his education at oxford      he some time was a clerk of oxenford     and had left school and went at home to board     with my gossib duelling in our town     god have her soul her name was alisoun  my gossib is my godmother and the wife of bath whose christian name was also alisoun had been named after her pope by turning my gossip into a gossip has done away with the special relationship and employed the word in its modern sense of a lover of tittletattle  footnote 21 in chaucer she adds a more powerful motive                  what wist i where my grace     was shapen for to be or in what place  in other words as she explains shortly afterwards she was in search of a lover who might succeed the fourth husband whenever he died  footnote 22 to perform a station says richelet in his french dictionary consists in visiting with devotion one or several churches a certain number of days and times and praying there in order to propitiate the wrath of god and obtain some favour from his mercy the wife of bath in the original says that she attended vigils processions preachings miracleplays and marriages besides making pilgrimages but stations are not included in her list the roman catholicism of pope had rendered the word familiar to him  footnote 23 the expression i cant tell how implies that the intimacy on the part of the wife of bath was accidental whereas it appears from popes context and still more from the original that it was a deliberate design      now will i telle forth what happed me     i say that in the fieldes walked we     till truely we had such dalliance     this clerk and i that of my purveyance     i spake to him and saide how that he     if i were widdow shoulde wedde me     for certainly i say for no bobaunce     yet was i never withouten purveyance     of mariage ne or no thinges eke     i hold a mouses heart not worth a leek     that hath but oon hole to sterte to     and if that faile then is all ido  the acknowledgment that while married to one man she is always engaged to a second seems to the wife of bath to have nothing discreditable in it and she only fears lest she should expose herself to the charge of vanity in asserting that she can command a succession of admirers  footnote 24 no englishwoman would talk of laying her husband in his urn not to mention that the phrase is a mixture of incongruous ideas the laid being applicable to burial and the urn to burning when the wife of bath speaks of her departed husband she says      he is now in his grave and in his chest  footnote 25 this couplet is an exaggeration of the original                  i followed ay my dames lore     as well of that as of other thinges more  footnote 26 tearing garments and throwing dust upon the head was a custom with some ancient nations but was not an english habit and there is no allusion to it in the text of chaucer        when that my fourthe husband was on bier     i wept algate and made a sorry cheer     as wives musten for it is usage     and with my kerchief covered my visage     but for that i was purveyed of a mate     i wept but small and that i undertake  the hardhearted selfishness which does not bestow a thought upon the dead being solely intent upon enjoying existence with the living comes out in a yet more odious light when she narrates her feelings at the funeral her mind is entirely taken up with the young clerk and mainly with admiration of his figure                      when that i saw him go     after the bier methought he had a pair     of legges and of feet so clean and fair     that all my heart i gave unto his hold  footnote 27 she does not in the original profess to repent it still and for the excellent reason that after a period of rebellion on the part of the clerk he had become a puppet in her hands and had rendered up both himself and his chattels to her undisputed management  footnote 28 the wife of bath says she insisted upon going from house to house according to her former custom and the clerk set his face against the practice his instances from roman story were directed against this special failing and were not general declamations on the virtue of roman matrons and gracchus mother the clerk told the gossiping intriguing dame that simplicius gallus left his wife for ever merely because he caught her looking out of the door with her head uncovered he told her of another roman that in the same manner deserted his wife because she one day went to see a game without his knowledge his quotation from holy writ is not some grave sentence but the particular sentence of ecclesiasticus which says give the water no passage neither a wicked woman liberty to gad abroad when the context has been generalised the lines which follow have not the accumulative sting of the original where they are an additional example of the evil consequences of suffering women to rove about pope has further weakened their force by supposing them to have no higher authority than the opinion of the clerk in chaucer they are given as a proverb and the husband urges them with triumph because they convey the general experience of mankind the language is stronger than in pope instead of mildly pronouncing that the man who suffers his wife to visit halwes or the shrines of saints deserves a fools cap the proverb declares that he is worthy to be hanged on the galwes  footnote 29 the clerk in the original reads with greater assiduity than oft at evening      he had a book that gladly night and day     for his desport he woulde read alway  after describing the contents of the book the wife of bath adds      and alle these were bound in one volume     and every night and day was his custume     when he had leisure and vacatioun     from other worldes occupation     to reden in this book of wicked wives  this portion of the narrative in chaucer is exceedingly pleasant and natural the wife says that she paid no regard to the clerks roman precedents his quotations from scripture his old saws and proverbs      ne i would not of him corrected be     i hate him that my vices telleth me  the contempt with which she treated his exhortations drove him utterly mad and it was then that he betook himself to reading all the literature he could find that bore upon the vices and frailties of women the evidence of their general perversity with which his studies supplied him consoled him for the ungovernable disposition of his own wife and he used to laugh away full fast over the record of their obstinacy and evil doings he had the sweeter satisfaction of revenge his mirth galled his imperious froward wife and when he read aloud the endless detail of female iniquities backed up by the authority of great names she could restrain her rage no longer and the storm burst forth under which the wretched clerk succumbed  footnote 30 pope has omitted a stroke of humour for in the original she naturally mistakes the rank and age of st jerome      and eke there was a clerk sometime in rome     a cardinal that highten st jeromewarton  footnote 31 this passage acquaints us with the writers who were popular in the days of chaucerwarton  warton takes no account of the fact that chaucer was only enumerating the authors which furnished arguments against women valerius is a tract by walter mapes which bears the title epistola valerii ad rufinum st jeromes denunciations of matrimony are in his treatise contra jovinianum tertullian wrote strongly against second marriages and severe animadversions upon female vices or weaknesses have a large place in his works who is meant by chrysippus says tyrwhitt i cannot guess ovids art of love and the letters of eloisa and abelard are known by name to all the world  footnote 32 this line is not in chaucer  footnote 33 if pope intended to follow the original good means good legends  footnote 34 the wife of bath having laid down the maxim that it is impossible for any clerk to speak well of women except it be of the saints indignantly inquires      who painted the lion tell me who  and with an oath she adds          if women hadde written stories     as clerkes have within their oratories     they would have writ of men more wickedness     than all the mark of adam may redress  than all the mark is than all that bear the mark or image of adam popes version in which the wife asks the question and tamely answers it is flat in comparison with the scornful repetition of the emphatic who yet he has employed this reduplication of a predominant word at ver 397 where it has much less effect judiciously used there is force and beauty in the turn as in the couplet from addisons translation of ovid      her sisters often as tis said would cry     fie salmacis what always idle fie  footnote 35 pope misapplying the original has adopted an image which is astronomically false chaucer spoke the language of astrology and said that each of these planets fell in the exaltation of the other for a planet was in its exaltation when it was in the sign of the zodiac where it was supposed to exercise its greatest influence and fell or was in its dejection in the sign where it exercised the least mercury the god of science was in his exaltation in virgo where venus the goddess of love had no sway venus was in her exaltation in pisces and there mercury was in his dejection a man could not be under the government of incompatible planetary powers and since scholars served mercury      therefore no woman is of clerkes praised  footnote 36 this line was followed by a poor couplet which pope afterwards omitted      how sampsons heart false delilah did move     his strength his sight his life were lost for love     then how aleides died whom dejanire c  footnote 37 eryphile bribed by a necklace prevailed upon her husband amphiaraus to join the expedition against thebes although he assured her it would be fatal to him clytemnestra lived in adultery during the absence of her husband agamemnon at the siege of troy and on his return she and her paramour entrapped and murdered him  footnote 38 some writers have pretended that lucilia the wife of lucretius the poet gave him a love potion which drove him mad  footnote 39 chaucer says nothing of the blushes of the wife of bath which were not at all in her character  footnote 40 who exclaims the wife of bath could imagine      the woe that in mine hearte was and pine     and when i saw he nolde never fine     to reden on this cursed book all night     all suddenly three leaves have i plight     out of this booke that he had and eke     i with my fist so took him on the cheek     that in our fire he fell backward adown     and he upstert as doth a wood leoun     and with his fist he smote me on the head     that in the floor i lay as i were dead     and when he saw so stille that i lay     he was aghast and would have fled away     till atte last out of my swoon i braide     o hastow slain me false thief i said     and for my land thus hastow murdered me     ere i be dead yet will i kisse thee  pine is pain fine is cease plight is plucked wood is mad and braide is awoke pope has dropped the natural circumstance of the clerks terror when he fancies he has killed his wife this alarm brings out more strongly the hypocrisy of his virulent dame in pretending that the blow he gave her on the head after she had torn the leaves out of his book and knocked him backwards into the fire was with the deliberate design of murdering her to get possession of her property  footnote 41 popes translation is mawkish and his adieu my dear adieu destroys the point of the story the wife of bath seconds the blow with reproaches instead of with terms of endearment nor does she consent to be pacified until the clerk surrenders at discretion had she relaxed before her conquest was complete she would have lost the opportunity of establishing her dominion after the line ere i be dead yet will i kisse thee chaucer thus continues      and near he came and kneeleth fairadown     and saide deare sister alisoun     as help me god i shall thee never smite     that i have done it is thyself to wite     forgive it me and that i thee beseke     and yet oftsoon i hit him on the cheek     and saide thief thus muchel i me wreke     now will i die i may no longer speak     but atte last with muchel care and woe     we fell accorded by ourselven two     he gave me all the bridle in mine hand     to have the governance of house and land     and of his tongue and of his hand also     and made him burn his book anon right tho  to wite is to blame i me wreke is i revenge myself and tho is then as soon as the poor clerk consented to have no will of his own and to be governed like a schoolboy by his master the dame declares      god help me so i was to him as kind     as any wife from denmark unto inde  it must have been holiday time with him notwithstanding when the wife of bath set out on one of her pilgrimages and left him in peace at home     the temple of fame  written in the year 1711     the temple of fame a vision  by mr pope  8vo  london printed for bernard lintott betwixt the two temple gates in fleet street 1715   this is the first edition a second edition which i have not seen is advertised by lintot in some of the lists of his publications dennis in the observations he put forth on the poem in 1717 asks pope if there are no women who are worthy to appear in the temple of fame and immediately adds divers he says but he thought he should affront the modesty of the sex in showing them there the remark does not occur in the first edition nor in the reprints of the poem in popes collected works and it may perhaps have been taken from the second edition as the production disappointed the expectations raised by the name of the author the sale was probably not large the piece was included in the quarto of 1717 and in the editions of lintots miscellanies which came out in 1727 and 1732 but was not in the editions of 1720 and 1722 lintot paid 32l 5s for the copyright on feb 1 1715   advertisement  the hint of the following piece was taken from chaucers house of fame the design is in a manner entirely altered the descriptions and most of the particular thoughts my own yet i could not suffer it to be printed without this acknowledgment1 or think a concealment of this nature the less unfair for being common the reader who would compare this with chaucer may begin with his third book of fame there being nothing in the two first books that answers to their title2 whenever any hint is taken from him the passage itself is set down in the marginal notes3  some modern critics from a pretended refinement of taste have declared themselves unable to relish allegorical poems4 it is not easy to penetrate into the meaning of this criticism for if fable be allowed one of the chief beauties or as aristotle calls it the very soul of poetry it is hard to comprehend how that fable should be the less valuable for having a moral the ancients constantly made use of allegories my lord bacon has composed an express treatise in proof of this entitled the wisdom of the ancients where the reader may see several particular fictions exemplified and explained with great clearness judgment and learning the incidents indeed by which the allegory is conveyed must be varied according to the different genius or manners of different times and they should never be spun too long or too much clogged with trivial circumstances or little particularities we find an uncommon charm in truth when it is conveyed by this sideway to our understanding and it is observable that even in the most ignorant ages this way of writing has found reception almost all the poems in the old provençal had this turn and from these it was that petrarch took the idea of his poetry we have his trionfi in this kind and boccace pursued in the same track soon after chaucer introduced it here whose romaunt of the rose court of love flower and the leaf house of fame and some others of his writings are masterpieces of this sort in epic poetry it is true too nice and exact a pursuit of the allegory is justly esteemed a fault and chaucer had the discernment to avoid it in his knights tale which was an attempt towards an epic poem ariosto with less judgment gave entirely into it in his orlando which though carried to an excess had yet so much reputation in italy that tasso who reduced heroic poetry to the juster standard of the ancients was forced to prefix to his work a scrupulous explanation of the allegory of it to which the fable itself could scarce have directed his readers our countryman spenser followed whose poem is almost entirely allegorical and imitates the manner of ariosto rather than that of tasso upon the whole one may observe this sort of writing however discontinued of late was in all times so far from being rejected by the best poets that some of them have rather erred by insisting on it too closely and carrying it too far and that to infer from thence that the allegory itself is vicious is a presumptuous contradiction to the judgment and practice of the greatest geniuses both ancient and modernpope  pope as he tells steele in their correspondence nov 16 1712 had written the temple of fame two years before that is when he was only twentytwo years old an early time of life for so much learning and so much observation as that work exhibits it has as steele warmly declared a thousand beauties every part is splendid there is great luxuriance of ornaments the original vision of chaucer was never denied to be much improved the allegory is very skilfully continued the imagery is properly selected and learnedly displayed yet with all this comprehension of excellence as its scene is laid in remote ages and its sentiments if the concluding paragraph be excepted have little relation to general manners or common life it never obtained much notice but is turned silently over and seldom quoted or mentioned with either praise or blamejohnson  it was to the italians we owed anything that could be called poetry from whom chaucer imitated by pope in this vision copied largely as they are said to have done from the bards of provence but whatever chaucer might copy from the italians yet the artful and entertaining plan of his canterbury tales was purely original and his own this admirable piece even exclusive of its poetry is highly valuable as it preserves to us the liveliest and exactest picture of the manners customs characters and habits of our forefathers whom he has brought before our eyes acting as on a stage suitably to their different orders and employments with these portraits the driest antiquary must be delighted by this plan he has more judiciously connected these stories which the guests relate than boccace has done his novels whom he has imitated if not excelled in the variety of the subjects of his tales it is a common mistake that chaucers excellence lay in his manner of treating light and ridiculous subjects for whoever will attentively consider the noble poem of palamon and arcite will be convinced that he equally excels in the pathetic and the sublime the house of fame as being merely descriptive is of an inferior rank to those in chaucer of the narrative kind and which paint life and manners the design is improved and heightened by the masterly hand of pope it is not improbable that this subject was suggested to our author not only by drydens translations of chaucer of which pope was so fond but likewise by that celebrated paper of addison in the tatler called the table of fame to which the great worthies of antiquity are introduced and seated according to their respective merits and characters and which was published some years before this poem was written the six persons pope thought proper to select as worthy to be placed on the highest seats of honour are homer virgil pindar horace aristotle tully it is observable that our author has omitted the great dramatic poets of greece sophocles and euripides deserved certainly an honourable niche in the temple of fame as much as pindar and horace but the truth is it was not fashionable in popes time nor among his acquaintance attentively to study these poets i own i have some particular reasons for thinking that he was not very conversant in this sort of composition having no inclination to the drama in a note on the third book of his homer where helen points out to priam the names and characters of the grecian leaders from the walls of troy he observes that several great poets have been engaged by the beauty of this passage to an imitation of it but who are the poets he enumerates on this occasion only statius and tasso the former of whom in his seventh book and the latter in his third shows the forces and the commanders that invested the cities of thebes and jerusalem not a syllable is mentioned of that capital scene in the phoenissæ of euripides from the hundred and twentieth to the two hundredth line where the old man standing with antigone on the walls of thebes marks out to her the various figures habits armour and qualifications of each different warrior in the most lively and picturesque manner as they appear in the camp beneath them in conclusion we may observe that popes alterations of chaucer are introduced with judgment and art and that these alterations are more in number and more important in conduct than any dryden has made of the same author  the temple of fame was communicated to steele who entertained a high opinion of its beauties and who conveyed it to addison pope had ornamented the poem with the machinery of guardian angels which he afterwards omitted he speaks of his work with a diffidence uncommon in a young poet and which does him credit no errors he says to steele are so trivial but they deserve to be mended i could point you to several but it is my business to be informed of those faults i do not know and as for those i do not to talk of them but to correct them you speak of that poem in a style i neither merit nor expect but i assure you if you freely mark or dash out i shall look upon your blots to be its greatest beautiesi mean if mr addison and yourself should like it in the whole i am afraid of nothing so much as to impose anything on the world which is unworthy its acceptancewarton  chaucers poem contains great strokes of gothic imagination yet bordering often on the most ideal and capricious extravagance pope has imitated this piece with his usual elegance of diction and harmony of versification but in the mean time he has not only misrepresented the story but marred the character of the poem he has endeavoured to correct its extravagancies by new refinements and additions of another cast but he did not consider that extravagancies are essential to a poem of such a structure and even constitute its beauties an attempt to unite order and exactness of imagery with a subject formed on principles so professedly romantic and anomalous is like giving corinthian pillars to a gothic palace when i read popes elegant imitation of this piece i think i am walking among the modern monuments unsuitably placed in westminster abbeyt warton  little can be added to t wartons masterly appreciation of the characteristic merit of this poem may i be just allowed to mention that there is less harmony of versification in this poem than in most of the preceding particularly the rape of the lock elegy to an unfortunate lady and above all the epistle of eloisa the pause is too generally at the end of the line and on the fourth and fifth syllable pope bids                     the muses raise     the golden trumpet of eternal praise  chaucer with a bolder personification sends for eolus that king of thrace from his cave of stone to sound his trump of gold these circumstances may designate in some measure the character of either poem i must confess i think there can be no comparison between the bold trump of eolus which he set                       to his mouth     and blew it east and west and south     and north as loud as any thunder  and the delicate but less animated tone of the muses in popebowles  if chaucer was indebted to any of the italian poets for the idea of his house of fame it was to petrarca who in his trionfo della fama has introduced many of the most eminent characters of ancient times it must however be observed that the poem of petrarca is extremely simple and inartificial and consists only in supposing that the most celebrated men of ancient greece and rome pass in review before him whilst that of chaucer is the work of a powerful imagination abounding with beautiful and lively descriptions and forming a connected and consistent whole popes temple of fame is one of the noblest though earliest productions of the author displaying a fertile invention and an uncommon grandeur and facility of style it is confessedly founded on chaucers house of fame but the design is greatly altered and improved and many of the thoughts and descriptions are entirely his own yet such is the coincidence and happy union of the work with its prototype that it is almost impossible to distinguish those portions for which he is indebted to chaucer from those of his own invention the conclusion as descriptive of his own feelings at an early period of his own life is particularly interestingroscoe  chaucers house of fame is adorned with statues      of all manner of minstrales     and gestours that tellen tales     both of weeping and of game  just such a gestour or narrative poet was chaucer himself for as warton has remarked he excelled alike in the pathetic and the gay and if he was more admirable in one than in the other his tales of weeping were superior to his tales of game none of our poets except shakespeare can compete with him in versatility of genius his numerous characters are conceived with equal truth and distinctness his dialogue is lively and natural his humour is sometimes broad sometimes subtle and always racy his tenderness is unrivalled in its mingled depth simplicity and refinement his descriptions whether serious or comic have never been surpassed in ease and vividness his preeminence appears the more conspicuous when we contrast his living strains with the feeble diffuse monotony of his successors and predecessors he may be compared says thomas warton to a premature summers day in an english spring the autobiographical passages in his works afford a glimpse of the varied tastes and pursuits which rendered him one of the most comprehensive writers in the world his keen observation of mankind was blended with the plodding of a student he tells us that he lived the life of a hermit and was entirely ignorant of what was passing among the neighbours who dwelt almost at his door his custom when the duties of the day were over was to withdraw to his house and sit down as dumb as any stone to his books till he was dazed with reading his love of nature could alone compete in intensity with his love of literature the single thing which had power to entice him from the studies he held in reverence was the singing of birds and the blooming of flowers the month of may had a peculiar fascination for him then he exclaims farewell my book and transported by the opening beauties of the year he gave himself up to the exhilarating effects of renovated nature the flower of flowers in his eyes was the daisy and there was never a morning that he was not out at dawn in the meadows kneeling on the soft sweet grass and watching his little favourite unclose its petals to the sun in the evening he returned to see the daisies go to rest and no sooner were they shut up than he hastened home to bed that he might be awake in time to witness the renewal of the scene the sight was to him so blissful that it softened all his sorrow nor did the commonness of the occurrence abate the charm he protests that he still feels within him the fire which impelled him to rise with glad devotion before break of day that he might behold the resurrection of his cherished flower and do it reverence for the friendly daisy was            ever alike fair and fresh of hue     and i love it and ever alike new     and ever shall till that mine hearte die  these traits present a charming picture of the man and they are enhanced by the modesty which accompanied his greatness he always speaks of his writings with unaffected humility as those of a person who from taste was a diligent cultivator of poetry without possessing the faculty to become a worthy poet  the house of fame cannot be ranked with chaucers best productions the incidents are supposed to pass in a dream which was his ordinary plan for avoiding the infringement of probability when he exchanged terrestrial realities for the visions of fancy he repeatedly in his works does homage to the happy influence of love he maintained that it was the parent of the choicest qualities among mankind though he sometimes adulterates his loftier sentiments by intermingling voluptuous passion with the pure affections of the hearta defect which was usual with the mediæval gestours he reverts in the house of fame to his favourite theme and the first book is taken up with a description of the temple of venus the entire edifice was of glass that was radiant with paintings representing subjects from ovid and virgil chaucer flourished in the finest period of gothic architecture when the storied windows richly dight were the delight of the age and his detailed enumeration of the pictured incidents were not to his contemporaries the dry catalogue they may appear to us after examining the marvellous gallery he walks out of the building to seek for some one to inform him in what country he may be he finds that the surrounding district is a desert as far as the eye can reach without house tree herbage or living creature till gazing upwards he beholds an eagle aloft in the sky      it was of gold and shone so bright     that never saw men such a sight     but if the heaven had ywon     all new of god another sun  the book concludes with the announcement that the gorgeous eagle began somewhat to descend and this is followed in the second book by the bird catching sight of chaucer and stooping upon him with the rapidity of lightning in an instant it catches him up in its claws and as lightly as if he was a lark soars with him into the clouds he swoons with fright and is restored to consciousness by the eagle calling him by name and rebuking him for his fears having calmed him the bird informs him why he has been sent to fetch him and bear him aloft into the skies chaucer more than once confesses that he was not framed to win affection he says he did not dare to love for his unlikeliness and that he might go in the dance with those whom it had not been cupids pleasure to prosper yet his quick and glowing sympathies had led him to employ his genius in celebrating a blessing of which he had tasted so sparingly and he is now told that his disinterested service to venus and cupid in devoting the hours of night to composing poems on the histories of lovers till his head aches has attracted the notice of jupiter who intends to reward him by admitting him to a view of the palace of fame the eagle continues rising upwards with his burthen and expounds to chaucer as they go the situation of the building and the means by which everything said and done on earth is known in the distant sanctuary of the goddess arrived there the winged messenger of jupiter sets the poet down and bidding him farewell expresses a hope that the god of heaven will send him grace to learn some good from the scenes which are about to be unveiled to him the third book contains the account of the house of fame and the house of rumour and despite the previous announcement of the extraordinary disclosures which await him chaucer has copied several of his leading ideas from ovid and virgil in the house of fame he witnesses the caprice with which the goddess dispenses reputation and disgrace and in the house of rumour he learns that nothing can exceed the lying and deception which are practised by mercenary ecclesiastics for the sake of lucre his honest nature and penetrating understanding repudiated the impostures of the romish church and it was the main lesson which he seemed to wish to inculcate in his poem  it is stated by pope in his prefatory advertisement that the house of fame had only supplied him with the hint for the temple of fame that the design was entirely altered and that the descriptions and most of the particular thoughts were his own bowles says that pope seems unwilling to confess all he owes to chaucer and that his language would lead us to conclude that the chief merit of the arrangement and imagination belonged to himself whereas he is indebted to his predecessor for what is most poetical in the whole composition pope cannot be accused of concealing his obligations to the house of fame for he has fairly specified them in his notes but he extremely underrated the extent to which he borrowed from it when he fancied that his general outline was different and most of the particular thoughts entirely new the fertility of invention ascribed to him by roscoe and which he in some degree challenges for himself is the last praise he can claim every portion of the conception which has a touch of creative power is found in chaucer together with the largest part of what is good in the filling up high authorities differ as to the effect of popes additions and variations thomas warton pronounced that the character of the poem was marred and bowles endorsed the criticism johnson on the other hand asserts that the original vision was never denied to be much improved and he had joseph warton roscoe and campbell on his side much of chaucers fantastic matter says campbell has been judiciously omitted by pope who at the same time has clothed the best ideas of the old poem in spirited numbers and expression chaucer supposes himself to be snatched up to heaven by a large eagle who addresses him in the name of st james and the virgin mary in pope the philosophy of fame comes with much more propriety from the poet himself than from the beak of a talkative eagle5 the introduction of the majestic eagle its tremendous swoop when it pounces on the lonely wanderer the terror produced by the first stage of the flight and the animated dialogue in the second stage is the most striking portion of chaucers vision the philosophic discourse of the bird is not inconsistent with the wild imaginings of a dream fantastic matter is here the most natural and keeps up an illusion which disappears in the formal composition of pope the advantage of modern language and versification would have rendered it easy for a man less gifted than him to improve on isolated passages but the free fancy and picturesqueness of chaucer are wanting the romance which constitutes the truth and charm of the original dream is replaced by a scene of frigid tameness and johnson while declaring that every part of the remodelled piece was splendid is compelled to admit that it is turned silently over and takes no hold on the mind dullness is a fatal innovation which is poorly compensated by the greater polish of the style and harmony of the verse  the temple of fame suffered from a cause which deteriorated much of popes early poetrythe notion that the noblest exercise of mind was to magnify the ancients and reproduce their ideas the epic poem he commenced at thirteen was naturally a schoolboys slavish imitation of greek and latin authors6 a magnificent modern literature marked by the strongest lines of native vigour and masculine independence might have been expected as he grew acquainted with it to expand his taste this effect did not ensue led astray by the false conventional canons of hacknied criticism he clung to his early prejudices and regardless of the splendid names which gave the lie to his theory he could say at the age of thirty in the preface to his works all that is left us is to recommend our productions by the imitation of the ancients he told spence that he should certainly have tried his hand upon a second epic if he had not translated the iliad and this epic in its main characteristics would not have differed much from his translation i should have sat down to it he said with this advantage that i had been nursed up in homer and virgil7 he once intended to take the corinthian timoleon for his hero and scene manners personages machinery and sentiments would all have been as greek as they could be made by an imitator who had not entered deeply into the spirit of classic writers and times the everlasting interest attached to the iliadto a poem original and national reflecting the institutions customs feelings and beliefs of its erawould he thought be extended to a modern duplicate in which every one of these qualities would have been reversed the less we copy the ancients said dr young we shall resemble them the more the undue exaltation of antiquity is complete in the temple of fame no english king warrior statesman or patriot no christian martyr or evangeliser no poet or philosopher was deemed worthy to be ranked with the men of old the fictitious phantoms of heathen mythology the heroes of decayed empires and the authors whose works are in dead languages are the sole immortals of pope within the limits of his narrow world several of his names appear to have been selected at random and others are applauded upon mistaken principles he extols the virtue of brutus whose chief glory was to have plotted the death of his preserver patron and friend nations do not need and virtue disowns the patriotism which manifests itself in ingratitude treachery and murder popes admiration of tyrannicides even led him to celebrate timoleon for killing his brother notwithstanding that timoleon had forfeited his claim to the panegyric by bitterly repenting his crime to consecrate political assassinations is to put the lives of rulers at the mercy of any individual who conceives their policy to be mischievous in short the portion of the temple of fame which was not directly borrowed from chaucer is merely a schoolboys theme in verse the manner in which pope sets forth his worthies is not for him felicitous his portraits are nearly all faint and feeble sketches without distinctness of outline individuality of feature or brilliancy of colouring  the contemporary literature of the middle ages could not compete with the classical masterpieces and chaucer might have been justified in peopling his house of fame with ancients alone but he does not believe that genius and grandeur expired with the romans he has faith in authors whose light has long since been dimmed or extinguished and confidently ranks such writers as guido de columpnis and geoffrey of monmouth with the loftiest greek and latin names the statues of minstrel bards musicians and professors of magic adorn the exterior of the palace the wall within is crowded with heralds and on their coats are embroidered the armorial ensigns of all the persons who had been famous in europe asia and africa since chivalry began everywhere we have the true reflection of the world in which chaucer lived his narrative represents the fourteenth century its actual pursuits and genuine tastes while the modernised version of pope is stripped of circumstantial realities and exhibits only an impassive artificial pedantry  the architecture of popes temple and chaucers house presents the same difference which distinguishes the respective poems throughout the house is in the magnificent gothic of the time with its multiplied buttresses niches images pinnacles and traceried windows the temple is a building which resembles nothing that ever existed one face is grecian architecture a second eastern a third egyptian and a fourth northern warton in a note to the poem says that popes knowledge and taste in the fine arts were unquestionable had he possessed the crudest ideas of architecture he could not have affirmed that so hideous and indeed so impossible a combination surpassed in beauty whatever had been beheld in proud rome or artful greece or elder babylon the details are worthy of the general conception the northern side is said to be of gothic structurenot the glorious style which commonly bears the name a style for which pope had no eyes since with chaucers description before him he ignores the mediæval gothic altogether but a structure lustrous as glass and overwrought with ornaments of barbarous pride huge colosses rise upon its face and around the statues are engraved runic characters this part of the design appears to be an importation from the south in the egyptian temples colossal figures are often attached to the piers and at the top bottom and sides of the piers there is a border of hieroglyphics with his statues pope has conjoined rude iron columns smeared with blood upon which stand the horrid forms of scythian heroes and in a note he gravely asserts that this medley is agreeable to the architecture of the northern part of the world in the text he has ventured upon the no less extraordinary statement that all the façades were of equal grace or in other words that his barbarous and chimerical northern side was of equal grace with the architecture of greece  johnson remarks that the learning and observation exhibited in the temple of fame were uncommon for a youth of twentytwo the authority for popes age was an expression in his letter to steele nov 16 1712 where he says of his work i was so diffident of it as to let it lie by me these two years just as you now see it and he adds in a note hence it appears this poem was writ before the author was twentytwo years old with the discrepancy usual with him when the dates of his compositions were in question he stated on the titlepage of the various reprints of the temple of fame that it was written in the year 1711 the first day of which found him nearer twentythree than twentytwo he did not publish it till 1715 and between his twentyfifth year when he showed it to steele and his twentyseventh year when it appeared he subjected the poem to an extensive revision i have read over your temple of fame twice wrote steele nov 12 1712 and cannot find anything amiss of weight enough to call a fault but see in it a thousand thousand beauties since you say pope replied you see nothing that may be called a fault can you not think it so that i have confined the attendance of guardian spirits to heavens favourites only he remedied the defect by getting rid of the guardian spirits and with his own testimony to the changes which the plan underwent the learning can only be considered as displaying the compass of his knowledge when he was upwards of twentysix it is surprising that johnson should have thought that a very small amount of classical mythology and an acquaintance with the broad characteristics of a few celebrities of antiquity was an unusual acquisition even for a man of twentytwo warton has pointed out that the narrow range of popes reading was more remarkable than its extent he has not alluded to the greek tragedians and had probably never looked into a single play of Æschylus sophocles or euripides the observation of life which johnson thought as precocious as the learning is not of the recondite kind and belongs exclusively to chaucer in whatever light we view the temple of fame it must be ranked at best with the secondary class of popes productions and the indifference with which it was regarded up to johnsons time has continued unabated up to ours the eight lines on the rocks of zembla are fine and there is an occasional good line in other portions of the piece but the poem seldom rises above a cold and somewhat languid elegance and like the pale suns which the author describes it rolls away unfelt  footnotes  footnote 1 the remainder of this

his eyes he must be too high to discern such minute objects as ships and trees but the imagination in dreams conjures up appearances which are beyond the compass of the waking powers and it is therefore strictly natural to represent events as passing in visions which would be unnatural in actual life added to this pope had before him ovids description of the house of fame which is endued with the property of enabling the beholder to distinguish the smallest objects however remote      unde quod est usquam quamvis regionibus absit     inspicitur  or as sandys translates it      where

the broken thunder heard from far     when jove at distance drives the rolling war  this is more poetically expressed than the same image in our author drydens lines are superior to the originalwarton  pope copied drydens translation of ovid and for this reason did not quote the parallel passage from chaucers second book of the house of fame where the eagle when they come within hearing of the swell of indistinct voices holds a colloquy with the poet on the phenomenon      and what sound is it like quoth he     peter beating of the sea     quoth i against the rockes hollow     when tempest doth the shippes swallow     or elles like the last humbling     after the clap of a thundring  peter is an exclamation and the sense is by st peter it is like the beating of the sea against the hollow rocks in popes poem no cause is assigned for the wild promiscuous sound in chaucer it is produced by the confluence of the talk upon earth every word of which is conveyed to the house of fame  footnote 14 chaucers third book of fame      it stood upon so high a rock     higher standeth none in spayne     what manner stone this rock was     for it was like a lymed glass     but that it shone

dennis proceeds to contend that for a rock to be sustained in the air was contrary to the eternal laws of gravitation which says pope sarcastically in a manuscript note no dream ought to be the cavil of dennis was as false in science as in criticism for it is not more contrary to the laws of gravitation for a rock to be suspended in space than for the earth itself  footnote 15 dryden Æneis vi 193

footnote 18 does not this use of the heat of the sun appear to be a puerile and farfetched conceit what connection is there betwixt the two sorts of excesses here mentioned my purpose in animadverting so frequently as i have done on this species of false thoughts is to guard the reader especially of the younger sort from being betrayed by the authority of so correct a writer as pope into such specious and false refinements of stylewarton  not only is the comparison defective but the fundamental idea is unfounded for though excess of admiration may produce a temporary reaction the opinion of the world oscillates back to the middle line and no instance can be quoted of an author who has finally lost his due reputation because he had once been overpraised chaucer makes a different use of the image in his poem the north side of the icy mountain bears the names of the ancients which were safe from injury the sunny side bears the names of the moderns and he perhaps intended to intimate his opinion that the reason why their fame was less durable than that of the greeks and romans was that they were a more luxurious race and did not in the same degree scorn delights and live laborious days for the sake of producing immortal works  footnote 19      for on that other side i sey     of that hill which northward ley     how it was written full of names     of folke that had afore great

verisimilitude be not required in the descriptions of this visionary and allegorical kind of poetry which admits of every wild object that fancy may present in a dream and where it is sufficient if the moral meaning atone for the improbability yet men are naturally so desirous of truth that a reader is generally pleased in such a case with some excuse or allusion that seems to reconcile the description to probability and nature the simile here is of that sort and renders it not wholly unlikely that a rock of ice should remain for ever by mentioning something like it in our northern regions agreeing with the accounts of our modern travellerspope  footnote 21 mountains propping the sky was one of those vicious commonplaces of poetry which falsify natural appearances  footnote 22 a

the western front is of grecian architecture the doric order was peculiarly sacred to heroes and worthies those whose statues are after mentioned were the first names of old greece in arms and artspope  the exterior of the doric temples abounded in sculptured figures which may be the reason that pope supposes the order to have been peculiarly sacred to heroes and worthies but it may be doubted whether he had any good grounds for his assertion  footnote 26 the expression literally interpreted would signify that the gates were placed on the top of columns pope could not have had such a preposterous notion in his mind and the meaning must be that the lofty gates were hung upon columns he copied a couplet in drydens Æneis vi 744 where the translation misrepresents the original

unquestionable had taken more pains in describing so famous a statue as that of the farnesian hercules for he has omitted the characteristical excellencies of this famous piece of grecian workmanship namely the uncommon breadth of the shoulders the knottiness and spaciousness of the chest the firmness and protuberance of the muscles in each limb particularly the legs and the majestic vastness of the whole figure undoubtedly designed by the artist to give a full idea of strength as the venus de medicis of beauty to mention the hesperian apples which the artist flung backwards and almost

footnote 41 the magi and chaldæans the chief of whom was zoroaster employed their studies upon magic and astrology which was in a manner almost all the learning of the ancient asian people we have scarce any account of a moral philosopher except confucius the great lawgiver of the chinese who lived about two thousand years agopope  there are several mistakes in popes note zoroaster was not a magician who waved the circling wand of the necromancer the magians says plato teach the magic of zoroaster but this is the worship of the gods his creed was theological and had no connexion with sorcery some of his nominal followers subsequently professed to be fortunetellers astrology was not a general characteristic of the diverse nations who constituted the ancient asian people and their learning was by no means limited to it the hindoos for instance were the precursors of aristotle in logic and the earliest metaphysicians whose doctrines have come down to us the indian philosophy says m cousin is so vast that all the philosophical systems are represented there and we may literally affirm that it is an abridgment of the entire history of philosophy nor was confucius the only oriental lawgiver who taught the useful science to be good the hindoo body of laws which bears the name of menu was compiled centuries before confucius was born and it is eminently a moral and religious as well as a political code  footnote 42 it was often erroneously stated that the brahmins dwelt always in groves by the laws of menu the life of a brahmin was divided into four portions and it was during the third portion only that he was commanded to become an anchorite in the woods to sleep on the bare ground to feed on roots and fruit to go clad in bark or the skin of the black antelope and to expose himself to the drenching rain and scorching sun the caste have ceased to conform to the primitive discipline and the old asceticism is now confined to individual devotees the

an example of unbounded virtue and the muchsuffering heroes could not be instances of less guilty fame than a man whose virtue was unbounded the classification was probably suggested by addisons vision in the tatler of the three roads of life and having his original in his mind when he composed his poem pope avoided the inconsistency which he subsequently imported into the passage the persons says addison who travelled up this great path were such whose thoughts were bent upon doing eminent services to mankind or promoting the good of their country on each side of this great road were several paths these were most of them covered walks and received into them men of retired virtue who proposed to themselves the same end of their journey though they chose to make it in shade and

antiquity these are described in such attitudes as express their different characters the columns on which they are raised are adorned with sculptures taken from the most striking subjects of their works which sculpture bears a resemblance in its manner and character to the manner and character of their writingspope  this was a trite device and is poorly applied in the present instance the

patroclus and the same hector dragged along at the wheels of achilles chariot are these the most affecting and striking incidents of the iliad but it is highly worth remarking that this very incident of dragging the body of hector thrice round the walls of troy is absolutely not mentioned by homer heyne thinks that virgil for he first mentioned it adopted the circumstance from some greek tragedy

Æneis was based upon the iliad and was both more polished and less vigorous the sulphur upon which claudian stands is typical of the hell he described in his poem on the rape of proserpine ovid the poet of love is put upon a pillar of copper because copper was the metal of venus and lucan like homer has a pillar of iron allotted to him because he celebrated in his pharsalia the wars of cæsar and pompey and as chaucer says              iron martes metal is     which that god is of battaile  footnote 81 wakefield supposes that modest majesty was suggested by miltons phrase modest pride in par

upon the truth that the same person is commonly both lauded and denounced this is finely expressed by milton samson agonistes ver 971      fame if not doublefaced is doublemouthed     and with contrary blast proclaims most deeds     on both his wings one black the other white     bears greatest names in his wild aery flight  footnote 104 the idea is from chaucer      they hadde good fame

110 in his account of the reception given by fame to her various suppliants pope is detailing the manner in which praise and blame are dispensed in this world and it is a departure from reality to consign the entire race of conquerors to oblivion however little they may deserve fame they at least obtain it the inconsistency is the more glaring that when he describes the temple in the opening of the poem he tells us that      within stood heroes who through loud alarms     in bloody fields pursued renown in arms  footnote 111      i saw anone the fifth route     that to this lady gan loute

themselves before the goddess there is the same defect in chaucer  footnote 118      tho come another companye     that lad ydone the treachery cpope  pope in this paragraph had not only chaucer in

goes up to him      and saide friend what is thy name     artow come hither to have fame  the poet disclaims any such intention and protests that he has no desire that his name should be known to a single soul he is then asked what he does there and he replies that he who brought him to the place promised him that he should learn new and wonderful things in which he says he has been disappointed for he was aware before that people coveted fame though he was not hitherto acquainted with the dwelling of the goddess nor with her appearance and condition his interrogator answers that he perceives what it is he desires to know and conducts him to the house of rumour there he has revealed to him the falsehood of the world and especially of pilgrims and pardoners which was an important doctrine to be inculcated in those days when the scene has been fully disclosed a man of great authority appears and the poet starts up from his sleep by which he seems to intimate that the wise and serious frown upon those who listen to idle tales his awaking half afraid is the result of his      remembring well what i had seen     and how high and far i had been     in my ghost  pope by reserving the inquiry addressed to him for the end of the poem represents himself as being asked in the temple of rumour whether he has come there for fame which is not more but much less natural than the arrangement of chaucer who supposes the question to be put in the temple of fame itself nor would it have been congenial to chaucers modest disposition to make himself the climax of the piece

position of homer aristotle c in the temple of fame as though it were a substantial triumph a real dignity and a glorious reward the purport of his piece is to enforce and not to depreciate the value of literary renown his whole life attests that this was his genuine opinion he was not endowed with the equanimity which neither covets nor despises reputation and it was pure affectation when he pretended in the concluding paragraph that he did not call for the favours of fame and that he held posthumous fame in particular to be a worthless possession  footnote 132 dryden in palamon and

amnes     flumina amem sylvasque ingloriusvirg   these pastorals were written at the age of sixteen and then passed through the hands of mr walsh mr wycherley g granville afterwards lord lansdowne sir william trumbull dr garth lord halifax lord somers mr mainwaring and others all these gave our author the greatest encouragement and particularly mr walsh whom mr dryden in his postscript to virgil calls the best critic of his age the author says he seems to have a particular genius for this kind of poetry and a judgment that much exceeds his years he has taken very freely from the ancients but what he has mixed of his own with theirs is no way inferior to what he has taken from them it is not flattery at all to say that virgil had written nothing so good at his age his preface is very judicious and learned letter to mr wycherley ap 1705 the lord lansdowne about the same time mentioning the youth of our poet says in a printed letter of the character of mr wycherley that if he goes on as he hath begun in the pastoral way as virgil first tried his strength we may hope to see english poetry vie with the roman notwithstanding the early time of their production the author esteemed these as the most correct in the versification and musical in the numbers of all his works the reason for his labouring them into so much softness was doubtless that this sort of poetry derives almost its whole beauty from a natural ease of thought and smoothness of verse whereas that of most other kinds consist in the strength and fulness of both in a letter of his to mr walsh about this time we find an enumeration of several niceties in versification which perhaps have never been strictly observed in any english poem except in these pastorals they were not printed till 1709pope  the sycophancy of a philips who had prejudiced mr addison against pope occasioned those papers1 in the guardian written by the latter in which there is an ironical preference given to the pastorals of philips above his own in order to support the profound judgment of those who could not distinguish between the rural and the rustic and on that account condemned the pastorals of pope for wanting simplicity these papers were sent by an unknown hand to steele and the irony escaping him he communicated them to mr pope declaring he would never publish any paper where one of the club was complimented at the expense of another pope told him he was too delicate and insisted that the papers should be published in the guardian they were so and the pleasantry escaped all but addison who taking pope aside2 said to him in his agreeable manner you have put your friends here in a very ridiculous light as will be seen when it is understood as it soon must be that you were only laughing at the admirers of philips but this ill conduct of philips occasioned a more open ridicule of his pastorals in the mock poem called the shepherds week written by gay but though more open the object of it was ill understood3 by those who were strangers to the quarrel these mistook the shepherds week for a burlesque of virgils pastorals how far this goes towards a vindication of philipss simple painting let others judgewarburton  in 1704 pope wrote his pastorals which were shown to the poets and critics of that time as they well deserved they were read with admiration and many praises were bestowed upon them and upon the preface which is both elegant and learned in a high degree they were however not published till five years afterwards cowley milton and pope are distinguished among the english poets by the early exertion of their powers but the works of cowley alone were published in his childhood and therefore of him only can it be certain that his juvenile performances received no improvement from his maturer studies the pastorals were at last printed 1709 in tonsons miscellany in a volume which began with the pastorals of philips and ended with those of pope it seems natural for a young poet to initiate himself by pastorals which not professing to imitate real life require no experience and exhibiting only the simple operation of unmingled passions admit no subtle reasoning or deep inquiry popes pastorals are not however composed but with close thought they have reference to the time of the day the seasons of the year and the periods of human life the last that which turns the attention upon age and death was the authors favourite to tell of disappointment and misery to thicken the darkness of futurity and perplex the labyrinth of uncertainty has been always a delicious employment of the poets his preference was probably just i wish however that his fondness had not overlooked the line in which the zephyrs are made to lament in silence to charge these pastorals with want of invention is to require what was never intended the imitations are so ambitiously frequent that the writer evidently means rather to show his literature than his wit it is surely sufficient for an author of sixteen not only to be able to copy the poems of antiquity with judicious selection but to have obtained sufficient power of language and skill in metre to exhibit a series of versification which had in english poetry no precedent nor has since had an imitationjohnson  it is somewhat strange that in the pastorals of a young poet there should not be found a single rural image that is new but this i am afraid is the case in the pastorals before us the ideas of theocritus virgil and spenser are indeed here exhibited in language equally mellifluous and pure but the descriptions and sentiments are trite and common to this assertion formerly made dr johnson answered that no invention was intended he therefore allows the fact and the charge it is a confession of the very fault imputed to them there ought to have been invention it has been my fortune from my way of life4 to have seen many compositions of youths of sixteen years old far beyond these pastorals in point of genius and imagination though not perhaps of correctness their excellence indeed might be owing to having had such a predecessor as pope5 a mixture of british and grecian ideas may justly be deemed a blemish in these pastorals and propriety is certainly violated when he couples pactolus with thames and windsor with hybla6 complaints of immoderate heat and wishes to be conveyed to cooling caverns when uttered by the inhabitants of greece have a decorum and consistency which they totally lose in the character of a british shepherd7 and theocrites during the ardors of sirius must have heard the murmurings of a brook and the whispers of a pine with more homefelt pleasure than pope could possibly experience upon the same occasion pope himself informs us in a note that he judiciously omitted the following verse      and listning wolves grow milder as they hear  on account of the absurdity which spenser overlooked of introducing wolves into england but on this principle which is certainly a just one may it not be asked why he should speak the scene lying in windsor forest of the sultry sirius of the grateful clusters of grapes of a pipe of reeds the antique fistula of thanking ceres for a plentiful harvest of the sacrifice of lambs with many other instances that might be adduced to this purpose that pope however was sensible of the importance of adapting images to the scene of action is obvious from the following example of his judgment for in translating      audiit eurotas jussitque ediscere lauros  he has dexterously dropped the laurels appropriated to eurotas as he is speaking of the river thames and has rendered it      thames heard the numbers as he flowed along     and bade his willows learn the moving song  in the passages which pope has imitated from theocritus and his latin translator virgil he has merited but little applause upon the whole the principal merit of these pastorals consists in their correct and musical versification musical to a degree of which rhyme could hardly be thought capable and in giving the truest specimen of that harmony in english verse which is now become indispensably necessary and which has so forcibly and universally influenced the public ear as to have obliged every moderate rhymer to be at least melodious pope lengthened the abruptness of waller and at the same time contracted the exuberance of drydenwarton  dr johnson does not appear sufficiently attentive to the true character and nature of pastoral poetry no doubt it is natural for a young poet to initiate himself by pastorals for what youthful heart does not glow at the descriptions of rural nature and scenes that accord with its own innocency and cheerfulness but although pastorals do not in the sense of dr johnson imitate real life nor require any great insight into human passions and characters yet there are many things necessary in this species of composition more than dr johnson seems to require the chief thing is an eye for picturesque and rural scenery and an intimate acquaintance with those minute and particular appearances of nature which alone can give a lively and original colour to the painting of pastoral poetry to copy the common descriptions of spring or summer morning or evening or to iterate from virgil the same complaints of the same shepherds is not surely to write pastoral poetry it is also difficult to conceive where is the close thought with which johnson says popes pastorals are composed they are pleasing as copies of the poems of antiquity although they exhibit no striking taste in the selection and they certainly exhibit a series of musical versification which till their appearance had no precedent in english poetry if in particular passages i have ventured to remark that pope has introduced false thoughts and conceits let us remember that we ought not so much to wonder that he admitted any as that they were not more drydens earlier poems are infinitely more vitiated in this respect  wartons observations are very just but he does not seem sufficiently to discriminate between the softness of individual lines which is the chief merit of these pastorals and the general harmony of poetic numbers let it however be always remembered that pope gave the first idea of mellifluence and produced a softer and sweeter cadence than before belonged to the english couplet dr johnson thinks it will be in vain after pope to endeavour to improve the english versification and that it is now carried to the ne plus ultra of excellence8 this is an opinion the validity of which i must be permitted to doubt pope certainly gave a more correct and finished tone to the english versification but he sometimes wanted a variety of pause and his nice precision of every line prevented in a few instances a more musical flow of modulated passages but we are to consider what he did not what might be done and surely there cannot be two opinions respecting his improvement of the couplet though it does not follow that his general rhythm has no imperfection johnson seems to have depreciated or to have been ignorant of the metrical powers of some writers prior to pope his ear seems to have been caught chiefly by dryden and as popes versification was more equably couplet with couplet being considered not passage with passage connected than drydens he thought therefore that nothing could be added to popes versification i should think it the extreme of arrogance and folly to make my own ear the criterion of music but i cannot help thinking that dryden and of later days cowper are much more harmonious in their general versification than pope i ought also to mention a neglected poem not neglected on account of its versification but on account of its title and subjectpriors solomon whoever candidly compares these writers together unless his ear be habituated to a certain recurrence of pauses precisely at the end of a line will not though he will give the highest praise for compactness skill precision and force to the undivided couplets of pope separately consideredwill not i think assent to the position that in versification what he found brickwork he left marble i am not afraid to own that with the exception of the epistle to abelard as musical as it is pathetic the verses of pope want variety and on this account in some instances they want both force and harmony in variety and variety only let it be remembered i think pope deficient it has been doubted whether couplet verses ought ever to be broken i will appeal to pope himself whenever he has done so is there a judge of poetical cadence who will not say it is harmonious the instances are few but where they occur are they not beautiful if they had been too often repeated the effect would be destroyed but in long compositions might not a greater variety of pauses have effect does not the ear feel a lassitude at times an idea has been started by some critics that you might as well have unequal columns to your house as unequal couplets in verse this comparison however if it proves anything proves too much for no one will say that every two verses in a long poem should in quantity be exactly the same the syllables the same the pause the same this will not hold a moment in versification if it did then johnsons assertion falls to the ground for then dr darwin is a far better versifier than pope and a very little pains would make a much more consummate versificator than dr darwinbowles  of all popes various and very freelycensured writings there are none that appear to have met with a harsher or more fastidious reception at the hands of his commentators and critics than his pastorals without regarding them with a sufficient reference either to the time of life of the author or the objects he had in view in their composition they have considered them as deficient in originality and strength of thought because they do not more greatly abound in new and striking images but to say nothing of the unreasonableness of requiring new and striking images on a subject which has been obvious from the earliest ages to all mankind and has been the general theme of poetry in every country period and language it must be observed that it was not the intention of pope to rely upon the strength of his own powers or to attempt an original style of pastoral composition on the contrary he informs us at the close of his discourse that if those pastorals have any merit it is to be attributed to some good old authors whose works says he as i have had leisure to study so i hope i have not wanted care to imitate in conceding then to pope that he has exhibited the ideas of theocritus virgil and spenser in language equally mellifluous and pure dr warton has granted every thing which pope endeavoured to accomplish and the observation of johnson that no invention was intended is as far as the remark of warton affects the genius and character of pope a decisive answer nor although the scene be laid in windsor forest does there appear to be any impropriety in referring to a pipe of reeds the clusters of grapes the bounty of ceres and other objects connected with pastoral life and for which the poet has himself assigned a sufficient reason in the following discourse if he observes we would copy nature it would be useful to carry this idea along with us that pastoral is an image of what they call the golden age so that we are not to describe our shepherds as shepherds at this day really are but as they may be conceived then to have been when the best of men followed the employment to which he adds that an air of piety to the gods should shine through the poem which so visibly appears in all the works of antiquity and it ought to preserve some relish of the old way of writingroscoe  the manuscript of popes pastorals is still preserved among the richardson papers it was lent by mr t b hollis to wakefield who has noted the variations from the published text with minute fidelity richardson has done the same in his copy of the quarto of 1717 and gives this correct description of the handwriting of the originalthe manuscript title of the discourse on pastoral poetry viz an essay on pastoral and the title of the pastorals are written by mr pope in printing capitals so perfectly beautiful and so exactly imitated that one can hardly believe they are not really from the press the same of all the words which would have been printed in italics throughout the whole which are in common printing character the general being in italics beautifully formed so as in all to imitate a printed book but in a fine taste of type and form of the page and margin pope has written upon the manuscript mem this copy is that which passed through the hands of mr walsh mr congreve mr mainwaring dr garth mr granville mr southern sir h sheers sir william trumbull lord halifax lord wharton marquis of dorchester duke of bucks c only the third eclogue was written since some of these saw the other three which were written as they here stand with the essay anno 1704 Ætatis meæ 16 the alterations from this copy were upon the objections of some of these or my own in his published list of the persons who had read the pastorals in manuscript pope has added the names of wycherley and lord somers and omitted the names of congreve southern sir h sheers lord wharton the marquis of dorchester and the duke of buckingham his chief adviser seems to have been walsh who of all his admiring friends gave him he says the greatest encouragement i cannot pope wrote to him july 2 1706 omit the first opportunity of making you my acknowledgments for reviewing these papers of mine you have no less right to correct me than the same hand that raised a tree has to prune it the richardson collection contains a manuscript in which the poet has transcribed from his pastorals the various lines he thought defective and after stating his own objection to them and subjoining amended readings he referred the task of selection to walsh who has jotted down his decisions at the bottom of popes remarks both will be found in the notes on the passages to which the comments of the author and his critic relate  there is no evidence except the poets own assertion to prove that the pastorals were composed at the age of sixteen they had been seen by walsh before april 20 1705 if any dependence could be placed upon the letter of that date which he wrote to wycherly when returning the manuscript but the letter rests on the authority of pope alone and there is reason to question the correctness of the date the letter of walsh to wycherley concludes with the expression of a desire to be made acquainted with pope if adds walsh he will give himself the trouble any morning to call at my house i shall be very glad to read the verses over with him the next letter is from walsh to pope and the opening sentence shows that his correspondence with the poet had only just commenced it appears from what follows that they had met in london that walsh had carried popes verses into the country and that these verses were three of the pastorals walsh expresses a hope that when he returns to town pope will have some fresh verses to show him for i make no doubt he says but any one who writes so well must write more these particulars evidently refer to the period when walsh first became acquainted with the pastorals and undertook to criticise them but the correspondence on the subject begins on june 24 1706 whence we should infer that it was in april 1706 and not in 1705 that wycherley introduced pope and his pastorals to walsh the poet would have departed from his usual practice if he had not falsified dates to exaggerate his precocity that he was past seventeen when he first exhibited his pastorals to his friends is confirmed by a passage from the letter in which george granville sketches the character of wycherley and invites an unnamed correspondent to meet him he shall bring with him if you will says granville a young poet newly inspired in the neighbourhood of coopers hill whom he and walsh have taken under their wing his name is pope he is not above seventeen or eighteen years of age and promises miracles if he goes on as he has begun in the pastoral way as virgil first tried his strength we may hope to see english poetry vie with the roman and this swan of windsor sing as sweetly as the mantuan9 whatever may be the true date of the pastorals a portion of them certainly existed before april 20 1706 on which day tonson the bookseller wrote to pope i have lately seen a pastoral of yours in mr walshs and congreves hands which is extremely fine and is generally approved of by the best judges in poetry i remember i have formerly seen you at my shop and am sorry i did not improve my acquaintance with you if you design your poem for the press no person shall be more careful in printing of it nor no one can give a greater encouragement to it three years elapsed before the pastorals saw the light when tonson became the publisher and they appeared on may 2 1709 in his sixth miscellany the preface which walsh had read in manuscript and which he calls very learned and judicious did not come out till 1717 and then bore the title of a discourse on pastoral poetry johnson repeating the language of walsh says that it is learned in a high degree whereas it was avowedly compiled from two or three recent essayists and demanded nothing from the poet to which the term learning could be properly applied he owed to his secondhand authorities the arbitrary and pedantic rules which were framed from the practice of the ancients and which were employed by the mechanical critics of his day to repress the free forms of modern genius the style would have been remarkable for its maturity if as pope professed it had been the produce of sixteen but the discourse was not printed till he was twentynine and he certainly did not send it uncorrected into the world  it must appear strange says de quincey that pope at twentyone should choose to come forward for the first time with a work composed at sixteen a difference of five years at that stage of life is of more effect than of twenty at a later and his own expanding judgment could hardly fail to inform him that his pastorals were by far the worst of his works in reality let us not deny that had pope never written anything else his name would not have been known as a name even of promise but would probably have been redeemed from oblivion by some satirist or writer of a dunciad10 expanding judgment is often a feeble antidote to the partiality of an author for his own compositions and pope always spoke of his pastoral effusions with fond complacency he did indeed pretend to regret their publication there was some delay in bringing out the miscellany and on november 1 1708 he wrote thus to cromwell but now i talk of the critics i have good news to tell you concerning myself for which i expect you should congratulate with me it is that beyond all my expectations and far above my demerits i have been most mercifully reprieved by the sovereign power of jacob tonson from being brought forth to public punishment and have been respited from time to time from the hands of those barbarous executioners of the muses whom i was just now speaking of it often happens that guilty poets like other guilty criminals when once they are known and proclaimed deliver themselves into the hands of justice only to prevent others from doing it more to their disadvantage and not out of any ambition to spread their fame by being executed in the face of the world which is a fame but of short continuance pope was in his twentyfirst year an age at which frankness commonly preponderates and he already abounded in the ostentatious profession of sentiments he did not entertain he had circulated the pastorals among numerous authors he had invited their criticisms he had continued to correct the poems with fastidious care he retained to the last a high opinion of their merit and it is impossible to credit his insinuation that he did not design them for the press and that he only printed them to avoid a surreptitious edition which nobody gave any sign of preparing the hypocrisy broke out again when the miscellany had appeared nothing wrote wycherley may 17 1709 has lately been better received by the public than your part of it you have only displeased the critics by pleasing them too well having not left them a word to say for themselves against you and your performances in earnest all the best judges of good sense or poetry are admirers of yours and like your part of the book so well that the rest is liked the worse pope replied i shall be satisfied if i can lose my time agreeably this way without losing my reputation as for gaining any i am as indifferent in the matter as falstaff was and may say of fame as he did of honour if it comes it comes unlooked for and theres an end ont this affectation of indifference was kept up by him to the end of his days yet he was all the time composing polishing and publishing his whole existence was passed in painstaking and almost drudging authorship he left no means untried dishonest as well as fair to sustain extend and perpetuate his reputation and he pursued every person with inveterate malice who presumed to question his poetical supremacy in spite of his boasted apathy there cannot be found in the annals of the irritable race a more anxious jealous intriguing candidate for fame  in his letter to wycherley walsh remarked of popes pastorals it is no flattery at all to say that virgil had written nothing so good at his age walsh must have been thinking of virgils eclogues which are his most juvenile productions though he is not supposed to have commenced them till he was thirty years old pope admired them to excess and in his manhood he held to the belief that it was difficult to find any fault in them11 his desire was to repeat with slight variations this ancient pattern which he thought perfection virgil himself was a plagiarist but the eclogues have more originality than the pastorals the descriptions of both virgil and pope are artificial but virgil has heartfelt touches from the life of which the pastorals afford no trace the taste of both was unformed but the conceits of virgil are accompanied by a poetic vein which was not yet equally developed in pope since the pastorals are an imitation of the eclogues it might be expected as usually happens in such cases that the copy would have the defects of the model in an exaggerated degree pope could not disguise from himself that his verses were the echo of an echo and in a letter of july 2 1706 he begged walsh to tell him sincerely whether he had not stretched the license of borrowing too far walsh admitted in his answer that some persons to whom he had shown the manuscript had made this objection but he professed not to share it and comforted his friend by the assurance that in all the common subjects of poetry the thoughts are so obvious that whoever writes last must write things like what have been said before roscoe has repeated the plea and speaks of the unreasonableness of expecting new images on a topic which has been the general theme of poetry in every country period and language he forgot that rural scenery and life had furnished abundant novelty to thomson cowper wordsworth and crabbe whose pictures are as fresh and unhacknied as if theocritus and virgil had never lived he that walks behind said michael angelo can never go before and originality was impossible when popes only notion of legitimate pastoral was a slavish mimicry of classical remains had he drawn his materials from the english landscape before his eyes from the english characters about his doors and from the english usages and modes of thought in his own day he would have discovered a thousand particulars in which he had not been anticipated by greeks and romans he neglected this inexhaustible territory and bestowed so little attention upon the realities around him that though his descriptions are confined to the barest generalities they are not unfrequently false  after contending that the triteness of the pastorals was inevitable roscoe puts forth a second defence to save the precocity of their author the observation he says of johnson that no invention was intended is as far as the remark of warton affects the genius and character of pope a decisive answer this must mean that he copied from choice and not from necessity which is contradicted by the confession of pope himself who acknowledges that he leant upon his masters because he was unable to go alone12 without his testimony we should have been driven to the same conclusion since every great poet whose youthful verses have been preserved began by imitating his predecessors and it would be absurd in defiance of a general law to assume that pope was gifted with a juvenile originality which his early works belie if he had been capable of higher flights it would have done him no honour to have employed his melodious verse in piecing together stale vapid and often paltry ideas  johnson to be sure was of opinion that pope in his pastorals had copied the poems of antiquity with judicious selection but this approbation he does not seem to deserve a large volume might be composed consisting solely of faults which had their counterpart in works of genius the homage pope paid to famous names seduced his immature taste into the admiration of many a vicious passage and he endeavoured to emulate or outdo the frigid and hyperbolical conceits of his prototypes throughout the pastorals for instance the phenomena which are the effects of the seasons are ascribed to the presence or absence of the nymphs whom his minstrels celebrate in spring the skies mourn in showers the birds are hushed and the flowers are closed till delia smiles when forthwith the skies brighten the flowers bloom and the birds sing in summer the shepherd boasts that the breezes shall wait upon his heroine and blow in the places where she walks that the trees where she sits shall crowd into a shade that the flowers shall rise up from the soil where she treads and that vegetation shall flourish where she turns her eyes in autumn the birds neglect their song the leaves fall from the trees and the flowers droop because delia has gone away in winter the heavens are obscured by clouds the verdure has withered the flocks refuse to graze the meadows the bees neglect their honey and the streams overflow with tears because daphne is dead this last pastoral which was popes favourite turns mainly on the notion that winter is the consequence of heaven and earth deploring the death of mrs tempest such says sandys is the sweetness and power of poesy as it makes that appear which were in prose both false and ridiculous to resemble the truth poetic fancy is separated from extravagance by narrow boundaries but there must be some affinity to truth or the understanding is repelled instead of the imagination being captivated no ideas can have less to recommend them than the hollow rhapsodies of the pastorals for they are at once obvious and absurd poetry said wordsworth is the image of man and nature and popes fantastic superlatives are the image of neither they never approximate to the exaggeration of fervid passion but both grief and love are without the semblance of genuine feeling and only excited the derision of those who looked for a meaning beneath the glitter of words pray tell me the name of him i love wrote lady mary pierrepont afterwards the celebrated lady mary wortley that i may sigh to the woods and groves hereabouts and teach it to the echo above all let me know whether it is most proper to walk in the woods increasing the winds with my sighs or to sit by a purling stream swelling the rivulet with my tears13 this happy ridicule of a style of composition which pope acknowledged ought to be full of the greatest simplicity in nature was written a few months after the pastorals were published and appears to have been suggested by them the clever girl drew her notions from life and the perceptions of the young author were sophisticated by books bowles believed that pope was influenced by the false taste of cowley at that time prevalent cowleys popularity however had ceased for some years the fashion he set had passed away and dryden reigned in his stead he is sunk in his reputation said this illustrious successor in 1700 because he could never forego any conceit which came in his way but swept like a dragnet great and small for this reason though he must always be thought a great poet he is no longer esteemed a good writer and for ten impressions which his works have had in many successive years yet at present a hundred books are scarcely purchased once a twelvemonth14 the conceits in popes pastorals were derived from other sources he took little from cowley and borrowed none of his peculiarities  pope says in his discourse that his pastorals have as much variety in respect of the several seasons as spensers that to add to this variety the several times of the day are observed the rural employments in each season or time of day and the rural scenes or places proper to such employments not without some regard to the several ages of man and the different passions proper to each age johnson has in consequence accorded to the pastorals the praise of being composed with close thought but the conception was very imperfectly executed and in part is puerile spring and morning summer and noon autumn and evening winter and night are coupled together as if each season was specially characterised by a single portion of the day selected for no other reason than because the order of succession is the same between the several ages of man and the seasons there is an obvious resemblance which has furnished similes from time immemorial but there is no propriety in peopling a spring scene with children and a winter scene with the old since all ages figure together in the world and manifest the feelings which belong to their years whether it happens to be winter or spring if the plan had any merit pope did not conform to it the shepherds who sing in spring are grown up the shepherd who sings in summer is a boy winter is a funereal lament for a young lady who was cut off in her prime and has not the most distant reference to old age the different passions proper to each time of life which pope professes to have distinguished are altogether overlooked love is the sole passion which animates the actors in spring summer and autumn and the shepherd in winter celebrates the departed daphne in the same loverlike rhapsodies which prevail throughout the three preceding poems the rural employments proper to each season have been equally forgotten sheepkeeping and versemaking are the only occupations though the poet declares he had changed the scene to suit the changing employment and represents the first pastoral as sung in a valley the second on the banks of a stream the third on a hill and the fourth in a grove in place of the variety to which he lays claim we have a general sameness and if he had kept faithfully to the outline he sketched he would with his mode of composition have done little towards diversifying the series he wanted the intimate acquaintance with those minute and particular appearances of nature which as bowles says can alone give a lively and original colour to the painting of pastoral poetry the scenes of his four laysthe valley the stream the hill and the groveare just mentioned and nothing more there is no attempt to depict them to the mind and it does not contribute to variety simply to tell the reader that he is now in a valley and now upon a hill the seasons themselves are only marked by the superficial notorious circumstances which convey no pleasure in the repetition unless they are accompanied by the nice discriminating touches of an exact observer to say that showers descend that birds sing that crocuses blow and that trees put forth their leaves in spring supplies the mind with no fresh ideas nor assists in giving a new beauty and a more definite form to the ideas we possessed before the genius of pope was in another direction and when we contrast the picturesque details of thomsons seasons with the blank commonplaces of the pastorals we perceive how wide is the interval between the elegant harmonious versifier and the genuine poet of nature sheep are twice mentioned in popes winter once at ver 5      now sleeping flocks in their soft fleeces lie  and again at ver 37      for her the flocks refuse their verdant food  widely different in life and vividness are the lines in which thomson paints the flocks under their true wintry aspect when the snow is falling and has buried up the herbage                              the bleating kind     eye the bleak heaven and next the glistning earth     with looks of dumb despair  in a verse which is not original but which is more descriptive than usual pope speaks of the breezes which in spring blow gently among the osiers      let vernal airs through trembling osiers play  this is flat by the side of the passage in thomsons spring where he describes the effects of the lightest current of air upon the aspen                                 not a breath     is heard to quiver through the closing woods     or rustling turn the manytwinkling leaves     of aspen tall  the epithet closing is happily applied to woods just bursting into foliage and the epithet manytwinkling is exquisitely appropriate to the leaves of the aspen which when every other tree is still and the air can hardly be felt to stir dance up and down incessantly with an endless play of light and shadow and rustle as they wave joyously to and fro nature scarce affords a prettier sight or a more soothing sound these comparisons might be extended through pages and they are fair examples of popes inferiority in a style which was unsuited to his turn of mind and of which he had never formed adequate ideas  roscoe could perceive no impropriety in transferring classical customs and mythology to the plains of windsor he conceived that every objection was obviated by the announcement of pope that pastoral is an image of the golden age which leaves us to infer that during this happy interlude our british shepherds adopted the manners and religion of greece but the golden age was itself an exploded fable which had lost its hold on the imagination and even if englishmen in the eighteenth century could have been beguiled by the dream they could not at least have been enthralled by the fiction that paradise was renewed in england under the auspices of heathenism the theory of a golden age introduced a second inconsistency into the pastorals without remedying the first bad as is the defence it cannot be pleaded on popes behalf for discarding in his winter the notion of some remote and undefined era he has laid the scene in a particular year of the reign of queen anne and makes lycidas declare that he will often sacrifice a lamb to the deceased mrs tempest who died in 1703 there are several other incongruities zodiac is too hard a term to be remembered correctly by one of popes shepherds a circumstance which is intended to denote the little learning he possessed and the same ignorant shepherd proceeds to talk as glibly of hybla and cynthus and idaliaa groves as if they had been neighbouring parishes  one characteristic of the pastorals has been universally allowedthe peculiar softness of the versification which was considered by pope to be an essential quality of this species of composition he told spence that he had scarce ever bestowed more labour in tuning his lines15 he must have had less facility when he was learning the art than when he was thoroughly practised in it and since authors are apt to estimate the result by the amount of toil it has cost them the greater pains he expended upon his early efforts may have been the reason that he esteemed the pastorals as the most correct in the versification and musical in the numbers of all his works he certainly went forwards in some of his later pieces windsor forest and the epistle of eloisa to abelard are finer specimens of melody than the pastorals the poetic harmony displayed by pope in his youth refuted an axiom which dryden propounded in his lines to the memory of oldham      o early ripe to thy abundant store     what could advancing age have added more     it might what nature never gives the young     have taught the smoothness of thy native tongue     but satire needs not this and wit will shine     through the harsh cadence of a rugged line  many examples might be quoted in support of drydens position but he had failed to discover what the later history of poetry has rendered clear that where there is not a defective ear the softness or ruggedness of juvenile verses depends upon the model the imitative faculty of boyhood is never more at home than in catching the trick of metrical harmony dryden had used the heroic measure with consummate skill and no one who came after him could fall into the harsh cadence of oldhams satires and cowleys davideis or rest satisfied with the combination of rough and smooth in the productions of sandys and denham the music of the mighty master was on every tongue when pope began to lisp in numbers i learned versification he said to spence wholly from drydens works who had improved it much beyond any of our former poets and would probably have brought it to its perfection had not he been unhappily obliged to write so often in haste16 what dryden did for pope pope did for the next generation and to compose mellifluous verses became the common attainment of ordinary scribblers cowper in his table talk has specially noticed this effect of popes writings      but he his musical finesse was such     so nice his ear so delicate his touch     made poetry a mere mechanic art     and every warbler has his tune by heart  in metrical skill pope was thought by most persons to have surpassed all his predecessors he is the most harmonious poet said voltaire that england ever had he has reduced the sharp hissings of the english trumpet to the sweet sounds of the flute17 voltaire doubtless found this opinion prevalent in the circle he frequented during his residence in england from 1720 to 1728 for his own knowledge of our language would not have enabled him to distinguish the nicer shades of melody the english critics confirm his decision johnson declared that the versification of the pastorals had no precedent nor has since had an imitation warton pronounced that it was musical to a degree of which rhyme could hardly be thought capable and bowles admitted that pope had made the english couplet infinitely more smooth to the few who censured his poetry as too uniformly musical and as glutting the ear with unvaried sweetness johnson replied i suspect this objection to be the cant of those who judge by principles rather than perception and who would even themselves have less pleasure in his works if he had tried to relieve attention by studied discords or affected to break his lines and vary his pauses18 bowles sided with the cavillers as johnson deemed them and held that the want of breaks and of variety in the pauses produced a monotony of sound lord kames on the contrary asserted that pope was eminent for variety of versification and that the variety of his pauses was the source of the variety of his melody19 i agree with the dissentients who think that his metre is prone to a cloying mannerism but i believe that the defect is ascribed by bowles to the wrong cause any one who compares the imperial march of the metre in the vanity of human wishes with the sweet but less majestic deserted village will perceive that the swell of the heroic measure is capable of wide degrees a poet judges of the harmony of his verses by trying them on his ear and the tendency is to set them all to the same tune this was popes error he has in general though not always intermixed the pauses but he has not varied sufficiently the swell and movement of his lines dryden in whose admirable ear as gray remarks the music of our old versification still sounded20 rings the changes with wonderful ease and spirit and is by turns soft and stately lively and solemn familiar and sonorous while he preserves through all his transitions a freedom a flow and an elasticity which never flag his negligent lines which are often imputed to haste have been thought by good writers to be intended to avoid the surfeit of an equable strain sometimes says dr trapp it is not only allowable but beautiful to run into harsh and unequal numbers mr dryden himself does it and we may be sure he knew when he did it as well as we could tell him in a work intended for pleasure variety justifies the breach of almost any rule provided it be done but rarely21 there is extreme exaggeration in the language of bowles when he states that pope gave the first idea of mellifluence lines as melodious may be counted in dryden by the hundred pope only maintained a more continuous softness or as johnson puts it he discovered by perusing the works of dryden the most perfect fabric of english verse and habituated himself to that only which he found the best22 this constantly recurring note however attractive in itself must always appear a retrograde system to those who appreciate the richer music of more diversified modulations the sameness of popes metre was the reason that every warbler had his tune by heart and imitated it so readily there was a complexity in the incessant rise and fall of drydens lines which mechanical versemakers could only copy imperfectly the uniformity of pope gave them little trouble the repetition soon fixed the brief lesson in their minds and the petty warblers almost rivalled their original in sound though they were far enough from approaching the beauty of his language the terseness of his style the felicity of his ideas and the weight of his sense  as the pastorals of philips opened the sixth volume of tonsons miscellany de quiucey conjectures that popes pastorals may have been placed at the end of the volume by his own desire both sets of verses by this arrangement were more likely to attract attention and invite comparison pope appears not to have felt any jealousy at the outset speaking of philipss pastorals in a letter to cromwell on october 28 1710 a year and a half after the miscellany was published he said he agreed with the tatler that we had no better eclogues in our language he particularly commended the lines which describe the musician playing on the harp and added that nothing could be objected to them except that they were too lofty for pastoral he changed his tone after the essays on pastoral poetry had appeared in the guardian these papers commenced with no 22 and in no 23 for april 7 1713 some passages are quoted from philips to illustrate the qualities appropriate to the pastoral style in no 30 there are more quotations from philips to the same purpose and he and spenser are singled out as the sole cultivators of this species of composition who have copied and improved the beauties of the ancients the eulogium reached its climax in no 32 where it is asserted that there have been only four true masters of the art in above two thousand yearstheocritus who left his dominions to virgil virgil who left his to his son spenser and spenser who was succeeded by his eldest born philips it is not known who contributed the essays but it has been conjectured without any evidence that they proceeded from tickell there cannot be a question that the author had a friendship for philips or he would not have ranked him with theocritus virgil and spenser and it is equally certain that he was not an admirer of the pastorals of pope which are passed over in silence and which violate the canons laid down by the critic i must observe he says that our countrymen have so good an opinion of the ancients and think so modestly of themselves that the generality of pastoral writers have either stolen all from the greeks and romans or so servilely imitated their manners and customs as makes them very ridiculous23 the method of philips is adduced in advantageous contrast he is commended for changing the details with the scene and introducing english ideas into english eclogues a few months earlier similar praise had been bestowed upon him by addison in the spectator for october 30 1712 when we are at school said addison in his essay it is necessary for us to be acquainted with the system of pagan theology and we may be allowed to enliven a theme or point an epigram with a heathen god but no thought is beautiful which is not just and no thought can be just which is not founded in truth or at least in that which passes for such if any are of opinion that there is a necessity of admitting these classical legends into our serious compositions in order to give them a more poetical turn i would recommend to their consideration the pastorals of mr philips one would have thought it impossible for this kind of poetry to have subsisted without fauns and satyrs woodnymphs and waternymphs with all the tribe of rural deities but we see he has given a new life and a more natural beauty to this way of writing by substituting in the place of these antiquated fables the superstitious mythology which prevails among the shepherds of our own country addison had previously commenced the reformation by excluding pagan machinery from his campaign it needed but a small amount of taste to share his opinions and the writer in the guardian can hardly be charged with hostility to pope for not commending pastorals which apart from their melodious language were little better than a medley of unnatural compliments and unmeaning mythology contemporary criticism is more often corrupted by the kindness of friendship than by the spite of enmity but the effect is sometimes the same and the undue exaltation of philips increased the comparative contempt which was cast upon pope he had reason to be annoyed and it was not much compensation that the prettiest lines of his january and may were quoted in one of the papers on pastoral to show that fairies could be rendered attractive in verse  the scheme pope devised for redressing the wrong was to send a paper to the guardian in which he ridiculed the pastorals of his rival and applauded his own with an unexampled and unequalled artifice of irony says dr johnson though he himself has always the advantage he gives the preference to philips in the opening sentence of the essay pope is described as a gentleman whose character it is that he takes the greatest care of his works before they are published and the least concern for them afterwards24 he followed his invariable habit of boasting his preeminence in the very virtue he was defying and attached this vaunt to a criticism in which his morbid concern for his works had induced him to become his own reviewer and eulogist he was liberal in his selflaudation and assured the public that though his pastorals might not fulfil the strict definition laid down in the guardian they were like virgils something better to prove the inferiority of philips he selected three of his worst passages and contrasted them with three of his own he picked out a dozen foolish lines from his rival and alleged that they were specimens of his ordinary manner he subjoined some ludicrous imitations of his style which are only not an outrageous caricature because they have no resemblance at all to the original the faults of philips did not require to be exaggerated the absurdities of his satirist are different in kind but they are not less in degree some defects they had in common and as selflove is blind pope did not perceive that most of his comments recoiled upon himself he objected that philips had introduced wolves into england where they formerly existed and the critic forgot that the imaginary golden age which he maintained in his discourse was the only era of pastoral must be assigned to a period long anterior to their extirpation or if the piping shepherds who composed and chanted poems were to be considered as existing personages credibility was not more violated in supposing that windsor forest was still haunted by wolves than by heathen gods and goddessesin imagining the lambs to be preyed upon by a wild beast than in picturing christian bards employed in sacrificing them to mrs tempest with an exact observance of pagan rites he took especial credit for having kept to the circumstances proper to a particular season of the year and a certain time of the day and exposed the ignorance of philips who says he by a poetical creation hath raised up finer beds of flowers than the most industrious gardener his roses lilies and daffodils blow in the same season pope might have remembered that in his own pastorals he had made roses violets and crocuses bloom together which drew from george steevens the remark that he has rarely mentioned flowers without some mistake of the kind the nicest observers of nature are not exempt from these oversights the swine in ivanhoe feed on acorns under the trees in the middle of summer and though walter scott at the end of the monastery alluded playfully to the anachronism he never cared to correct the error a more important charge in which pope is most of all open to retaliation was that philips pastorals gave manifest proof of his knowledge of books while it was admitted that his competitor had imitated some single thoughts of the ancients philips was held up as a wholesale depredator he does indeed abound in the stock ideas which had served a hundred versifiers he is a warbler who whistles an old tune but he is not without a few notes which have a semblance of originality and these are wanting in his accuser inferior to the pastorals of pope in polish and versification the pastorals of philips are on the whole superior in their substance the trial of skill between the musician and the nightingale which forms the subject of the fifth pastoral is narrated with singular sweetness and may still be read with pleasure in true poetic feeling it is much beyond anything in the pastorals of his scoffing critic philips owed his advantage to his maturer years and not to the brilliancy of his talents he was thirtyfour when tonsons miscellany appeared and pope was but twentyone the powers of philips remained stationary and he ranks low among the minor poets pope quickly ripened into genius and reigned without a competitor the exaggerated panegyrics of the guardian could not confer a reputation upon philips he did not deserve and pope derived none of his celebrity from the gross expedient of exalting himself and decrying his antagonist there is nothing which is less affected by unjust praise and unjust detraction than an authors works they are there to speak for themselves and no amount of petty artifices can long raise them higher or sink them lower than they merit  pope was a contributor to the guardian and on cordial terms with the editor but he could not ask to have a paper inserted in which he had drawn a comparison between his own pastorals and those of his rival and awarded himself the palm he therefore sent the criticism anonymously and steele as we are told by warburton not discovering that the praise of philips and the censure of pope were both ironical showed the manuscript to the latter and assured him that he would never publish any paper where one of the club was complimented at the expense of another his ingenuous ally affected magnanimity and prevailed upon steele to print the essay the irony which could not be detected by the wits at buttons might well escape less cultivated minds ayre in his memoirs of pope in 1745 and dilworth in 1760 both believed that the criticism was to be interpreted literally that steele was the author of it and that it was dictated by friendship for philips small as was the ability of these biographers they may be supposed to have shared the common opinion this continued to be the accepted doctrine in the next generation and the celebrated circle in which hannah more lived were unanimous in holding that the essay was not satirical the whole criticism she wrote august 4 1783 appears to me a burlesque but i have some reason to think i am in the wrong as i have all the world against me that a writer of so pure a taste could be in earnest when he talks of the elegance of diggon davy and exalts all that trash of philipss whose simplicity is silliness i cannot bring myself to believe she found it still more difficult to believe that the author could be serious in asserting that hobbinol and lobbin are names agreeable to the delicacy of an english ear25 hannah more judged of philips by the wretched extracts in the guardian her accomplished friends could hardly have admired them and it must have been for a different reason that the purpose of the essay was misunderstood warton says that the misapprehension arose from the skill with which the irony was conducted it would be more natural to infer that the execution was defective when the vast majority of literary men mistook the design the satire in fact is imperfectly sustained and passages which the author intended for irony appeared to the reader to be plain common sense mr pope he says of himself hath fallen into the same error with virgil his names are borrowed from theocritus and virgil which are improper to the scenes of his pastorals he introduces daphnis alexis and thyrsis on british plains as virgil had done before him on the mantuan habit had reconciled pope to the affectation of calling english shepherds daphnis and thyrsis but the names as de quincey says are rank with childishness and the public who felt the practice to be absurd concluded that the censure was real it may said pope be observed as a farther beauty of this pastoral that the words nymph dryad naiad faun cupid or satyr are not once mentioned through the whole which was a sneer at addisons commendation of philips for rejecting those dreary nonentities but the public who had been nauseated with them could not detect a covert sarcasm in the repetition of the praise by the writer in the guardian the circumstance which seemed to warton to render the irony transparent was the remark that philips had with great judgment described wolves in england but the ridicule was based upon ignorance and must have been lost upon every one who was aware that wolves abounded in the antique period to which the pastorals referred bowles who knew that the paper was ironical yet imagined that pope was serious in the opening portion where it is asserted that virgil has not above a couple of true pastorals and that theocritus has scarcely more this part however of the essay was in the same sarcastic vein with the rest the previous critic in the guardian had laid down the rule that a pastoral should reflect the golden age of innocence and pope to deprive philips of the benefit of the definition endeavoured to show that theocritus and virgil had hardly ever conformed to it he did not mean seriously to admit that his competitor was a more genuine pastoral poet than virgil and theocritus his object was to throw ridicule on the definition itself albeit he adopted it in his discourse on pastoral poetry when he was no longer engaged in disparaging philips  nothing can be clearer than that pope was instigated to write the essay in the guardian by his jealousy of the praise which had been bestowed upon his rival the course he took was discreditable and warburton without attempting a direct apology pretends that the incident which influenced the poet was the misrepresentations made of him to addison by philips ruffhead adds that the calumny consisted in the assertion that pope was engaged in the intrigues of the tory ministry this would be a good reason for his exposing the misstatement but would be a poor excuse for his writing an anonymous attack upon philipss pastorals and a panegyric upon his own the defence which would be inadequate if it was true is indubitably incorrect the account of warburton did not appear till philips was dead pope while philips was living published an account in the shape of a letter to caryll the date and contents of which prove that philips did not bring his charge against pope till a full year after the paper had been printed in the guardian26 the poet adds that when they meet he will inform caryll of the secret grounds of philipss malignity and warburton himself subjoins in a note these grounds were mr popes writing the ironical comparison between his own and philipss pastorals the strong presumption from the nature of the case that pope was actuated by literary envy is thus confirmed the criticism in the guardian was not provoked by the malignity of philips but the bitterness of philips was the consequence of the criticism in 1790 mr j c walker the italian scholar sent to the gentlemans magazine an alleged remark of philips to the same effect when the comparison says mr walker between the pastorals of pope and philips appeared philips was secretary to primate boulter and then in ireland dining one day with the officers of the prerogative court the comparison became the subject of conversation and philips said he knew it was written by pope adding i wonder why the little crooked bastard should attack me who never offended him either in word or deed this i had from a gentleman who was present27 if the conversation ever occurred the gentleman was mistaken in supposing that the criticism was recent for the paper in the guardian came out in 1713 and it was not till more than ten years afterwards that philips went with archbishop boulter to ireland the story is unnecessary to prove that pope was the aggressor which is sufficiently evident from independent testimony unhappily for himself he began at the outset of his career to stir up those enmities which were the torment of his existence by his attack upon dennis in the essay on criticism he invited the scurrility of that rabid pamphleteer and by what bowles calls his unmanly hostility to philips he was reduced to the shame of being scared away from buttons by the no less unmanly retaliation of his victim who at some period of the quarrel hung up a birch and declared that he would use it on his rival arcadian if he showed his face in the coffeeroom  footnotes  footnote 1 there was only one paper  footnote 2 warburton implies that addisons remark to pope was made immediately after the essay appeared in the guardian in which case pope could have lost no time in avowing that he was the author of the criticism when once it was in print for addison had no suspicion of him from internal evidence he did not says spence discover mr popes style in the letter on pastorals which he published in the guardian but then that was a disguised style  footnote 3 the effect of reality and truth became conspicuous even when the intention was to show them grovelling and degraded gays pastorals became popular and were read with delight as just representations of rural manners and occupations by those who had no interest in the rivalry of the poets nor knowledge of the critical disputejohnson  footnote 4 warton was master of winchester school  footnote 5 but if pope had no invention and had exhibited in his pastorals no new or striking images how could his example have led the way to others in point of genius and imagination whatever it might have done in point of correctnessroscoe  footnote 6 they are not coupled but contradistinguished and surely the poet might draw a contrast from greece without being chargeable with a faulty mixture of british and grecian

hist vol vii 713     a discourse  on  pastoral poetry1   there are not i believe a greater number of any sort of verses than of those which are called pastorals nor a smaller than of those which are truly so it therefore seems necessary to give some account of this kind of poem and it is my design to comprise in this short paper the substance of those numerous dissertations the critics have made on the subject without omitting any of their rules in my own favour you will also find some points reconciled about which they seem to differ and a few remarks which i think have escaped their observation  the original of poetry is ascribed to that age which succeeded the creation of the world and as the keeping of flocks seems to have been the first employment of mankind the most ancient sort of poetry was probably pastoral2 it is natural to imagine that the leisure of those ancient shepherds admitting and inviting some diversion none was so proper to that solitary and sedentary life as singing and that in their songs they took occasion to celebrate their own felicity from hence a poem was invented and afterwards improved to a perfect image of that happy time which by giving us an esteem for the virtues of a former age might recommend them to the present and since the life of shepherds was attended with more tranquillity than any other rural employment the poets chose to introduce their persons from whom it received the name of pastoral  a pastoral is an imitation of the action of a shepherd or one considered under that character the form of this imitation is dramatic or narrative or mixed of both3 the fable simple the manners not too polite nor too rustic the thoughts are plain yet admit a little quickness and passion but that short and flowing the expression humble yet as pure as the language will afford neat but not florid easy and yet lively in short the fable manners thoughts and expressions are full of the greatest simplicity in nature  the complete character of this poem consists in simplicity4 brevity and delicacy the two first of which render an eclogue natural and the last delightful  if we would copy nature it may be useful to take this idea along with us that pastoral is an image of what they call the golden age so that we are not to describe our shepherds as shepherds at this day really are but as they may be conceived then to have been when the best of men followed the employment5 to carry this resemblance yet further it would not be amiss to give these shepherds some skill in astronomy as far as it may be useful to that sort of life and an air of piety to the gods should shine through the poem which so visibly appears in all the works of antiquity and it ought to preserve some relish of the old way of writing the connection should be loose the narrations and descriptions short6 and the periods concise yet it is not sufficient that the sentences only be brief the whole eclogue should be so too for we cannot suppose poetry in those days to have been the business of men but their recreation at vacant hours7  but with respect to the present age nothing more conduces to make these composures natural than when some knowledge in rural affairs is discovered8 this may be made to appear rather done by chance than on design and sometimes is best shown by inference lest by too much study to seem natural we destroy that easy simplicity from whence arises the delight for what is inviting in this sort of poetry as fontenelle observes proceeds not so much from the idea of that business as of the tranquillity of a country life  we must therefore use some illusion to render a pastoral delightful and this consists in exposing the best side only of a shepherds life and in concealing its miseries9 nor is it enough to introduce shepherds discoursing together in a natural way but a regard must be had to the subject that it contain some particular beauty in itself and that it be different in every eclogue besides in each of them a designed scene or prospect is to be presented to our view which should likewise have its variety10 this variety is obtained in a great degree by frequent comparisons drawn from the most agreeable objects of the country by interrogations to things inanimate by beautiful digressions but those short sometimes by insisting a little on circumstances and lastly by elegant turns on the words which render the numbers extremely sweet and pleasing as for the numbers themselves though they are properly of the heroic measure they should be the smoothest the most easy and flowing imaginable  it is by rules like these that we ought to judge of pastoral and since the instructions given for any art are to be delivered as that art is in perfection they must of necessity be derived from those in whom it is acknowledged so to be it is therefore from the practice of theocritus and virgil the only undisputed authors of pastoral that the critics have drawn the foregoing notions concerning it  theocritus excels all others in nature and simplicity the subjects of his idyllia are purely pastoral but he is not so exact in his persons having introduced reapers and fishermen11 as well as shepherds12 he is apt to be too long in his descriptions of which that of the cup in the first pastoral is a remarkable instance13 in the manners he seems a little defective for his swains are sometimes abusive and immodest and perhaps too much inclining to rusticity for instance in his fourth and fifth idyllia but it is enough that all others learnt their excellencies from him and that his dialect alone has a secret charm in it which no other could ever attain  virgil who copies theocritus refines upon his original14 and in all points where judgment is principally concerned he is much superior to his master though some of his subjects are not pastoral in themselves but only seem to be such they have a wonderful variety in them15 which the greek was a stranger to16 he exceeds him in regularity and brevity and falls short of him in nothing but simplicity and propriety of style the first of which perhaps was the fault of his age and the last of his language  among the moderns their success has been greatest who have most endeavoured to make these ancients their pattern the most considerable genius appears in the famous tasso and our spenser tasso in his aminta has far excelled all the pastoral writers as in his gierusalemme he has outdone the epic poets of his country but as this piece seems to have been the original of a new sort of poem the pastoral comedy in italy it cannot so well be considered as a copy of the ancients17 spensers calendar in mr drydens opinion is the most complete work of this kind which any nation has produced ever since the time of virgil18 not but that he may be thought imperfect in some few points his eclogues are somewhat too long if we compare them with the ancients19 he is sometimes too allegorical and treats of matters of religion in a pastoral style as the mantuan had done before him he has employed the lyric measure which is contrary to the practice of the old poets his stanza is not still the same nor always well chosen this last may be the reason his expression is sometimes not concise enough for the tetrastic has obliged him to extend his sense to the length of four lines which would have been more closely confined in the couplet  in the manners thoughts and characters he comes near to theocritus himself though notwithstanding all the care he has taken he is certainly inferior in his dialect for the doric had its beauty and propriety in the time of theocritus it was used in part of greece and frequent in the mouths of many of the greatest persons whereas the old english and country phrases of spenser were either entirely obsolete or spoken only by people of the lowest condition20 as there is a difference betwixt simplicity and rusticity so the expression of simple thoughts should be plain but not clownish the addition he has made of a calendar to his eclogues is very beautiful since by this besides the general moral of innocence and simplicity which is common to other authors of pastoral he has one peculiar to himself he compares human life to the several seasons and at once exposes to his readers a view of the great and little worlds in their various changes and aspects21 yet the scrupulous division of his pastorals into months has obliged him either to repeat the same description in other words for three months together or when it was exhausted before entirely to omit it whence it comes to pass that some of his eclogues as the sixth eighth and tenth for example have nothing but their titles to distinguish them the reason is evident because the year has not that variety in it to furnish every month with a particular description as it may every season  of the following eclogues i shall only say that these four comprehend all the subjects which the critics upon theocritus and virgil will allow to be fit for pastoral that they have as much variety of description in respect of the several seasons as spensers that in order to add to this variety the several times of the day are observed the rural employments in each season or time of day and the rural scenes or places proper to such employments not without some regard to the several ages of man and the different passions proper to each age but after all if they have any merit it is to be attributed to some good old authors whose works as i had leisure to study so i hope i have not wanted care to imitate  footnotes  footnote 1 written at sixteen years of agepope  this sensible and judicious discourse written at so early an age is a more extraordinary production than the pastorals that follow it our author has chiefly drawn his observations from rapin fontenelle and the preface to drydens virgil a translation of rapins discourse had been some years before prefixed to creechs translation of theocritus and is no extraordinary piece of criticism and though hume highly praises the discourse of fontenelle yet dr hurd thinks it only rather more tolerable than his pastoralswarton  hume had said that there could not be a finer piece of criticism than fontenelles dissertation on pastorals but that the pastorals themselves displayed false taste and did not exemplify the rules laid down in the criticism  footnote 2 fontenelles discourse of pastoralspope  footnote 3 heinsius in theocrpope  footnote 4 rapin de carm past p 2pope  footnote 5 i cannot easily discover why it is thought necessary to refer descriptions of a rural state to the golden age nor can i perceive that any writer has consistently preserved the arcadian manners and sentiments the only reason that i have read on which this rule has been founded is that according to the customs of modern life it is improbable that shepherds should be capable of harmonious numbers or delicate sentiments and therefore the reader must exalt his ideas of the pastoral character by carrying his thoughts back to the age in which the care of herds and flocks was the employment of the wisest and greatest men these reasoners seem to have been led into their hypothesis by considering pastoral not in general as a representation of rural nature and consequently as exhibiting the ideas and sentiments of those whoever they are to whom the country affords pleasure or employment but simply as a dialogue or narrative of men actually tending sheep and busied in the lowest and most laborious offices from whence they very readily concluded since characters must necessarily be preserved that either the sentiments must sink to the level of the speakers or the speakers must be raised to the height of the sentiments in consequence of these original errors a thousand precepts have been given which have only contributed to perplex and confoundjohnson  footnote 6 rapin reflex sur lart poet darist p ii refl xxviipope  footnote 7 pope took this remark from dr knightly chetwoods preface to the pastorals in drydens virgil not only the sentences should be short and smart but the whole piece should be so too for poetry and pastime was not the business of mens lives in those days but only their seasonable recreation after necessary hours the rule is purely fanciful by continuing the same subject from week to week a shepherd could as easily find leisure to compose a single piece of a thousand lines as ten pieces of a hundred lines each most of the laws of pastoral poetry which pope has collected are equally unfounded  footnote 8 pref to virg past in dryd virgpope  footnote 9 fontenelles disc of pastoralspope  footnote 10 see the forementioned prefacepope  footnote 11 greek theristai idyl x and greek alieis idyl xxipope  popes definition of pastoral is too confined in fact his pastoral discourse seems made to fit his pastorals for the same reason he would not class as a true pastoral the most interesting of all virgils ecloguesi mean the first which is founded on fact which has the most tender and touching strokes of nature and the plot of which is entirely pastoral being the complaint of a shepherd obliged to leave the fields of his infancy and yield the possession to soldiers and strangers pope says because it relates to soldiers it is not pastoral but how little of a military cast is seen in it the soldier is mentioned but only as far as was absolutely necessary and always in connection with the rural imagery from whence the most exquisite touches are derived popes pastoral ideas with the exception of the messiah seem to have been taken from the least interesting and poetic scenes of the ancient ecloguethe wager the contest the riddle the alternate praises of daphne or delia the commonplace complaint of the lover c the more interesting and picturesque subjects were excluded as not being properly pastoral according to his definitionbowles  in saying that pope would not allow virgils first eclogue to be a true pastoral bowles refers to the paper in the guardian where the design was to laugh at the strict definition which would exclude a poem from the pastoral class on such frivolous grounds in the same jesting tone pope asserts that the third eclogue must be set aside because it introduces calumny and railing which are not proper to a state of concord and the eighth because it has a shepherd whom an inviting precipice tempts to selfdestruction  footnote 12 the tenth and twentyfirst idyll here alluded to contain some of the most exquisite strokes of nature and true poetry anywhere to be met with as does the beautiful description of the carving on the cup which indeed is not a cup but a very large pastoral vessel or cauldronwarton  footnote 13 in what does the great father of the pastoral excel all others in simplicity and nature i admit with pope but more particularly in one circumstance which seems to have escaped general attention and that circumstance is the picturesque pope says he is too long in his descriptions particularly of the cup was not pope a professed admirer of painting aware that the description of that cup contains touches of the most delightful and highlyfinished landscape the old fisherman and the broken rock in one scene in another the beautiful contrast of the little boy weaving his rushwork and so intent on it that he forgets the vineyard he was set to guard we see him in the foreground of the piece then there is his scrip and the fox eyeing it askance the ripe and purple vineyard and the other fox treading down the grapes whilst he continues at his work add to these circumstances the wild and beautiful sicilian scenery and where can there be found more perfect landscapes in the works which these pictures peculiarly resemble of vernet or gainsborough considered in this view how rich wild and various are the landscapes of the old sicilian and we cannot but wonder that so many striking and original traits should be passed over by a youthful bard who professed to select from and to copy the ancientsbowles  footnote 14 he refines indeed so much as to make him on this very account much inferior to the beautiful simplicity of his originalwarton  footnote 15 it is difficult to conceive where is the wonderful variety in virgils eclogues which the greek was a stranger to many of the more poetical parts of virgil are copied literally from theocritus but are weakened by being made more general and often lose much of their picturesque and poetical effect from that circumstancebowles  footnote 16 rapin refl on arist p ii refl xxvii pref to the ecl in drydens virgilpope  footnote 17 the aminta of tasso is here erroneously mentioned by pope as the very first pastoral comedy that appeared in italy but it is certain that il sacrificio of agostino beccari was the first who boasts of it in his prologue and who died very old in 1590warton  there were says roscoe several writers of pastoral in italy prior to those mentioned either by pope or warton roscoe mistook the question which was who was the first author of the pastoral drama none of the prior pastoral writers he enumerates produced a drama and warton was right in giving the precedency to beccari  footnote 18 dedication to virg eclpope  footnote 19 in the manuscript pope had added some of them contain two hundred lines and others considerably exceed that number  footnote 20 johnson remarks that while the notion that rustic characters ought to use rustic phraseology led to the adoption in pastorals of a mangled dialect which no human being ever could have spoken the authors had the inconsistency to invest their personages with a refinement of thought which was incompatible with coarse and vulgar diction spenser he continues begins one of his pastorals with studied barbarity      diggon davie i bid her good day     or diggon her is or i missay      dig her wus her while it was daylight     but now her is a most wretched wight  what will the reader imagine to be the subject on which speakers like these exercise their eloquence will he not be somewhat disappointed when he finds them met together to condemn the corruptions of the church of rome surely at the same time that a shepherd learns theology he may gain some acquaintance with his native language  footnote 21 it was from hence the poet went on to say in his manuscript i took my first design of the following eclogues for looking upon spenser as the father of english pastoral i thought myself unworthy to be esteemed even the meanest of his sons unless i bore some resemblance of him but as it happens with degenerate offspring not only to recede from the virtues but to dwindle from the bulk of their ancestor so i have copied spenser in miniature and reduced his twelve months into four seasons when pope published his pastorals he stated that three of them were imitated from virgil and theocritus which occasioned his cancelling this passage where he speaks as if he had taken spenser alone for his model     spring  the first pastoral  or  damon   to sir william trumbull1        first in these fields i try the

retired statesman had a true taste for literature but his efforts as a versifier had been limited to a dozen lines translated from martial  footnote 11 warton observes that the nightingale does not sing till the other birds are at rest this is a mistake the nightingale sings by day as well as at night but the expressions to rest removes and forsaken groves give an idea of evening in which case there would be certainly an error in making the thrush chant after the nightingale as to the thrush being charmed to silence at any time by the nightingale and the aërial audience applauding it is

friend  in keeping with this announcement the song of hylas which forms the first portion of the pastoral was devoted to mourning an absent shepherd and not as at present an absent shepherdess when pope made his lines commemorative of love instead of friendship he did little more than change the name of the man thyrsis to that of a woman delia and substitute the feminine for the masculine pronoun the extravagant idea expressed in the first line of the rejected couplet is found in oldhams translation of moschus      and trees leaned their attentive branches down  there is nothing of the

insidious attack upon pope than of serious commendation for if as warburton assumes the panegyric in the text has reference to the plays and not to the man it was a misplaced encomium to say that wycherley instructed the world by the sense and swayed them by the judgment which were manifested in a shamefully profligate dialogue and action  footnote 8 the reading was rapture in all editions

the rocks weep which has no resemblance to anything in nature  footnote 12 the lines from verse 17 to 30 are very beautiful tender and melodiousbowles  footnote 13 it was a timehonoured fancy that the moan of the turtledove was a lament for the loss of its mate turtur the latin name for the bird is a correct representation of its monotonous note the poets commonly call it simply the turtle but since the term to quote the explanation of johnson in his dictionary is also used by sailors and gluttons for a tortoise the description of its deep murmurs as filling the sounding shores calls up this secondary sense and gives an air of ludicrousness to the passage  footnote 14 this whole passage is imitated from sir philip sidneys arcadia book iii p 712 8vo ed      earth brook flowrs pipe

the several subjects of the four pastorals and to the several scenes of them particularized before in eachpope  they should have been added by the poet in his own person instead of being put into the mouth of a shepherd who is not presumed to have any knowledge of the previous pieces the specific character which pope ascribes to each of his pastorals is not borne out by the poems themselves there is as much about flocks in the first pastoral as in the second and there is as much about rural lays and loves in the second pastoral as in the first the third pastoral contains no mention of a sylvan crew but a couple of shepherds are absorbed by the same rural lays and loves which occupied their predecessors     messiah  a sacred eclogue  in imitation of  virgils pollio   advertisement  in reading several passages of the prophet isaiah which foretell the coming of christ and the felicities attending it i could not but observe a remarkable parity between many of the thoughts and those in the pollio of virgil this will not seem surprising when we reflect that the eclogue was taken from a sibylline prophecy on the same subject one may judge that virgil did not copy it line by line but selected such ideas as best agreed with the nature of pastoral poetry and disposed them in that manner which served most to beautify his piece i have endeavoured the same in this imitation of him though without admitting anything of my own since it was written with this particular view that the reader by comparing the several thoughts might see how far the images and descriptions of the prophet are superior to those of the poet but as i fear i have prejudiced them by my management i shall subjoin the passages of isaiah and those of virgil under the same disadvantage of a literal translation1  this is certainly the most animated and sublime of all our authors compositions and it is manifestly owing to the great original which he copied perhaps the dignity the energy and the simplicity of the original are in a few passages weakened and diminished by florid epithets and useless circumlocutionswarton  all things considered the messiah is as fine and masterly a piece of composition as the english language in the same style of verse can boast i have ventured to point out a passage or two for they are rare where the sublimity has been weakened by epithets and i have done this because it is a fault particularly with young writers so common in the most truly sublime images of scripture the addition of a single word would often destroy their effect it is therefore right to keep as nearly as possible to the very words no one understood better than milton where to be general and where particular where to adopt the very expression of scripture and where it was allowed to paraphrasebowles  the fourth eclogue of virgil is devoted to celebrating the coming birth while pollio is consul of a boy whose infancy will usher in the golden age and whose manhood will witness its fullness wars are to cease the beasts of prey are to change their natures the untilled earth is to bring forth fruits spontaneously and peace ease and plenty are to reign supreme the names of the parents of this expected child are not recorded and the commentators are greatly divided upon the question the most reasonable conjecture is that the intention was to do homage to the ruling genius at rome augustus or cæsar octavianus as he was then called whose wife scribonia was pregnant at the time unhappily for the prognostications of the poet the infant proved a daughter and the infamous julia2 virgil grounds his glowing anticipations upon certain cumæan or sibylline verses for as jortin well remarks he would have deprived his announcement of all authority if he himself had set up for a prophet he could only hope to accredit his promised marvels by appealing to an oracle that was popularly believed to be inspired the sibylline books says prideaux were a main engine of state when they were ordered to be consulted the keepers of them always brought forth such an answer as served their purpose and in many difficulties the governors helped themselves this way3 virgil was equally diplomatic he probably had no faith in the wonders he announced his object was to pay court to augustus and to assist in establishing his patrons power  the resemblance which portions of the pollio bear to passages in isaiah is generally admitted this says pope will not seem surprising when we reflect that the eclogue was taken from a sibylline prophecy on the same subject he does not attempt to explain how the sibyl came by her knowledge unless he means us to infer that she was divinely illuminated this theory has been supported by learned men and would be warranted if the eight books of sibylline oracles still extant in greek verse were anterior to the christian era for since they often go beyond the old testament predictions in historic precision the insight into futurity could not have been gathered exclusively from the scripture prophets but the existing oracles says jortin are without any one exception mere impostures they abound with phrases words facts and passages taken from the septuagint and the new testament and are a remarkable specimen of astonishing impudence and miserable poetry4 still there remains the circumstance of the parallelism between parts of isaiah and the eclogue which virgil based upon the sibylline verses it is easy to account for the coincidence the original sibylline books were accidentally burnt b c 83 a few years later the senate employed agents to glean together from italy greece sicily and africa a body of prophecies to replace the oracles which had perished the collection was from private as well as public sources and a vast number of the same or similar predictions were in the hands of individuals at rome the jews were located everywhere they abounded in rome itself they were animated by the expectation that the reign of the messiah was approaching their prophetic records were incomparable for poetic beauty sublimity and variety the language of the septuagint was well understood by lettered pagans and was even the language of the new sibylline oracles which were embodied in greek verse when all these things are considered it would be strange if the persons employed to pick up prophecies had not come across notions which had either been derived from personal intercourse with jews or from their sacred books although the entire world had been sunk in stupid apathy and not a single heathen had been attracted by curiosity to turn his attention to hebrew literature and beliefs it was yet inevitable that a crude conception should get abroad of the leading idea which fermented in the mind of the ubiquitous jew and nothing was more likely than that it should be put into sibylline verse when roman agents were searching far and wide for oracles and inviting contributions from every quarter  popes messiah first appeared in the spectator for may 14 1712 no 378 where it is prefaced by these words i will make no apology for entertaining the reader with the following poem which is written by a great genius a friend of mine in the country who is not ashamed to employ his wit in the praise of his maker after it was published steele wrote on june 1 1712 to pope and said i have turned to every verse and chapter and think you have preserved the sublime heavenly spirit throughout the whole especially at hark a glad voice and the lamb with wolves shall graze your poem is better than the pollio upon this johnson remarks that the messiah excels the pollio is no great praise if it be considered from what original the improvements are derived bowles and warton thought that pope had kept up his verse to the level of isaiah and had only here and there weakened the sublimity by epithets wordsworth was of another opinion when he contended that the language of poetry should be a selection from the real language of men in a state of vivid sensation and repudiated the ornate conventional phraseology which passed for poetic diction he pointed to the paraphrases on parts of the bible in illustration of what he condemned and to the passages as they exist in our authorised version for a specimen of what he approved popes messiah throughout was in his apprehension an adulteration of the original5 his criticism appears well founded the pure and natural language of the prophet is sometimes exchanged for sickly affected expressions righteousness becomes dewy nectar sheep the fleecy care and the call upon jerusalem to arise and shine is turned into an invocation to exalt her towry head apart from these mawkish phrases the imitation is framed from first to last upon the mistaken principle that the original would be embellished by amplifications by a profusion of epithets and by a gaudier diction the firtree and boxtree of isaiah are called by pope the spiry fir and shapely box where the sacred text announces that instead of the thorn shall come up the firtree and instead of the briar shall come up the myrtletree pope tells us that      to leafless shrubs the flowring palms succeed     and odrous myrtle to the noisome weed  in his translation of the prediction that in the kingdom of christ the suckingchild shall play on the hole of the asp and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice den pope makes the cockatrice a crested basilisk and the asp a speckled snake they have both scales of a green lustre and a forky tongue and with this last the smiling infant shall innocently play the leopard says isaiah shall lie down with the kid and the young lion and the fatling together and a little child shall lead them but pope could not leave this exquisite picture undecorated and with him boys in flowry bands the tiger lead how grievously is the force and pathos of the passage impaired by the substitution of boys for the little child how completely is the bewitching nature turned into masquerade by the engrafted notion that the beasts are led by flowry bands the alteration is an example of the justice of de quinceys observation that the arcadia of popes age was the spurious arcadia of the opera theatre6 the prophet refers anew to the time when creatures of prey shall cease to be carnivorous and relates that the lion shall eat straw like the bullock and dust shall be the serpents meat pope converts the second clause into the statement that harmless serpents lick the pilgrims feet which alters the meaning and introduces a conception more noticeable for its grotesqueness than for the enchanting vision it should conjure up of universal peace7 pope says he was induced to subjoin in his notes the passages he had versified by the fear that he had prejudiced isaiah and virgil by his management the reputation of isaiah and virgil was safe and no one can doubt that his real reason for inviting the comparison was the belief that he had improved upon them he imagined that he had enriched the text of the prophet and did not suspect that the majesty and truth of the original were vitiated by his embroidery bowles has drawn attention to the finest parts of the poem and it may be allowed that the piece in general is powerful of its kind the fault is in the kind itself which belongs to a lower style than the living strains of isaiah and borders too closely upon the meretricious to suit the lofty theme the messiah is a prophetic vision of a golden age and on this account was classed by pope among his pastorals8  footnotes  footnote 1 pope printed in his notes only those passages of isaiah which had some resemblance to the ideas of virgil to the other portions of the prophet which he put into verse he merely

which the figure is taken thick films agree only with the thing to which it is applied namely to the sight or eye and not to that from which it is taken namely a ray of light coming to the eye he should have said thick clouds which would have agreed with both but these inaccuracies are not to be found in his later poemswarburton  concanen had previously made the same objection in his

gratior ulla est     quam sibi quæ vari præscripsit pagina nomenvirg      london printed for bernard lintott at the crosskeys     in fleet street       the work appeared before march 9 1713 on which day swift      writes to stella mr pope has published a fine poem      called windsor forest read it in his manuscript pope      says it was first printed in folio in  again in folio      the same year and in octavo the next it was included in      the quarto of 1717 in the second edition of lintots      miscellany in 1714 and in the four succeeding editions of      1720 1722 1727 and 1732   this poem was written at two different times the first part of it which relates to the country in the year 1704 at the same time with the pastorals the latter part was not added till the year 1713 in which it was publishedpope  in 1713 pope published windsor forest of which part was as he relates written at sixteen about the same time as his pastorals and the latter part was added afterwards where the addition begins we are not told1 the lines relating to the peace confess their own date it is dedicated to lord lansdowne who was then in high reputation and influence among the tories and it is said that the conclusion of the poem gave great pain to addison both as a poet and a politician reports like this are often spread with boldness very disproportionate to their evidence why should addison receive any particular disturbance from the last lines of windsor forest if contrariety of opinion could poison a politician he would not live a day and as a poet he must have felt popes force of genius much more from many other parts of his works the pain that addison might feel it is not likely that he would confess and it is certain that he so well suppressed his discontent that pope now thought himself his favourite  the design of windsor forest is evidently derived from coopers hill with some attention to wallers poem on the park but pope cannot be denied to excel his masters in variety and elegance and the art of interchanging description narrative and morality the objection made by dennis is the want of plan of a regular subordination of parts terminating in the principal and original design there is this want in most descriptive poems because as the scenes which they must exhibit successively are all subsisting at the same time the order in which they are shown must by necessity be arbitrary and more is not to be expected from the last part than from the first the attention therefore which cannot be detained by suspense must be excited by diversity such as this poem offers to its reader but the desire of diversity may be too much indulged the parts of windsor forest which deserve least praise are those which were added to enliven the stillness of the scenethe appearance of father thames and the transformation of lodona addison had in his campaign derided the rivers that rise from their oozy beds to tell stories of heroes2 and it is therefore strange that pope should adopt a fiction not only unnatural but lately censured the story of lodona is told with sweetness but a new metamorphosis is a ready and puerile expedient nothing is easier than to tell how a flower was once a blooming virgin or a rock an obdurate tyrantjohnson  descriptive poetry was by no means the shining talent of pope this assertion may be manifested by the few images introduced in the poem before us which are not equally applicable to any place whatsoever rural beauty in general and not the peculiar beauties of the forest of windsor are here described nor are the sports of setting shooting and fishing at all more appropriated the stagchase that immediately follows although some of the lines are incomparably good is not so full so animated and so circumstantial as that of somervillewarton  johnson remarks that this poem was written after the model of denhams coopers hill with perhaps an eye on wallers poem of the park marvel has also written a poem on local scenery3upon the hill and grove at billborow and another on appleton house now nunappleton in yorkshire marvel abounds with conceits and false thoughts but some of the descriptive touches are picturesque and beautiful he sometimes observes little circumstances of rural nature with the eye and feeling of a true poet      then as i careless on the bed     of gelid strawberries do tread     and through the hazels thick espy     the hatching thrustles shining eye  the last circumstance is new highly poetical and could only have been described by one who was a real lover of nature and a witness of her beauties in her most solitary retirements before this descriptive poem on windsor forest i do not recollect any other professed composition on local scenery except the poems of the authors already mentioned denhams is certainly the best prior to popes his description of london at a distance is sublime4      under his proud survey the city lies     and like a mist beneath a hill does rise     whose state and wealth the busness and the crowd     seems at this distance but a darker cloud  pope by the expression of majestic has justly characterised the flow of denhams couplets it is extraordinary that pope who by this expression seems to have appreciated the general cast of harmony in coopers hill should have made his own cadences so regular and almost unvaried denhams couplets are often irregular but the effect of the pauses in the following lines was obviously the result of a fine ear the language truly suits the subject      but his proud head the airy mountain hides     among the clouds his shoulders and his sides     a shady mantle clothes his curled brows     frown on the gentle stream which calmly flows     whilst winds and storms his lofty forehead beat  the occasional introduction of such passages should be managed with great care but i appeal to any judge of poetry whether he does not feel the effect intended to be raised by the pauses of the lines just quoted  he who has not an eye to observe every external appearance that nature may exhibit in every change of season and who cannot with a glance distinguish every diversity of every hue in her variety of beauties must so far be deficient in one of the essential qualities of a poet here pope from infirmities and from physical causes was particularly deficient when he left his own laurel circus at twickenham he was lifted into his chariot or his barge and with weak eyes and tottering strength it is physically impossible he could be a descriptive bard where description has been introduced among his poems as far as his observation could go he excelled more could not be expected it is for this reason that his windsor forest and his pastorals must ever appear so defective to a lover of nature in his windsor forest he has description incident and history the descriptive part is too general and unappropriate the incident or story part is such as only would have been adopted by a young man who had just read ovid but the historical part is very judiciously and skilfully blended and the conclusion highly animated and poetical nor can we be insensible to its more lofty tone of versificationbowles  richardson transcribed the various readings of windsor forest into his copy of the quarto of 1717 and added this notealtered from the first copy of the authors own hand written out beautifully as usual for the perusal and criticism of his friends the manuscript in richardsons possession did not contain the entire work but stopped at ver 390 on the titlepage of the manuscript was a memorandum by pope which says this poem was written just after the pastorals as appears by the last verse of it that was in the year  when the author was  years of age but the last hundred lines including the celebration of the peace were added in the year  soon after the ratification of the treaty of utrecht pope supplied the omitted dates in the octavo of 1736 where he ascribes the former part of windsor forest to 1704 and the latter part to 1710 the testimony of pope carries little weight and there is no subsidiary evidence to confirm the improbable statement that the larger portion of the poem was produced as early as 1704 the date he assigned to the remainder in a note at ver 1 of the edition of 1736 and again in a note on ver 289 must have been a slip of the pen or an error of the press warburton altered 1710 to 1713 in the first note and left the mistake uncorrected in the second the amended date was a fresh blunder for it appears from the letters of pope to caryll on nov 29 and dec 5 1712 that the new conclusion was then complete popes memory deceived him when he stated that the end of the poem was written soon after the ratification of the treaty of utrecht the treaty as mr croker remarks was not signed till march 30 1713 nor ratified till april 28 and windsor forest was published before march 9 the peace had for some months been an accepted fact and pope did not wait for its formal ratification  lord lansdowne said pope to spence insisted on my publishing my windsor forest and the motto non injussa cano shows it5 pope not only published but composed windsor forest at the instigation of lord lansdowne if the opening lines of the poem are to be believed trumbull however asserts that it was he who suggested the topic to pope i should have commended his poem on windsor forest much more wrote sir william to mr bridges may 12 1713 if he had not served me a slippery trick for you must know i had long since put him upon this subject gave several hints and at last when he brought it and read it and made some little alterations c not one word of putting in my name till i found it in print the apparent discrepancy may be explained by the supposition that trumbull proposed the earlier poem on the forest and lord lansdowne the subsequent celebration of the peace the poet tacked the new matter on to the old and may have represented that he sang at the command of granville because the ultimate form which the work assumed was due to him  mrs delany who was the niece of lord lansdowne and lived with him in her youth says in her autobiography that he was a man of an open unsuspecting temper that he had the greatest politeness and goodhumour imaginable that he was magnificent in his nature and wasted his fortune to gratify his passion for display6 his predominant characteristics were amiability and vanity his love of distinction incited him to become a dramatist poet and politician he had aspirations without ability and in none of these capacities did he exhibit any vigour of mind his poetry was an imitation of waller of whom says johnson he copied the faults and very little more7 his plays reflect the worst qualities of the era of charles ii in tragedy he thought that to be dull and stately was to be classical in comedy that affected briskness of dialogue was liveliness and indecent double meanings wit he made no figure in politics and owed his posts in the harley administration to his wealth family and electioneering influence his literature aided by his hereditary advantages sufficed to procure him a factitious fame while he lived but his reputation was at an end the moment his works lost the lustre they derived from his social position  lord lansdowne was at the zenith of his career when he persuaded pope to eulogise the peace a measure in itself wise had been made subservient to the personal interests of the unprincipled faction in power these intriguers could not carry on the war without the commanding genius of marlborough nor allow a political opponent to perpetuate his ascendancy by a fresh series of victories certain that they would be driven from office unless they could huddle up a peace they were guilty of a treacherous connivance with the enemy and a flagrant breach of faith towards their allies they were compelled to grant terms to france which were the boast of her minister torcy and which bolingbroke confessed were not what policy or our successes required8 a man of more enlightened views might have justly urged that hard conditions offensive to the pride of a great nation were less calculated to ensure a lengthened peace than lenient demands which allowed the consolation of an honourable retreat no such plea was put forth by bolingbroke he always retained the vulgar idea that france ought to have been humbled and her power reduced for generations to come he lamented the moderation of the treaty and threw the blame upon the want of union among the allies which was itself occasioned by the knowledge that he and his colleagues had determined to sacrifice all other interests to their own9 there was a risk that a treaty which was thought inadequate by its authors would rouse universal indignation and prove as fatal to their power as the continuance of the war the peace became the political test of the hour and every artifice of prose and verse was employed to appease public opinion  pope did not stop with applauding the peace he denounced the revolution he afterwards professed a lofty superiority to party prejudices but there were obvious reasons which might induce him to lay aside his usual caution at this crisis the war was directed against louis xiv the champion of roman catholicism and the pretender a general belief prevailed that the protestant succession could only be secured by reducing the french king to helplessness and that a peace on the other hand which saved him and the harley administration from ruin would be propitious to the cause of tories papists and jacobites they fancied says bolingbroke that the peace was the period at which their millenary year would begin10 a young and sanguine poet may well have shared a conviction in which both sides concurredthe ministerialists by their hopes and the opposition by their fears no sooner was the treaty concluded than it became apparent that the hopes and fears were exaggerated the ministry was torn to pieces by intestine divisions its supportersa heterogeneous body who had been loosely held together by a common enmitywere rapidly throwing off their allegiance the good will which had been founded upon large and vague expectations was converted into hostility under total disappointment and the failing health of the queen rendered it probable that the accession of a whig sovereign would shortly complete the discomfiture of the faction after the conclusion of the peace says bolingbroke we saw nothing but increase of mortification and nearer approaches to ruin11  having been too precipitate in casting in his lot with the tories pope hastened to qualify his rashness by conciliating the whigs and undertook to furnish the prologue to addisons cato this play was brought out april 14 1713 at the request of the opposition who intended it for a remonstrance against the arbitrary projects imputed to the ministry the tragedy was hurried upon the stage towards the close of the dramatic season lest the salutary lesson should come too late to save the threatened constitution12 pope told spence that the manuscript was submitted to him by addison that he thought the action not sufficiently theatrical and that he recommended the author to forego its performance shortly afterwards addison went to him and said that some particular friends whom he could not disoblige insisted on its being acted he protested that he had no party purpose in the play commissioned pope to convey this assurance to oxford and bolingbroke sent them the tragedy along with the message and obtained their encouragement when a year and a half had elapsed and the house of hanover had succeeded to the english throne addison published in nov 1714 a copy of verses to the princess of wales in which he took credit for the patriotism and daring of his muse in sending forth the play with the express design of defeating the machinations of the government13      and boldly rising for britannias laws     engaged great cato in her countrys cause  hurd unwilling to condemn his hero addison and accepting without misgiving the statement reported by spence exclaims how spotless must that man be that in passing through a court had only contracted this slight stain even in the opinion of so severe a censor and casuist as mr pope14 but unless the conduct of addison is misrepresented he must have been corrupt and contemptible the party of which he was a prominent member urged the production of his play at a momentous crisis with a political object and it would have been mean and treacherous to yield to their entreaties and then privately assure the common enemy that nothing political was intended the baseness would have been great indeed if when the power passed over to the whigs he triumphantly declared that he had pursued the very course he disavowed at the time and thus endeavoured by a false boast to procure new credit and rewards either addison was unscrupulous or pope fabricated the tale addisons version was published to the world popes version was dropped into the ear of spence addison made his claim when the circumstances were fresh and when pope bolingbroke and oxford were at hand to expose him pope told his story after the lapse of many years when he had quarrelled with addison and the subject of his aspersions was in the grave addison has never been convicted of an untruthful word or a dishonourable act popes career was a labyrinth of deceit and he abounded in audacious malignant inventions these considerations are sufficient but there is more direct evidence i have had lately wrote pope to caryll feb 1713 the entertainment of reading mr addisons tragedy of cato it drew tears from me in several parts of the fourth and fifth acts where the beauty of virtue appears so charming that i believe if it comes upon the theatre we shall enjoy that which plato thought the greatest pleasure an exalted soul could be capable of a view of virtue itself dressed in person colour and action the emotion which the mind will feel from this character and the sentiments of humanity which the distress of such a person as cato will stir up in us must necessarily fill an audience with so glorious a disposition and sovereign a love of virtue that i question if any play has ever conduced so immediately to morals as this here is pope prognosticating that cato upon the stage will melt delight and animate the audience he penned the words at the exact period when according to his later assertion he was admonishing addison that the play was unsuited to the theatre and he is selfconvicted by the contradiction onehalf of his story was false and renders the other half worthless15  in the account which pope gave to caryll of the first night of cato he said that all the foolish industry possible had been used to make it a party play and complained that the prologue writer was clapped into a stanch whig sore against his will at almost every two lines16 he might be anxious to persuade his jacobite correspondent that he had not been abetting a whig manifesto and might pretend that he was annoyed at the construction put upon the prologue but his verses were chiefly devoted to enforcing the political doctrine of the play and he must deliberately have laid himself out to catch the applause of its friends his management advanced his fortunes windsor forest procured him the acquaintance and patronage of the tory leaders swift recommended the poem to stella on march 9 1713 and in november he was heard by dr kennet instructing a young nobleman that the best poet in england was mr pope a papist who had begun a translation of homer into english verse for which he must have them all subscribe for says he the author shall not begin to print till i have a thousand guineas for him17 the other magnates of the faction joined with swift in befriending him in those heated times a roman catholic who had won over one party to his interests by proclaiming his jacobite bias in verse would naturally have fallen under the ban of their opponents but his standing sponsor for the whig play and the relations he maintained with whig authors kept the whigs from renouncing him to his art in attracting notice to his poetry through his politics and in combining the suffrages of embittered political antagonists he owed the unexampled success of the homer subscription which secured his pecuniary independence he had served both masters by turns though in unequal degrees and then unreasonably complained to caryll that some people called him a whig and others called him a tory18 he disclaimed being either he talked of his abhorrence of party violence and propounded his principles in dark unmeaning generalities from which nothing can be gathered except that he wished to avoid being held responsible for any opinions whatever he did not take up the position that a purely literary undertaking was independent of politics the moment the tory cause declined he pleaded his neutrality and seemed to imagine that he could claim the support of all parties on the ground that he adhered to none the less wary patron who bespoke windsor forest had to suffer for his jacobite zeal he was arrested on sept 21 1715 and remained in the tower till feb 8 1717 bolingbroke and oxford were impeached and the selfish bargain they had brought about by dishonourable means that they might prolong their rule annihilated their power for ever  a person says warton of no small rank has informed me that mr addison was inexpressibly chagrined at the noble conclusion of windsor forest both as a politician and as a poetas a politician because it so highly celebrated that treaty of peace which he deemed so pernicious to the liberties of europe and as a poet because he was deeply conscious that his own campaign that gazette in rhyme contained no strokes of such genuine and sublime poetry19 this is one of those plausible imputations which enemies propagate on the evidence of their own suspicions and which therefore require to be substantiated by unexceptionable testimony warton had nothing better to adduce in support of the credibility of his informant than the irrelevant circumstance that he was a person of no small rank the description of the witness declares his incompetence it is not pretended that the person of no small rank was intimate with addison or had any authentic means of ascertaining his sentiments and they are certainly misrepresented by the assertion that he could not endure poetical panegyrics on a peace he disapproved for in the spectator of oct 30 1712 he wrote up tickells laudatory verses and hoped his poem would meet with such a reward from its patrons as so noble a performance deserved20 there is not a party word added to extenuate the praise a tory might have endorsed the essay intolerance and inexpressible chagrin were not at any time characteristics of addison  tickells prospect of peace went through six editions and to judge by the sale was more popular than windsor forest which was published four months later the greater success of the far inferior poem was doubtless owing to the eulogium in the spectator pope joined in applauding tickells work he said that it contained several most poetical images and fine pieces of painting he specified certain strokes of mastery and he especially commended the versification21 his too liberal praise may have been influenced by the couplet in which tickell exclaimed      like the young spreading laurel pope thy name     shoots up with strength and rises into fame  nearly the whole of the poem is in an equally dreary style and this dull mediocrity was not attained without numerous imitations of ancient and modern authors the insipidity did not exclude extravagance for both poetry and patriotism were thought to be displayed by a nonsensical exaggeration of british beauty valour and power  windsor forest is not free from flat passages inflation of sentiment and false and puerile thoughts pope mixed up in it the beauties of his manlier period with the vices of his early style no writer clung more tenaciously to the lifeless phantoms of paganism nor applied the hereditary commonplaces in a more servile manner liberty is britannias goddess the sun is phoebus fiery car the sea is neptunes self the harvest is ceres gifts the orchard is pomona crowned with fruits the ground is painted by blushing flora and the flocks on the hills are attended by pan this last personage leaves his innocent pastoral employment to chase with evil intentions a rural nymph who calls on father thames for aid father thames is deaf or indifferent and pan is about to clutch her when at her own request she is dissolved into a river before her transformation she was one of the buskined virgins of diana what time the goddess forsook cynthus top for windsor and was often seen roving there over the airy wastes there was no occasion now to envy arcadia the immortal huntress and her virgin train since windsor could boast      as bright a goddess and as chaste a queen  and the poet proceeds to complete the comparison between diana and queen annebetween the virgin huntress and a prolific mother who was ugly corpulent gouty sluggish a glutton and a tippler pope afterwards affected a disdain of royalty he was ready enough to flatter it when he had his own ends to serve he could not have devised a less felicitous compliment tickells poem was specially praised in the spectator for its freedom from the follies of pagan theology addison laughed at the whole tiresome tribe of gods and goddesses and with goodhumoured pleasantry warned the versifiers who were about to celebrate the peace against introducing trifling antiquated fables unpardonable in a poet that was past sixteen he laid stress upon the circumstance that in a panegyric which should be distinguished for truth nothing could be more ridiculous than to have recourse to our jupiters and junos22 and no incongruity of the kind could be more absurd than to couple diana and queen anne windsor forest was still in manuscript when addisons essay appeared pope was not at the pains to recast his poem but he must have recognised the force of the playful satire and thenceforward he abjured mythological trash  the passage on the death of cowley exemplifies in a short compass the unskilful use to which pope put the wornout rags of antiquity      o early lost what tears the river shed     when the sad pomp along his banks was led     his drooping swans on evry note expire     and on his willows hung each muses lyre  the appropriate business of poetry says wordsworth her privilege and her duty is to treat of things not as they are but as they appear not as they exist in themselves but as they seem to exist to the senses and passions23 since genuine emotions are often founded upon fancies since thoughts are not always the true reflection of outward realities poetasters and even poets have concluded that they might represent things neither as they are nor as they appear might neglect nature altogether and be unfaithful alike to the world of intelligence and the world of matter to this spurious class of invention belong the notions that a river which had flowed for ages was the tears of the rivergod lamenting the newlydeceased cowley and that all the swans on the thames died with grief on the day of his funeral the mind refuses to admit such jejune and monstrous fictions among the illusions of imagination the compound of mythological and biblical ideas in the fourth line has converted a pathetic incident in the psalms into a cold and miserable conceit the harp of the jew was a reality and when he wept over his captivity by the rivers of babylon he hung up his harp in very truth because his broken spirit would not permit him to sing the lords song in a strange land there is on the contrary only hollow pedantry in the pretence that nonexistent muses hung up nonexistent lyres on the willows of the thames because cowley was dead the passage goes on in the same empty artificial strain      who now shall charm the shades where cowley strung     his living harp and lofty denham sung     but hark the groves rejoice the forest rings     are these revivedor is it granville sings  it is an excellent remark of bowles that there are some ideas which will only just bear touching the earliest poems were sung and singing became synonymous with poetical composition but when a phrase which is now a mere figure of speech is expanded and the groves are said to rejoice and the forests to ring with the singing of granville the predominant effect produced by the metaphor is a sense of its falsity and grotesqueness the picture called up is not that of a poet but of a halfcrazed opera singer this sickly vein of counterfeit pastoral is continued and we are told that the groves of windsor are filled with the name of mira the subject of lord lansdownes amatory verses and that the cupids tuned the lovers lyre in the shades  the lines on lord lansdowne offend the more from the fulsomeness of the adulation pope said that flattery turned his stomach24 which meant that he could not endure his own vices in other people he had emphatically satirised the sycophancy which estimated literary works by the rank of the author      what woful stuff this madrigal would be     in some starved hackney sonneteer or me     but let a lord once own the happy lines     how the wit brightens how the style refines     before his sacred name flies evry fault     and each exalted stanza teems with thought25  the sacred name of lansdowne imparted genius to verse which would have been woful stuff in dennis or welsted when pope in later years called him granville the polite he characterised him correctly when in windsor forest he exalted him to the rank of a transcendent poet he said what he could not believe he outraged candour in prose as well as in verse he wrote a sycophantic letter to lord lansdowne boasting his freedom from the insincerity of his fellow scribblers who composed panegyrics at random and persuaded the next vain creature they could find that it was his own likeness pope vowed he had erred in the opposite direction and had forborne to praise lord lansdowne up to the height of his deserts out of deference to his modesty whereas others are offended if they have not more than justice done them you would be displeased if you had so much therefore i may safely do you as much injury in my word as you do yourself in your own thoughts i am so vain as to think i have shown you a favour in sparing your modesty and you cannot but make me some return for prejudicing the truth to gratify you26 here was triple incensethe original adulation the protestation that it was inadequate and the pretence that lord lansdowne a man noted for vanity was too modest to endure merited praise pope spoke more truth than he intended when he said that he had prejudiced truth to gratify him  who now reads cowley asked pope in 173727 the panegyric in windsor forest was an anachronism and he might have asked the same question in 1713 never was an equal reputation more ephemeral while cowley lived and for a few years afterwards the most cultivated minds in the kingdom called him the great cowley the incomparable cowley the divine cowley when he died denham said that death had      plucked the fairest sweetest flowr     that in the muses garden grew  the herd of readers vied with men of letters in applauding him as was shown by the sale of his works and is implied in the couplet of oldham      one likes my verses and commends each line     and swears that cowleys are but dull to mine28  the wonder is not that he lost his preeminence but that he ever obtained it his poetry is a puzzle from its contradictory qualities some of his pieces have a gay facility which had not hitherto been rivalled and the greater part are harsh heavy and obscure he loved to search for remote analogies and his profusion of farfetched similes are constantly of a kind which debase the subject they are intended to elevate and adorn his language is incessantly pitched in a high heroic key and then sinks in the same or the succeeding sentence into the tamest meanest phrases of colloquial prose his verse in entire poems as well as in single lilies and occasional passages is remarkable for its tripping ease and is more often rugged to such a degree that it is incredible how it could pass with him for verse at all the faulty side in him predominates and the general impression he leaves is that of dullness laboured and negligent by turns he did not owe the whole of his popularity to his real abilities and the bad taste of his age he was a conspicuous adherent of the stuarts and the cavaliers adopted his works out of compliment to his politics the grand funeral procession commemorated in windsor forest was a tribute paid to him by a party because he united the fame of a forward royalist to the celebrity of an author in a generation when authors and royalists were both dissolute his writings had at least the merit of being untainted by the prevailing vice pope describing the infidelity and debauchery of the restoration era exclaims      unhappy dryden in all charless days     roscommon only boasts unspotted bays29  he might have remembered milton if he overlooked cowley who was nevertheless a far greater poet than roscommon the one had gleams of genius and the other had none the contemporaries of cowley had not been blind to the moral merits of his productions i cannot says sir john denham but mention with honour my friend mr cowley who was the first who of late offered to redeem poesy from that slavery wherein this depraved age has prostituted her to all imaginable uncleanness30 his request in his will that his compositions printed and manuscript should be collected by dr sprat was accompanied by a clause beseeching him not to let any pass if anything of that kind has escaped my pen which may give the least offence in point of religion and good manners his life was in keeping with his writings evelyn calls him that incomparable poet and virtuous man and pepys heard dr ward the bishop of winchester and dr bates the wellknown puritan mightily lamenting his death as the best poet of our nation and as good a man31 the king was pleased to add his testimony worthless if it had stood alone and declared that mr cowley had not left a better man behind him in england32  in windsor forest says bowles there is description incident and history a few remarks may still be made on it under each of these heads wordsworth assigned to it the distinction in conjunction with lady winchelseas nocturnal reverie of containing the only new images of external nature to be found in the poetry of the period intervening between paradise lost and the seasons33 he limited the praise to a passage or two and does not particularise the passages to which he alluded he must chiefly have referred to the lines from ver 111 to ver 146 for the other happy images of external nature are borrowed pope had but a faint perception of latent and subtle beauties and he usually kept to those general appearances which are obvious to all the world his trees cast a shade his streams murmur his heath is purple his harvests are yellow and his skies blue living in the midst of english peasants he shows less familiarity with rural character than with rural scenes neither in his verse nor his letters is there anything to indicate that he had mixed like thomson cowper and wordsworth with the cottagers around him or had divined the noble qualities which are masked by a rustic exterior his sympathies were contracted and strange to say there is not one word in his voluminous writings on human kind which denotes that he had felt in the smallest degree the loveliness of children his main interest was in men and women whose names for good or evil were before the world and in speaking of them he dwelt principally upon their foibles and misdeeds  the censure of warton is valid when he complains that popes account of field sports is deficient in characteristic details he found a stagchase in coopers hill which determined him to extend while ho imitated the plan of his original and introduce hunting fishing shooting and netting into windsor forest though he was not a sportsman the objection that his stagchase is not as circumstantial as that of somerville is fairly answered by johnsons remark that the chase was the main subject of somerville and is only subsidiary with pope more nevertheless was required than a description of the impatience and galloping of the horses and of the eagerness of the riders of this single topic one half was a translation from statius the fishing and shooting are superior to the hunt the particulars are meagre but there is mastery in the mode of representing them the dying pheasant is painted in language as rich as its plumage and the doves the lapwing the lark and the wintry landscape could not have been brought more vividly before the mind or in fewer words a gentle pathos intermingles with the whole the portrait of the angler would have been perfect in the single circumstance to which it is confined if pope had not said of him he hopes the scaly breed wakefield observed that hope used as an active verb was intolerably affected and he might have extended the remark to the use of scaly breed for fish  the story part of windsor forest is a mosaic of translated scraps from ovids metamorphoses the fictions of heathen mythology which had been repeated to satiety which exhibited no invention and had no charm for modern imaginations are worse than an excrescence in the midst of english prospects sports and history the bad effect does not stop with the puerilities themselves but they communicate an air of weakness and unreality to the general texture of the work  the wellmerited praise which bowles bestowed upon the historical part of the poem is inapplicable to the ill drawn character of william the conqueror pope saw in him only a devastator and a tyrant he had not caught a glimpse of the robust will and masculine genius which conquered and consolidated a great country the vigour daring and sagacity which tempered the grosser traits in the mind of william are suppressed and the masterly warrior and statesman is reduced to an inglorious spoiler of peasants and hunter of deer the advantages which accrued to england from the conquest itself were unknown to pope who fancied that its principal result was to destroy agriculture and impoverish the people he was not aware that it introduced a more advanced civilisation imparted new energy to a backward stagnant population opened up to them a vista of grander views and repaid transitory suffering by vast and permanent benefits  a fourth element in windsor forest is not noticed by bowles pope considered that the reflections upon life and political institutions were the distinguishing excellence of coopers hill he emulated in this respect his masters merits surpassed him in polish of style and fell below him in strength of thought hunting the hare suggests to pope this poor and false conclusion      beasts urged by us their fellow beasts pursue     and learn of man each other to undo  how much more weighty is the sentiment expressed by denham when the stag endeavours to take refuge in the herd                         the herd unkindly wise     or chases him from thence or from him flies     like a declining statesman left forlorn     to his friends pity and pursuers scorn     with shame remembers while himself was one     of the same herd himself the same had done  the terse satire upon henry viii is a still better specimen of denhams moralisings as he surveys the prospect round coopers hill he is reminded of the dissolution of the monasteries by the sight of the place where once stood a chapel which had shared the fate of its parent abbey this rouses his indignation and he thus proceeds      tell me my muse what monstrous dire offence     what crime could any christian king incense     to such a rage wast luxury or lust     was he so temperate so chaste so just     were these their crimesthey were his own much more     but wealth is crime enough to him thats poor     who having spent the treasures of his crown     condemns their luxury to feed his own     thus he the church at once protects and spoils     but princes swords are sharper than their styles  the last couplet is a contrast between the destroying energy of henry viii and the impotence of his book against luther  windsor forest has rather more variety in its versification than is usual with pope the poem opens with one of those breaks in the metre which were incessant in the older rhymsters and which were gradually abjured by their successors      thy forest windsor and thy green retreats     at once the monarchs and the muses seats     invite my lays  this use of the full stop commonly required that the sense should be carried on without a pause from the preceding line whereas the theory spread that the close of the sense should coincide with the close of the rhymed sound or in other words that the full stop should be always at the end of the couplet to keep the rhyme predominant there was an increasing tendency to have at least the pause of a comma even after the final word of the first line of the couplet thus from a license which as prior says was found too dissolute and wild and came very often too near prose the writers of heroics arrived at a system which produced too frequent an identity in the sound and brought every couplet to the point of an epigram34 denham according to johnson was the chief reformer who taught his followers the art of concluding their sense in couplets35 but he retained much of the primitive freedom and prior says that to dryden belongs the credit of perfecting the innovation and the blame of pushing it to excess pope went further than dryden when once the change had commenced there was a constant movement towards uniformity till the utmost verge was reached and a fresh reaction began bowles with his fine ear was a zealous advocate for diversified harmony and tuneful strength he felt that an occasional break managed with skill adds dignity to the couplet while the toning down of the final syllables by sometimes running one verse into another is a grateful antidote to the cloying monotony of emphatic rhymes imperfect rhymes offend from the impression they give of imperfect art but perfect rhymes softened by the continuous flow of the pronunciation are a relief to the ear as the rhymed sound should be diminished at intervals so at intervals it may be advantageously increased by the introduction of triplets dryden often used them with admirable effect36 pope employed them sparingly and they were almost entirely laid aside by his immediate imitators with them the taste for numerous verse was extinct  footnotes  footnote 1 johnson was mistaken pope states in a note that the addition commenced at ver 291  footnote 2      when actions unadorned are faint and weak     cities and countries must be taught to speak     gods may descend in factions from the skies     and rivers from their oozy beds arise  footnote 3 denham says johnson seems to have been at least among us the author of a species of composition that may be denominated local poetry of which the fundamental subject is some particular landscape to be poetically described with the addition of such embellishments as may be supplied by historical retrospection or incidental meditation  footnote 4 critics differ nothing says warton can be colder and more prosaic than the manner in which denham has

is the magna charta of heroic poetry besides he says the majesty which it gives it confines the sense within the barriers of three lines which would languish if it were lengthened into four johnson while granting that the variety arising from triplets was desirable wished that there should be some stated mode of admitting them in order to prevent their coming upon the reader by surprise and to keep up the constancy of metrical laws such a rule would introduce a new species of monotony and do away with the benefit which principally recommended triplets to dryden ideas which were not enough for four lines and overmuch for two would not recur at stages fixed beforehand swift thought triplets and alexandrines a corruption and boasted that he had banished them by a triplet in his city shower i absolutely he adds did prevail with mr pope and gay and dr young and one or two more to reject them mr pope never used them till he translated homer which was too long a work to be so very exact in and i think in one or two of his last poems he has out of laziness done the same thing though very seldom swift was mistaken in his assertion that pope never used triplets till he translated the iliad they occur in the essay on criticism the temple of fame and other pieces and not only did these works appear before the homer but they appeared after the triplet in the city shower which swift flattered himself had banished all triplets from poetry nor had he any need to persuade young and gay to reject them if they had been exploded by his triplet of 1710 for it was two or three years later before either young or gray printed their first rhymes they contained however triplets in spite of his city shower which had none of the effect he imagined it merely proved what no one doubted that a metre proper to serious subjects was ludicrous in a burlesque swifts dislike to triplets and alexandrines was a prejudice and he did not pretend to offer any reason for his decree

laws had a more serious object than to secure for the king a monopoly of sport the chief intention was to keep the newly conquered saxons from going armed under the pretext that they were in pursuit of game hence the penalty was of a nature to incapacitate the offender for military service  footnote 19 this is in imitation of waller      prove all a desert and none there make stay     but savage

savages more wild than they  wakefield remarks that there is an inaccuracy in popes couplet since the savage laws to which the pronoun they in part refers were the mode in which the severity of the king displayed itself  footnote 20 the representation is erroneous the air floods and wilds were not dispeopled the forest laws occasioned an increase in the quantity of game which was preserved more carefully when it became the property of the privileged few and was no longer liable to be exterminated by the many pope is not consistent with himself for he afterwards complains that while the subject starved the beast was fed  footnote 21 originally thus in the ms      from towns laid waste to dens and caves they ran     for who first stooped to be a slave was manwarburton  the conceit is childish because dens and caves are the residence of these brutes at all times and therefore their retreat to these places constitutes no argument of their aversion to slavery and the following

best antiquarians to say that the common tradition of villages and parishes within the compass of thirty miles being destroyed in the new forest is absolutely groundless no traces or vestiges of such being to be discovered nor any other parish named in doomsday book but what now remainswarton  the argument from doomsday book is of no weight if as lingard asserts the new forest was formed before the registration took place william was an eager sportsman he loved the beasts of chase says the saxon chronicle as if he had been their father and the source of his love was the pleasure he took in killing them his hunting grounds however were ample without the new forest and thierry thinks that his motive in forming it may have been political the wooded district denuded of a hostile population

footnote 34 william did not confine his oppression to the weak and succumb to the strong the statement that he was awed by his nobles is opposed to the contemporary testimony of the saxon chronicle no man says the writer durst do anything against his will he had earls in his bonds who had done against his will and at last he did not spare his own brother odo him he set in prison his rich men moaned says the chronicler again and the poor men murmured but he was so hard that he recked not the hatred of them all  footnote 35 the language is too strong when his power or interest was concerned says lingard william listened to no suggestions but those of ambition or avarice but on other occasions he displayed a strong sense of religion and a profound respect for its institutions while resisting ecclesiastical usurpation and depriving individuals who were disaffected or incompetent of their preferment he upheld the church and its dignitaries and left both in a more exalted position than he found them  footnote 36 it is incorrect to say that william was denied a grave as his body was about to be lowered into the vault in the church of st stephen which he had founded at caen a person named fitzarthur forbade the burial on the plea that the land had been taken by violence from his father but the prelates having paid him sixty shillings on the spot and promised him further

better in the manuscript      and rules the boundless empire of the main  by the alteration pope increased the compliment to anne by making her the light of the earth as well as mistress of the forest and the sea wakefield thinks that this application to the queen of the offices of diana as goddess of the woods the luminary of the night and the chief agent in the production of the tides is happily conceived but the moon and the monarch were the light of the earth and empress of the main in such different senses that the line is a trivial play upon words  footnote 74 in the last edition published in popes lifetime the four previous lines with the variation of sunny heaths for airy wastes were printed in a note and their place in the text was supplied by a single couplet      here as old bards have sung diana strayed     bathed in the springs or sought the cooling shade  wakefield suggests that pope rejected this latter line as not being suited to the prevailing character of the english climate but at ver 209 he represents the goddess as often laving in the lodona and to bathe and luxuriate in shade are surely common enough in england  footnote 75 dr warton says that johnson seems to have passed too severe a censure on this episode of lodona and that a tale in a descriptive poem has a good effect johnson does not object to a tale in a descriptive poem he objects only to

the tide poured as much water into the thames as all the other rivers of the world discharged into the ocean and he probably meant that all the navigable rivers of the globe did not send more commerce to the sea than came from the sea up the thames even in this case it was a wild without being a poetical exaggeration  footnote 91 in the first edition      no seas so rich so full no streams appear

the romans at one period gave to london the representation of the god attended by      all little rivers which owe vassalage     to him as to their lord and tribute pay  and the accompanying

appellation was formed from appending the name isis to thame  footnote 146 warton observes that pope has here copied and equalled the description of rivers in spenser drayton and milton the description is beautiful but in some points it is deficient winding isis and fruitful thame are ill designated no peculiar and visible image is added to the character of the streams either interesting from beauty or incidental circumstances most rivers wind and may be called fruitful as well as the isis and thame the latter part of the description is much more masterly as every river has its distinctive mark and that mark is picturesque it may be said however that all the epithets in a description of this sort cannot be equally significant but surely something more striking should have been given as circumstantially characteristic of such rivers as the isis and thames than that they were winding and fruitful or of the kennet that it was renowned for silver eelsbowles  footnote 147
