54067548	under western eyes  by joseph conrad     i would take liberty from any hand as a hungry man would snatch a piece of bread miss haldin     part first    to begin with i wish to disclaim the possession of those high gifts of imagination and expression which would have enabled my pen to create for the reader the personality of the man who called himself after the russian custom cyril son of isidorkirylo sidorovitchrazumov  if i have ever had these gifts in any sort of living form they have been smothered out of existence a long time ago under a wilderness of words words as is well known are the great foes of reality i have been for many years a teacher of languages it is an occupation which at length becomes fatal to whatever share of imagination observation and insight an ordinary person may be heir to to a teacher of languages there comes a time when the world is but a place of many words and man appears a mere talking animal not much more wonderful than a parrot  this being so i could not have observed mr razumov or guessed at his reality by the force of insight much less have imagined him as he was even to invent the mere bald facts of his life would have been utterly beyond my powers but i think that without this declaration the readers of these pages will be able to detect in the story the marks of documentary evidence and that is perfectly correct it is based on a document all i have brought to it is my knowledge of the russian language which is sufficient for what is attempted here the document of course is something in the nature of a journal a diary yet not exactly that in its actual form for instance most of it was not written up from day to day though all the entries are dated some of these entries cover months of time and extend over dozens of pages all the earlier part is a retrospect in a narrative form relating to an event which took place about a year before  i must mention that i have lived for a long time in geneva a whole quarter of that town on account of many russians residing there is called la petite russielittle russia i had a rather extensive connexion in little russia at that time yet i confess that i have no comprehension of the russian character the illogicality of their attitude the arbitrariness of their conclusions the frequency of the exceptional should present no difficulty to a student of many grammars but there must be something else in the way some special human traitone of those subtle differences that are beyond the ken of mere professors what must remain striking to a teacher of languages is the russians extraordinary love of words they gather them up they cherish them but they dont hoard them in their breasts on the contrary they are always ready to pour them out by the hour or by the night with an enthusiasm a sweeping abundance with such an aptness of application sometimes that as in the case of very accomplished parrots one cant defend oneself from the suspicion that they really understand what they say there is a generosity in their ardour of speech which removes it as far as possible from common loquacity and it is ever too disconnected to be classed as eloquence but i must apologize for this digression  it would be idle to inquire why mr razumov has left this record behind him it is inconceivable that he should have wished any human eye to see it a mysterious impulse of human nature comes into play here putting aside samuel pepys who has forced in this way the door of immortality innumerable people criminals saints philosophers young girls statesmen and simple imbeciles have kept selfrevealing records from vanity no doubt but also from other more inscrutable motives there must be a wonderful soothing power in mere words since so many men have used them for selfcommunion being myself a quiet individual i take it that what all men are really after is some form or perhaps only some formula of peace certainly they are crying loud enough for it at the present day what sort of peace kirylo sidorovitch razumov expected to find in the writing up of his record it passeth my understanding to guess  the fact remains that he has written it  mr razumov was a tall wellproportioned young man quite unusually dark for a russian from the central provinces his good looks would have been unquestionable if it had not been for a peculiar lack of fineness in the features it was as if a face modelled vigorously in wax with some approach even to a classical correctness of type had been held close to a fire till all sharpness of line had been lost in the softening of the material but even thus he was sufficiently goodlooking his manner too was good in discussion he was easily swayed by argument and authority with his younger compatriots he took the attitude of an inscrutable listener a listener of the kind that hears you out intelligently and thenjust changes the subject  this sort of trick which may arise either from intellectual insufficiency or from an imperfect trust in ones own convictions procured for mr razumov a reputation of profundity amongst a lot of exuberant talkers in the habit of exhausting themselves daily by ardent discussion a comparatively taciturn personality is naturally credited with reserve power by his comrades at the st petersburg university kirylo sidorovitch razumov third years student in philosophy was looked upon as a strong naturean altogether trustworthy man this in a country where an opinion may be a legal crime visited by death or sometimes by a fate worse than mere death meant that he was worthy of being trusted with forbidden opinions he was liked also for his amiability and for his quiet readiness to oblige his comrades even at the cost of personal inconvenience  mr razumov was supposed to be the son of an archpriest and to be protected by a distinguished noblemanperhaps of his own distant province but his outward appearance accorded badly with such humble origin such a descent was not credible it was indeed suggested that mr razumov was the son of an archpriests pretty daughterwhich of course would put a different complexion on the matter this theory also rendered intelligible the protection of the distinguished nobleman all this however had never been investigated maliciously or otherwise no one knew or cared who the nobleman in question was razumov received a modest but very sufficient allowance from the hands of an obscure attorney who seemed to act as his guardian in some measure now and then he appeared at some professors informal reception apart from that razumov was not known to have any social relations in the town he attended the obligatory lectures regularly and was considered by the authorities as a very promising student he worked at home in the manner of a man who means to get on but did not shut himself up severely for that purpose he was always accessible and there was nothing secret or reserved in his life  i  the origin of mr razumovs record is connected with an event characteristic of modern russia in the actual fact the assassination of a prominent statesmanand still more characteristic of the moral corruption of an oppressed society where the noblest aspirations of humanity the desire of freedom an ardent patriotism the love of justice the sense of pity and even the fidelity of simple minds are prostituted to the lusts of hate and fear the inseparable companions of an uneasy despotism  the fact alluded to above is the successful attempt on the life of mr de p the president of the notorious repressive commission of some years ago the minister of state invested with extraordinary powers the newspapers made noise enough about that fanatical narrowchested figure in goldlaced uniform with a face of crumpled parchment insipid bespectacled eyes and the cross of the order of st procopius hung under the skinny throat for a time it may be remembered not a month passed without his portrait appearing in some one of the illustrated papers of europe he served the monarchy by imprisoning exiling or sending to the gallows men and women young and old with an equable unwearied industry in his mystic acceptance of the principle of autocracy he was bent on extirpating from the land every vestige of anything that resembled freedom in public institutions and in his ruthless persecution of the rising generation he seemed to aim at the destruction of the very hope of liberty itself  it is said that this execrated personality had not enough imagination to be aware of the hate he inspired it is hardly credible but it is a fact that he took very few precautions for his safety in the preamble of a certain famous state paper he had declared once that the thought of liberty has never existed in the act of the creator from the multitude of mens counsel nothing could come but revolt and disorder and revolt and disorder in a world created for obedience and stability is sin it was not reason but authority which expressed the divine intention god was the autocrat of the universe it may be that the man who made this declaration believed that heaven itself was bound to protect him in his remorseless defence of autocracy on this earth  no doubt the vigilance of the police saved him many times but as a matter of fact when his appointed fate overtook him the competent authorities could not have given him any warning they had no knowledge of any conspiracy against the ministers life had no hint of any plot through their usual channels of information had seen no signs were aware of no suspicious movements or dangerous persons  mr de p was being driven towards the railway station in a twohorse uncovered sleigh with footman and coachman on the box snow had been falling all night making the roadway uncleared as yet at this early hour very heavy for the horses it was still falling thickly but the sleigh must have been observed and marked down as it drew over to the left before taking a turn the footman noticed a peasant walking slowly on the edge of the pavement with his hands in the pockets of his sheepskin coat and his shoulders hunched up to his ears under the falling snow on being overtaken this peasant suddenly faced about and swung his arm in an instant there was a terrible shock a detonation muffled in the multitude of snowflakes both horses lay dead and mangled on the ground and the coachman with a shrill cry had fallen off the box mortally wounded the footman who survived had no time to see the face of the man in the sheepskin coat after throwing the bomb this last got away but it is supposed that seeing a lot of people surging up on all sides of him in the falling snow and all running towards the scene of the explosion he thought it safer to turn back with them  in an incredibly short time an excited crowd assembled round the sledge the ministerpresident getting out unhurt into the deep snow stood near the groaning coachman and addressed the people repeatedly in his weak colourless voice i beg of you to keep off for the love of god i beg of you good people to keep off  it was then that a tall young man who had remained standing perfectly still within a carriage gateway two houses lower down stepped out into the street and walking up rapidly flung another bomb over the heads of the crowd it actually struck the ministerpresident on the shoulder as he stooped over his dying servant then falling between his feet exploded with a terrific concentrated violence striking him dead to the ground finishing the wounded man and practically annihilating the empty sledge in the twinkling of an eye with a yell of horror the crowd broke up and fled in all directions except for those who fell dead or dying where they stood nearest to the ministerpresident and one or two others who did not fall till they had run a little way  the first explosion had brought together a crowd as if by enchantment the second made as swiftly a solitude in the street for hundreds of yards in each direction through the falling snow people looked from afar at the small heap of dead bodies lying upon each other near the carcases of the two horses nobody dared to approach till some cossacks of a streetpatrol galloped up and dismounting began to turn over the dead amongst the innocent victims of the second explosion laid out on the pavement there was a body dressed in a peasants sheepskin coat but the face was unrecognisable there was absolutely nothing found in the pockets of its poor clothing and it was the only one whose identity was never established  that day mr razumov got up at his usual hour and spent the morning within the university buildings listening to the lectures and working for some time in the library he heard the first vague rumour of something in the way of bombthrowing at the table of the students ordinary where he was accustomed to eat his two oclock dinner but this rumour was made up of mere whispers and this was russia where it was not always safe for a student especially to appear too much interested in certain kinds of whispers razumov was one of those men who living in a period of mental and political unrest keep an instinctive hold on normal practical everyday life he was aware of the emotional tension of his time he even responded to it in an indefinite way but his main concern was with his work his studies and with his own future  officially and in fact without a family for the daughter of the archpriest had long been dead no home influences had shaped his opinions or his feelings he was as lonely in the world as a man swimming in the deep sea the word razumov was the mere label of a solitary individuality there were no razumovs belonging to him anywhere his closest parentage was defined in the statement that he was a russian whatever good he expected from life would be given to or withheld from his hopes by that connexion alone this immense parentage suffered from the throes of internal dissensions and he shrank mentally from the fray as a goodnatured man may shrink from taking definite sides in a violent family quarrel  razumov going home reflected that having prepared all the matters of the forthcoming examination he could now devote his time to the subject of the prize essay he hankered after the silver medal the prize was offered by the ministry of education the names of the competitors would be submitted to the minister himself the mere fact of trying would be considered meritorious in the higher quarters and the possessor of the prize would have a claim to an administrative appointment of the better sort after he had taken his degree the student razumov in an access of elation forgot the dangers menacing the stability of the institutions which give rewards and appointments but remembering the medallist of the year before razumov the young man of no parentage was sobered he and some others happened to be assembled in their comrades rooms at the very time when that last received the official advice of his success he was a quiet unassuming young man forgive me he had said with a faint apologetic smile and taking up his cap i am going out to order up some wine but i must first send a telegram to my folk at home i say wont the old people make it a festive time for the neighbours for twenty miles around our place  razumov thought there was nothing of that sort for him in the world his success would matter to no one but he felt no bitterness against the nobleman his protector who was not a provincial magnate as was generally supposed he was in fact nobody less than prince k once a great and splendid figure in the world and now his day being over a senator and a gouty invalid living in a still splendid but more domestic manner he had some young children and a wife as aristocratic and proud as himself  in all his life razumov was allowed only once to come into personal contact with the prince  it had the air of a chance meeting in the little attorneys office one day razumov coming in by appointment found a stranger standing therea tall aristocraticlooking personage with silky grey sidewhiskers the baldheaded sly little lawyerfellow called out come income in mr razumov with a sort of ironic heartiness then turning deferentially to the stranger with the grand air a ward of mine your excellency one of the most promising students of his faculty in the st petersburg university  to his intense surprise razumov saw a white shapely hand extended to him he took it in great confusion it was soft and passive and heard at the same time a condescending murmur in which he caught only the words satisfactory and persevere but the most amazing thing of all was to feel suddenly a distinct pressure of the white shapely hand just before it was withdrawn a light pressure like a secret sign the emotion of it was terrible razumovs heart seemed to leap into his throat when he raised his eyes the aristocratic personage motioning the little lawyer aside had opened the door and was going out  the attorney rummaged amongst the papers on his desk for a time do you know who that was he asked suddenly  razumov whose heart was thumping hard yet shook his head in silence  that was prince k you wonder what he could be doing in the hole of a poor legal rat like myselfeh these awfully great people have their sentimental curiosities like common sinners but if i were you kirylo sidorovitch he continued leering and laying a peculiar emphasis on the patronymic i wouldnt boast at large of the introduction it would not be prudent kirylo sidorovitch oh dear no it would be in fact dangerous for your future  the young mans ears burned like fire his sight was dim that man razumov was saying to himself he  henceforth it was by this monosyllable that mr razumov got into the habit of referring mentally to the stranger with grey silky sidewhiskers from that time too when walking in the more fashionable quarters he noted with interest the magnificent horses and carriages with prince ks liveries on the box once he saw the princess get outshe was shoppingfollowed by two girls of which one was nearly a head taller than the other their fair hair hung loose down their backs in the english style they had merry eyes their coats muffs and little fur caps were exactly alike and their cheeks and noses were tinged a cheerful pink by the frost they crossed the pavement in front of him and razumov went on his way smiling shyly to himself his daughters they resembled him the young man felt a glow of warm friendliness towards these girls who would never know of his existence presently they would marry generals or kammerherrs and have girls and boys of their own who perhaps would be aware of him as a celebrated old professor decorated possibly a privy councillor one of the glories of russianothing more  but a celebrated professor was a somebody distinction would convert the label razumov into an honoured name there was nothing strange in the student razumovs wish for distinction a mans real life is that accorded to him in the thoughts of other men by reason of respect or natural love returning home on the day of the attempt on mr de ps life razumov resolved to have a good try for the silver medal  climbing slowly the four flights of the dark dirty staircase in the house where he had his lodgings he felt confident of success the winners name would be published in the papers on new years day and at the thought that he would most probably read it there razumov stopped short on the stairs for an instant then went on smiling faintly at his own emotion this is but a shadow he said to himself but the medal is a solid beginning  with those ideas of industry in his head the warmth of his room was agreeable and encouraging i shall put in four hours of good work he thought but no sooner had he closed the door than he was horribly startled all black against the usual tall stove of white tiles gleaming in the dusk stood a strange figure wearing a skirted closefitting brown cloth coat strapped round the waist in long boots and with a little astrakhan cap on its head it loomed lithe and martial razumov was utterly confounded it was only when the figure advancing two paces asked in an untroubled grave voice if the outer door was closed that he regained his power of speech  haldin victor victorovitch is that you yes the outer door is shut all right but this is indeed unexpected  victor haldin a student older than most of his contemporaries at the university was not one of the industrious set he was hardly ever seen at lectures the authorities had marked him as restless and unsound very bad notes but he had a great personal prestige with his comrades and influenced their thoughts razumov had never been intimate with him they had met from time to time at gatherings in other students houses they had even had a discussion togetherone of those discussions on first principles dear to the sanguine minds of youth  razumov wished the man had chosen some other time to come for a chat he felt in good trim to tackle the prize essay but as haldin could not be slightingly dismissed razumov adopted the tone of hospitality asking him to sit down and smoke  kirylo sidorovitch said the other flinging off his cap we are not perhaps in exactly the same camp your judgment is more philosophical you are a man of few words but i havent met anybody who dared to doubt the generosity of your sentiments there is a solidity about your character which cannot exist without courage  razumov felt flattered and began to murmur shyly something about being very glad of his good opinion when haldin raised his hand  that is what i was saying to myself he continued as i dodged in the woodyard down by the riverside he has a strong character this young man i said to myself he does not throw his soul to the winds your reserve has always fascinated me kirylo sidorovitch so i tried to remember your address but look hereit was a piece of luck your dvornik was away from the gate talking to a sleighdriver on the other side of the street i met no one on the stairs not a soul as i came up to your floor i caught sight of your landlady coming out of your rooms but she did not see me she crossed the landing to her own side and then i slipped in i have been here two hours expecting you to come in every moment  razumov had listened in astonishment but before he could open his mouth haldin added speaking deliberately it was i who removed de p this morning razumov kept down a cry of dismay the sentiment of his life being utterly ruined by this contact with such a crime expressed itself quaintly by a sort of halfderisive mental exclamation there goes my silver medal  haldin continued after waiting a while  you say nothing kirylo sidorovitch i understand your silence to be sure i cannot expect you with your frigid english manner to embrace me but never mind your manners you have enough heart to have heard the sound of weeping and gnashing of teeth this man raised in the land that would be enough to get over any philosophical hopes he was uprooting the tender plant he had to be stopped he was a dangerous mana convinced man three more years of his work would have put us back fifty years into bondageand look at all the lives wasted at all the souls lost in that time  his curt selfconfident voice suddenly lost its ring and it was in a dull tone that he added yes brother i have killed him its weary work  razumov had sunk into a chair every moment he expected a crowd of policemen to rush in there must have been thousands of them out looking for that man walking up and down in his room haldin was talking again in a restrained steady voice now and then he flourished an arm slowly without excitement  he told razumov how he had brooded for a year how he had not slept properly for weeks he and another had a warning of the ministers movements from a certain person late the evening before he and that another prepared their engines and resolved to have no sleep till the deed was done they walked the streets under the falling snow with the engines on them exchanging not a word the livelong night when they happened to meet a police patrol they took each other by the arm and pretended to be a couple of peasants on the spree they reeled and talked in drunken hoarse voices except for these strange outbreaks they kept silence moving on ceaselessly their plans had been previously arranged at daybreak they made their way to the spot which they knew the sledge must pass when it appeared in sight they exchanged a muttered goodbye and separated the other remained at the corner haldin took up a position a little farther up the street  after throwing his engine he ran off and in a moment was overtaken by the panicstruck people flying away from the spot after the second explosion they were wild with terror he was jostled once or twice he slowed down for the rush to pass him and then turned to the left into a narrow street there he was alone  he marvelled at this immediate escape the work was done he could hardly believe it he fought with an almost irresistible longing to lie down on the pavement and sleep but this sort of faintnessa drowsy faintnesspassed off quickly he walked faster making his way to one of the poorer parts of the town in order to look up ziemianitch  this ziemianitch razumov understood was a sort of townpeasant who had got on owner of a small number of sledges and horses for hire haldin paused in his narrative to exclaim  a bright spirit a hardy soul the best driver in st petersburg he has a team of three horses there ah hes a fellow  this man had declared himself willing to take out safely at any time one or two persons to the second or third railway station on one of the southern lines but there had been no time to warn him the night before his usual haunt seemed to be a lowclass eatinghouse on the outskirts of the town when haldin got there the man was not to be found he was not expected to turn up again till the evening haldin wandered away restlessly  he saw the gate of a woodyard open and went in to get out of the wind which swept the bleak broad thoroughfare the great rectangular piles of cut wood loaded with snow resembled the huts of a village at first the watchman who discovered him crouching amongst them talked in a friendly manner he was a driedup old man wearing two ragged army coats one over the other his wizened little face tied up under the jaw and over the ears in a dirty red handkerchief looked comical presently he grew sulky and then all at once without rhyme or reason began to shout furiously  arent you ever going to clear out of this you loafer we know all about factory hands of your sort a big strong young chap you arent even drunk what do you want here you dont frighten us take yourself and your ugly eyes away  haldin stopped before the sitting razumov his supple figure with the white forehead above which the fair hair stood straight up had an aspect of lofty daring  he did not like my eyes he said and sohere i am  razumov made an effort to speak calmly  but pardon me victor victorovitch we know each other so little i dont see why you  confidence said haldin  this word sealed razumovs lips as if a hand had been clapped on his mouth his brain seethed with arguments  and sohere you are he muttered through his teeth  the other did not detect the tone of anger never suspected it  yes and nobody knows i am here you are the last person that could be suspectedshould i get caught thats an advantage you see and thenspeaking to a superior mind like yours i can well say all the truth it occurred to me that youyou have no one belonging to youno ties no one to suffer for it if this came out by some means there have been enough ruined russian homes as it is but i dont see how my passage through your rooms can be ever known if i should be got hold of ill know how to keep silentno matter what they may be pleased to do to me he added grimly  he began to walk again while razumov sat still appalled  you thought that he faltered out almost sick with indignation  yes razumov yes brother some day you shall help to build you suppose that i am a terrorist nowa destructor of what is but consider that the true destroyers are they who destroy the spirit of progress and truth not the avengers who merely kill the bodies of the persecutors of human dignity men like me are necessary to make room for selfcontained thinking men like you well we have made the sacrifice of our lives but all the same i want to escape if it can be done it is not my life i want to save but my power to do i wont live idle oh no dont make any mistake razumov men like me are rare and besides an example like this is more awful to oppressors when the perpetrator vanishes without a trace they sit in their offices and palaces and quake all i want you to do is to help me to vanish no great matter that only to go by and by and see ziemianitch for me at that place where i went this morning just tell him he whom you know wants a wellhorsed sledge to pull up half an hour after midnight at the seventh lamppost on the left counting from the upper end of karabelnaya if nobody gets in the sledge is to run round a block or two so as to come back past the same spot in ten minutes time  razumov wondered why he had not cut short that talk and told this man to go away long before was it weakness or what  he concluded that it was a sound instinct haldin must have been seen it was impossible that some people should not have noticed the face and appearance of the man who threw the second bomb haldin was a noticeable person the police in their thousands must have had his description within the hour with every moment the danger grew sent out to wander in the streets he could not escape being caught in the end  the police would very soon find out all about him they would set about discovering a conspiracy everybody haldin had ever known would be in the greatest danger unguarded expressions little facts in themselves innocent would be counted for crimes razumov remembered certain words he said the speeches he had listened to the harmless gatherings he had attendedit was almost impossible for a student to keep out of that sort of thing without becoming suspect to his comrades  razumov saw himself shut up in a fortress worried badgered perhaps illused he saw himself deported by an administrative order his life broken ruined and robbed of all hope he saw himselfat bestleading a miserable existence under police supervision in some small faraway provincial town without friends to assist his necessities or even take any steps to alleviate his lotas others had others had fathers mothers brothers relations connexions to move heaven and earth on their behalfhe had no one the very officials that sentenced him some morning would forget his existence before sunset  he saw his youth pass away from him in misery and half starvationhis strength give way his mind become an abject thing he saw himself creeping broken down and shabby about the streetsdying unattended in some filthy hole of a room or on the sordid bed of a government hospital  he shuddered then the peace of bitter calmness came over him it was best to keep this man out of the streets till he could be got rid of with some chance of escaping that was the best that could be done razumov of course felt the safety of his lonely existence to be permanently endangered this evenings doings could turn up against him at any time as long as this man lived and the present institutions endured they appeared to him rational and indestructible at that moment they had a force of harmonyin contrast with the horrible discord of this mans presence he hated the man he said quietly  yes of course i will go you must give me precise directions and for the restdepend on me  ah you are a fellow collectedcool as a cucumber a regular englishman where did you get your soul from there arent many like you look here brother men like me leave no posterity but their souls are not lost no mans soul is ever lost it works for itselfor else where would be the sense of selfsacrifice of martyrdom of conviction of faiththe labours of the soul what will become of my soul when i die in the way i must diesoonvery soon perhaps it shall not perish dont make a mistake razumov this is not murderit is war war my spirit shall go on warring in some russian body till all falsehood is swept out of the world the modern civilization is false but a new revelation shall come out of russia ha you say nothing you are a sceptic i respect your philosophical scepticism razumov but dont touch the soul the russian soul that lives in all of us it has a future it has a mission i tell you or else why should i have been moved to do thisrecklesslike a butcherin the middle of all these innocent peoplescattering deathi i i wouldnt hurt a fly  not so loud warned razumov harshly  haldin sat down abruptly and leaning his head on his folded arms burst into tears he wept for a long time the dusk had deepened in the room razumov motionless in sombre wonder listened to the sobs  the other raised his head got up and with an effort mastered his voice  yes men like me leave no posterity he repeated in a subdued tone i have a sister though shes with my old motheri persuaded them to go abroad this yearthank god not a bad little girl my sister she has the most trustful eyes of any human being that ever walked this earth she will marry well i hope she may have childrensons perhaps look at me my father was a government official in the provinces he had a little land too a simple servant of goda true russian in his way his was the soul of obedience but i am not like him they say i resemble my mothers eldest brother an officer they shot him in 28 under nicholas you know havent i told you that this is war war but god of justice this is weary work  razumov in his chair leaning his head on his hand spoke as if from the bottom of an abyss  you believe in god haldin  there you go catching at words that are wrung from one what does it matter what was it the englishman said there is a divine soul in things devil take himi dont remember now but he spoke the truth when the day of you thinkers comes dont you forget whats divine in the russian souland thats resignation respect that in your intellectual restlessness and dont let your arrogant wisdom spoil its message to the world i am speaking to you now like a man with a rope round his neck what do you imagine i am a being in revolt no its you thinkers who are in everlasting revolt i am one of the resigned when the necessity of this heavy work came to me and i understood that it had to be donewhat did i do did i exult did i take pride in my purpose did i try to weigh its worth and consequences no i was resigned i thought gods will be done  he threw himself full length on razumovs bed and putting the backs of his hands over his eyes remained perfectly motionless and silent not even the sound of his breathing could be heard the dead stillness or the room remained undisturbed till in the darkness razumov said gloomily  haldin  yes answered the other readily quite invisible now on the bed and without the slightest stir  isnt it time for me to start  yes brother the other was heard lying still in the darkness as though he were talking in his sleep the time has come to put fate to the test  he paused then gave a few lucid directions in the quiet impersonal voice of a man in a trance razumov made ready without a word of answer as he was leaving the room the voice on the bed said after him  go with god thou silent soul  on the landing moving softly razumov locked the door and put the key in his pocket  ii  the words and events of that evening must have been graven as if with a steel tool on mr razumovs brain since he was able to write his relation with such fullness and precision a good many months afterwards  the record of the thoughts which assailed him in the street is even more minute and abundant they seem to have rushed upon him with the greater freedom because his thinking powers were no longer crushed by haldins presencethe appalling presence of a great crime and the stunning force of a great fanaticism on looking through the pages of mr razumovs diary i own that a rush of thoughts is not an adequate image  the more adequate description would be a tumult of thoughtsthe faithful reflection of the state of his feelings the thoughts in themselves were not numerousthey were like the thoughts of most human beings few and simplebut they cannot be reproduced here in all their exclamatory repetitions which went on in an endless and weary turmoilfor the walk was long  if to the western reader they appear shocking inappropriate or even improper it must be remembered that as to the first this may be the effect of my crude statement for the rest i will only remark here that this is not a story of the west of europe  nations it may be have fashioned their governments but the governments have paid them back in the same coin it is unthinkable that any young englishman should find himself in razumovs situation this being so it would be a vain enterprise to imagine what he would think the only safe surmise to make is that he would not think as mr razumov thought at this crisis of his fate he would not have an hereditary and personal knowledge or the means by which historical autocracy represses ideas guards its power and defends its existence by an act of mental extravagance he might imagine himself arbitrarily thrown into prison but it would never occur to him unless he were delirious and perhaps not even then that he could be beaten with whips as a practical measure either of investigation or of punishment  this is but a crude and obvious example of the different conditions of western thought i dont know that this danger occurred specially to mr razumov no doubt it entered unconsciously into the general dread and the general appallingness of this crisis razumov as has been seen was aware of more subtle ways in which an individual may be undone by the proceedings of a despotic government a simple expulsion from the university the very least that could happen to him with an impossibility to continue his studies anywhere was enough to ruin utterly a young man depending entirely upon the development of his natural abilities for his place in the world he was a russian and for him to be implicated meant simply sinking into the lowest social depths amongst the hopeless and the destitutethe night birds of the city  the peculiar circumstances of razumovs parentage or rather of his lack of parentage should be taken into the account of his thoughts and he remembered them too he had been lately reminded of them in a peculiarly atrocious way by this fatal haldin because i havent that must everything else be taken away from me he thought  he nerved himself for another effort to go on along the roadway sledges glided phantomlike and jingling through a fluttering whiteness on the black face of the night for it is a crime he was saying to himself a murder is a murder though of course some sort of liberal institutions  a feeling of horrible sickness came over him i must be courageous he exhorted himself mentally all his strength was suddenly gone as if taken out by a hand then by a mighty effort of will it came back because he was afraid of fainting in the street and being picked up by the police with the key of his lodgings in his pocket they would find haldin there and then indeed he would be undone  strangely enough it was this fear which seems to have kept him up to the end the passersby were rare they came upon him suddenly looming up black in the snowflakes close by then vanishing all at oncewithout footfalls  it was the quarter of the very poor razumov noticed an elderly woman tied up in ragged shawls under the street lamp she seemed a beggar off duty she walked leisurely in the blizzard as though she had no home to hurry to she hugged under one arm a round loaf of black bread with an air of guarding a priceless booty and razumov averting his glance envied her the peace of her mind and the serenity of her fate  to one reading mr razumovs narrative it is really a wonder how he managed to keep going as he did along one interminable street after another on pavements that were gradually becoming blocked with snow it was the thought of haldin locked up in his rooms and the desperate desire to get rid of his presence which drove him forward no rational determination had any part in his exertions thus when on arriving at the low eatinghouse he heard that the man of horses ziemianitch was not there he could only stare stupidly  the waiter a wildhaired youth in tarred boots and a pink shirt exclaimed uncovering his pale gums in a silly grin that ziemianitch had got his skinful early in the afternoon and had gone away with a bottle under each arm to keep it up amongst the horseshe supposed  the owner of the vile den a bony short man in a dirty cloth caftan coming down to his heels stood by his hands tucked into his belt and nodded confirmation  the reek of spirits the greasy rancid steam of food got razumov by the throat he struck a table with his clenched hand and shouted violently  you lie  bleary unwashed faces were turned to his direction a mildeyed ragged tramp drinking tea at the next table moved farther away a murmur of wonder arose with an undertone of uneasiness a laugh was heard too and an exclamation there there jeeringly soothing the waiter looked all round and announced to the room  the gentleman wont believe that ziemianitch is drunk   from a distant corner a hoarse voice belonging to a horrible nondescript shaggy being with a black face like the muzzle of a bear grunted angrily  the cursed driver of thieves what do we want with his gentlemen here we are all honest folk in this place  razumov biting his lip till blood came to keep himself from bursting into imprecations followed the owner of the den who whispering come along little father led him into a tiny hole of a place behind the wooden counter whence proceeded a sound of splashing a wet and bedraggled creature a sort of sexless and shivering scarecrow washed glasses in there bending over a wooden tub by the light of a tallow dip  yes little father the man in the long caftan said plaintively he had a brown cunning little face a thin greyish beard trying to light a tin lantern he hugged it to his breast and talked garrulously the while  he would show ziemianitch to the gentleman to prove there were no lies told and he would show him drunk his woman it seems ran away from him last night such a hag she was thin pfui he spat they were always running away from that driver of the deviland he sixty years old too could never get used to it but each heart knows sorrow after its own kind and ziemianitch was a born fool all his days and then he would fly to the bottle who could bear life in our land without the bottle he says a proper russian manthe little pig be pleased to follow me  razumov crossed a quadrangle of deep snow enclosed between high walls with innumerable windows here and there a dim yellow light hung within the foursquare mass of darkness the house was an enormous slum a hive of human vermin a monumental abode of misery towering on the verge of starvation and despair  in a corner the ground sloped sharply down and razumov followed the light of the lantern through a small doorway into a long cavernous place like a neglected subterranean byre deep within three shaggy little horses tied up to rings hung their heads together motionless and shadowy in the dim light of the lantern it must have been the famous team of haldins escape razumov peered fearfully into the gloom his guide pawed in the straw with his foot  here he is ah the little pigeon a true russian man no heavy hearts for me he says bring out the bottle and take your ugly mug out of my sight ha ha ha thats the fellow he is  he held the lantern over a prone form of a man apparently fully dressed for outdoors his head was lost in a pointed cloth hood on the other side of a heap of straw protruded a pair of feet in monstrous thick boots  always ready to drive commented the keeper of the eatinghouse a proper russian driver that saint or devil night or day is all one to ziemianitch when his heart is free from sorrow i dont ask who you are but where you want to go he says he would drive satan himself to his own abode and come back chirruping to his horses many a one he has driven who is clanking his chains in the nertchinsk mines by this time  razumov shuddered  call him wake him up he faltered out  the other set down his light stepped back and launched a kick at the prostrate sleeper the man shook at the impact but did not move at the third kick he grunted but remained inert as before  the eatinghouse keeper desisted and fetched a deep sigh  you see for yourself how it is we have done what we can for you  he picked up the lantern the intense black spokes of shadow swung about in the circle of light a terrible furythe blind rage of selfpreservationpossessed razumov  ah the vile beast he bellowed out in an unearthly tone which made the lantern jump and tremble i shall wake you give megive me  he looked round wildly seized the handle of a stablefork and rushing forward struck at the prostrate body with inarticulate cries after a time his cries ceased and the rain of blows fell in the stillness and shadows of the cellarlike stable razumov belaboured ziemianitch with an insatiable fury in great volleys of sounding thwacks except for the violent movements of razumov nothing stirred neither the beaten man nor the spokelike shadows on the walls and only the sound of blows was heard it was a weird scene  suddenly there was a sharp crack the stick broke and half of it flew far away into the gloom beyond the light at the same time ziemianitch sat up at this razumov became as motionless as the man with the lanternonly his breast heaved for air as if ready to burst  some dull sensation of pain must have penetrated at last the consoling night of drunkenness enwrapping the bright russian soul of haldins enthusiastic praise but ziemianitch evidently saw nothing his eyeballs blinked all white in the light once twicethen the gleam went out for a moment he sat in the straw with closed eyes with a strange air of weary meditation then fell over slowly on his side without making the slightest sound only the straw rustled a little razumov stared wildly fighting for his breath after a second or two he heard a light snore  he flung from him the piece of stick remaining in his grasp and went off with great hasty strides without looking back once  after going heedlessly for some fifty yards along the street he walked into a snowdrift and was up to his knees before he stopped  this recalled him to himself and glancing about he discovered he had been going in the wrong direction he retraced his steps but now at a more moderate pace when passing before the house he had just left he flourished his fist at the sombre refuge of misery and crime rearing its sinister bulk on the white ground it had an air of brooding he let his arm fall by his sidediscouraged  ziemianitchs passionate surrender to sorrow and consolation had baffled him that was the people a true russian man razumov was glad he had beaten that brutethe bright soul of the other here they were the people and the enthusiast  between the two he was done for between the drunkenness of the peasant incapable of action and the dreamintoxication of the idealist incapable of perceiving the reason of things and the true character of men it was a sort of terrible childishness but children had their masters ah the stick the stick the stern hand thought razumov longing for power to hurt and destroy  he was glad he had thrashed that brute the physical exertion had left his body in a comfortable glow his mental agitation too was clarified as if all the feverishness had gone out of him in a fit of outward violence together with the persisting sense of terrible danger he was conscious now of a tranquil unquenchable hate  he walked slower and slower and indeed considering the guest he had in his rooms it was no wonder he lingered on the way it was like harbouring a pestilential disease that would not perhaps take your life but would take from you all that made life worth livinga subtle pest that would convert earth into a hell  what was he doing now lying on the bed as if dead with the back of his hands over his eyes razumov had a morbidly vivid vision of haldin on his bedthe white pillow hollowed by the head the legs in long boots the upturned feet and in his abhorrence he said to himself ill kill him when i get home but he knew very well that that was of no use the corpse hanging round his neck would be nearly as fatal as the living man nothing short of complete annihilation would do and that was impossible what then must one kill oneself to escape this visitation  razumovs despair was too profoundly tinged with hate to accept that issue  and yet it was despairnothing lessat the thought of having to live with haldin for an indefinite number of days in mortal alarm at every sound but perhaps when he heard that this bright soul of ziemianitch suffered from a drunken eclipse the fellow would take his infernal resignation somewhere else and that was not likely on the face of it  razumov thought i am being crushedand i cant even run away other men had somewhere a corner of the earthsome little house in the provinces where they had a right to take their troubles a material refuge he had nothing he had not even a moral refugethe refuge of confidence to whom could he go with this talein all this great great land  razumov stamped his footand under the soft carpet of snow felt the hard ground of russia inanimate cold inert like a sullen and tragic mother hiding her face under a windingsheethis native soilhis very ownwithout a fireside without a heart  he cast his eyes upwards and stood amazed the snow had ceased to fall and now as if by a miracle he saw above his head the clear black sky of the northern winter decorated with the sumptuous fires of the stars it was a canopy fit for the resplendent purity of the snows  razumov received an almost physical impression of endless space and of countless millions  he responded to it with the readiness of a russian who is born to an inheritance of space and numbers under the sumptuous immensity of the sky the snow covered the endless forests the frozen rivers the plains of an immense country obliterating the landmarks the accidents of the ground levelling everything under its uniform whiteness like a monstrous blank page awaiting the record of an inconceivable history it covered the passive land with its lives of countless people like ziemianitch and its handful of agitators like this haldinmurdering foolishly  it was a sort of sacred inertia razumov felt a respect for it a voice seemed to cry within him dont touch it it was a guarantee of duration of safety while the travail of maturing destiny went ona work not of revolutions with their passionate levity of action and their shifting impulsesbut of peace what it needed was not the conflicting aspirations of a people but a will strong and one it wanted not the babble of many voices but a manstrong and one  razumov stood on the point of conversion he was fascinated by its approach by its overpowering logic for a train of thought is never false the falsehood lies deep in the necessities of existence in secret fears and halfformed ambitions in the secret confidence combined with a secret mistrust of ourselves in the love of hope and the dread of uncertain days  in russia the land of spectral ideas and disembodied aspirations many brave minds have turned away at last from the vain and endless conflict to the one great historical fact of the land they turned to autocracy for the peace of their patriotic conscience as a weary unbeliever touched by grace turns to the faith of his fathers for the blessing of spiritual rest like other russians before him razumov in conflict with himself felt the touch of grace upon his forehead  haldin means disruption he thought to himself beginning to walk again what is he with his indignation with his talk of bondagewith his talk of gods justice all that means disruption better that thousands should suffer than that a people should become a disintegrated mass helpless like dust in the wind obscurantism is better than the light of incendiary torches the seed germinates in the night out of the dark soil springs the perfect plant but a volcanic eruption is sterile the ruin of the fertile ground and am i who love my countrywho have nothing but that to love and put my faith inam i to have my future perhaps my usefulness ruined by this sanguinary fanatic  the grace entered into razumov he believed now in the man who would come at the appointed time  what is a throne a few pieces of wood upholstered in velvet but a throne is a seat of power too the form of government is the shape of a toolan instrument but twenty thousand bladders inflated by the noblest sentiments and jostling against each other in the air are a miserable incumbrance of space holding no power possessing no will having nothing to give  he went on thus heedless of the way holding a discourse with himself with extraordinary abundance and facility generally his phrases came to him slowly after a conscious and painstaking wooing some superior power had inspired him with a flow of masterly argument as certain converted sinners become overwhelmingly loquacious  he felt an austere exultation  what are the luridly smoky lucubrations of that fellow to the clear grasp of my intellect he thought is not this my country have i not got forty million brothers he asked himself unanswerably victorious in the silence of his breast and the fearful thrashing he had given the inanimate ziemianitch seemed to him a sign of intimate union a pathetically severe necessity of brotherly love no if i must suffer let me at least suffer for my convictions not for a crime my reasonmy cool superior reasonrejects  he ceased to think for a moment the silence in his breast was complete but he felt a suspicious uneasiness such as we may experience when we enter an unlighted strange placethe irrational feeling that something may jump upon us in the darkthe absurd dread of the unseen  of course he was far from being a mossgrown reactionary everything was not for the best despotic bureaucracy abuses corruption and so on capable men were wanted enlightened intelligences devoted hearts but absolute power should be preservedthe tool ready for the manfor the great autocrat of the future razumov believed in him the logic of history made him unavoidable the state of the people demanded him what else he asked himself ardently could move all that mass in one direction nothing could nothing but a single will  he was persuaded that he was sacrificing his personal longings of liberalismrejecting the attractive error for the stern russian truth thats patriotism he observed mentally and added theres no stopping midway on that road and then remarked to himself i am not a coward  and again there was a dead silence in razumovs breast he walked with lowered head making room for no one he walked slowly and his thoughts returning spoke within him with solemn slowness  what is this haldin and what am i only two grains of sand but a great mountain is made up of just such insignificant grains and the death of a man or of many men is an insignificant thing yet we combat a contagious pestilence do i want his death no i would save him if i couldbut no one can do thathe is the withered member which must be cut off if i must perish through him let me at least not perish with him and associated against my will with his sombre folly that understands nothing either of men or things why should i leave a false memory  it passed through his mind that there was no one in the world who cared what sort of memory he left behind him he exclaimed to himself instantly perish vainly for a falsehood what a miserable fate  he was now in a more animated part of the town he did not remark the crash of two colliding sledges close to the curb the driver of one bellowed tearfully at his fellow  oh thou vile wretch  this hoarse yell let out nearly in his ear disturbed razumov he shook his head impatiently and went on looking straight before him suddenly on the snow stretched on his back right across his path he saw haldin solid distinct real with his inverted hands over his eyes clad in a brown closefitting coat and long boots he was lying out of the way a little as though he had selected that place on purpose the snow round him was untrodden  this hallucination had such a solidity of aspect that the first movement of razumov was to reach for his pocket to assure himself that the key of his rooms was there but he checked the impulse with a disdainful curve of his lips he understood his thought concentrated intensely on the figure left lying on his bed had culminated in this extraordinary illusion of the sight razumov tackled the phenomenon calmly with a stern face without a check and gazing far beyond the vision he walked on experiencing nothing but a slight tightening of the chest after passing he turned his head for a glance and saw only the unbroken track of his footsteps over the place where the breast of the phantom had been lying  razumov walked on and after a little time whispered his wonder to himself  exactly as if alive seemed to breathe and right in my way too i have had an extraordinary experience  he made a few steps and muttered through his set teeth  i shall give him up  then for some twenty yards or more all was blank he wrapped his cloak closer round him he pulled his cap well forward over his eyes  betray a great word what is betrayal they talk of a man betraying his country his friends his sweetheart there must be a moral bond first all a man can betray is his conscience and how is my conscience engaged here by what bond of common faith of common conviction am i obliged to let that fanatical idiot drag me down with him on the contraryevery obligation of true courage is the other way  razumov looked round from under his cap  what can the prejudice of the world reproach me with have i provoked his confidence no have i by a single word look or gesture given him reason to suppose that i accepted his trust in me no it is true that i consented to go and see his ziemianitch well i have been to see him and i broke a stick on his back toothe brute  something seemed to turn over in his head bringing uppermost a singularly hard clear facet of his brain  it would be better however he reflected with a quite different mental accent to keep that circumstance altogether to myself  he had passed beyond the turn leading to his lodgings and had reached a wide and fashionable street some shops were still open and all the restaurants lights fell on the pavement where men in expensive fur coats with here and there the elegant figure of a woman walked with an air of leisure razumov looked at them with the contempt of an austere believer for the frivolous crowd it was the worldthose officers dignitaries men of fashion officials members of the yacht club the event of the morning affected them all what would they say if they knew what this student in a cloak was going to do  not one of them is capable of feeling and thinking as deeply as i can how many of them could accomplish an act of conscience  razumov lingered in the welllighted street he was firmly decided indeed it could hardly be called a decision he had simply discovered what he had meant to do all along and yet he felt the need of some other minds sanction  with something resembling anguish he said to himself  i want to be understood the universal aspiration with all its profound and melancholy meaning assailed heavily razumov who amongst eighty millions of his kith and kin had no heart to which he could open himself  the attorney was not to be thought of he despised the little agent of chicane too much one could not go and lay ones conscience before the policeman at the corner neither was razumov anxious to go to the chief of his districts policea commonlooking person whom he used to see sometimes in the street in a shabby uniform and with a smouldering cigarette stuck to his lower lip he would begin by locking me up most probably at any rate he is certain to get excited and create an awful commotion thought razumov practically  an act of conscience must be done with outward dignity  razumov longed desperately for a word of advice for moral support who knows what true loneliness isnot the conventional word but the naked terror to the lonely themselves it wears a mask the most miserable outcast hugs some memory or some illusion now and then a fatal conjunction of events may lift the veil for an instant for an instant only no human being could bear a steady view of moral solitude without going mad  razumov had reached that point of vision to escape from it he embraced for a whole minute the delirious purpose of rushing to his lodgings and flinging himself on his knees by the side of the bed with the dark figure stretched on it to pour out a full confession in passionate words that would stir the whole being of that man to its innermost depths that would end in embraces and tears in an incredible fellowship of soulssuch as the world had never seen it was sublime  inwardly he wept and trembled already but to the casual eyes that were cast upon him he was aware that he appeared as a tranquil student in a cloak out for a leisurely stroll he noted too the sidelong brilliant glance of a pretty womanwith a delicate head and covered in the hairy skins of wild beasts down to her feet like a frail and beautiful savagewhich rested for a moment with a sort of mocking tenderness on the deep abstraction of that goodlooking young man  suddenly razumov stood still the glimpse of a passing grey whisker caught and lost in the same instant had evoked the complete image of prince k the man who once had pressed his hand as no other man had pressed ita faint but lingering pressure like a secret sign like a halfunwilling caress  and razumov marvelled at himself why did he not think of him before  a senator a dignitary a great personage the very manhe  a strange softening emotion came over razumovmade his knees shake a little he repressed it with a newborn austerity all that sentiment was pernicious nonsense he couldnt be quick enough and when he got into a sledge he shouted to the driverto the k palace get onyou fly the startled moujik bearded up to the very whites of his eyes answered obsequiously  i hear your high nobility  it was lucky for razumov that prince k was not a man of timid character on the day of mr de ps murder an extreme alarm and despondency prevailed in the high official spheres  prince k sitting sadly alone in his study was told by his alarmed servants that a mysterious young man had forced his way into the hall refused to tell his name and the nature of his business and would not move from there till he had seen his excellency in private instead of locking himself up and telephoning for the police as nine out of ten high personages would have done that evening the prince gave way to curiosity and came quietly to the door of his study  in the hall the front door standing wide open he recognised at once razumov pale as death his eyes blazing and surrounded by perplexed lackeys  the prince was vexed beyond measure and even indignant but his humane instincts and a subtle sense of selfrespect could not allow him to let this young man be thrown out into the street by base menials he retreated unseen into his room and after a little rang his bell razumov heard in the hall an ominously raised harsh voice saying somewhere far away  show the gentleman in here  razumov walked in without a tremor he felt himself invulnerableraised far above the shallowness of common judgment though he saw the prince looking at him with black displeasure the lucidity of his mind of which he was very conscious gave him an extraordinary assurance he was not asked to sit down  half an hour later they appeared in the hall together the lackeys stood up and the prince moving with difficulty on his gouty feet was helped into his furs the carriage had been ordered before when the great double door was flung open with a crash razumov who had been standing silent with a lost gaze but with every faculty intensely on the alert heard the princes voice  your arm young man  the mobile superficial mind of the exguards officer man of showy missions experienced in nothing but the arts of gallant intrigue and worldly success had been equally impressed by the more obvious difficulties of such a situation and by razumovs quiet dignity in stating them  he had said no upon the whole i cant condemn the step you ventured to take by coming to me with your story it is not an affair for police understrappers the greatest importance is attached to set your mind at rest i shall see you through this most extraordinary and difficult situation  then the prince rose to ring the bell and razumov making a short bow had said with deference  i have trusted my instinct a young man having no claim upon anybody in the world has in an hour of trial involving his deepest political convictions turned to an illustrious russianthats all  the prince had exclaimed hastily  you have done well  in the carriageit was a small brougham on sleigh runnersrazumov broke the silence in a voice that trembled slightly  my gratitude surpasses the greatness of my presumption  he gasped feeling unexpectedly in the dark a momentary pressure on his arm  you have done well repeated the prince  when the carriage stopped the prince murmured to razumov who had never ventured a single question  the house of general t  in the middle of the snowcovered roadway blazed a great bonfire some cossacks the bridles of their horses over the arm were warming themselves around two sentries stood at the door several gendarmes lounged under the great carriage gateway and on the firstfloor landing two orderlies rose and stood at attention razumov walked at the princes elbow  a surprising quantity of hothouse plants in pots cumbered the floor of the anteroom servants came forward a young man in civilian clothes arrived hurriedly was whispered to bowed low and exclaiming zealously certainlythis minute fled within somewhere the prince signed to razumov  they passed through a suite of receptionrooms all barely lit and one of them prepared for dancing the wife of the general had put off her party an atmosphere of consternation pervaded the place but the generals own room with heavy sombre hangings two massive desks and deep armchairs had all the lights turned on the footman shut the door behind them and they waited  there was a coal fire in an english grate razumov had never before seen such a fire and the silence of the room was like the silence of the grave perfect measureless for even the clock on the mantelpiece made no sound filling a corner on a black pedestal stood a quarterlifesize smoothlimbed bronze of an adolescent figure running the prince observed in an undertone  spontinis flight of youth exquisite  admirable assented razumov faintly  they said nothing more after this the prince silent with his grand air razumov staring at the statue he was worried by a sensation resembling the gnawing of hunger  he did not turn when he heard an inner door fly open and a quick footstep muffled on the carpet  the princes voice immediately exclaimed thick with excitement  we have got himce miserable a worthy young man came to meno its incredible  razumov held his breath before the bronze as if expecting a crash behind his back a voice he had never heard before insisted politely  asseyezvous donc  the prince almost shrieked mais comprenezvous mon cher lassassin the murdererwe have got him  razumov spun round the generals smooth big cheeks rested on the stiff collar of his uniform he must have been already looking at razumov because that last saw the pale blue eyes fastened on him coldly  the prince from a chair waved an impressive hand  this is a most honourable young man whom providence itself mr razumov  the general acknowledged the introduction by frowning at razumov who did not make the slightest movement  sitting down before his desk the general listened with compressed lips it was impossible to detect any sign of emotion on his face  razumov watched the immobility of the fleshy profile but it lasted only a moment till the prince had finished and when the general turned to the providential young man his florid complexion the blue unbelieving eyes and the bright white flash of an automatic smile had an air of jovial careless cruelty he expressed no wonder at the extraordinary storyno pleasure or excitementno incredulity either he betrayed no sentiment whatever only with a politeness almost deferential suggested that the bird might have flown while mrmr razumov was running about the streets  razumov advanced to the middle of the room and said the door is locked and i have the key in my pocket  his loathing for the man was intense it had come upon him so unawares that he felt he had not kept it out of his voice the general looked up at him thoughtfully and razumov grinned  all this went over the head of prince k seated in a deep armchair very tired and impatient  a student called haldin said the general thoughtfully  razumov ceased to grin  that is his name he said unnecessarily loud victor victorovitch haldina student  the general shifted his position a little  how is he dressed would you have the goodness to tell me  razumov angrily described haldins clothing in a few jerky words the general stared all the time then addressing the prince  we were not without some indications he said in french a good woman who was in the street described to us somebody wearing a dress of the sort as the thrower of the second bomb we have detained her at the secretariat and every one in a tcherkess coat we could lay our hands on has been brought to her to look at she kept on crossing herself and shaking her head at them it was exasperating he turned to razumov and in russian with friendly reproach  take a chair mr razumovdo why are you standing  razumov sat down carelessly and looked at the general  this goggleeyed imbecile understands nothing he thought  the prince began to speak loftily  mr razumov is a young man of conspicuous abilities i have it at heart that his future should not  certainly interrupted the general with a movement of the hand has he any weapons on him do you think mr razumov  the general employed a gentle musical voice razumov answered with suppressed irritation  no but my razors are lying aboutyou understand  the general lowered his head approvingly  precisely  then to the prince explaining courteously  we want that bird alive it will be the devil if we cant make him sing a little before we are done with him  the gravelike silence of the room with its mute clock fell upon the polite modulations of this terrible phrase the prince hidden in the chair made no sound  the general unexpectedly developed a thought  fidelity to menaced institutions on which depend the safety of a throne and of a people is no childs play we know that mon prince andtenez he went on with a sort of flattering harshness mr razumov here begins to understand that too  his eyes which he turned upon razumov seemed to be starting out of his head this grotesqueness of aspect no longer shocked razumov he said with gloomy conviction  haldin will never speak  that remains to be seen muttered the general  i am certain insisted razumov a man like this never speaks do you imagine that i am here from fear he added violently he felt ready to stand by his opinion of haldin to the last extremity  certainly not protested the general with great simplicity of tone and i dont mind telling you mr razumov that if he had not come with his tale to such a staunch and loyal russian as you he would have disappeared like a stone in the water which would have had a detestable effect he added with a bright cruel smile under his stony stare so you see there can be no suspicion of any fear here  the prince intervened looking at razumov round the back of the armchair  nobody doubts the moral soundness of your action be at ease in that respect pray  he turned to the general uneasily  thats why i am here you may be surprised why i should  the general hastened to interrupt  not at all extremely natural you saw the importance  yes broke in the prince and i venture to ask insistently that mine and mr razumovs intervention should not become public he is a young man of promiseof remarkable aptitudes  i havent a doubt of it murmured the general he inspires confidence  all sorts of pernicious views are so widespread nowadaysthey taint such unexpected quartersthat monstrous as it seems he might suffer his studieshis  the general with his elbows on the desk took his head between his hands  yes yes i am thinking it out how long is it since you left him at your rooms mr razumov  razumov mentioned the hour which nearly corresponded with the time of his distracted flight from the big slum house he had made up his mind to keep ziemianitch out of the affair completely to mention him at all would mean imprisonment for the bright soul perhaps cruel floggings and in the end a journey to siberia in chains razumov who had beaten ziemianitch felt for him now a vague remorseful tenderness  the general giving way for the first time to his secret sentiments exclaimed contemptuously  and you say he came in to make you this confidence like thisfor nothinga propos des bottes  razumov felt danger in the air the merciless suspicion of despotism had spoken openly at last sudden fear sealed razumovs lips the silence of the room resembled now the silence of a deep dungeon where time does not count and a suspect person is sometimes forgotten for ever but the prince came to the rescue  providence itself has led the wretch in a moment of mental aberration to seek mr razumov on the strength of some old utterly misinterpreted exchange of ideassome sort of idle speculative conversationmonths agoi am toldand completely forgotten till now by mr razumov  mr razumov queried the general meditatively after a short silence do you often indulge in speculative conversation  no excellency answered razumov coolly in a sudden access of selfconfidence i am a man of deep convictions crude opinions are in the air they are not always worth combating but even the silent contempt of a serious mind may be misinterpreted by headlong utopists  the general stared from between his hands prince k murmured  a serious young man un esprit superieur  i see that mon cher prince said the general mr razumov is quite safe with me i am interested in him he has it seems the great and useful quality of inspiring confidence what i was wondering at is why the other should mention anything at alli mean even the bare fact aloneif his object was only to obtain temporary shelter for a few hours for after all nothing was easier than to say nothing about it unless indeed he were trying under a crazy misapprehension of your true sentiments to enlist your assistanceeh mr razumov  it seemed to razumov that the floor was moving slightly this grotesque man in a tight uniform was terrible it was right that he should be terrible  i can see what your excellency has in your mind but i can only answer that i dont know why  i have nothing in my mind murmured the general with gentle surprise  i am his preyhis helpless prey thought razumov the fatigues and the disgusts of that afternoon the need to forget the fear which he could not keep off reawakened his hate for haldin  then i cant help your excellency i dont know what he meant i only know there was a moment when i wished to kill him there was also a moment when i wished myself dead i said nothing i was overcome i provoked no confidencei asked for no explanations  razumov seemed beside himself but his mind was lucid it was really a calculated outburst  it is rather a pity the general said that you did not dont you know at all what he means to do razumov calmed down and saw an opening there  he told me he was in hopes that a sledge would meet him about half an hour after midnight at the seventh lamppost on the left from the upper end of karabelnaya at any rate he meant to be there at that time he did not even ask me for a change of clothes  ah voila said the general turning to prince k with an air of satisfaction there is a way to keep your protege mr razumov quite clear of any connexion with the actual arrest we shall be ready for that gentleman in karabelnaya  the prince expressed his gratitude there was real emotion in his voice razumov motionless silent sat staring at the carpet the general turned to him  half an hour after midnight till then we have to depend on you mr razumov you dont think he is likely to change his purpose  how can i tell said razumov those men are not of the sort that ever changes its purpose  what men do you mean  fanatical lovers of liberty in general liberty with a capital l excellency liberty that means nothing precise liberty in whose name crimes are committed  the general murmured  i detest rebels of every kind i cant help it its my nature  he clenched a fist and shook it drawing back his arm they shall be destroyed then  they have made a sacrifice of their lives beforehand said razumov with malicious pleasure and looking the general straight in the face if haldin does change his purpose tonight you may depend on it that it will not be to save his life by flight in some other way he would have thought then of something else to attempt but that is not likely  the general repeated as if to himself they shall be destroyed  razumov assumed an impenetrable expression  the prince exclaimed  what a terrible necessity  the generals arm was lowered slowly  one comfort there is that brood leaves no posterity ive always said it one effort pitiless persistent steadyand we are done with them for ever  razumov thought to himself that this man entrusted with so much arbitrary power must have believed what he said or else he could not have gone on bearing the responsibility  i detest rebels these subversive minds these intellectual debauches my existence has been built on fidelity its a feeling to defend it i am ready to lay down my lifeand even my honourif that were needed but pray tell me what honour can there be as against rebelsagainst people that deny god himselfperfect unbelievers brutes it is horrible to think of  during this tirade razumov facing the general had nodded slightly twice prince k standing on one side with his grand air murmured casting up his eyes  helas  then lowering his glance and with great decision declared  this young man general is perfectly fit to apprehend the bearing of your memorable words  the generals whole expression changed from dull resentment to perfect urbanity  i would ask now mr razumov he said to return to his home note that i dont ask mr razumov whether he has justified his absence to his guest no doubt he did this sufficiently but i dont ask mr razumov inspires confidence it is a great gift i only suggest that a more prolonged absence might awaken the criminals suspicions and induce him perhaps to change his plans  he rose and with a scrupulous courtesy escorted his visitors to the anteroom encumbered with flowerpots  razumov parted with the prince at the corner of a street in the carriage he had listened to speeches where natural sentiment struggled with caution evidently the prince was afraid of encouraging any hopes of future intercourse but there was a touch of tenderness in the voice uttering in the dark the guarded general phrases of goodwill and the prince too said  i have perfect confidence in you mr razumov  they all it seems have confidence in me thought razumov dully he had an indulgent contempt for the man sitting shoulder to shoulder with him in the confined space probably he was afraid of scenes with his wife she was said to be proud and violent  it seemed to him bizarre that secrecy should play such a large part in the comfort and safety of lives but he wanted to put the princes mind at ease and with a proper amount of emphasis he said that being conscious of some small abilities and confident in his power of work he trusted his future to his own exertions he expressed his gratitude for the helping hand such dangerous situations did not occur twice in the course of one lifehe added  and you have met this one with a firmness of mind and correctness of feeling which give me a high idea of your worth the prince said solemnly you have now only to persevereto persevere  on getting out on the pavement razumov saw an ungloved hand extended to him through the lowered window of the brougham it detained his own in its grasp for a moment while the light of a street lamp fell upon the princes long face and oldfashioned grey whiskers  i hope you are perfectly reassured now as to the consequences  after what your excellency has condescended to do for me i can only rely on my conscience  adieu said the whiskered head with feeling  razumov bowed the brougham glided away with a slight swish in the snowhe was alone on the edge of the pavement  he said to himself that there was nothing to think about and began walking towards his home  he walked quietly it was a common experience to walk thus home to bed after an evening spent somewhere with his fellows or in the cheaper seats of a theatre after he had gone a little way the familiarity of things got hold of him nothing was changed there was the familiar corner and when he turned it he saw the familiar dim light of the provision shop kept by a german woman there were loaves of stale bread bunches of onions and strings of sausages behind the small windowpanes they were closing it the sickly lame fellow whom he knew so well by sight staggered out into the snow embracing a large shutter  nothing would change there was the familiar gateway yawning black with feeble glimmers marking the arches of the different staircases  the sense of lifes continuity depended on trifling bodily impressions the trivialities of daily existence were an armour for the soul and this thought reinforced the inward quietness of razumov as he began to climb the stairs familiar to his feet in the dark with his hand on the familiar clammy banister the exceptional could not prevail against the material contacts which make one day resemble another tomorrow would be like yesterday  it was only on the stage that the unusual was outwardly acknowledged  i suppose thought razumov that if i had made up my mind to blow out my brains on the landing i would be going up these stairs as quietly as i am doing it now whats a man to do what must be must be extraordinary things do happen but when they have happened they are done with thus too when the mind is made up that question is done with and the daily concerns the familiarities of our thought swallow it upand the life goes on as before with its mysterious and secret sides quite out of sight as they should be life is a public thing  razumov unlocked his door and took the key out entered very quietly and bolted the door behind him carefully  he thought he hears me and after bolting the door he stood still holding his breath there was not a sound he crossed the bare outer room stepping deliberately in the darkness entering the other he felt all over his table for the matchbox the silence but for the groping of his hand was profound could the fellow be sleeping so soundly  he struck a light and looked at the bed haldin was lying on his back as before only both his hands were under his head his eyes were open he stared at the ceiling  razumov held the match up he saw the clearcut features the firm chin the white forehead and the topknot of fair hair against the white pillow there he was lying flat on his back razumov thought suddenly i have walked over his chest  he continued to stare till the match burnt itself out then struck another and lit the lamp in silence without looking towards the bed any more he had turned his back on it and was hanging his coat on a peg when he heard haldin sigh profoundly then ask in a tired voice  well and what have you arranged  the emotion was so great that razumov was glad to put his hands against the wall a diabolical impulse to say i have given you up to the police frightened him exceedingly but he did not say that he said without turning round in a muffled voice  its done  again he heard haldin sigh he walked to the table sat down with the lamp before him and only then looked towards the bed  in the distant corner of the large room far away from the lamp which was small and provided with a very thick china shade haldin appeared like a dark and elongated shaperigid with the immobility of death this body seemed to have less substance than its own phantom walked over by razumov in the street white with snow it was more alarming in its shadowy persistent reality than the distinct but vanishing illusion  haldin was heard again  you must have had a walksuch a walk he murmured deprecatingly this weather  razumov answered with energy  horrible walk a nightmare of a walk  he shuddered audibly haldin sighed once more then  and so you have seen ziemianitchbrother  ive seen him  razumov remembering the time he had spent with the prince thought it prudent to add i had to wait some time  a charactereh its extraordinary what a sense of the necessity of freedom there is in that man and he has sayings toosimple to the point such as only the people can invent in their rough sagacity a character that  i you understand havent had much opportunity razumov muttered through his teeth  haldin continued to stare at the ceiling  you see brother i have been a good deal in that house of late i used to take there booksleaflets not a few of the poor people who live there can read and you see the guests for the feast of freedom must be sought for in byways and hedges the truth is i have almost lived in that house of late i slept sometimes in the stable there is a stable  thats where i had my interview with ziemianitch interrupted razumov gently a mocking spirit entered into him and he added it was satisfactory in a sense i came away from it much relieved  ah hes a fellow went on haldin talking slowly at the ceiling i came to know him in that way you see for some weeks now ever since i resigned myself to do what had to be done i tried to isolate myself i gave up my rooms what was the good of exposing a decent widow woman to the risk of being worried out of her mind by the police i gave up seeing any of our comrades  razumov drew to himself a halfsheet of paper and began to trace lines on it with a pencil  upon my word he thought angrily he seems to have thought of everybodys safety but mine  haldin was talking on  this morningah this morningthat was different how can i explain to you before the deed was done i wandered at night and lay hid in the day thinking it out and i felt restful sleepless but restful what was there for me to torment myself about but this morningafter then it was that i became restless i could not have stopped in that big house full of misery the miserable of this world cant give you peace then when that silly caretaker began to shout i said to myself there is a young man in this town head and shoulders above common prejudices  is he laughing at me razumov asked himself going on with his aimless drawing of triangles and squares and suddenly he thought my behaviour must appear to him strange should he take fright at my manner and rush off somewhere i shall be undone completely that infernal general  he dropped the pencil and turned abruptly towards the bed with the shadowy figure extended full length on itso much more indistinct than the one over whose breast he had walked without faltering was this too a phantom  the silence had lasted a long time he is no longer here was the thought against which razumov struggled desperately quite frightened at its absurdity he is already gone and thisonly  he could resist no longer he sprang to his feet saying aloud i am intolerably anxious and in a few headlong strides stood by the side of the bed his hand fell lightly on haldins shoulder and directly he felt its reality he was beset by an insane temptation to grip that exposed throat and squeeze the breath out of that body lest it should escape his custody leaving only a phantom behind  haldin did not stir a limb but his overshadowed eyes moving a little gazed upwards at razumov with wistful gratitude for this manifestation of feeling  razumov turned away and strode up and down the room it would have been possibly a kindness he muttered to himself and was appalled by the nature of that apology for a murderous intention his mind had found somewhere within him and all the same he could not give it up he became lucid about it what can he expect he thought the halterin the end and i  this argument was interrupted by haldins voice  why be anxious for me they can kill my body but they cannot exile my soul from this world i tell you whati believe in this world so much that i cannot conceive eternity otherwise than as a very long life that is perhaps the reason i am so ready to die  hm muttered razumov and biting his lower lip he continued to walk up and down and to carry on his strange argument  yes to a man in such a situationof course it would be an act of kindness the question however was not how to be kind but how to be firm he was a slippery customer  i too victor victorovitch believe in this world of ours he said with force i too while i live but you seem determined to haunt it you cant seriouslymean  the voice of the motionless haldin began  haunt it truly the oppressors of thought which quickens the world the destroyers of souls which aspire to perfection of human dignity they shall be haunted as to the destroyers of my mere body i have forgiven them beforehand  razumov had stopped apparently to listen but at the same time he was observing his own sensations he was vexed with himself for attaching so much importance to what haldin said  the fellows mad he thought firmly but this opinion did not mollify him towards haldin it was a particularly impudent form of lunacyand when it got loose in the sphere of public life of a country it was obviously the duty of every good citizen  this train of thought broke off short there and was succeeded by a paroxysm of silent hatred towards haldin so intense that razumov hastened to speak at random  yes eternity of course i too cant very well represent it to myself i imagine it however as something quiet and dull there would be nothing unexpecteddont you see the element of time would be wanting  he pulled out his watch and gazed at it haldin turned over on his side and looked on intently  razumov got frightened at this movement a slippery customer this fellow with a phantom it was not midnight yet he hastened on  and unfathomable mysteries can you conceive secret places in eternity impossible whereas life is full of them there are secrets of birth for instance one carries them on to the grave there is something comicalbut never mind and there are secret motives of conduct a mans most open actions have a secret side to them that is interesting and so unfathomable for instance a man goes out of a room for a walk nothing more trivial in appearance and yet it may be momentous he comes backhe has seen perhaps a drunken brute taken particular notice of the snow on the groundand behold he is no longer the same man the most unlikely things have a secret power over ones thoughtsthe grey whiskers of a particular personthe goggle eyes of another  razumovs forehead was moist he took a turn or two in the room his head low and smiling to himself viciously  have you ever reflected on the power of goggle eyes and grey whiskers excuse me you seem to think i must be crazy to talk in this vein at such a time but i am not talking lightly i have seen instances it has happened to me once to be talking to a man whose fate was affected by physical facts of that kind and the man did not know it of course it was a case of conscience but the material facts such as these brought about the solution and you tell me victor victorovitch not to be anxious why i am responsible for you razumov almost shrieked  he avoided with difficulty a burst of mephistophelian laughter haldin very pale raised himself on his elbow  and the surprises of life went on razumov after glancing at the other uneasily just consider their astonishing nature a mysterious impulse induces you to come here i dont say you have done wrong indeed from a certain point of view you could not have done better you might have gone to a man with affections and family ties you have such ties yourself as to me you know i have been brought up in an educational institute where they did not give us enough to eat to talk of affection in such a connexionyou perceive yourself as to ties the only ties i have in the world are social i must get acknowledged in some way before i can act at all i sit here working and dont you think i am working for progress too ive got to find my own ideas of the true way pardon me continued razumov after drawing breath and with a short throaty laugh but i havent inherited a revolutionary inspiration together with a resemblance from an uncle  he looked again at his watch and noticed with sickening disgust that there were yet a good many minutes to midnight he tore watch and chain off his waistcoat and laid them on the table well in the circle of bright lamplight haldin reclining on his elbow did not stir razumov was made uneasy by this attitude what move is he meditating over so quietly he thought he must be prevented i must keep on talking to him  he raised his voice  you are a son a brother a nephew a cousini dont know whatto no end of people i am just a man here i stand before you a man with a mind did it ever occur to you how a man who had never heard a word of warm affection or praise in his life would think on matters on which you would think first with or against your class your domestic traditionyour fireside prejudices did you ever consider how a man like that would feel i have no domestic tradition i have nothing to think against my tradition is historical what have i to look back to but that national past from which you gentlemen want to wrench away your future am i to let my intelligence my aspirations towards a better lot be robbed of the only thing it has to go upon at the will of violent enthusiasts you come from your province but all this land is mineor i have nothing no doubt you shall be looked upon as a martyr some daya sort of heroa political saint but i beg to be excused i am content in fitting myself to be a worker and what can you people do by scattering a few drops of blood on the snow on this immensity on this unhappy immensity i tell you he cried in a vibrating subdued voice and advancing one step nearer the bed that what it needs is not a lot of haunting phantoms that i could walk throughbut a man  haldin threw his arms forward as if to keep him off in horror  i understand it all now he exclaimed with awestruck dismay i understandat last  razumov staggered back against the table his forehead broke out in perspiration while a cold shudder ran down his spine  what have i been saying he asked himself have i let him slip through my fingers after all  he felt his lips go stiff like buckram and instead of a reassuring smile only achieved an uncertain grimace  what will you have he began in a conciliating voice which got steady after the first trembling word or two what will you have considera man of studious retired habitsand suddenly like this i am not practised in talking delicately but  he felt anger a wicked anger get hold of him again  what were we to do together till midnight sit here opposite each other and think of youryourshambles  haldin had a subdued heartbroken attitude he bowed his head his hands hung between his knees his voice was low and pained but calm  i see now how it is razumovbrother you are a magnanimous soul but my action is abhorrent to youalas  razumov stared from fright he had set his teeth so hard that his whole face ached it was impossible for him to make a sound  and even my person too is loathsome to you perhaps haldin added mournfully after a short pause looking up for a moment then fixing his gaze on the floor for indeed unless one  he broke off evidently waiting for a word razumov remained silent haldin nodded his head dejectedly twice  of course of course he murmured ah weary work  he remained perfectly still for a moment then made razumovs leaden heart strike a ponderous blow by springing up briskly  so be it he cried sadly in a low distinct tone farewell then  razumov started forward but the sight of haldins raised hand checked him before he could get away from the table he leaned on it heavily listening to the faint sounds of some town clock tolling the hour haldin already at the door tall and straight as an arrow with his pale face and a hand raised attentively might have posed for the statue of a daring youth listening to an inner voice razumov mechanically glanced down at his watch when he looked towards the door again haldin had vanished there was a faint rustling in the outer room the feeble click of a bolt drawn back lightly he was gonealmost as noiseless as a vision  razumov ran forward unsteadily with parted voiceless lips the outer door stood open staggering out on the landing he leaned far over the banister gazing down into the deep black shaft with a tiny glimmering flame at the bottom he traced by ear the rapid spiral descent of somebody running down the stairs on tiptoe it was a light swift pattering sound which sank away from him into the depths a fleeting shadow passed over the glimmera wink of the tiny flame then stillness  razumov hung over breathing the cold raw air tainted by the evil smells of the unclean staircase all quiet  he went back into his room slowly shutting the doors after him the peaceful steady light of his readinglamp shone on the watch razumov stood looking down at the little white dial it wanted yet three minutes to midnight he took the watch into his hand fumblingly  slow he muttered and a strange fit of nervelessness came over him his knees shook the watch and chain slipped through his fingers in an instant and fell on the floor he was so startled that he nearly fell himself when at last he regained enough confidence in his limbs to stoop for it he held it to his ear at once after a while he growled  stopped and paused for quite a long time before he muttered sourly  its done and now to work  he sat down reached haphazard for a book opened it in middle and began to read but after going conscientiously over two lines he lost his hold on the print completely and did not try to regain it he thought  there was to a certainty a police agent of some sort watching the house across the street  he imagined him lurking in a dark gateway goggleeyed muffled up in a cloak to the nose and with a generals plumed cocked hat on his head this absurdity made him start in the chair convulsively he literally had to shake his head violently to get rid of it the man would be disguised perhaps as a peasant a beggar perhaps he would be just buttoned up in a dark overcoat and carrying a loaded sticka shiftyeyed rascal smelling of raw onions and spirits  this evocation brought on positive nausea why do i want to bother about this thought razumov with disgust am i a gendarme moreover it is done  he got up in great agitation it was not done not yet not till halfpast twelve and the watch had stopped this reduced him to despair impossible to know the time the landlady and all the people across the landing were asleep how could he go and god knows what they would imagine or how much they would guess he dared not go into the streets to find out i am a suspect now theres no use shirking that fact he said to himself bitterly if haldin from some cause or another gave them the slip and failed to turn up in the karabelnaya the police would be invading his lodging and if he were not in he could never clear himself never razumov looked wildly about as if for some means of seizing upon time which seemed to have escaped him altogether he had never as far as he could remember heard the striking of that town clock in his rooms before this night and he was not even sure now whether he had heard it really on this night  he went to the window and stood there with slightly bent head on the watch for the faint sound i will stay here till i hear something he said to himself he stood still his ear turned to the panes an atrocious aching numbness with shooting pains in his back and legs tortured him he did not budge his mind hovered on the borders of delirium he heard himself suddenly saying i confess as a person might do on the rack i am on the rack he thought he felt ready to swoon the faint deep boom of the distant clock seemed to explode in his headhe heard it so clearly one  if haldin had not turned up the police would have been already here ransacking the house no sound reached him this time it was done  he dragged himself painfully to the table and dropped into the chair he flung the book away and took a square sheet of paper it was like the pile of sheets covered with his neat minute handwriting only blank he took a pen brusquely and dipped it with a vague notion of going on with the writing of his essaybut his pen remained poised over the sheet it hung there for some time before it came down and formed long scrawly letters  stillfaced and his lips set hard razumov began to write when he wrote a large hand his neat writing lost its character altogetherbecame unsteady almost childish he wrote five lines one under the other history not theory patriotism not internationalism evolution not revolution direction not destruction unity not disruption  he gazed at them dully then his eyes strayed to the bed and remained fixed there for a good many minutes while his right hand groped all over the table for the penknife  he rose at last and walking up with measured steps stabbed the paper with the penknife to the lath and plaster wall at the head of the bed this done he stepped back a pace and flourished his hand with a glance round the room  after that he never looked again at the bed he took his big cloak down from its peg and wrapping himself up closely went to lie down on the hard horsehair sofa at the other side of his room a leaden sleep closed his eyelids at once several times that night he woke up shivering from a dream of walking through drifts of snow in a russia where he was as completely alone as any betrayed autocrat could be an immense wintry russia which somehow his view could embrace in all its enormous expanse as if it were a map but after each shuddering start his heavy eyelids fell over his glazed eyes and he slept again   iii   approaching this part of mr razumovs story my mind the decent mind of an old teacher of languages feels more and more the difficulty of the task  the task is not in truth the writing in the narrative form a precis of a strange human document but the renderingi perceive it now clearlyof the moral conditions ruling over a large portion of this earths surface conditions not easily to be understood much less discovered in the limits of a story till some keyword is found a word that could stand at the back of all the words covering the pages a word which if not truth itself may perchance hold truth enough to help the moral discovery which should be the object of every tale  i turn over for the hundredth time the leaves of mr razumovs record i lay it aside i take up the penand the pen being ready for its office of setting down black on white i hesitate for the word that persists in creeping under its point is no other word than cynicism  for that is the mark of russian autocracy and of russian revolt in its pride of numbers in its strange pretensions of sanctity and in the secret readiness to abase itself in suffering the spirit of russia is the spirit of cynicism it informs the declarations of her statesmen the theories of her revolutionists and the mystic vaticinations of prophets to the point of making freedom look like a form of debauch and the christian virtues themselves appear actually indecent but i must apologize for the digression it proceeds from the consideration of the course taken by the story of mr razumov after his conservative convictions diluted in a vague liberalism natural to the ardour of his age had become crystallized by the shock of his contact with haldin  razumov woke up for the tenth time perhaps with a heavy shiver seeing the light of day in his window he resisted the inclination to lay himself down again he did not remember anything but he did not think it strange to find himself on the sofa in his cloak and chilled to the bone the light coming through the window seemed strangely cheerless containing no promise as the light of each new day should for a young man it was the awakening of a man mortally ill or of a man ninety years old he looked at the lamp which had burnt itself out it stood there the extinguished beacon of his labours a cold object of brass and porcelain amongst the scattered pages of his notes and small piles of booksa mere litter of blackened paperdead matterwithout significance or interest  he got on his feet and divesting himself of his cloak hung it on the peg going through all the motions mechanically an incredible dullness a ditchwater stagnation was sensible to his perceptions as though life had withdrawn itself from all things and even from his own thoughts there was not a sound in the house  turning away from the peg he thought in that same lifeless manner that it must be very early yet but when he looked at the watch on his table he saw both hands arrested at twelve oclock  ah yes he mumbled to himself and as if beginning to get roused a little he took a survey of his room the paper stabbed to the wall arrested his attention he eyed it from the distance without approval or perplexity but when he heard the servantgirl beginning to bustle about in the outer room with the samovar for his morning tea he walked up to it and took it down with an air of profound indifference  while doing this he glanced down at the bed on which he had not slept that night the hollow in the pillow made by the weight of haldins head was very noticeable  even his anger at this sign of the mans passage was dull he did not try to nurse it into life he did nothing all that day he neglected even to brush his hair the idea of going out never occurred to himand if he did not start a connected train of thought it was not because he was unable to think it was because he was not interested enough  he yawned frequently he drank large quantities of tea he walked about aimlessly and when he sat down he did not budge for a long time he spent some time drumming on the window with his fingertips quietly in his listless wanderings round about the table he caught sight of his own face in the lookingglass and that arrested him the eyes which returned his stare were the most unhappy eyes he had ever seen and this was the first thing which disturbed the mental stagnation of that day  he was not affected personally he merely thought that life without happiness is impossible what was happiness he yawned and went on shuffling about and about between the walls of his room looking forward was happinessthats allnothing more to look forward to the gratification of some desire to the gratification of some passion love ambition hatehate too indubitably love and hate and to escape the dangers of existence to live without fear was also happiness there was nothing else absence of fearlooking forward oh the miserable lot of humanity he exclaimed mentally and added at once in his thought i ought to be happy enough as far as that goes but he was not excited by that assurance on the contrary he yawned again as he had been yawning all day he was mildly surprised to discover himself being overtaken by night the room grew dark swiftly though time had seemed to stand still how was it that he had not noticed the passing of that day of course it was the watch being stopped  he did not light his lamp but went over to the bed and threw himself on it without any hesitation lying on his back he put his hands under his head and stared upward after a moment he thought i am lying here like that man i wonder if he slept while i was struggling with the blizzard in the streets no he did not sleep but why should i not sleep and he felt the silence of the night press upon all his limbs like a weight  in the calm of the hard frost outside the clearcut strokes of the town clock counting off midnight penetrated the quietness of his suspended animation  again he began to think it was twentyfour hours since that man left his room razumov had a distinct feeling that haldin in the fortress was sleeping that night it was a certitude which made him angry because he did not want to think of haldin but he justified it to himself by physiological and psychological reasons the fellow had hardly slept for weeks on his own confession and now every incertitude was at an end for him no doubt he was looking forward to the consummation of his martyrdom a man who resigns himself to kill need not go very far for resignation to die haldin slept perhaps more soundly than general t whose taskweary work toowas not done and over whose head hung the sword of revolutionary vengeance  razumov remembering the thickset man with his heavy jowl resting on the collar of his uniform the champion of autocracy who had let no sign of surprise incredulity or joy escape him but whose goggle eyes could express a mortal hatred of all rebellionrazumov moved uneasily on the bed  he suspected me he thought i suppose he must suspect everybody he would be capable of suspecting his own wife if haldin had gone to her boudoir with his confession  razumov sat up in anguish was he to remain a political suspect all his days was he to go through life as a man not wholly to be trustedwith a bad secret police note tacked on to his record what sort of future could he look forward to  i am now a suspect he thought again but the habit of reflection and that desire of safety of an ordered life which was so strong in him came to his assistance as the night wore on his quiet steady and laborious existence would vouch at length for his loyalty there were many permitted ways to serve ones country there was an activity that made for progress without being revolutionary the field of influence was great and infinitely variedonce one had conquered a name  his thought like a circling bird reverted after fourandtwenty hours to the silver medal and as it were poised itself there  when the day broke he had not slept not for a moment but he got up not very tired and quite sufficiently selfpossessed for all practical purposes  he went out and attended three lectures in the morning but the work in the library was a mere dumb show of research he sat with many volumes open before him trying to make notes and extracts his new tranquillity was like a flimsy garment and seemed to float at the mercy of a casual word betrayal why the fellow had done all that was necessary to betray himself precious little had been needed to deceive him  i have said no word to him that was not strictly true not one word razumov argued with himself  once engaged on this line of thought there could be no question of doing useful work the same ideas went on passing through his mind and he pronounced mentally the same words over and over again he shut up all the books and rammed all his papers into his pocket with convulsive movements raging inwardly against haldin  as he was leaving the library a long bony student in a threadbare overcoat joined him stepping moodily by his side razumov answered his mumbled greeting without looking at him at all  what does he want with me he thought with a strange dread of the unexpected which he tried to shake off lest it should fasten itself upon his life for good and all and the other muttering cautiously with downcast eyes supposed that his comrade had seen the news of de ps executionerthat was the expression he usedhaving been arrested the night before last  ive been illshut up in my rooms razumov mumbled through his teeth  the tall student raising his shoulders shoved his hands deep into his pockets he had a hairless square tallowy chin which trembled slightly as he spoke and his nose nipped bright red by the sharp air looked like a false nose of painted cardboard between the sallow cheeks his whole appearance was stamped with the mark of cold and hunger he stalked deliberately at razumovs elbow with his eyes on the ground  its an official statement he continued in the same cautious mutter it may be a lie but there was somebody arrested between midnight and one in the morning on tuesday this is certain  and talking rapidly under the cover of his downcast air he told razumov that this was known through an inferior government clerk employed at the central secretariat that man belonged to one of the revolutionary circles the same in fact i am affiliated to remarked the student  they were crossing a wide quadrangle an infinite distress possessed razumov annihilated his energy and before his eyes everything appeared confused and as if evanescent he dared not leave the fellow there he may be affiliated to the police was the thought that passed through his mind who could tell but eyeing the miserable frostnipped faminestruck figure of his companion he perceived the absurdity of his suspicion  but iyou knowi dont belong to any circle i  he dared not say any more neither dared he mend his pace the other raising and setting down his lamentably shod feet with exact deliberation protested in a low tone that it was not necessary for everybody to belong to an organization the most valuable personalities remained outside some of the best work was done outside the organization then very fast with whispering feverish lips  the man arrested in the street was haldin  and accepting razumovs dismayed silence as natural enough he assured him that there was no mistake that government clerk was on night duty at the secretariat hearing a great noise of footsteps in the hall and aware that political prisoners were brought over sometimes at night from the fortress he opened the door of the room in which he was working suddenly before the gendarme on duty could push him back and slam the door in his face he had seen a prisoner being partly carried partly dragged along the hall by a lot of policemen he was being used very brutally and the clerk had recognized haldin perfectly less than half an hour afterwards general t arrived at the secretariat to examine that prisoner personally  arent you astonished concluded the gaunt student  no said razumov roughlyand at once regretted his answer  everybody supposed haldin was in the provinceswith his people didnt you  the student turned his big hollow eyes upon razumov who said unguardedly  his people are abroad  he could have bitten his tongue out with vexation the student pronounced in a tone of profound meaning  so you alone were aware and stopped  they have sworn my ruin thought razumov have you spoken of this to anyone else he asked with bitter curiosity  the other shook his head  no only to you our circle thought that as haldin had been often heard expressing a warm appreciation of your character  razumov could not restrain a gesture of angry despair which the other must have misunderstood in some way because he ceased speaking and turned away his black lacklustre eyes  they moved side by side in silence then the gaunt student began to whisper again with averted gaze  as we have at present no one affiliated inside the fortress so as to make it possible to furnish him with a packet of poison we have considered already some sort of retaliatory actionto follow very soon  razumov trudging on interrupted  were you acquainted with haldin did he know where you live  i had the happiness to hear him speak twice his companion answered in the feverish whisper contrasting with the gloomy apathy of his face and bearing he did not know where i live i am lodging poorly with an artisan family i have just a corner in a room it is not very practicable to see me there but if you should need me for anything i am ready  razumov trembled with rage and fear he was beside himself but kept his voice low  you are not to come near me you are not to speak to me never address a single word to me i forbid you  very well said the other submissively showing no surprise whatever at this abrupt prohibition you dont wish for secret reasons perfectly i understand  he edged away at once not looking up even and razumov saw his gaunt shabby faminestricken figure cross the street obliquely with lowered head and that peculiar exact motion of the feet  he watched him as one would watch a vision out of a nightmare then he continued on his way trying not to think on his landing the landlady seemed to be waiting for him she was a short thick shapeless woman with a large yellow face wrapped up everlastingly in a black woollen shawl when she saw him come up the last flight of stairs she flung both her arms up excitedly then clasped her hands before her face  kirylo sidorovitchlittle fatherwhat have you been doing and such a quiet young man too the police are just gone this moment after searching your rooms  razumov gazed down at her with silent scrutinizing attention her puffy yellow countenance was working with emotion she screwed up her eyes at him entreatingly  such a sensible young man anybody can see you are sensible and nowlike thisall at once what is the good of mixing yourself up with these nihilists do give over little father they are unlucky people  razumov moved his shoulders slightly  or is it that some secret enemy has been calumniating you kirylo sidorovitch the world is full of black hearts and false denunciations nowadays there is much fear about  have you heard that i have been denounced by some one asked razumov without taking his eyes off her quivering face  but she had not heard anything she had tried to find out by asking the police captain while his men were turning the room upside down the police captain of the district had known her for the last eleven years and was a humane person but he said to her on the landing looking very black and vexed  my good woman do not ask questions i dont know anything myself the order comes from higher quarters  and indeed there had appeared shortly after the arrival of the policemen of the district a very superior gentleman in a fur coat and a shiny hat who sat down in the room and looked through all the papers himself he came alone and went away by himself taking nothing with him she had been trying to put things straight a little since they left  razumov turned away brusquely and entered his rooms  all his books had been shaken and thrown on the floor his landlady followed him and stooping painfully began to pick them up into her apron his papers and notes which were kept always neatly sorted they all related to his studies had been shuffled up and heaped together into a ragged pile in the middle of the table  this disorder affected him profoundly unreasonably he sat down and stared he had a distinct sensation of his very existence being undermined in some mysterious manner of his moral supports falling away from him one by one he even experienced a slight physical giddiness and made a movement as if to reach for something to steady himself with  the old woman rising to her feet with a low groan shot all the books she had collected in her apron on to the sofa and left the room muttering and sighing  it was only then that he noticed that the sheet of paper which for one night had remained stabbed to the wall above his empty bed was lying on top of the pile  when he had taken it down the day before he had folded it in four absentmindedly before dropping it on the table and now he saw it lying uppermost spread out smoothed out even and covering all the confused pile of pages the record of his intellectual life for the last three years it had not been flung there it had been placed theresmoothed out too he guessed in that an intention of profound meaningor perhaps some inexplicable mockery  he sat staring at the piece of paper till his eyes began to smart he did not attempt to put his papers in order either that evening or the next daywhich he spent at home in a state of peculiar irresolution this irresolution bore upon the question whether he should continue to liveneither more nor less but its nature was very far removed from the hesitation of a man contemplating suicide the idea of laying violent hands upon his body did not occur to razumov the unrelated organism bearing that label walking breathing wearing these clothes was of no importance to anyone unless maybe to the landlady the true razumov had his being in the willed in the determined futurein that future menaced by the lawlessness of autocracyfor autocracy knows no lawand the lawlessness of revolution the feeling that his moral personality was at the mercy of these lawless forces was so strong that he asked himself seriously if it were worth while to go on accomplishing the mental functions of that existence which seemed no longer his own  what is the good of exerting my intelligence of pursuing the systematic development of my faculties and all my plans of work he asked himself i want to guide my conduct by reasonable convictions but what security have i against somethingsome destructive horrorwalking in upon me as i sit here  razumov looked apprehensively towards the door of the outer room as if expecting some shape of evil to turn the handle and appear before him silently  a common thief he said to himself finds more guarantees in the law he is breaking and even a brute like ziemianitch has his consolation razumov envied the materialism of the thief and the passion of the incorrigible lover the consequences of their actions were always clear and their lives remained their own  but he slept as soundly that night as though he had been consoling himself in the manner of ziemianitch he dropped off suddenly lay like a log remembered no dream on waking but it was as if his soul had gone out in the night to gather the flowers of wrathful wisdom he got up in a mood of grim determination and as if with a new knowledge of his own nature he looked mockingly on the heap of papers on his table and left his room to attend the lectures muttering to himself we shall see  he was in no humour to talk to anybody or hear himself questioned as to his absence from lectures the day before but it was difficult to repulse rudely a very good comrade with a smooth pink face and fair hair bearing the nickname amongst his fellowstudents of madcap kostia he was the idolized only son of a very wealthy and illiterate government contractor and attended the lectures only during the periodical fits of contrition following upon tearful paternal remonstrances noisily blundering like a retriever puppy his elated voice and great gestures filled the bare academy corridors with the joy of thoughtless animal life provoking indulgent smiles at a great distance his usual discourses treated of trotting horses wineparties in expensive restaurants and the merits of persons of easy virtue with a disarming artlessness of outlook he pounced upon razumov about midday somewhat less uproariously than his habit was and led him aside  just a moment kirylo sidorovitch a few words here in this quiet corner  he felt razumovs reluctance and insinuated his hand under his arm caressingly  nopray do i dont want to talk to you about any of my silly scrapes what are my scrapes absolutely nothing mere childishness the other night i flung a fellow out of a certain place where i was having a fairly good time a tyrannical little beast of a quilldriver from the treasury department he was bullying the people of the house i rebuked him you are not behaving humanely to gods creatures that are a jolly sight more estimable than yourself i said i cant bear to see any tyranny kirylo sidorovitch upon my word i cant he didnt take it in good part at all whos that impudent puppy he begins to shout i was in excellent form as it happened and he went through the closed window very suddenly he flew quite a long way into the yard i raged likelike aminotaur the women clung to me and screamed the fiddlers got under the table such fun my dad had to put his hand pretty deep into his pocket i can tell you he chuckled  my dad is a very useful man jolly good thing it is for me too i do get into unholy scrapes  his elation fell that was just it what was his life insignificant no good to anyone a mere festivity it would end some fine day in his getting his skull split with a champagne bottle in a drunken brawl at such times too when men were sacrificing themselves to ideas but he could never get any ideas into his head his head wasnt worth anything better than to be split by a champagne bottle  razumov protesting that he had no time made an attempt to get away the others tone changed to confidential earnestness  for gods sake kirylo my dear soul let me make some sort of sacrifice it would not be a sacrifice really i have my rich dad behind me theres positively no getting to the bottom of his pocket  and rejecting indignantly razumovs suggestion that this was drunken raving he offered to lend him some money to escape abroad with he could always get money from his dad he had only to say that he had lost it at cards or something of that sort and at the same time promise solemnly not to miss a single lecture for three months on end that would fetch the old man and he kostia was quite equal to the sacrifice though he really did not see what was the good for him to attend the lectures it was perfectly hopeless  wont you let me be of some use he pleaded to the silent razumov who with his eyes on the ground and utterly unable to penetrate the real drift of the others intention felt a strange reluctance to clear up the point  what makes you think i want to go abroad he asked at last very quietly  kostia lowered his voice  you had the police in your rooms yesterday there are three or four of us who have heard of that never mind how we know it is sufficient that we do so we have been consulting together  ah you got to know that so soon muttered razumov negligently  yes we did and it struck us that a man like you  what sort of a man do you take me to be razumov interrupted him  a man of ideasand a man of action too but you are very deep kirylo theres no getting to the bottom of your mind not for fellows like me but we all agreed that you must be preserved for our country of that we have no doubt whateveri mean all of us who have heard haldin speak of you on certain occasions a man doesnt get the police ransacking his rooms without there being some devilry hanging over his head and so if you think that it would be better for you to bolt at once  razumov tore himself away and walked down the corridor leaving the other motionless with his mouth open but almost at once he returned and stood before the amazed kostia who shut his mouth slowly razumov looked him straight in the eyes before saying with marked deliberation and separating his words  i thankyouverymuch  he went away again rapidly kostia recovering from his surprise at these manoeuvres ran up behind him pressingly  no wait listen i really mean it it would be like giving your compassion to a starving fellow do you hear kirylo and any disguise you may think of that too i could procure from a costumier a jew i know let a fool be made serviceable according to his folly perhaps also a false beard or something of that kind may be needed  razumov turned at bay  there are no false beards needed in this business kostiayou goodhearted lunatic you what do you know of my ideas my ideas may be poison to you the other began to shake his head in energetic protest  what have you got to do with ideas some of them would make an end of your dads moneybags leave off meddling with what you dont understand go back to your trotting horses and your girls and then youll be sure at least of doing no harm to anybody and hardly any to yourself  the enthusiastic youth was overcome by this disdain  youre sending me back to my pigs trough kirylo that settles it i am an unlucky beastand i shall die like a beast too but mindits your contempt that has done for me  razumov went off with long strides that this simple and grossly festive soul should have fallen too under the revolutionary curse affected him as an ominous symptom of the time he reproached himself for feeling troubled personally he ought to have felt reassured there was an obvious advantage in this conspiracy of mistaken judgment taking him for what he was not but was it not strange  again he experienced that sensation of his conduct being taken out of his hands by haldins revolutionary tyranny his solitary and laborious existence had been destroyedthe only thing he could call his own on this earth by what right he asked himself furiously in what name  what infuriated him most was to feel that the thinkers of the university were evidently connecting him with haldinas a sort of confidant in the background apparently a mysterious connexion ha ha he had been made a personage without knowing anything about it how that wretch haldin must have talked about him yet it was likely that haldin had said very little the fellows casual utterances were caught up and treasured and pondered over by all these imbeciles and was not all secret revolutionary action based upon folly selfdeception and lies  impossible to think of anything else muttered razumov to himself ill become an idiot if this goes on the scoundrels and the fools are murdering my intelligence  he lost all hope of saving his future which depended on the free use of his intelligence  he reached the doorway of his house in a state of mental discouragement which enabled him to receive with apparent indifference an officiallooking envelope from the dirty hand of the dvornik  a gendarme brought it said the man he asked if you were at home i told him no hes not at home so he left it give it into his own hands says he now youve got iteh  he went back to his sweeping and razumov climbed his stairs envelope in hand once in his room he did not hasten to open it of course this official missive was from the superior direction of the police a suspect a suspect  he stared in dreary astonishment at the absurdity of his position he thought with a sort of dry unemotional melancholy three years of good work gone the course of forty more perhaps jeopardizedturned from hope to terror because events started by human folly link themselves into a sequence which no sagacity can foresee and no courage can break through fatality enters your rooms while your landladys back is turned you come home and find it in possession bearing a mans name clothed in fleshwearing a brown cloth coat and long bootslounging against the stove it asks you is the outer door closedand you dont know enough to take it by the throat and fling it downstairs you dont know you welcome the crazy fate sit down you say and it is all over you cannot shake it off any more it will cling to you for ever neither halter nor bullet can give you back the freedom of your life and the sanity of your thought it was enough to dash ones head against a wall  razumov looked slowly all round the walls as if to select a spot to dash his head against then he opened the letter it directed the student kirylo sidorovitch razumov to present himself without delay at the general secretariat  razumov had a vision of general ts goggle eyes waiting for himthe embodied power of autocracy grotesque and terrible he embodied the whole power of autocracy because he was its guardian he was the incarnate suspicion the incarnate anger the incarnate ruthlessness of a political and social regime on its defence he loathed rebellion by instinct and razumov reflected that the man was simply unable to understand a reasonable adherence to the doctrine of absolutism  what can he want with me preciselyi wonder he asked himself  as if that mental question had evoked the familiar phantom haldin stood suddenly before him in the room with an extraordinary completeness of detail though the short winter day had passed already into the sinister twilight of a land buried in snow razumov saw plainly the narrow leather strap round the tcherkess coat the illusion of that hateful presence was so perfect that he half expected it to ask is the outer door closed he looked at it with hatred and contempt souls do not take a shape of clothing moreover haldin could not be dead yet razumov stepped forward menacingly the vision vanishedand turning short on his heel he walked out of his room with infinite disdain  but after going down the first flight of stairs it occurred to him that perhaps the superior authorities of police meant to confront him with haldin in the flesh this thought struck him like a bullet and had he not clung with both hands to the banister he would have rolled down to the next landing most likely his legs were of no use for a considerable time but why for what conceivable reason to what end  there could be no rational answer to these questions but razumov remembered the promise made by the general to prince k his action was to remain unknown  he got down to the bottom of the stairs lowering himself as it were from step to step by the banister under the gate he regained much of his firmness of thought and limb he went out into the street without staggering visibly every moment he felt steadier mentally and yet he was saying to himself that general t was perfectly capable of shutting him up in the fortress for an indefinite time his temperament fitted his remorseless task and his omnipotence made him inaccessible to reasonable argument  but when razumov arrived at the secretariat he discovered that he would have nothing to do with general t it is evident from mr razumovs diary that this dreaded personality was to remain in the background a civilian of superior rank received him in a private room after a period of waiting in outer offices where a lot of scribbling went on at many tables in a heated and stuffy atmosphere  the clerk in uniform who conducted him said in the corridor  you are going before gregor matvieitch mikulin  there was nothing formidable about the man bearing that name his mild expectant glance was turned on the door already when razumov entered at once with the penholder he was holding in his hand he pointed to a deep sofa between two windows he followed razumov with his eyes while that last crossed the room and sat down the mild gaze rested on him not curious not inquisitivecertainly not suspiciousalmost without expression in its passionless persistence there was something resembling sympathy  razumov who had prepared his will and his intelligence to encounter general t himself was profoundly troubled all the moral bracing up against the possible excesses of power and passion went for nothing before this sallow man who wore a full unclipped beard it was fair thin and very fine the light fell in coppery gleams on the protuberances of a high rugged forehead and the aspect of the broad soft physiognomy was so homely and rustic that the careful middle parting of the hair seemed a pretentious affectation  the diary of mr razumov testifies to some irritation on his part i may remark here that the diary proper consisting of the more or less daily entries seems to have been begun on that very evening after mr razumov had returned home  mr razumov then was irritated his strungup individuality had gone to pieces within him very suddenly  i must be very prudent with him he warned himself in the silence during which they sat gazing at each other it lasted some little time and was characterized for silences have their character by a sort of sadness imparted to it perhaps by the mild and thoughtful manner of the bearded official razumov learned later that he was the chief of a department in the general secretariat with a rank in the civil service equivalent to that of a colonel in the army  razumovs mistrust became acute the main point was not to be drawn into saying too much he had been called there for some reason what reason to be given to understand that he was a suspectand also no doubt to be pumped as to what precisely there was nothing or perhaps haldin had been telling lies every alarming uncertainty beset razumov he could bear the silence no longer and cursing himself for his weakness spoke first though he had promised himself not to do so on any account  i havent lost a moments time he began in a hoarse provoking tone and then the faculty of speech seemed to leave him and enter the body of councillor mikulin who chimed in approvingly  very proper very proper though as a matter of fact  but the spell was broken and razumov interrupted him boldly under a sudden conviction that this was the safest attitude to take with a great flow of words he complained of being totally misunderstood even as he talked with a perception of his own audacity he thought that the word misunderstood was better than the word mistrusted and he repeated it again with insistence suddenly he ceased being seized with fright before the attentive immobility of the official what am i talking about he thought eyeing him with a vague gaze mistrustednot misunderstoodwas the right symbol for these people misunderstood was the other kind of curse both had been brought on his head by that fellow haldin and his head ached terribly he passed his hand over his browan involuntary gesture of suffering which he was too careless to restrain at that moment razumov beheld his own brain suffering on the racka long pale figure drawn asunder horizontally with terrific force in the darkness of a vault whose face he failed to see it was as though he had dreamed for an infinitesimal fraction of time of some dark print of the inquisition  it is not to be seriously supposed that razumov had actually dozed off and had dreamed in the presence of councillor mikulin of an old print of the inquisition he was indeed extremely exhausted and he records a remarkably dreamlike experience of anguish at the circumstance that there was no one whatever near the pale and extended figure the solitude of the racked victim was particularly horrible to behold the mysterious impossibility to see the face he also notes inspired a sort of terror all these characteristics of an ugly dream were present yet he is certain that he never lost the consciousness of himself on the sofa leaning forward with his hands between his knees and turning his cap round and round in his fingers but everything vanished at the voice of councillor mikulin razumov felt profoundly grateful for the even simplicity of its tone  yes i have listened with interest i comprehend in a measure your but indeed you are mistaken in what you councillor mikulin uttered a series of broken sentences instead of finishing them he glanced down his beard it was a deliberate curtailment which somehow made the phrases more impressive but he could talk fluently enough as became apparent when changing his tone to persuasiveness he went on by listening to you as i did i think i have proved that i do not regard our intercourse as strictly official in fact i dont want it to have that character at all oh yes i admit that the request for your presence here had an official form but i put it to you whether it was a form which would have been used to secure the attendance of a  suspect exclaimed razumov looking straight into the officials eyes they were big with heavy eyelids and met his boldness with a dim steadfast gaze a suspect the open repetition of that word which had been haunting all his waking hours gave razumov a strange sort of satisfaction councillor mikulin shook his head slightly surely you do know that ive had my rooms searched by the police  i was about to say a misunderstood person when you interrupted me insinuated quietly councillor mikulin  razumov smiled without bitterness the renewed sense of his intellectual superiority sustained him in the hour of danger he said a little disdainfully  i know i am but a reed but i beg you to allow me the superiority of the thinking reed over the unthinking forces that are about to crush him out of existence practical thinking in the last instance is but criticism i may perhaps be allowed to express my wonder at this action of the police being delayed for two full days during which of course i could have annihilated everything compromising by burning itlet us sayand getting rid of the very ashes for that matter  you are angry remarked the official with an unutterable simplicity of tone and manner is that reasonable  razumov felt himself colouring with annoyance  i am reasonable i am evenpermit me to saya thinker though to be sure this name nowadays seems to be the monopoly of hawkers of revolutionary wares the slaves of some french or german thoughtdevil knows what foreign notions but i am not an intellectual mongrel i think like a russian i think faithfullyand i take the liberty to call myself a thinker it is not a forbidden word as far as i know  no why should it be a forbidden word councillor mikulin turned in his seat with crossed legs and resting his elbow on the table propped his head on the knuckles of a halfclosed hand razumov noticed a thick forefinger clasped by a massive gold band set with a bloodred stonea signet ring that looking as if it could weigh half a pound was an appropriate ornament for that ponderous man with the accurate middleparting of glossy hair above a rugged socratic forehead  could it be a wig razumov detected himself wondering with an unexpected detachment his selfconfidence was much shaken he resolved to chatter no more reserve reserve all he had to do was to keep the ziemianitch episode secret with absolute determination when the questions came keep ziemianitch strictly out of all the answers  councillor mikulin looked at him dimly razumovs selfconfidence abandoned him completely it seemed impossible to keep ziemianitch out every question would lead to that because of course there was nothing else he made an effort to brace himself up it was a failure but councillor mikulin was surprisingly detached too  why should it be forbidden he repeated i too consider myself a thinking man i assure you the principal condition is to think correctly i admit it is difficult sometimes at first for a young man abandoned to himselfwith his generous impulses undisciplined so to speakat the mercy of every wild wind that blows religious belief of course is a great  councillor mikulin glanced down his beard and razumov whose tension was relaxed by that unexpected and discursive turn murmured with gloomy discontent  that man haldin believed in god  ah you are aware breathed out councillor mikulin making the point softly as if with discretion but making it nevertheless plainly enough as if he too were put off his guard by razumovs remark the young man preserved an impassive moody countenance though he reproached himself bitterly for a pernicious fool to have given thus an utterly false impression of intimacy he kept his eyes on the floor i must positively hold my tongue unless i am obliged to speak he admonished himself and at once against his will the question hadnt i better tell him everything presented itself with such force that he had to bite his lower lip councillor mikulin could not however have nourished any hope of confession he went on  you tell me more than his judges were able to get out of him he was judged by a commission of three he would tell them absolutely nothing i have the report of the interrogatories here by me after every question there stands refuses to answerrefuses to answer its like that page after page you see i have been entrusted with some further investigations around and about this affair he has left me nothing to begin my investigations on a hardened miscreant and so you say he believed in  again councillor mikulin glanced down his beard with a faint grimace but he did not pause for long remarking with a shade of scorn that blasphemers also had that sort of belief he concluded by supposing that mr razumov had conversed frequently with haldin on the subject  no said razumov loudly without looking up he talked and i listened that is not a conversation  listening is a great art observed mikulin parenthetically  and getting people to talk is another mumbled razumov  well nothat is not very difficult mikulin said innocently except of course in special cases for instance this haldin nothing could induce him to talk he was brought four times before the delegated judges four secret interrogatoriesand even during the last when your personality was put forward  my personality put forward repeated razumov raising his head brusquely i dont understand councillor mikulin turned squarely to the table and taking up some sheets of grey foolscap dropped them one after another retaining only the last in his hand he held it before his eyes while speaking  it wasyou seejudged necessary in a case of that gravity no means of action upon the culprit should be neglected you understand that yourself i am certain  razumov stared with enormous wide eyes at the side view of councillor mikulin who now was not looking at him at all  so it was decided i was consulted by general t that a certain question should be put to the accused but in deference to the earnest wishes of prince k your name has been kept out of the documents and even from the very knowledge of the judges themselves prince k recognized the propriety the necessity of what we proposed to do but he was concerned for your safety things do leak outthat we cant deny one cannot always answer for the discretion of inferior officials there was of course the secretary of the special tribunalone or two gendarmes in the room moreover as i have said in deference to prince k even the judges themselves were to be left in ignorance the question ready framed was sent to them by general t i wrote it out with my own hand with instructions to put it to the prisoner the very last of all here it is  councillor mikulin threw back his head into proper focus and went on reading monotonously questionhas the man well known to you in whose rooms you remained for several hours on monday and on whose information you have been arrestedhas he had any previous knowledge of your intention to commit a political murder prisoner refuses to reply  question repeated prisoner preserves the same stubborn silence  the venerable chaplain of the fortress being then admitted and exhorting the prisoner to repentance entreating him also to atone for his crime by an unreserved and full confession which should help to liberate from the sin of rebellion against the divine laws and the sacred majesty of the ruler our christloving landthe prisoner opens his lips for the first time during this mornings audience and in a loud clear voice rejects the venerable chaplains ministrations  at eleven oclock the court pronounces in summary form the death sentence  the execution is fixed for four oclock in the afternoon subject to further instructions from superior authorities  councillor mikulin dropped the page of foolscap glanced down his beard and turning to razumov added in an easy explanatory tone  we saw no object in delaying the execution the order to carry out the sentence was sent by telegraph at noon i wrote out the telegram myself he was hanged at four oclock this afternoon  the definite information of haldins death gave razumov the feeling of general lassitude which follows a great exertion or a great excitement he kept very still on the sofa but a murmur escaped him  he had a belief in a future existence  councillor mikulin shrugged his shoulders slightly and razumov got up with an effort there was nothing now to stay for in that room haldin had been hanged at four oclock there could be no doubt of that he had it seemed entered upon his future existence long boots astrakhan fur cap and all down to the very leather strap round his waist a flickering vanishing sort of existence it was not his soul it was his mere phantom he had left behind on this earththought razumov smiling caustically to himself while he crossed the room utterly forgetful of where he was and of councillor mikulins existence the official could have set a lot of bells ringing all over the building without leaving his chair he let razumov go quite up to the door before he spoke  come kirylo sidorovitchwhat are you doing  razumov turned his head and looked at him in silence he was not in the least disconcerted councillor mikulins arms were stretched out on the table before him and his body leaned forward a little with an effort of his dim gaze  was i actually going to clear out like this razumov wondered at himself with an impassive countenance and he was aware of this impassiveness concealing a lucid astonishment  evidently i was going out if he had not spoken he thought what would he have done then i must end this affair one way or another i must make him show his hand  for a moment longer he reflected behind the mask as it were then let go the doorhandle and came back to the middle of the room  ill tell you what you think he said explosively but not raising his voice you think that you are dealing with a secret accomplice of that unhappy man no i do not know that he was unhappy he did not tell me he was a wretch from my point of view because to keep alive a false idea is a greater crime than to kill a man i suppose you will not deny that i hated him visionaries work everlasting evil on earth their utopias inspire in the mass of mediocre minds a disgust of reality and a contempt for the secular logic of human development  razumov shrugged his shoulders and stared what a tirade he thought the silence and immobility of councillor mikulin impressed him the bearded bureaucrat sat at his post mysteriously selfpossessed like an idol with dim unreadable eyes razumovs voice changed involuntarily  if you were to ask me where is the necessity of my hate for such as haldin i would answer youthere is nothing sentimental in it i did not hate him because he had committed the crime of murder abhorrence is not hate i hated him simply because i am sane it is in that character that he outraged me his death  razumov felt his voice growing thick in his throat the dimness of councillor mikulins eyes seemed to spread all over his face and made it indistinct to razumovs sight he tried to disregard these phenomena  indeed he pursued pronouncing each word carefully what is his death to me if he were lying here on the floor i could walk over his breast the fellow is a mere phantom  razumovs voice died out very much against his will mikulin behind the table did not allow himself the slightest movement the silence lasted for some little time before razumov could go on again  he went about talking of me those intellectual fellows sit in each others rooms and get drunk on foreign ideas in the same way young guards officers treat each other with foreign wines merest debauchery upon my wordrazumov enraged by a sudden recollection of ziemianitch lowered his voice forciblyupon my word we russians are a drunken lot intoxication of some sort we must have to get ourselves wild with sorrow or maudlin with resignation to lie inert like a log or set fire to the house what is a sober man to do i should like to know to cut oneself entirely from ones kind is impossible to live in a desert one must be a saint but if a drunken man runs out of the grogshop falls on your neck and kisses you on both cheeks because something about your appearance has taken his fancy what thenkindly tell me you may break perhaps a cudgel on his back and yet not succeed in beating him off  councillor mikulin raised his hand and passed it down his face deliberately  thats of course he said in an undertone  the quiet gravity of that gesture made razumov pause it was so unexpected too what did it mean it had an alarming aloofness razumov remembered his intention of making him show his hand  i have said all this to prince k he began with assumed indifference but lost it on seeing councillor mikulins slow nod of assent you know it youve heard then why should i be called here to be told of haldins execution did you want to confront me with his silence now that the man is dead what is his silence to me this is incomprehensible you want in some way to shake my moral balance  no not that murmured councillor mikulin just audibly the service you have rendered is appreciated  is it interrupted razumov ironically  and your position too councillor mikulin did not raise his voice but only think you fall into prince ks study as if from the sky with your startling information you are studying yet mr razumov but we are serving alreadydont forget that and naturally some curiosity was bound to  councillor mikulin looked down his beard razumovs lips trembled  an occurrence of that sort marks a man the homely murmur went on i admit i was curious to see you general t thought it would be useful too dont think i am incapable of understanding your sentiments when i was young like you i studied  yesyou wished to see me said razumov in a tone of profound distaste naturally you have the righti mean the power it all amounts to the same thing but it is perfectly useless if you were to look at me and listen to me for a year i begin to think there is something about me which people dont seem able to make out its unfortunate i imagine however that prince k understands he seemed to  councillor mikulin moved slightly and spoke  prince k is aware of everything that is being done and i dont mind informing you that he approved my intention of becoming personally acquainted with you  razumov concealed an immense disappointment under the accents of railing surprise  so he is curious too wellafter all prince k knows me very little it is really very unfortunate for me butit is not exactly my fault  councillor mikulin raised a hasty deprecatory hand and inclined his head slightly over his shoulder  now mr razumovis it necessary to take it in that way everybody i am sure can  he glanced rapidly down his beard and when he looked up again there was for a moment an interested expression in his misty gaze razumov discouraged it with a cold repellent smile  no thats of no importance to be sureexcept that in respect of all this curiosity being aroused by a very simple matter what is to be done with it it is unappeasable i mean to say there is nothing to appease it with i happen to have been born a russian with patriotic instinctswhether inherited or not i am not in a position to say  razumov spoke consciously with elaborate steadiness  yes patriotic instincts developed by a faculty of independent thinkingof detached thinking in that respect i am more free than any social democratic revolution could make me it is more than probable that i dont think exactly as you are thinking indeed how could it be you would think most likely at this moment that i am elaborately lying to cover up the track of my repentance  razumov stopped his heart had grown too big for his breast councillor mikulin did not flinch  why so he said simply i assisted personally at the search of your rooms i looked through all the papers myself i have been greatly impressed by a sort of political confession of faith a very remarkable document now may i ask for what purpose  to deceive the police naturally said razumov savagely what is all this mockery of course you can send me straight from this room to siberia that would be intelligible to what is intelligible i can submit but i protest against this comedy of persecution the whole affair is becoming too comical altogether for my taste a comedy of errors phantoms and suspicions its positively indecent  councillor mikulin turned an attentive ear did you say phantoms he murmured  i could walk over dozens of them razumov with an impatient wave of his hand went on headlong but really i must claim the right to be done once for all with that man and in order to accomplish this i shall take the liberty  razumov on his side of the table bowed slightly to the seated bureaucrat   to retiresimply to retire he finished with great resolution  he walked to the door thinking now he must show his hand he must ring and have me arrested before i am out of the building or he must let me go and either way  an unhurried voice said  kirylo sidorovitch razumov at the door turned his head  to retire he repeated  where to asked councillor mikulin softly    part second    i   in the conduct of an invented story there are no doubt certain proprieties to be observed for the sake of clearness and effect a man of imagination however inexperienced in the art of narrative has his instinct to guide him in the choice of his words and in the development of the action a grain of talent excuses many mistakes but this is not a work of imagination i have no talent my excuse for this undertaking lies not in its art but in its artlessness aware of my limitations and strong in the sincerity of my purpose i would not try were i able to invent anything i push my scruples so far that i would not even invent a transition  dropping then mr razumovs record at the point where councillor mikulins question where to comes in with the force of an insoluble problem i shall simply say that i made the acquaintance of these ladies about six months before that time by these ladies i mean of course the mother and the sister of the unfortunate haldin  by what arguments he had induced his mother to sell their little property and go abroad for an indefinite time i cannot tell precisely i have an idea that mrs haldin at her sons wish would have set fire to her house and emigrated to the moon without any sign of surprise or apprehension and that miss haldinnathalie caressingly natalkawould have given her assent to the scheme  their proud devotion to that young man became clear to me in a very short time following his directions they went straight to switzerlandto zurichwhere they remained the best part of a year from zurich which they did not like they came to geneva a friend of mine in lausanne a lecturer in history at the university he had married a russian lady a distant connection of mrs haldins wrote to me suggesting i should call on these ladies it was a very kindly meant business suggestion miss haldin wished to go through a course of reading the best english authors with a competent teacher  mrs haldin received me very kindly her bad french of which she was smilingly conscious did away with the formality of the first interview she was a tall woman in a black silk dress a wide brow regular features and delicately cut lips testified to her past beauty she sat upright in an easy chair and in a rather weak gentle voice told me that her natalka simply thirsted after knowledge her thin hands were lying on her lap her facial immobility had in it something monachal in russia she went on all knowledge was tainted with falsehood not chemistry and all that but education generally she explained the government corrupted the teaching for its own purposes both her children felt that her natalka had obtained a diploma of a superior school for women and her son was a student at the st petersburg university he had a brilliant intellect a most noble unselfish nature and he was the oracle of his comrades early next year she hoped he would join them and they would then go to italy together in any other country but their own she would have been certain of a great future for a man with the extraordinary abilities and the lofty character of her sonbut in russia  the young lady sitting by the window turned her head and said  come mother even with us things change with years  her voice was deep almost harsh and yet caressing in its harshness she had a dark complexion with red lips and a full figure she gave the impression of strong vitality the old lady sighed  you are both youngyou two it is easy for you to hope but i too am not hopeless indeed how could i be with a son like this  i addressed miss haldin asking her what authors she wished to read she directed upon me her grey eyes shaded by black eyelashes and i became aware notwithstanding my years how attractive physically her personality could be to a man capable of appreciating in a woman something else than the mere grace of femininity her glance was as direct and trustful as that of a young man yet unspoiled by the worlds wise lessons and it was intrepid but in this intrepidity there was nothing aggressive a naive yet thoughtful assurance is a better definition she had reflected already in russia the young begin to think early but she had never known deception as yet because obviously she had never yet fallen under the sway of passion she wasto look at her was enoughvery capable of being roused by an idea or simply by a person at least so i judged with i believe an unbiassed mind for clearly my person could not be the personand as to my ideas  we became excellent friends in the course of our reading it was very pleasant without fear of provoking a smile i shall confess that i became very much attached to that young girl at the end of four months i told her that now she could very well go on reading english by herself it was time for the teacher to depart my pupil looked unpleasantly surprised  mrs haldin with her immobility of feature and kindly expression of the eyes uttered from her armchair in her uncertain french mais lami reviendra and so it was settled i returnednot four times a week as before but pretty frequently in the autumn we made some short excursions together in company with other russians my friendship with these ladies gave me a standing in the russian colony which otherwise i could not have had  the day i saw in the papers the news of mr de ps assassinationit was a sundayi met the two ladies in the street and walked with them for some distance mrs haldin wore a heavy grey cloak i remember over her black silk dress and her fine eyes met mine with a very quiet expression  we have been to the late service she said natalka came with me her girlfriends the students here of course dont with us in russia the church is so identified with oppression that it seems almost necessary when one wishes to be free in this life to give up all hope of a future existence but i cannot give up praying for my son  she added with a sort of stony grimness colouring slightly and in french ce nest peut etre quune habitude it may be only habit  miss haldin was carrying the prayerbook she did not glance at her mother  you and victor are both profound believers she said  i communicated to them the news from their country which i had just read in a cafe for a whole minute we walked together fairly briskly in silence then mrs haldin murmured  there will be more trouble more persecutions for this they may be even closing the university there is neither peace nor rest in russia for one but in the grave  yes the way is hard came from the daughter looking straight before her at the chain of jura covered with snow like a white wall closing the end of the street but concord is not so very far off  that is what my children think observed mrs haldin to me  i did not conceal my feeling that these were strange times to talk of concord nathalie haldin surprised me by saying as if she had thought very much on the subject that the occidentals did not understand the situation she was very calm and youthfully superior  you think it is a class conflict or a conflict of interests as social contests are with you in europe but it is not that at all it is something quite different  it is quite possible that i dont understand i admitted  that propensity of lifting every problem from the plane of the understandable by means of some sort of mystic expression is very russian i knew her well enough to have discovered her scorn for all the practical forms of political liberty known to the western world i suppose one must be a russian to understand russian simplicity a terrible corroding simplicity in which mystic phrases clothe a naive and hopeless cynicism i think sometimes that the psychological secret of the profound difference of that people consists in this that they detest life the irremediable life of the earth as it is whereas we westerners cherish it with perhaps an equal exaggeration of its sentimental value but this is a digression indeed  i helped these ladies into the tramcar and they asked me to call in the afternoon at least mrs haldin asked me as she climbed up and her natalka smiled down at the dense westerner indulgently from the rear platform of the moving car the light of the clear wintry forenoon was softened in her grey eyes  mr razumovs record like the open book of fate revives for me the memory of that day as something startlingly pitiless in its freedom from all forebodings victor haldin was still with the living but with the living whose only contact with life is the expectation of death he must have been already referring to the last of his earthly affections the hours of that obstinate silence which for him was to be prolonged into eternity that afternoon the ladies entertained a good many of their compatriotsmore than was usual for them to receive at one time and the drawingroom on the ground floor of a large house on the boulevard des philosophes was very much crowded  i outstayed everybody and when i rose miss haldin stood up too i took her hand and was moved to revert to that mornings conversation in the street  admitting that we occidentals do not understand the character of your i began  it was as if she had been prepared for me by some mysterious foreknowledge she checked me gently  their impulsestheir she sought the proper expression and found it but in frenchtheir mouvements dame  her voice was not much above a whisper  very well i said but still we are looking at a conflict you say it is not a conflict of classes and not a conflict of interests suppose i admitted that are antagonistic ideas then to be reconciled more easilycan they be cemented with blood and violence into that concord which you proclaim to be so near  she looked at me searchingly with her clear grey eyes without answering my reasonable questionmy obvious my unanswerable question  it is inconceivable i added with something like annoyance  everything is inconceivable she said the whole world is inconceivable to the strict logic of ideas and yet the world exists to our senses and we exist in it there must be a necessity superior to our conceptions it is a very miserable and a very false thing to belong to the majority we russians shall find some better form of national freedom than an artificial conflict of partieswhich is wrong because it is a conflict and contemptible because it is artificial it is left for us russians to discover a better way  mrs haldin had been looking out of the window she turned upon me the almost lifeless beauty of her face and the living benign glance of her big dark eyes  thats what my children think she declared  i suppose i addressed miss haldin that you will be shocked if i tell you that i havent understoodi wont say a single word ive understood all the words but what can be this era of disembodied concord you are looking forward to life is a thing of form it has its plastic shape and a definite intellectual aspect the most idealistic conceptions of love and forbearance must be clothed in flesh as it were before they can be made understandable  i took my leave of mrs haldin whose beautiful lips never stirred she smiled with her eyes only nathalie haldin went with me as far as the door very amiable  mother imagines that i am the slavish echo of my brother victor it is not so he understands me better than i can understand him when he joins us and you come to know him you will see what an exceptional soul it is she paused he is not a strong man in the conventional sense you know she added but his character is without a flaw  i believe that it will not be difficult for me to make friends with your brother victor  dont expect to understand him quite she said a little maliciously he is not at allat allwestern at bottom  and on this unnecessary warning i left the room with another bow in the doorway to mrs haldin in her armchair by the window the shadow of autocracy all unperceived by me had already fallen upon the boulevard des philosophes in the free independent and democratic city of geneva where there is a quarter called la petite russie whenever two russians come together the shadow of autocracy is with them tinging their thoughts their views their most intimate feelings their private life their public utteranceshaunting the secret of their silences  what struck me next in the course of a week or so was the silence of these ladies i used to meet them walking in the public garden near the university they greeted me with their usual friendliness but i could not help noticing their taciturnity by that time it was generally known that the assassin of m de p had been caught judged and executed so much had been declared officially to the news agencies but for the world at large he remained anonymous the official secrecy had withheld his name from the public i really cannot imagine for what reason  one day i saw miss haldin walking alone in the main valley of the bastions under the naked trees  mother is not very well she explained  as mrs haldin had it seemed never had a days illness in her life this indisposition was disquieting it was nothing definite too  i think she is fretting because we have not heard from my brother for rather a long time  no newsgood news i said cheerfully and we began to walk slowly side by side  not in russia she breathed out so low that i only just caught the words i looked at her with more attention  you too are anxious  she admitted after a moment of hesitation that she was  it is really such a long time since we heard  and before i could offer the usual banal suggestions she confided in me  oh but it is much worse than that i wrote to a family we know in petersburg they had not seen him for more than a month they thought he was already with us they were even offended a little that he should have left petersburg without calling on them the husband of the lady went at once to his lodgings victor had left there and they did not know his address  i remember her catching her breath rather pitifully her brother had not been seen at lectures for a very long time either he only turned up now and then at the university gate to ask the porter for his letters and the gentleman friend was told that the student haldin did not come to claim the last two letters for him but the police came to inquire if the student haldin ever received any correspondence at the university and took them away  my two last letters she said  we faced each other a few snowflakes fluttered under the naked boughs the sky was dark  what do you think could have happened i asked  her shoulders moved slightly  one can never tellin russia  i saw then the shadow of autocracy lying upon russian lives in their submission or their revolt i saw it touch her handsome open face nestled in a fur collar and darken her clear eyes that shone upon me brilliantly grey in the murky light of a beclouded inclement afternoon  let us move on she said it is cold standingtoday  she shuddered a little and stamped her little feet we moved briskly to the end of the alley and back to the great gates of the garden  have you told your mother i ventured to ask  no not yet i came out to walk off the impression of this letter  i heard a rustle of paper somewhere it came from her muff she had the letter with her in there  what is it that you are afraid of i asked  to us europeans of the west all ideas of political plots and conspiracies seem childish crude inventions for the theatre or a novel i did not like to be more definite in my inquiry  for usfor my mother specially what i am afraid of is incertitude people do disappear yes they do disappear i leave you to imagine what it isthe cruelty of the dumb weeksmonthsyears this friend of ours has abandoned his inquiries when he heard of the police getting hold of the letters i suppose he was afraid of compromising himself he has a wife and childrenand why should he after all moreover he is without influential connections and not rich what could he do yes i am afraid of silencefor my poor mother she wont be able to bear it for my brother i am afraid of she became almost indistinct of anything  we were now near the gate opposite the theatre she raised her voice  but lost people do turn up even in russia do you know what my last hope is perhaps the next thing we know we shall see him walking into our rooms  i raised my hat and she passed out of the gardens graceful and strong after a slight movement of the head to me her hands in the muff crumpling the cruel petersburg letter  on returning home i opened the newspaper i receive from london and glancing down the correspondence from russianot the telegrams but the correspondencethe first thing that caught my eye was the name of haldin mr de ps death was no longer an actuality but the enterprising correspondent was proud of having ferreted out some unofficial information about that fact of modern history he had got hold of haldins name and had picked up the story of the midnight arrest in the street but the sensation from a journalistic point of view was already well in the past he did not allot to it more than twenty lines out of a full column it was quite enough to give me a sleepless night i perceived that it would have been a sort of treason to let miss haldin come without preparation upon that journalistic discovery which would infallibly be reproduced on the morrow by french and swiss newspapers i had a very bad time of it till the morning wakeful with nervous worry and nightmarish with the feeling of being mixed up with something theatrical and morbidly affected the incongruity of such a complication in those two womens lives was sensible to me all night in the form of absolute anguish it seemed due to their refined simplicity that it should remain concealed from them for ever arriving at an unconscionably early hour at the door of their apartment i felt as if i were about to commit an act of vandalism  the middleaged servant woman led me into the drawingroom where there was a duster on a chair and a broom leaning against the centre table the motes danced in the sunshine i regretted i had not written a letter instead of coming myself and was thankful for the brightness of the day miss haldin in a plain black dress came lightly out of her mothers room with a fixed uncertain smile on her lips  i pulled the paper out of my pocket i did not imagine that a number of the standard could have the effect of medusas head her face went stony in a momenther eyesher limbs the most terrible thing was that being stony she remained alive one was conscious of her palpitating heart i hope she forgave me the delay of my clumsy circumlocution it was not very prolonged she could not have kept so still from head to foot for more than a second or two and then i heard her draw a breath as if the shock had paralysed her moral resistance and affected the firmness of her muscles the contours of her face seemed to have given way she was frightfully altered she looked agedruined but only for a moment she said with decision  i am going to tell my mother at once  would that be safe in her state i objected  what can be worse than the state she has been in for the last month we understand this in another way the crime is not at his door dont imagine i am defending him before you  she went to the bedroom door then came back to ask me in a low murmur not to go till she returned for twenty interminable minutes not a sound reached me at last miss haldin came out and walked across the room with her quick light step when she reached the armchair she dropped into it heavily as if completely exhausted  mrs haldin she told me had not shed a tear she was sitting up in bed and her immobility her silence were very alarming at last she lay down gently and had motioned her daughter away  she will call me in presently added miss haldin i left a bell near the bed  i confess that my very real sympathy had no standpoint the western readers for whom this story is written will understand what i mean it was if i may say so the want of experience death is a remorseless spoliator the anguish of irreparable loss is familiar to us all there is no life so lonely as to be safe against that experience but the grief i had brought to these two ladies had gruesome associations it had the associations of bombs and gallowsa lurid russian colouring which made the complexion of my sympathy uncertain  i was grateful to miss haldin for not embarrassing me by an outward display of deep feeling i admired her for that wonderful command over herself even while i was a little frightened at it it was the stillness of a great tension what if it should suddenly snap even the door of mrs haldins room with the old mother alone in there had a rather awful aspect  nathalie haldin murmured sadly  i suppose you are wondering what my feelings are  essentially that was true it was that very wonder which unsettled my sympathy of a dense occidental i could get hold of nothing but of some commonplace phrases those futile phrases that give the measure of our impotence before each others trials i mumbled something to the effect that for the young life held its hopes and compensations it held duties toobut of that i was certain it was not necessary to remind her  she had a handkerchief in her hands and pulled at it nervously  i am not likely to forget my mother she said we used to be three now we are twotwo women shes not so very old she may live quite a long time yet what have we to look for in the future for what hope and what consolation  you must take a wider view i said resolutely thinking that with this exceptional creature this was the right note to strike she looked at me steadily for a moment and then the tears she had been keeping down flowed unrestrained she jumped up and stood in the window with her back to me  i slipped away without attempting even to approach her next day i was told at the door that mrs haldin was better the middleaged servant remarked that a lot of peoplerussianshad called that day but miss haldin bad not seen anybody a fortnight later when making my daily call i was asked in and found mrs haldin sitting in her usual place by the window  at first one would have thought that nothing was changed i saw across the room the familiar profile a little sharper in outline and overspread by a uniform pallor as might have been expected in an invalid but no disease could have accounted for the change in her black eyes smiling no longer with gentle irony she raised them as she gave me her hand i observed the three weeks old number of the standard folded with the correspondence from russia uppermost lying on a little table by the side of the armchair mrs haldins voice was startlingly weak and colourless her first words to me framed a question  has there been anything more in papers  i released her long emaciated hand shook my head negatively and sat down  the english press is wonderful nothing can be kept secret from it and all the world must hear only our russian news is not always easy to understand not always easy but english mothers do not look for news like that  she laid her hand on the newspaper and took it away again i said  we too have had tragic times in our history  a long time ago a very long time ago  yes  there are nations that have made their bargain with fate said miss haldin who had approached us we need not envy them  why this scorn i asked gently it may be that our bargain was not a very lofty one but the terms men and nations obtain from fate are hallowed by the price  mrs haldin turned her head away and looked out of the window for a time with that new sombre extinct gaze of her sunken eyes which so completely made another woman of her  that englishman this correspondent she addressed me suddenly do you think it is possible that he knew my son  to this strange question i could only say that it was possible of course she saw my surprise  if one knew what sort of man he was one could perhaps write to him she murmured  mother thinks explained miss haldin standing between us with one hand resting on the back of my chair that my poor brother perhaps did not try to save himself  i looked up at miss haldin in sympathetic consternation but miss haldin was looking down calmly at her mother the latter said  we do not know the address of any of his friends indeed we know nothing of his petersburg comrades he had a multitude of young friends only he never spoke much of them one could guess that they were his disciples and that they idolized him but he was so modest one would think that with so many devoted  she averted her head again and looked down the boulevard des philosophes a singularly arid and dusty thoroughfare where nothing could be seen at the moment but two dogs a little girl in a pinafore hopping on one leg and in the distance a workman wheeling a bicycle  even amongst the apostles of christ there was found a judas she whispered as if to herself but with the evident intention to be heard by me  the russian visitors assembled in little knots conversed amongst themselves meantime in low murmurs and with brief glances in our direction it was a great contrast to the usual loud volubility of these gatherings miss haldin followed me into the anteroom  people will come she said we cannot shut the door in their faces  while i was putting on my overcoat she began to talk to me of her mother poor mrs haldin was fretting after more news she wanted to go on hearing about her unfortunate son she could not make up her mind to abandon him quietly to the dumb unknown she would persist in pursuing him in there through the long days of motionless silence face to face with the empty boulevard des philosophes she could not understand why he had not escapedas so many other revolutionists and conspirators had managed to escape in other instances of that kind it was really inconceivable that the means of secret revolutionary organisations should have failed so inexcusably to preserve her son but in reality the inconceivable that staggered her mind was nothing but the cruel audacity of death passing over her head to strike at that young and precious heart  miss haldin mechanically with an absorbed look handed me my hat i understood from her that the poor woman was possessed by the sombre and simple idea that her son must have perished because he did not want to be saved it could not have been that he despaired of his countrys future that was impossible was it possible that his mother and sister had not known how to merit his confidence and that after having done what he was compelled to do his spirit became crushed by an intolerable doubt his mind distracted by a sudden mistrust  i was very much shocked by this piece of ingenuity  our three lives were like that miss haldin twined the fingers of both her hands together in demonstration then separated them slowly looking straight into my face thats what poor mother found to torment herself and me with for all the years to come added the strange girl at that moment her indefinable charm was revealed to me in the conjunction of passion and stoicism i imagined what her life was likely to be by the side of mrs haldins terrible immobility inhabited by that fixed idea but my concern was reduced to silence by my ignorance of her modes of feeling difference of nationality is a terrible obstacle for our complex western natures but miss haldin probably was too simple to suspect my embarrassment she did not wait for me to say anything but as if reading my thoughts on my face she went on courageously  at first poor mother went numb as our peasants say then she began to think and she will go on now thinking and thinking in that unfortunate strain you see yourself how cruel that is  i never spoke with greater sincerity than when i agreed with her that it would be deplorable in the highest degree she took an anxious breath  but all these strange details in the english paper she exclaimed suddenly what is the meaning of them i suppose they are true but is it not terrible that my poor brother should be caught wandering alone as if in despair about the streets at night  we stood so close to each other in the dark anteroom that i could see her biting her lower lip to suppress a dry sob after a short pause she said  i suggested to mother that he may have been betrayed by some false friend or simply by some cowardly creature it may be easier for her to believe that  i understood now the poor womans whispered allusion to judas  it may be easier i admitted admiring inwardly the directness and the subtlety of the girls outlook she was dealing with life as it was made for her by the political conditions of her country she faced cruel realities not morbid imaginings of her own making i could not defend myself from a certain feeling of respect when she added simply  time they say can soften every sort of bitterness but i cannot believe that it has any power over remorse it is better that mother should think some person guilty of victors death than that she should connect it with a weakness of her son or a shortcoming of her own  but you yourself dont suppose that i began  she compressed her lips and shook her head she harboured no evil thoughts against any one she declaredand perhaps nothing that happened was unnecessary on these words pronounced low and sounding mysterious in the half obscurity of the anteroom we parted with an expressive and warm handshake the grip of her strong shapely hand had a seductive frankness a sort of exquisite virility i do not know why she should have felt so friendly to me it may be that she thought i understood her much better than i was able to do the most precise of her sayings seemed always to me to have enigmatical prolongations vanishing somewhere beyond my reach i am reduced to suppose that she appreciated my attention and my silence the attention she could see was quite sincere so that the silence could not be suspected of coldness it seemed to satisfy her and it is to be noted that if she confided in me it was clearly not with the expectation of receiving advice for which indeed she never asked   ii   our daily relations were interrupted at this period for something like a fortnight i had to absent myself unexpectedly from geneva on my return i lost no time in directing my steps up the boulevard des philosophes  through the open door of the drawingroom i was annoyed to hear a visitor holding forth steadily in an unctuous deep voice  mrs haldins armchair by the window stood empty on the sofa nathalie haldin raised her charming grey eyes in a glance of greeting accompanied by the merest hint of a welcoming smile but she made no movement with her strong white hands lying inverted in the lap of her mourning dress she faced a man who presented to me a robust back covered with black broadcloth and well in keeping with the deep voice he turned his head sharply over his shoulder but only for a moment  ah your english friend i know i know thats nothing  he wore spectacles with smoked glasses a tall silk hat stood on the floor by the side of his chair flourishing slightly a big soft hand he went on with his discourse precipitating his delivery a little more  i have never changed the faith i held while wandering in the forests and bogs of siberia it sustained me thenit sustains me now the great powers of europe are bound to disappearand the cause of their collapse will be very simple they will exhaust themselves struggling against their proletariat in russia it is different in russia we have no classes to combat each other one holding the power of wealth and the other mighty with the strength of numbers we have only an unclean bureaucracy in the face of a people as great and as incorruptible as the ocean no we have no classes but we have the russian woman the admirable russian woman i receive most remarkable letters signed by women so elevated in tone so courageous breathing such a noble ardour of service the greatest part of our hopes rests on women i behold their thirst for knowledge it is admirable look how they absorb how they are making it their own it is miraculous but what is knowledge i understand that you have not been studying anything especiallymedicine for instance no thats right had i been honoured by being asked to advise you on the use of your time when you arrived here i would have been strongly opposed to such a course knowledge in itself is mere dross  he had one of those bearded russian faces without shape a mere appearance of flesh and hair with not a single feature having any sort of character his eyes being hidden by the dark glasses there was an utter absence of all expression i knew him by sight he was a russian refugee of mark all geneva knew his burly blackcoated figure at one time all europe was aware of the story of his life written by himself and translated into seven or more languages in his youth he had led an idle dissolute life then a society girl he was about to marry died suddenly and thereupon he abandoned the world of fashion and began to conspire in a spirit of repentance and after that his native autocracy took good care that the usual things should happen to him he was imprisoned in fortresses beaten within an inch of his life and condemned to work in mines with common criminals the great success of his book however was the chain  i do not remember now the details of the weight and length of the fetters riveted on his limbs by an administrative order but it was in the number of pounds and the thickness of links an appalling assertion of the divine right of autocracy appalling and futile too because this big man managed to carry off that simple engine of government with him into the woods the sensational clink of these fetters is heard all through the chapters describing his escapea subject of wonder to two continents he had begun by concealing himself successfully from his guard in a hole on a river bank it was the end of the day with infinite labour he managed to free one of his legs meantime night fell he was going to begin on his other leg when he was overtaken by a terrible misfortune he dropped his file  all this is precise yet symbolic and the file had its pathetic history it was given to him unexpectedly one evening by a quiet palefaced girl the poor creature had come out to the mines to join one of his fellow convicts a delicate young man a mechanic and a social democrat with broad cheekbones and large staring eyes she had worked her way across half russia and nearly the whole of siberia to be near him and as it seems with the hope of helping him to escape but she arrived too late her lover had died only a week before  through that obscure episode as he says in the history of ideas in russia the file came into his hands and inspired him with an ardent resolution to regain his liberty when it slipped through his fingers it was as if it had gone straight into the earth he could by no manner of means put his hand on it again in the dark he groped systematically in the loose earth in the mud in the water the night was passing meantime the precious night on which he counted to get away into the forests his only chance of escape for a moment he was tempted by despair to give up but recalling the quiet sad face of the heroic girl he felt profoundly ashamed of his weakness she had selected him for the gift of liberty and he must show himself worthy of the favour conferred by her feminine indomitable soul it appeared to be a sacred trust to fail would have been a sort of treason against the sacredness of selfsacrifice and womanly love  there are in his book whole pages of selfanalysis whence emerges like a white figure from a dark confused sea the conviction of womans spiritual superiorityhis new faith confessed since in several volumes his first tribute to it the great act of his conversion was his extraordinary existence in the endless forests of the okhotsk province with the loose end of the chain wound about his waist a strip torn off his convict shirt secured the end firmly other strips fastened it at intervals up his left leg to deaden the clanking and to prevent the slack links from getting hooked in the bushes he became very fierce he developed an unsuspected genius for the arts of a wild and hunted existence he learned to creep into villages without betraying his presence by anything more than an occasional faint jingle he broke into outhouses with an axe he managed to purloin in a woodcutters camp in the deserted tracts of country he lived on wild berries and hunted for honey his clothing dropped off him gradually his naked tawny figure glimpsed vaguely through the bushes with a cloud of mosquitoes and flies hovering about the shaggy head spread tales of terror through whole districts his temper grew savage as the days went by and he was glad to discover that that there was so much of a brute in him he had nothing else to put his trust in for it was as though there had been two human beings indissolubly joined in that enterprise the civilized man the enthusiast of advanced humanitarian ideals thirsting for the triumph of spiritual love and political liberty and the stealthy primeval savage pitilessly cunning in the preservation of his freedom from day to day like a tracked wild beast  the wild beast was making its way instinctively eastward to the pacific coast and the civilised humanitarian in fearful anxious dependence watched the proceedings with awe through all these weeks he could never make up his mind to appeal to human compassion in the wary primeval savage this shyness might have been natural but the other too the civilized creature the thinker the escaping political had developed an absurd form of morbid pessimism a form of temporary insanity originating perhaps in the physical worry and discomfort of the chain these links he fancied made him odious to the rest of mankind it was a repugnant and suggestive load nobody could feel any pity at the disgusting sight of a man escaping with a broken chain his imagination became affected by his fetters in a precise matteroffact manner it seemed to him impossible that people could resist the temptation of fastening the loose end to a staple in the wall while they went for the nearest police official crouching in holes or hidden in thickets he had tried to read the faces of unsuspecting free settlers working in the clearings or passing along the paths within a foot or two of his eyes his feeling was that no man on earth could be trusted with the temptation of the chain  one day however he chanced to come upon a solitary woman it was on an open slope of rough grass outside the forest she sat on the bank of a narrow stream she had a red handkerchief on her head and a small basket was lying on the ground near her hand at a little distance could be seen a cluster of log cabins with a watermill over a dammed pool shaded by birch trees and looking bright as glass in the twilight he approached her silently his hatchet stuck in his iron belt a thick cudgel in his hand there were leaves and bits of twig in his tangled hair in his matted beard bunches of rags he had wound round the links fluttered from his waist a faint clink of his fetters made the woman turn her head too terrified by this savage apparition to jump up or even to scream she was yet too stouthearted to faint expecting nothing less than to be murdered on the spot she covered her eyes with her hands to avoid the sight of the descending axe when at last she found courage to look again she saw the shaggy wild man sitting on the bank six feet away from her his thin sinewy arms hugged his naked legs the long beard covered the knees on which he rested his chin all these clasped folded limbs the bare shoulders the wild head with red staring eyes shook and trembled violently while the bestial creature was making efforts to speak it was six weeks since he had heard the sound of his own voice it seemed as though he had lost the faculty of speech he had become a dumb and despairing brute till the womans sudden unexpected cry of profound pity the insight of her feminine compassion discovering the complex misery of the man under the terrifying aspect of the monster restored him to the ranks of humanity this point of view is presented in his book with a very effective eloquence she ended he says by shedding tears over him sacred redeeming tears while he also wept with joy in the manner of a converted sinner directing him to hide in the bushes and wait patiently a police patrol was expected in the settlement she went away towards the houses promising to return at night  as if providentially appointed to be the newly wedded wife of the village blacksmith the woman persuaded her husband to come out with her bringing some tools of his trade a hammer a chisel a small anvil my fettersthe book sayswere struck off on the banks of the stream in the starlight of a calm night by an athletic taciturn young man of the people kneeling at my feet while the woman like a liberating genius stood by with clasped hands obviously a symbolic couple at the same time they furnished his regained humanity with some decent clothing and put heart into the new man by the information that the seacoast of the pacific was only a very few miles away it could be seen in fact from the top of the next ridge  the rest of his escape does not lend itself to mystic treatment and symbolic interpretation he ended by finding his way to the west by the suez canal route in the usual manner reaching the shores of south europe he sat down to write his autobiographythe great literary success of its year this book was followed by other books written with the declared purpose of elevating humanity in these works he preached generally the cult of the woman for his own part he practised it under the rites of special devotion to the transcendental merits of a certain madame de s a lady of advanced views no longer very young once upon a time the intriguing wife of a now dead and forgotten diplomat her loud pretensions to be one of the leaders of modern thought and of modern sentiment she sheltered like voltaire and mme de stael on the republican territory of geneva driving through the streets in her big landau she exhibited to the indifference of the natives and the stares of the tourists a longwaisted youthful figure of hieratic stiffness with a pair of big gleaming eyes rolling restlessly behind a short veil of black lace which coming down no further than her vividly red lips resembled a mask usually the heroic fugitive this name was bestowed upon him in a review of the english edition of his bookthe heroic fugitive accompanied her sitting portentously bearded and darkly bespectacled not by her side but opposite her with his back to the horses thus facing each other with no one else in the roomy carriage their airings suggested a conscious public manifestation or it may have been unconscious russian simplicity often marches innocently on the edge of cynicism for some lofty purpose but it is a vain enterprise for sophisticated europe to try and understand these doings considering the air of gravity extending even to the physiognomy of the coachman and the action of the showy horses this quaint display might have possessed a mystic significance but to the corrupt frivolity of a western mind like my own it seemed hardly decent  however it is not becoming for an obscure teacher of languages to criticize a heroic fugitive of worldwide celebrity i was aware from hearsay that he was an industrious busybody hunting up his compatriots in hotels in private lodgings andi was toldconferring upon them the honour of his notice in public gardens when a suitable opening presented itself i was under the impression that after a visit or two several months before he had given up the ladies haldinno doubt reluctantly for there could be no question of his being a determined person it was perhaps to be expected that he should reappear again on this terrible occasion as a russian and a revolutionist to say the right thing to strike the true perhaps a comforting note but i did not like to see him sitting there i trust that an unbecoming jealousy of my privileged position had nothing to do with it i made no claim to a special standing for my silent friendship removed by the difference of age and nationality as if into the sphere of another existence i produced even upon myself the effect of a dumb helpless ghost of an anxious immaterial thing that could only hover about without the power to protect or guide by as much as a whisper since miss haldin with her sure instinct had refrained from introducing me to the burly celebrity i would have retired quietly and returned later on had i not met a peculiar expression in her eyes which i interpreted as a request to stay with the view perhaps of shortening an unwelcome visit  he picked up his hat but only to deposit it on his knees  we shall meet again natalia victorovna today i have called only to mark those feelings towards your honoured mother and yourself the nature of which you cannot doubt i needed no urging but eleanormadame de s herself has in a way sent me she extends to you the hand of feminine fellowship there is positively in all the range of human sentiments no joy and no sorrow that woman cannot understand elevate and spiritualize by her interpretation that young man newly arrived from st petersburg i have mentioned to you is already under the charm  at this point miss haldin got up abruptly i was glad he did not evidently expect anything so decisive and at first throwing his head back he tilted up his dark glasses with bland curiosity at last recollecting himself he stood up hastily seizing his hat off his knees with great adroitness  how is it natalia victorovna that you have kept aloof so long from what after all islet disparaging tongues say what they likea unique centre of intellectual freedom and of effort to shape a high conception of our future in the case of your honoured mother i understand in a measure at her age new ideasnew faces are not perhaps but you was it mistrustor indifference you must come out of your reserve we russians have no right to be reserved with each other in our circumstances it is almost a crime against humanity the luxury of private grief is not for us nowadays the devil is not combated by prayers and fasting and what is fasting after all but starvation you must not starve yourself natalia victorovna strength is what we want spiritual strength i mean as to the other kind what could withstand us russians if we only put it forth sin is different in our day and the way of salvation for pure souls is different too it is no longer to be found in monasteries but in the world in the  the deep sound seemed to rise from under the floor and one felt steeped in it to the lips miss haldins interruption resembled the effort of a drowning person to keep above water she struck in with an accent of impatience  but peter ivanovitch i dont mean to retire into a monastery who would look for salvation there  i spoke figuratively he boomed  well then i am speaking figuratively too but sorrow is sorrow and pain is pain in the old way they make their demands upon people one has got to face them the best way one can i know that the blow which has fallen upon us so unexpectedly is only an episode in the fate of a people you may rest assured that i dont forget that but just now i have to think of my mother how can you expect me to leave her to herself  that is putting it in a very crude way he protested in his great effortless voice  miss haldin did not wait for the vibration to die out  and run about visiting amongst a lot of strange people the idea is distasteful for me and i do not know what else you may mean  he towered before her enormous deferential cropped as close as a convict and this big pinkish poll evoked for me the vision of a wild head with matted locks peering through parted bushes glimpses of naked tawny limbs slinking behind the masses of sodden foliage under a cloud of flies and mosquitoes it was an involuntary tribute to the vigour of his writing nobody could doubt that he had wandered in siberian forests naked and girt with a chain the black broadcloth coat invested his person with a character of austere decencysomething recalling a missionary  do you know what i want natalia victorovna he uttered solemnly i want you to be a fanatic  a fanatic  yes faith alone wont do  his voice dropped to a still lower tone he raised for a moment one thick arm the other remained hanging down against his thigh with the fragile silk hat at the end  i shall tell you now something which i entreat you to ponder over carefully listen we need a force that would move heaven and earthnothing less  the profound subterranean note of this nothing less made one shudder almost like the deep muttering of wind in the pipes of an organ  and are we to find that force in the salon of madame de s excuse me peter ivanovitch if i permit myself to doubt it is not that lady a woman of the great world an aristocrat  prejudice he cried you astonish me and suppose she was all that she is also a woman of flesh and blood there is always something to weigh down the spiritual side in all of us but to make of it a reproach is what i did not expect from you no i did not expect that one would think you have listened to some malevolent scandal  i have heard no gossip i assure you in our province how could we but the world speaks of her what can there be in common in a lady of that sort and an obscure country girl like me  she is a perpetual manifestation of a noble and peerless spirit he broke in her charmno i shall not speak of her charm but of course everybody who approaches her falls under the spell contradictions vanish trouble falls away from one unless i am mistakenbut i never make a mistake in spiritual mattersyou are troubled in your soul natalia victorovna  miss haldins clear eyes looked straight at his soft enormous face i received the impression that behind these dark spectacles of his he could be as impudent as he chose  only the other evening walking back to town from chateau borel with our latest interesting arrival from petersburg i could notice the powerful soothing influencei may say reconciling influence there he was all these kilometres along the shores of the lake silent like a man who has been shown the way of peace i could feel the leaven working in his soul you understand for one thing he listened to me patiently i myself was inspired that evening by the firm and exquisite genius of eleanormadame de s you know it was a full moon and i could observe his face i cannot be deceived  miss haldin looking down seemed to hesitate  well i will think of what you said peter ivanovitch i shall try to call as soon as i can leave mother for an hour or two safely  coldly as these words were said i was amazed at the concession he snatched her right hand with such fervour that i thought he was going to press it to his lips or his breast but he only held it by the fingertips in his great paw and shook it a little up and down while he delivered his last volley of words  thats right thats right i havent obtained your full confidence as yet natalia victorovna but that will come all in good time the sister of viktor haldin cannot be without importance its simply impossible and no woman can remain sitting on the steps flowers tears applausethat has had its time its a mediaeval conception the arena the arena itself is the place for women  he relinquished her hand with a flourish as if giving it to her for a gift and remained still his head bowed in dignified submission before her femininity  the arena you must descend into the arena natalia  he made one step backwards inclined his enormous body and was gone swiftly the door fell to behind him but immediately the powerful resonance of his voice was heard addressing in the anteroom the middleaged servant woman who was letting him out whether he exhorted her too to descend into the arena i cannot tell the thing sounded like a lecture and the slight crash of the outer door cut it short suddenly   iii   we remained looking at each other for a time  do you know who he is  miss haldin coming forward put this question to me in english  i took her offered hand  everybody knows he is a revolutionary feminist a great writer if you like andhow shall i say itthethe familiar guest of madame de ss mystic revolutionary salon  miss haldin passed her hand over her forehead  you know he was with me for more than an hour before you came in i was so glad mother was lying down she has many nights without sleep and then sometimes in the middle of the day she gets a rest of several hours it is sheer exhaustionbut still i am thankful if it were not for these intervals  she looked at me and with that extraordinary penetration which used to disconcert me shook her head  no she would not go mad  my dear young lady i cried by way of protest the more shocked because in my heart i was far from thinking mrs haldin quite sane  you dont know what a fine lucid intellect mother had continued nathalie haldin with her calm cleareyed simplicity which seemed to me always to have a quality of heroism  i am sure i murmured  i darkened mothers room and came out here ive wanted for so long to think quietly  she paused then without giving any sign of distress added its so difficult and looked at me with a strange fixity as if watching for a sign of dissent or surprise  i gave neither i was irresistibly impelled to say  the visit from that gentleman has not made it any easier i fear  miss haldin stood before me with a peculiar expression in her eyes  i dont pretend to understand completely some guide one must have even if one does not wholly give up the direction of ones conduct to him i am an inexperienced girl but i am not slavish there has been too much of that in russia why should i not listen to him there is no harm in having ones thoughts directed but i dont mind confessing to you that i have not been completely candid with peter ivanovitch i dont quite know what prevented me at the moment  she walked away suddenly from me to a distant part of the room but it was only to open and shut a drawer in a bureau she returned with a piece of paper in her hand it was thin and blackened with close handwriting it was obviously a letter  i wanted to read you the very words she said this is one of my poor brothers letters he never doubted how could he doubt they make only such a small handful these miserable oppressors before the unanimous will of our people  your brother believed in the power of a peoples will to achieve anything  it was his religion declared miss haldin  i looked at her calm face and her animated eyes  of course the will must be awakened inspired concentrated she went on that is the true task of real agitators one has got to give up ones life to it the degradation of servitude the absolutist lies must be uprooted and swept out reform is impossible there is nothing to reform there is no legality there are no institutions there are only arbitrary decrees there is only a handful of cruelperhaps blindofficials against a nation  the letter rustled slightly in her hand i glanced down at the flimsy blackened pages whose very handwriting seemed cabalistic incomprehensible to the experience of western europe  stated like this i confessed the problem seems simple enough but i fear i shall not see it solved and if you go back to russia i know that i shall not see you again yet once more i say go back dont suppose that i am thinking of your preservation no i know that you will not be returning to personal safety but i had much rather think of you in danger there than see you exposed to what may be met here  i tell you what said miss haldin after a moment of reflection i believe that you hate revolution you fancy its not quite honest you belong to a people which has made a bargain with fate and wouldnt like to be rude to it but we have made no bargain it was never offered to usso much liberty for so much hard cash you shrink from the idea of revolutionary action for those you think well of as if it were somethinghow shall i say itnot quite decent  i bowed my head  you are quite right i said i think very highly of you  dont suppose i do not know it she began hurriedly your friendship has been very valuable  i have done little else but look on  she was a little flushed under the eyes  there is a way of looking on which is valuable i have felt less lonely because of it its difficult to explain  really well i too have felt less lonely thats easy to explain though but it wont go on much longer the last thing i want to tell you is this in a real revolutionnot a simple dynastic change or a mere reform of institutionsin a real revolution the best characters do not come to the front a violent revolution falls into the hands of narrowminded fanatics and of tyrannical hypocrites at first afterwards comes the turn of all the pretentious intellectual failures of the time such are the chiefs and the leaders you will notice that i have left out the mere rogues the scrupulous and the just the noble humane and devoted natures the unselfish and the intelligent may begin a movementbut it passes away from them they are not the leaders of a revolution they are its victims the victims of disgust of disenchantmentoften of remorse hopes grotesquely betrayed ideals caricaturedthat is the definition of revolutionary success there have been in every revolution hearts broken by such successes but enough of that my meaning is that i dont want you to be a victim  if i could believe all you have said i still wouldnt think of myself protested miss haldin i would take liberty from any hand as a hungry man would snatch at a piece of bread the true progress must begin after and for that the right men shall be found they are already amongst us one comes upon them in their obscurity unknown preparing themselves  she spread out the letter she had kept in her hand all the time and looking down at it  yes one comes upon such men she repeated and then read out the words unstained lofty and solitary existences  folding up the letter while i looked at her interrogatively she explained  these are the words which my brother applies to a young man he came to know in st petersburg an intimate friend i suppose it must be his is the only name my brother mentions in all his correspondence with me absolutely the only one andwould you believe itthe man is here he arrived recently in geneva  have you seen him i inquired but of course you must have seen him  no no i havent i didnt know he was here its peter ivanovitch himself who told me you have heard him yourself mentioning a new arrival from petersburg well that is the man of unstained lofty and solitary existence my brothers friend  compromised politically i suppose i remarked  i dont know yes it must be so who knows perhaps it was this very friendship with my brother which but no it is scarcely possible really i know nothing except what peter ivanovitch told me of him he has brought a letter of introduction from father zosimyou know the priestdemocrat you have heard of father zosim  oh yes the famous father zosim was staying here in geneva for some two months about a year ago i said when he left here he seems to have disappeared from the world  it appears that he is at work in russia again somewhere in the centre miss haldin said with animation but please dont mention that to any onedont let it slip from you because if it got into the papers it would be dangerous for him  you are anxious of course to meet that friend of your brother i asked  miss haldin put the letter into her pocket her eyes looked beyond my shoulder at the door of her mothers room  not here she murmured not for the first time at least  after a moment of silence i said goodbye but miss haldin followed me into the anteroom closing the door behind us carefully  i suppose you guess where i mean to go tomorrow  you have made up your mind to call on madame de s  yes i am going to the chateau borel i must  what do you expect to hear there i asked in a low voice  i wondered if she were not deluding herself with some impossible hope it was not that however  only thinksuch a friend the only man mentioned in his letters he would have something to give me if nothing more than a few poor words it may be something said and thought in those last days would you want me to turn my back on what is left of my poor brothera friend  certainly not i said i quite understand your pious curiosity  unstained lofty and solitary existences she murmured to herself there are there are well let me question one of them about the loved dead  how do you know though that you will meet him there is he staying in the chateau as a guestdo you suppose  i cant really tell she confessed he brought a written introduction from father zosimwho it seems is a friend of madame de s too she cant be such a worthless woman after all  there were all sorts of rumours afloat about father zosim himself i observed  she shrugged her shoulders  calumny is a weapon of our government too its well known oh yes it is a fact that father zosim had the protection of the governorgeneral of a certain province we talked on the subject with my brother two years ago i remember but his work was good and now he is proscribed what better proof can one require but no matter what that priest was or is all that cannot affect my brothers friend if i dont meet him there i shall ask these people for his address and of course mother must see him too later on there is no guessing what he may have to tell us it would be a mercy if mamma could be soothed you know what she imagines some explanation perhaps may be found oror even made up perhaps it would be no sin  certainly i said it would be no sin it may be a mistake though  i want her only to recover some of her old spirit while she is like this i cannot think of anything calmly  do you mean to invent some sort of pious fraud for your mothers sake i asked  why fraud such a friend is sure to know something of my brother in these last days he could tell us there is something in the facts which will not let me rest i am certain he meant to join us abroadthat he had some planssome great patriotic action in view not only for himself but for both of us i trusted in that i looked forward to the time oh with such hope and impatience i could have helped and now suddenly this appearance of recklessnessas if he had not cared  she remained silent for a time then obstinately she concluded  i want to know  thinking it over later on while i walked slowly away from the boulevard des philosophes i asked myself critically what precisely was it that she wanted to know what i had heard of her history was enough to give me a clue in the educational establishment for girls where miss haldin finished her studies she was looked upon rather unfavourably she was suspected of holding independent views on matters settled by official teaching afterwards when the two ladies returned to their country place both mother and daughter by speaking their minds openly on public events had earned for themselves a reputation of liberalism the threehorse trap of the district policecaptain began to be seen frequently in their village i must keep an eye on the peasantsso he explained his visits up at the house two lonely ladies must be looked after a little he would inspect the walls as though he wanted to pierce them with his eyes peer at the photographs turn over the books in the drawingroom negligently and after the usual refreshments would depart but the old priest of the village came one evening in the greatest distress and agitation to confess that hethe priesthad been ordered to watch and ascertain in other ways too such as using his spiritual power with the servants all that was going on in the house and especially in respect of the visitors these ladies received who they were the length of their stay whether any of them were strangers to that part of the country and so on the poor simple old man was in an agony of humiliation and terror i came to warn you be cautious in your conduct for the love of god i am burning with shame but there is no getting out from under the net i shall have to tell them what i see because if i did not there is my deacon he would make the worst of things to curry favour and then my soninlaw the husband of my parasha who is a writer in the government domain office they would soon kick him outand maybe send him away somewhere the old man lamented the necessities of the timeswhen people do not agree somehow and wiped his eyes he did not wish to spend the evening of his days with a shaven head in the penitents cell of some monasteryand subjected to all the severities of ecclesiastical discipline for they would show no mercy to an old man he groaned he became almost hysterical and the two ladies full of commiseration soothed him the best they could before they let him go back to his cottage but as a matter of fact they had very few visitors the neighbourssome of them old friendsbegan to keep away a few from timidity others with marked disdain being grand people that came only for the summermiss haldin explained to mearistocrats reactionaries it was a solitary existence for a young girl her relations with her mother were of the tenderest and most open kind but mrs haldin had seen the experiences of her own generation its sufferings its deceptions its apostasies too her affection for her children was expressed by the suppression of all signs of anxiety she maintained a heroic reserve to nathalie haldin her brother with his petersburg existence not enigmatical in the least there could be no doubt of what he felt or thought but conducted a little mysteriously was the only visible representative of a proscribed liberty all the significance of freedom its indefinite promises lived in their long discussions which breathed the loftiest hope of action and faith in success then suddenly the action the hopes came to an end with the details ferreted out by the english journalist the concrete fact the fact of his death remained but it remained obscure in its deeper causes she felt herself abandoned without explanation but she did not suspect him what she wanted was to learn almost at any cost how she could remain faithful to his departed spirit   iv   several days elapsed before i met nathalie haldin again i was crossing the place in front of the theatre when i made out her shapely figure in the very act of turning between the gate pillars of the unattractive public promenade of the bastions she walked away from me but i knew we should meet as she returned down the main alleyunless indeed she were going home in that case i dont think i should have called on her yet my desire to keep her away from these people was as strong as ever but i had no illusions as to my power i was but a westerner and it was clear that miss haldin would not could not listen to my wisdom and as to my desire of listening to her voice it were better i thought not to indulge overmuch in that pleasure no i should not have gone to the boulevard des philosophes but when at about the middle of the principal alley i saw miss haldin coming towards me i was too curious and too honest perhaps to run away  there was something of the spring harshness in the air the blue sky was hard but the young leaves clung like soft mist about the uninteresting range of trees and the clear sun put little points of gold into the grey of miss haldins frank eyes turned to me with a friendly greeting  i inquired after the health of her mother  she had a slight movement of the shoulders and a little sad sigh  but you see i did come out for a walkfor exercise as you english say  i smiled approvingly and she added an unexpected remark  it is a glorious day  her voice slightly harsh but fascinating with its masculine and birdlike quality had the accent of spontaneous conviction i was glad of it it was as though she had become aware of her youthfor there was but little of springlike glory in the rectangular railed space of grass and trees framed visibly by the orderly roofslopes of that town comely without grace and hospitable without sympathy in the very air through which she moved there was but little warmth and the sky the sky of a land without horizons swept and washed clean by the april showers extended a cold cruel blue without elevation narrowed suddenly by the ugly dark wall of the jura where here and there lingered yet a few miserable trails and patches of snow all the glory of the season must have been within herselfand i was glad this feeling had come into her life if only for a little time  i am pleased to hear you say these words she gave me a quick look quick not stealthy if there was one thing of which she was absolutely incapable it was stealthiness her sincerity was expressed in the very rhythm of her walk it was i who was looking at her covertlyif i may say so i knew where she had been but i did not know what she had seen and heard in that nest of aristocratic conspiracies i use the word aristocratic for want of a better term the chateau borel embowered in the trees and thickets of its neglected grounds had its fame in our day like the residence of that other dangerous and exiled woman madame de stael in the napoleonic era only the napoleonic despotism the booted heir of the revolution which counted that intellectual woman for an enemy worthy to be watched was something quite unlike the autocracy in mystic vestments engendered by the slavery of a tartar conquest and madame de s was very far from resembling the gifted author of corinne she made a great noise about being persecuted i dont know if she were regarded in certain circles as dangerous as to being watched i imagine that the chateau borel could be subjected only to a most distant observation it was in its exclusiveness an ideal abode for hatching superior plotswhether serious or futile but all this did not interest me i wanted to know the effect its extraordinary inhabitants and its special atmosphere had produced on a girl like miss haldin so true so honest but so dangerously inexperienced her unconsciously lofty ignorance of the baser instincts of mankind left her disarmed before her own impulses and there was also that friend of her brother the significant new arrival from russia i wondered whether she had managed to meet him  we walked for some time slowly and in silence  you know i attacked her suddenly if you dont intend telling me anything you must say so distinctly and then of course it shall be final but i wont play at delicacy i ask you pointblank for all the details  she smiled faintly at my threatening tone  you are as curious as a child  no i am only an anxious old man i replied earnestly  she rested her glance on me as if to ascertain the degree of my anxiety or the number of my years my physiognomy has never been expressive i believe and as to my years i am not ancient enough as yet to be strikingly decrepit i have no long beard like the good hermit of a romantic ballad my footsteps are not tottering my aspect not that of a slow venerable sage those picturesque advantages are not mine i am old alas in a brisk commonplace way and it seemed to me as though there were some pity for me in miss haldins prolonged glance she stepped out a little quicker  you ask for all the details let me see i ought to remember them it was novel enough for aa village girl like me  after a moment of silence she began by saying that the chateau borel was almost as neglected inside as outside it was nothing to wonder at a hamburg banker i believe retired from business had it built to cheer his remaining days by the view of that lake whose precise orderly and welltodo beauty must have been attractive to the unromantic imagination of a business man but he died soon his wife departed too but only to italy and this house of moneyed ease presumably unsaleable had stood empty for several years one went to it up a gravel drive round a large coarse grassplot with plenty of time to observe the degradation of its stuccoed front miss haldin said that the impression was unpleasant it grew more depressing as one came nearer  she observed green stains of moss on the steps of the terrace the front door stood wide open there was no one about she found herself in a wide lofty and absolutely empty hall with a good many doors these doors were all shut a broad bare stone staircase faced her and the effect of the whole was of an untenanted house she stood still disconcerted by the solitude but after a while she became aware of a voice speaking continuously somewhere  you were probably being observed all the time i suggested there must have been eyes  i dont see how that could be she retorted i havent seen even a bird in the grounds i dont remember hearing a single twitter in the trees the whole place appeared utterly deserted except for the voice  she could not make out the languagerussian french or german no one seemed to answer it it was as though the voice had been left behind by the departed inhabitants to talk to the bare walls it went on volubly with a pause now and then it was lonely and sad the time seemed very long to miss haldin an invincible repugnance prevented her from opening one of the doors in the hall it was so hopeless no one would come the voice would never stop she confessed to me that she had to resist an impulse to turn round and go away unseen as she had come  really you had that impulse i cried full of regret what a pity you did not obey it  she shook her head  what a strange memory it would have been for one those deserted grounds that empty hall that impersonal voluble voice andnobody nothing not a soul  the memory would have been unique and harmless but she was not a girl to run away from an intimidating impression of solitude and mystery no i did not run away she said i stayed where i wasand i did see a soul such a strange soul  as she was gazing up the broad staircase and had concluded that the voice came from somewhere above a rustle of dress attracted her attention she looked down and saw a woman crossing the hall having issued apparently through one of the many doors her face was averted so that at first she was not aware of miss haldin  on turning her head and seeing a stranger she appeared very much startled from her slender figure miss haldin had taken her for a young girl but if her face was almost childishly round it was also sallow and wrinkled with dark rings under the eyes a thick crop of dusty brown hair was parted boyishly on the side with a lateral wave above the dry furrowed forehead after a moment of dumb blinking she suddenly squatted down on the floor  what do you mean by squatted down i asked astonished this is a very strange detail  miss haldin explained the reason this person when first seen was carrying a small bowl in her hand she had squatted down to put it on the floor for the benefit of a large cat which appeared then from behind her skirts and hid its head into the bowl greedily she got up and approaching miss haldin asked with nervous bluntness  what do you want who are you  miss haldin mentioned her name and also the name of peter ivanovitch the girlish elderly woman nodded and puckered her face into a momentary expression of sympathy her black silk blouse was old and even frayed in places the black serge skirt was short and shabby she continued to blink at close quarters and her eyelashes and eyebrows seemed shabby too miss haldin speaking gently to her as if to an unhappy and sensitive person explained how it was that her visit could not be an altogether unexpected event to madame de s  ah peter ivanovitch brought you an invitation how was i to know a dame de compangnie is not consulted as you may imagine  the shabby woman laughed a little her teeth splendidly white and admirably even looked absurdly out of place like a string of pearls on the neck of a ragged tramp peter ivanovitch is the greatest genius of the century perhaps but he is the most inconsiderate man living so if you have an appointment with him you must not be surprised to hear that he is not here  miss haldin explained that she had no appointment with peter ivanovitch she became interested at once in that bizarre person  why should he put himself out for you or any one else oh these geniuses if you only knew yes and their booksi mean of course the books that the world admires the inspired books but you have not been behind the scenes wait till you have to sit at a table for a half a day with a pen in your hand he can walk up and down his rooms for hours and hours i used to get so stiff and numb that i was afraid i would lose my balance and fall off the chair all at once  she kept her hands folded in front of her and her eyes fixed on miss haldins face betrayed no animation whatever miss haldin gathering that the lady who called herself a dame de compangnie was proud of having acted as secretary to peter ivanovitch made an amiable remark  you could not imagine a more trying experience declared the lady there is an angloamerican journalist interviewing madame de s now or i would take you up she continued in a changed tone and glancing towards the staircase i act as master of ceremonies  it appeared that madame de s could not bear swiss servants about her person and indeed servants would not stay for very long in the chateau borel there were always difficulties miss haldin had already noticed that the hall was like a dusty barn of marble and stucco with cobwebs in the corners and faint tracks of mud on the black and white tessellated floor  i look also after this animal continued the dame de compagnie keeping her hands folded quietly in front of her and she bent her worn gaze upon the cat i dont mind a bit animals have their rights though strictly speaking i see no reason why they should not suffer as well as human beings do you but of course they never suffer so much that is impossible only in their case it is more pitiful because they cannot make a revolution i used to be a republican i suppose you are a republican  miss haldin confessed to me that she did not know what to say but she nodded slightly and asked in her turn  and are you no longer a republican  after taking down peter ivanovitch from dictation for two years it is difficult for me to be anything first of all you have to sit perfectly motionless the slightest movement you make puts to flight the ideas of peter ivanovitch you hardly dare to breathe and as to coughinggod forbid peter ivanovitch changed the position of the table to the wall because at first i could not help raising my eyes to look out of the window while waiting for him to go on with his dictation that was not allowed he said i stared so stupidly i was likewise not permitted to look at him over my shoulder instantly peter ivanovitch stamped his foot and would roar look down on the paper it seems my expression my face put him off well i know that i am not beautiful and that my expression is not hopeful either he said that my air of unintelligent expectation irritated him these are his own words  miss haldin was shocked but admitted to me that she was not altogether surprised  is it possible that peter ivanovitch could treat any woman so rudely she cried  the dame de compagnie nodded several times with an air of discretion then assured miss haldin that she did not mind in the least the trying part of it was to have the secret of the composition laid bare before her to see the great author of the revolutionary gospels grope for words as if he were in the dark as to what he meant to say  i am quite willing to be the blind instrument of higher ends to give ones life for the cause is nothing but to have ones illusions destroyedthat is really almost more than one can bear i really dont exaggerate she insisted it seemed to freeze my very beliefs in methe more so that when we worked in winter peter ivanovitch walking up and down the room required no artificial heat to keep himself warm even when we move to the south of france there are bitterly cold days especially when you have to sit still for six hours at a stretch the walls of these villas on the riviera are so flimsy peter ivanovitch did not seem to be aware of anything it is true that i kept down my shivers from fear of putting him out i used to set my teeth till my jaws felt absolutely locked in the moments when peter ivanovitch interrupted his dictation and sometimes these intervals were very longoften twenty minutes no less while he walked to and fro behind my back muttering to himselfi felt i was dying by inches i assure you perhaps if i had let my teeth rattle peter ivanovitch might have noticed my distress but i dont think it would have had any practical effect shes very miserly in such matters  the dame de compagnie glanced up the staircase the big cat had finished the milk and was rubbing its whiskered cheek sinuously against her skirt she dived to snatch it up from the floor  miserliness is rather a quality than otherwise you know she continued holding the cat in her folded arms with us it is misers who can spare money for worthy objectsnot the socalled generous natures but pray dont think i am a sybarite my father was a clerk in the ministry of finances with no position at all you may guess by this that our home was far from luxurious though of course we did not actually suffer from cold i ran away from my parents you know directly i began to think by myself it is not very easy such thinking one has got to be put in the way of it awakened to the truth i am indebted for my salvation to an old applewoman who had her stall under the gateway of the house we lived in she had a kind wrinkled face and the most friendly voice imaginable one day casually we began to talk about a child a ragged little girl we had seen begging from men in the streets at dusk and from one thing to another my eyes began to open gradually to the horrors from which innocent people are made to suffer in this world only in order that governments might exist after i once understood the crime of the upper classes i could not go on living with my parents not a single charitable word was to be heard in our home from years end to years end there was nothing but the talk of vile office intrigues and of promotion and of salaries and of courting the favour of the chiefs the mere idea of marrying one day such another man as my father made me shudder i dont mean that there was anyone wanting to marry me there was not the slightest prospect of anything of the kind but was it not sin enough to live on a government salary while half russia was dying of hunger the ministry of finances what a grotesque horror it is what does the starving ignorant people want with a ministry of finances i kissed my old folks on both cheeks and went away from them to live in cellars with the proletariat i tried to make myself useful to the utterly hopeless i suppose you understand what i mean i mean the people who have nowhere to go and nothing to look forward to in this life do you understand how frightful that isnothing to look forward to sometimes i think that it is only in russia that there are such people and such a depth of misery can be reached well i plunged into it anddo you knowthere isnt much that one can do in there no indeedat least as long as there are ministries of finances and such like grotesque horrors to stand in the way i suppose i would have gone mad there just trying to fight the vermin if it had not been for a man it was my old friend and teacher the poor saintly applewoman who discovered him for me quite accidentally she came to fetch me late one evening in her quiet way i followed her where she would lead that part of my life was in her hands altogether and without her my spirit would have perished miserably the man was a young workman a lithographer by trade and he had got into trouble in connexion with that affair of temperance tractsyou remember there was a lot of people put in prison for that the ministry of finances again what would become of it if the poor folk ceased making beasts of themselves with drink upon my word i would think that finances and all the rest of it are an invention of the devil only that a belief in a supernatural source of evil is not necessary men alone are quite capable of every wickedness finances indeed  hatred and contempt hissed in her utterance of the word finances but at the very moment she gently stroked the cat reposing in her arms she even raised them slightly and inclining her head rubbed her cheek against the fur of the animal which received this caress with the complete detachment so characteristic of its kind then looking at miss haldin she excused herself once more for not taking her upstairs to madame s the interview could not be interrupted presently the journalist would be seen coming down the stairs the best thing was to remain in the hall and besides all these rooms she glanced all round at the many doors all these rooms on the ground floor were unfurnished  positively there is no chair down here to offer you she continued but if you prefer your own thoughts to my chatter i will sit down on the bottom step here and keep silent  miss haldin hastened to assure her that on the contrary she was very much interested in the story of the journeyman lithographer he was a revolutionist of course  a martyr a simple man said the dame de compangnie with a faint sigh and gazing through the open front door dreamily she turned her misty brown eyes on miss haldin  i lived with him for four months it was like a nightmare  as miss haldin looked at her inquisitively she began to describe the emaciated face of the man his fleshless limbs his destitution the room into which the applewoman had led her was a tiny garret a miserable den under the roof of a sordid house the plaster fallen off the walls covered the floor and when the door was opened a horrible tapestry of black cobwebs waved in the draught he had been liberated a few days beforeflung out of prison into the streets and miss haldin seemed to see for the first time a name and a face upon the body of that suffering people whose hard fate had been the subject of so many conversations between her and her brother in the garden of their country house  he had been arrested with scores and scores of other people in that affair of the lithographed temperance tracts unluckily having got hold of a great many suspected persons the police thought they could extract from some of them other information relating to the revolutionist propaganda  they beat him so cruelly in the course of investigation went on the dame de compagnie that they injured him internally when they had done with him he was doomed he could do nothing for himself i beheld him lying on a wooden bedstead without any bedding with his head on a bundle of dirty rags lent to him out of charity by an old ragpicker who happened to live in the basement of the house there he was uncovered burning with fever and there was not even a jug in the room for the water to quench his thirst with there was nothing whateverjust that bedstead and the bare floor  was there no one in all that great town amongst the liberals and revolutionaries to extend a helping hand to a brother asked miss haldin indignantly  yes but you do not know the most terrible part of that mans misery listen it seems that they illused him so atrociously that at last his firmness gave way and he did let out some information poor soul the flesh is weak you know what it was he did not tell me there was a crushed spirit in that mangled body nothing i found to say could make him whole when they let him out he crept into that hole and bore his remorse stoically he would not go near anyone he knew i would have sought assistance for him but indeed where could i have gone looking for it where was i to look for anyone who had anything to spare or any power to help the people living round us were all starving and drunken they were the victims of the ministry of finances dont ask me how we lived i couldnt tell you it was like a miracle of wretchedness i had nothing to sell and i assure you my clothes were in such a state that it was impossible for me to go out in the daytime i was indecent i had to wait till it was dark before i ventured into the streets to beg for a crust of bread or whatever i could get to keep him and me alive often i got nothing and then i would crawl back and lie on the floor by the side of his couch oh yes i can sleep quite soundly on bare boards that is nothing and i am only mentioning it to you so that you should not think i am a sybarite it was infinitely less killing than the task of sitting for hours at a table in a cold study to take the books of peter ivanovitch from dictation but you shall see yourself what that is like so i neednt say any more about it  it is by no means certain that i will ever take peter ivanovitch from dictation said miss haldin  no cried the other incredulously not certain you mean to say that you have not made up your mind  when miss haldin assured her that there never had been any question of that between her and peter ivanovitch the woman with the cat compressed her lips tightly for a moment  oh you will find yourself settled at the table before you know that you have made up your mind dont make a mistake it is disenchanting to hear peter ivanovitch dictate but at the same time there is a fascination about it he is a man of genius your face is certain not to irritate him you may perhaps even help his inspiration make it easier for him to deliver his message as i look at you i feel certain that you are the kind of woman who is not likely to check the flow of his inspiration  miss haldin thought it useless to protest against all these assumptions  but this manthis workman did he die under your care she said after a short silence  the dame de compagnie listening up the stairs where now two voices were alternating with some animation made no answer for a time when the loud sounds of the discussion had sunk into an almost inaudible murmur she turned to miss haldin  yes he died but not literally speaking in my arms as you might suppose as a matter of fact i was asleep when he breathed his last so even now i cannot say i have seen anybody die a few days before the end some young men found us out in our extremity they were revolutionists as you might guess he ought to have trusted in his political friends when he came out of prison he had been liked and respected before and nobody would have dreamed of reproaching him with his indiscretion before the police everybody knows how they go to work and the strongest man has his moments of weakness before pain why even hunger alone is enough to give one queer ideas as to what may be done a doctor came our lot was alleviated as far as physical comforts go but otherwise he could not be consoledpoor man i assure you miss haldin that he was very lovable but i had not the strength to weep i was nearly dead myself but there were kind hearts to take care of me a dress was found to clothe my nakedness i tell you i was not decentand after a time the revolutionists placed me with a jewish family going abroad as governess of course i could teach the children i finished the sixth class of the lyceum but the real object was that i should carry some important papers across the frontier i was entrusted with a packet which i carried next my heart the gendarmes at the station did not suspect the governess of a jewish family busy looking after three children i dont suppose those hebrews knew what i had on me for i had been introduced to them in a very roundabout way by persons who did not belong to the revolutionary movement and naturally i had been instructed to accept a very small salary when we reached germany i left that family and delivered my papers to a revolutionist in stuttgart after this i was employed in various ways but you do not want to hear all that i have never felt that i was very useful but i live in hopes of seeing all the ministries destroyed finances and all the greatest joy of my life has been to hear what your brother has done  she directed her round eyes again to the sunshine outside while the cat reposed within her folded arms in lordly beatitude and sphinxlike meditation  yes i rejoiced she began again for me there is a heroic ring about the very name of haldin they must have been trembling with fear in their ministriesall those men with fiendish hearts here i stand talking to you and when i think of all the cruelties oppressions and injustices that are going on at this very moment my head begins to swim i have looked closely at what would seem inconceivable if ones own eyes had not to be trusted i have looked at things that made me hate myself for my helplessness i hated my hands that had no power my voice that could not be heard my very mind that would not become unhinged ah i have seen things and you  miss haldin was moved she shook her head slightly  no i have seen nothing for myself as yet she murmured we have always lived in the country it was my brothers wish  it is a curious meetingthisbetween you and me continued the other do you believe in chance miss haldin how could i have expected to see you his sister with my own eyes do you know that when the news came the revolutionaries here were as much surprised as pleased every bit no one seemed to know anything about your brother peter ivanovitch himself had not foreseen that such a blow was going to be struck i suppose your brother was simply inspired i myself think that such deeds should be done by inspiration it is a great privilege to have the inspiration and the opportunity did he resemble you at all dont you rejoice miss haldin  you must not expect too much from me said miss haldin repressing an inclination to cry which came over her suddenly she succeeded then added calmly i am not a heroic person  you think you couldnt have done such a thing yourself perhaps  i dont know i must not even ask myself till i have lived a little longer seen more  the other moved her head appreciatively the purring of the cat had a loud complacency in the empty hall no sound of voices came from upstairs miss haldin broke the silence  what is it precisely that you heard people say about my brother you said that they were surprised yes i supposed they were did it not seem strange to them that my brother should have failed to save himself after the most difficult partthat is getting away from the spotwas over conspirators should understand these things well there are reasons why i am very anxious to know how it is he failed to escape  the dame de compagnie had advanced to the open halldoor she glanced rapidly over her shoulder at miss haldin who remained within the hall  failed to escape she repeated absently didnt he make the sacrifice of his life wasnt he just simply inspired wasnt it an act of abnegation arent you certain  what i am certain of said miss haldin is that it was not an act of despair have you not heard some opinion expressed here upon his miserable capture  the dame de compagnie mused for a while in the doorway  did i hear of course everything is discussed here has not all the world been speaking about your brother for my part the mere mention of his achievement plunges me into an envious ecstasy why should a man certain of immortality think of his life at all  she kept her back turned to miss haldin upstairs from behind a great dingy white and gold door visible behind the balustrade of the first floor landing a deep voice began to drone formally as if reading over notes or something of the sort it paused frequently and then ceased altogether  i dont think i can stay any longer now said miss haldin i may return another day  she waited for the dame de compagnie to make room for her exit but the woman appeared lost in the contemplation of sunshine and shadows sharing between themselves the stillness of the deserted grounds she concealed the view of the drive from miss haldin suddenly she said  it will not be necessary here is peter ivanovitch himself coming up but he is not alone he is seldom alone now  hearing that peter ivanovitch was approaching miss haldin was not so pleased as she might have been expected to be somehow she had lost the desire to see either the heroic captive or madame de s and the reason of that shrinking which came upon her at the very last minute is accounted for by the feeling that those two people had not been treating the woman with the cat kindly  would you please let me pass said miss haldin at last touching lightly the shoulder of the dame de compagnie  but the other pressing the cat to her breast did not budge  i know who is with him she said without even looking back  more unaccountably than ever miss haldin felt a strong impulse to leave the house  madame de s may be engaged for some time yet and what i have got to say to peter ivanovitch is just a simple question which i might put to him when i meet him in the grounds on my way down i really think i must go i have been some time here and i am anxious to get back to my mother will you let me pass please  the dame de compagnie turned her head at last  i never supposed that you really wanted to see madame de s she said with unexpected insight not for a moment there was something confidential and mysterious in her tone she passed through the door with miss haldin following her on to the terrace and they descended side by side the mossgrown stone steps there was no one to be seen on the part of the drive visible from the front of the house  they are hidden by the trees over there explained miss haldins new acquaintance but you shall see them directly i dont know who that young man is to whom peter ivanovitch has taken such a fancy he must be one of us or he would not be admitted here when the others come you know what i mean by the others but i must say that he is not at all mystically inclined i dont know that i have made him out yet naturally i am never for very long in the drawingroom there is always something to do for me though the establishment here is not so extensive as the villa on the riviera but still there are plenty of opportunities for me to make myself useful  to the left passing by the ivygrown end of the stables appeared peter ivanovitch and his companion they walked very slowly conversing with some animation they stopped for a moment and peter ivanovitch was seen to gesticulate while the young man listened motionless with his arms hanging down and his head bowed a little he was dressed in a dark brown suit and a black hat the round eyes of the dame de compagnie remained fixed on the two figures which had resumed their leisurely approach  an extremely polite young man she said you shall see what a bow he will make and it wont altogether be so exceptional either he bows in the same way when he meets me alone in the hall  she moved on a few steps with miss haldin by her side and things happened just as she had foretold the young man took off his hat bowed and fell back while peter ivanovitch advanced quicker his black thick arms extended heartily and seized hold of both miss haldins hands shook them and peered at her through his dark glasses  thats right thats right he exclaimed twice approvingly and so you have been looked after by he frowned slightly at the dame de compagnie who was still nursing the cat i conclude eleanormadame de s is engaged i know she expected somebody today so the newspaper man did turn up eh she is engaged  for all answer the dame de compagnie turned away her head  it is very unfortunatevery unfortunate indeed i very much regret that you should have been he lowered suddenly his voice but what is itsurely you are not departing natalia victorovna you got bored waiting didnt you  not in the least miss haldin protested only i have been here some time and i am anxious to get back to my mother  the time seemed long eh i am afraid our worthy friend here peter ivanovitch suddenly jerked his head sideways towards his right shoulder and jerked it up againour worthy friend here has not the art of shortening the moments of waiting no distinctly she has not the art and in that respect good intentions alone count for nothing  the dame de compagnie dropped her arms and the cat found itself suddenly on the ground it remained quite still after alighting one hind leg stretched backwards miss haldin was extremely indignant on behalf of the lady companion  believe me peter ivanovitch that the moments i have passed in the hall of this house have been not a little interesting and very instructive too they are memorable i do not regret the waiting but i see that the object of my call here can be attained without taking up madame de ss time  at this point i interrupted miss haldin the above relation is founded on her narrative which i have not so much dramatized as might be supposed she had rendered with extraordinary feeling and animation the very accent almost of the disciple of the old applewoman the irreconcilable hater of ministries the voluntary servant of the poor miss haldins true and delicate humanity had been extremely shocked by the uncongenial fate of her new acquaintance that lady companion secretary whatever she was for my own part i was pleased to discover in it one more obstacle to intimacy with madame de s i had a positive abhorrence for the painted bedizened deadfaced glassyeyed egeria of peter ivanovitch i do not know what was her attitude to the unseen but i know that in the affairs of this world she was avaricious greedy and unscrupulous it was within my knowledge that she had been worsted in a sordid and desperate quarrel about money matters with the family of her late husband the diplomatist some very august personages indeed whom in her fury she had insisted upon scandalously involving in her affairs had incurred her animosity i find it perfectly easy to believe that she had come to within an ace of being spirited away for reasons of state into some discreet maison de santea madhouse of sorts to be plain it appears however that certain highplaced personages opposed it for reasons which  but its no use to go into details  wonder may be expressed at a man in the position of a teacher of languages knowing all this with such definiteness a novelist says this and that of his personages and if only he knows how to say it earnestly enough he may not be questioned upon the inventions of his brain in which his own belief is made sufficiently manifest by a telling phrase a poetic image the accent of emotion art is great but i have no art and not having invented madame de s i feel bound to explain how i came to know so much about her  my informant was the russian wife of a friend of mine already mentioned the professor of lausanne university it was from her that i learned the last fact of madame de ss history with which i intend to trouble my readers she told me speaking positively as a person who trusts her sources of the cause of madame de ss flight from russia some years before it was neither more nor less than this that she became suspect to the police in connexion with the assassination of the emperor alexander the ground of this suspicion was either some unguarded expressions that escaped her in public or some talk overheard in her salon overheard we must believe by some guest perhaps a friend who hastened to play the informer i suppose at any rate the overheard matter seemed to imply her foreknowledge of that event and i think she was wise in not waiting for the investigation of such a charge some of my readers may remember a little book from her pen published in paris a mystically badtempered declamatory and frightfully disconnected piece of writing in which she all but admits the foreknowledge more than hints at its supernatural origin and plainly suggests in venomous innuendoes that the guilt of the act was not with the terrorists but with a palace intrigue when i observed to my friend the professors wife that the life of madame de s with its unofficial diplomacy its intrigues lawsuits favours disgrace expulsions its atmosphere of scandal occultism and charlatanism was more fit for the eighteenth century than for the conditions of our own time she assented with a smile but a moment after went on in a reflective tone charlatanismyes in a certain measure still times are changed there are forces now which were nonexistent in the eighteenth century i should not be surprised if she were more dangerous than an englishman would be willing to believe and whats more she is looked upon as really dangerous by certain peoplechez nous  chez nous in this connexion meant russia in general and the russian political police in particular the object of my digression from the straight course of miss haldins relation in my own words of her visit to the chateau borel was to bring forward that statement of my friend the professors wife i wanted to bring it forward simply to make what i have to say presently of mr razumovs presence in geneva a little more crediblefor this is a russian story for western ears which as i have observed already are not attuned to certain tones of cynicism and cruelty of moral negation and even of moral distress already silenced at our end of europe and this i state as my excuse for having left miss haldin standing one of the little group of two women and two men who had come together below the terrace of the chateau borel  the knowledge which i have just stated was in my mind when as i have said i interrupted miss haldin i interrupted her with the cry of profound satisfaction  so you never saw madame de s after all  miss haldin shook her head it was very satisfactory to me she had not seen madame de s that was excellent excellent i welcomed the conviction that she would never know madame de s now i could not explain the reason of the conviction but by the knowledge that miss haldin was standing face to face with her brothers wonderful friend i preferred him to madame de s as the companion and guide of that young girl abandoned to her inexperience by the miserable end of her brother but at any rate that life now ended had been sincere and perhaps its thoughts might have been lofty its moral sufferings profound its last act a true sacrifice it is not for us the staid lovers calmed by the possession of a conquered liberty to condemn without appeal the fierceness of thwarted desire  i am not ashamed of the warmth of my regard for miss haldin it was it must be admitted an unselfish sentiment being its own reward the late victor haldinin the light of that sentimentappeared to me not as a sinister conspirator but as a pure enthusiast i did not wish indeed to judge him but the very fact that he did not escape that fact which brought so much trouble to both his mother and his sister spoke to me in his favour meantime in my fear of seeing the girl surrender to the influence of the chateau borel revolutionary feminism i was more than willing to put my trust in that friend of the late victor haldin he was nothing but a name you will say exactly a name and whats more the only name the only name to be found in the correspondence between brother and sister the young man had turned up they had come face to face and fortunately without the direct interference of madame de s what will come of it what will she tell me presently i was asking myself  it was only natural that my thought should turn to the young man the bearer of the only name uttered in all the dreamtalk of a future to be brought about by a revolution and my thought took the shape of asking myself why this young man had not called upon these ladies he had been in geneva for some days before miss haldin heard of him first in my presence from peter ivanovitch i regretted that lasts presence at their meeting i would rather have had it happen somewhere out of his spectacled sight but i supposed that having both these young people there he introduced them to each other  i broke the silence by beginning a question on that point  i suppose peter ivanovitch  miss haldin gave vent to her indignation peter ivanovitch directly he had got his answer from her had turned upon the dame de compagnie in a shameful manner  turned upon her i wondered what about for what reason  it was unheard of it was shameful miss haldin pursued with angry eyes il lui a fait une scenelike this before strangers and for what you would never guess for some eggs oh  i was astonished eggs did you say  for madame de s that lady observes a special diet or something of the sort it seems she complained the day before to peter ivanovitch that the eggs were not rightly prepared peter ivanovitch suddenly remembered this against the poor woman and flew out at her it was most astonishing i stood as if rooted  do you mean to say that the great feminist allowed himself to be abusive to a woman i asked  oh not that it was something you have no conception of it was an odious performance imagine he raised his hat to begin with he made his voice soft and deprecatory ah you are not kind to usyou will not deign to remember this sort of phrases that sort of tone the poor creature was terribly upset her eyes ran full of tears she did not know where to look i shouldnt wonder if she would have preferred abuse or even a blow  i did not remark that very possibly she was familiar with both on occasions when no one was by miss haldin walked by my side her head up in scornful and angry silence  great men have their surprising peculiarities i observed inanely exactly like men who are not great but that sort of thing cannot be kept up for ever how did the great feminist wind up this very characteristic episode  miss haldin without turning her face my way told me that the end was brought about by the appearance of the interviewer who had been closeted with madame de s  he came up rapidly unnoticed lifted his hat slightly and paused to say in french the baroness has asked me in case i met a lady on my way out to desire her to come in at once  after delivering this message he hurried down the drive the dame de compagnie flew towards the house and peter ivanovitch followed her hastily looking uneasy in a moment miss haldin found herself alone with the young man who undoubtedly must have been the new arrival from russia she wondered whether her brothers friend had not already guessed who she was  i am in a position to say that as a matter of fact he had guessed it is clear to me that peter ivanovitch for some reason or other had refrained from alluding to these ladies presence in geneva but razumov had guessed the trustful girl every word uttered by haldin lived in razumovs memory they were like haunting shapes they could not be exorcised the most vivid amongst them was the mention of the sister the girl had existed for him ever since but he did not recognize her at once coming up with peter ivanovitch he did observe her their eyes had met even he had responded as no one could help responding to the harmonious charm of her whole person its strength its grace its tranquil franknessand then he had turned his gaze away he said to himself that all this was not for him the beauty of women and the friendship of men were not for him he accepted that feeling with a purposeful sternness and tried to pass on it was only her outstretched hand which brought about the recognition it stands recorded in the pages of his selfconfession that it nearly suffocated him physically with an emotional reaction of hate and dismay as though her appearance had been a piece of accomplished treachery  he faced about the considerable elevation of the terrace concealed them from anyone lingering in the doorway of the house and even from the upstairs windows they could not have been seen through the thickets run wild and the trees of the gently sloping grounds he had cold placid glimpses of the lake a moment of perfect privacy had been vouchsafed to them at this juncture i wondered to myself what use they had made of that fortunate circumstance  did you have time for more than a few words i asked  that animation with which she had related to me the incidents of her visit to the chateau borel had left her completely strolling by my side she looked straight before her but i noticed a little colour on her cheek she did not answer me  after some little time i observed that they could not have hoped to remain forgotten for very long unless the other two had discovered madame de s swooning with fatigue perhaps or in a state of morbid exaltation after the long interview either would require their devoted ministrations i could depict to myself peter ivanovitch rushing busily out of the house again bareheaded perhaps and on across the terrace with his swinging gait the black skirts of the frockcoat floating clear of his stout light grey legs i confess to having looked upon these young people as the quarry of the heroic fugitive i had the notion that they would not be allowed to escape capture but of that i said nothing to miss haldin only as she still remained uncommunicative i pressed her a little  wellbut you can tell me at least your impression  she turned her head to look at me and turned away again  impression she repeated slowly almost dreamily then in a quicker tone  he seems to be a man who has suffered more from his thoughts than from evil fortune  from his thoughts you say  and that is natural enough in a russian she took me up in a young russian so many of them are unfit for action and yet unable to rest  and you think he is that sort of man  no i do not judge him how could i so suddenly you asked for my impressioni explain my impression iidont know the world nor yet the people in it i have been too solitaryi am too young to trust my own opinions  trust your instinct i advised her most women trust to that and make no worse mistakes than men in this case you have your brothers letter to help you  she drew a deep breath like a light sigh unstained lofty and solitary existences she quoted as if to herself but i caught the wistful murmur distinctly  high praise i whispered to her  the highest possible  so high that like the award of happiness it is more fit to come only at the end of a life but still no common or altogether unworthy personality could have suggested such a confident exaggeration of praise and  ah she interrupted me ardently and if you had only known the heart from which that judgment has come  she ceased on that note and for a space i reflected on the character of the words which i perceived very well must tip the scale of the girls feelings in that young mans favour they had not the sound of a casual utterance vague they were to my western mind and to my western sentiment but i could not forget that standing by miss haldins side i was like a traveller in a strange country it had also become clear to me that miss haldin was unwilling to enter into the details of the only material part of their visit to the chateau borel but i was not hurt somehow i didnt feel it to be a want of confidence it was some other difficultya difficulty i could not resent and it was without the slightest resentment that i said  very well but on that high ground which i will not dispute you like anyone else in such circumstances you must have made for yourself a representation of that exceptional friend a mental image of him andplease tell meyou were not disappointed  what do you mean his personal appearance  i dont mean precisely his good looks or otherwise  we turned at the end of the alley and made a few steps without looking at each other  his appearance is not ordinary said miss haldin at last  no i should have thought notfrom the little youve said of your first impression after all one has to fall back on that word impression what i mean is that something indescribable which is likely to mark a not ordinary person  i perceived that she was not listening there was no mistaking her expression and once more i had the sense of being out of itnot because of my age which at any rate could draw inferencesbut altogether out of it on another plane whence i could only watch her from afar and so ceasing to speak i watched her stepping out by my side  no she exclaimed suddenly i could not have been disappointed with a man of such strong feeling  aha strong feeling i muttered thinking to myself censoriously like this at once all in a moment  what did you say inquired miss haldin innocently  oh nothing i beg your pardon strong feeling i am not surprised  and you dont know how abruptly i behaved to him she cried remorsefully  i suppose i must have appeared surprised for looking at me with a still more heightened colour she said she was ashamed to admit that she had not been sufficiently collected she had failed to control her words and actions as the situation demanded she lost the fortitude worthy of both the men the dead and the living the fortitude which should have been the note of the meeting of victor haldins sister with victor haldins only known friend he was looking at her keenly but said nothing and she wasshe confessedpainfully affected by his want of comprehension all she could say was you are mr razumov a slight frown passed over his forehead after a short watchful pause he made a little bow of assent and waited  at the thought that she had before her the man so highly regarded by her brother the man who had known his value spoken to him understood him had listened to his confidences perhaps had encouraged himher lips trembled her eyes ran full of tears she put out her hand made a step towards him impulsively saying with an effort to restrain her emotion cant you guess who i am he did not take the proffered hand he even recoiled a pace and miss haldin imagined that he was unpleasantly affected miss haldin excused him directing her displeasure at herself she had behaved unworthily like an emotional french girl a manifestation of that kind could not be welcomed by a man of stern selfcontained character  he must have been stern indeed or perhaps very timid with women not to respond in a more human way to the advances of a girl like nathalie haldini thought to myself those lofty and solitary existences i remembered the words suddenly make a young man shy and an old man savageoften  well i encouraged miss haldin to proceed  she was still very dissatisfied with herself  i went from bad to worse she said with an air of discouragement very foreign to her i did everything foolish except actually bursting into tears i am thankful to say i did not do that but i was unable to speak for quite a long time  she had stood before him speechless swallowing her sobs and when she managed at last to utter something it was only her brothers namevictorvictor haldin she gasped out and again her voice failed her  of course she commented to me this distressed him he was quite overcome i have told you my opinion that he is a man of deep feelingit is impossible to doubt it you should have seen his face he positively reeled he leaned against the wall of the terrace their friendship must have been the very brotherhood of souls i was grateful to him for that emotion which made me feel less ashamed of my own lack of selfcontrol of course i had regained the power of speech at once almost all this lasted not more than a few seconds i am his sister i said maybe you have heard of me  and had he i interrupted  i dont know how could it have been otherwise and yet but what does that matter i stood there before him near enough to be touched and surely not looking like an impostor all i know is that he put out both his hands then to me i may say flung them out at me with the greatest readiness and warmth and that i seized and pressed them feeling that i was finding again a little of what i thought was lost to me for ever with the loss of my brothersome of that hope inspiration and support which i used to get from my dear dead  i understood quite well what she meant we strolled on slowly i refrained from looking at her and it was as if answering my own thoughts that i murmured  no doubt it was a great friendshipas you say and that young man ended by welcoming your name so to speak with both hands after that of course you would understand each other yes you would understand each other quickly  it was a moment before i heard her voice  mr razumov seems to be a man of few words a reserved maneven when he is strongly moved  unable to forgetor even to forgivethe basstoned expansiveness of peter ivanovitch the archpatron of revolutionary parties i said that i took this for a favourable trait of character it was associated with sincerityin my mind  and besides we had not much time she added  no you would not have of course my suspicion and even dread of the feminist and his egeria was so ineradicable that i could not help asking with real anxiety which i made smiling  but you escaped all right  she understood me and smiled too at my uneasiness  oh yes i escaped if you like to call it that i walked away quickly there was no need to run i am neither frightened nor yet fascinated like that poor woman who received me so strangely  and mrmr razumov  he remained there of course i suppose he went into the house after i left him you remember that he came here strongly recommended to peter ivanovitchpossibly entrusted with important messages for him  ah yes from that priest who  father zosimyes or from others perhaps  you left him then but have you seen him since may i ask  for some time miss haldin made no answer to this very direct question then  i have been expecting to see him here today she said quietly  you have do you meet then in this garden in that case i had better leave you at once  no why leave me and we dont meet in this garden i have not seen mr razumov since that first time not once but i have been expecting him  she paused i wondered to myself why that young revolutionist should show so little alacrity  before we parted i told mr razumov that i walked here for an hour every day at this time i could not explain to him then why i did not ask him to come and see us at once mother must be prepared for such a visit and then you see i do not know myself what mr razumov has to tell us he too must be told first how it is with poor mother all these thoughts flashed through my mind at once so i told him hurriedly that there was a reason why i could not ask him to see us at home but that i was in the habit of walking here this is a public place but there are never many people about at this hour i thought it would do very well and it is so near our apartments i dont like to be very far away from mother our servant knows where i am in case i should be wanted suddenly  yes it is very convenient from that point of view i agreed  in fact i thought the bastions a very convenient place since the girl did not think it prudent as yet to introduce that young man to her mother it was here then i thought looking round at that plot of ground of deplorable banality that their acquaintance will begin and go on in the exchange of generous indignations and of extreme sentiments too poignant perhaps for a nonrussian mind to conceive i saw these two escaped out of four score of millions of human beings ground between the upper and nether millstone walking under these trees their young heads close together yes an excellent place to stroll and talk in it even occurred to me while we turned once more away from the wide iron gates that when tired they would have plenty of accommodation to rest themselves there was a quantity of tables and chairs displayed between the restaurant chalet and the bandstand a whole raft of painted deals spread out under the trees in the very middle of it i observed a solitary swiss couple whose fate was made secure from the cradle to the grave by the perfected mechanism of democratic institutions in a republic that could almost be held in the palm of ones hand the man colourlessly uncouth was drinking beer out of a glittering glass the woman rustic and placid leaning back in the rough chair gazed idly around  there is little logic to be expected on this earth not only in the matter of thought but also of sentiment i was surprised to discover myself displeased with that unknown young man a week had gone by since they met was he callous or shy or very stupid i could not make it out  do you think i asked miss haldin after we had gone some distance up the great alley that mr razumov understood your intention  understood what i meant she wondered he was greatly moved that i know in my own agitation i could see it but i spoke distinctly he heard me he seemed indeed to hang on my words  unconsciously she had hastened her pace her utterance too became quicker  i waited a little before i observed thoughtfully  and yet he allowed all these days to pass  how can we tell what work he may have to do here he is not an idler travelling for his pleasure his time may not be his ownnor yet his thoughts perhaps  she slowed her pace suddenly and in a lowered voice added  or his very lifethen paused and stood still for all i know he may have had to leave geneva the very day he saw me  without telling you i exclaimed incredulously  i did not give him time i left him quite abruptly i behaved emotionally to the end i am sorry for it even if i had given him the opportunity he would have been justified in taking me for a person not to be trusted an emotional tearful girl is not a person to confide in but even if he has left geneva for a time i am confident that we shall meet again  ah you are confident i dare say but on what ground  because ive told him that i was in great need of some one a fellowcountryman a fellowbeliever to whom i could give my confidence in a certain matter  i see i dont ask you what answer he made i confess that this is good ground for your belief in mr razumovs appearance before long but he has not turned up today  no she said quietly not today and we stood for a time in silence like people that have nothing more to say to each other and let their thoughts run widely asunder before their bodies go off their different ways miss haldin glanced at the watch on her wrist and made a brusque movement she had already overstayed her time it seemed  i dont like to be away from mother she murmured shaking her head it is not that she is very ill now but somehow when i am not with her i am more uneasy than ever  mrs haldin had not made the slightest allusion to her son for the last week or more she sat as usual in the armchair by the window looking out silently on that hopeless stretch of the boulevard des philosophes when she spoke a few lifeless words it was of indifferent trivial things  for anyone who knows what the poor soul is thinking of that sort of talk is more painful than her silence but that is bad too i can hardly endure it and i dare not break it  miss haldin sighed refastening a button of her glove which had come undone i knew well enough what a hard time of it she must be having the stress its causes its nature would have undermined the health of an occidental girl but russian natures have a singular power of resistance against the unfair strains of life straight and supple with a short jacket open on her black dress which made her figure appear more slender and her fresh but colourless face more pale she compelled my wonder and admiration  i cant stay a moment longer you ought to come soon to see mother you know she calls you lami it is an excellent name and she really means it and now au revoir i must run  she glanced vaguely down the broad walkthe hand she put out to me eluded my grasp by an unexpected upward movement and rested upon my shoulder her red lips were slightly parted not in a smile however but expressing a sort of startled pleasure she gazed towards the gates and said quickly with a gasp  there i knew it here he comes  i understood that she must mean mr razumov a young man was walking up the alley without haste his clothes were some dull shade of brown and he carried a stick when my eyes first fell on him his head was hanging on his breast as if in deep thought while i was looking at him he raised it sharply and at once stopped i am certain he did but that pause was nothing more perceptible than a faltering check in his gait instantaneously overcome then he continued his approach looking at us steadily miss haldin signed to me to remain and advanced a step or two to meet him  i turned my head away from that meeting and did not look at them again till i heard miss haldins voice uttering his name in the way of introduction mr razumov was informed in a warm low tone that besides being a wonderful teacher i was a great support in our sorrow and distress  of course i was described also as an englishman miss haldin spoke rapidly faster than i have ever heard her speak and that by contrast made the quietness of her eyes more expressive  i have given him my confidence she added looking all the time at mr razumov that young man did indeed rest his gaze on miss haldin but certainly did not look into her eyes which were so ready for him afterwards he glanced backwards and forwards at us both while the faint commencement of a forced smile followed by the suspicion of a frown vanished one after another i detected them though neither could have been noticed by a person less intensely bent upon divining him than myself i dont know what nathalie haldin had observed but my attention seized the very shades of these movements the attempted smile was given up the incipient frown was checked and smoothed so that there should be no sign but i imagined him exclaiming inwardly  her confidence to this elderly personthis foreigner  i imagined this because he looked foreign enough to me i was upon the whole favourably impressed he had an air of intelligence and even some distinction quite above the average of the students and other inhabitants of the petite russie his features were more decided than in the generality of russian faces he had a line of the jaw a cleanshaven sallow cheek his nose was a ridge and not a mere protuberance he wore the hat well down over his eyes his dark hair curled low on the nape of his neck in the illfitting brown clothes there were sturdy limbs a slight stoop brought out a satisfactory breadth of shoulders upon the whole i was not disappointed studiousrobustshy  before miss haldin had ceased speaking i felt the grip of his hand on mine a muscular firm grip but unexpectedly hot and dry not a word or even a mutter assisted this short and arid handshake  i intended to leave them to themselves but miss haldin touched me lightly on the forearm with a significant contact conveying a distinct wish let him smile who likes but i was only too ready to stay near nathalie haldin and i am not ashamed to say that it was no smiling matter to me i stayed not as a youth would have stayed uplifted as it were poised in the air but soberly with my feet on the ground and my mind trying to penetrate her intention she had turned to razumov  well this is the place yes it is here that i meant you to come i have been walking every day dont excuse yourselfi understand i am grateful to you for coming today but all the same i cannot stay now it is impossible i must hurry off home yes even with you standing before me i must run off i have been too long away you know how it is  these last words were addressed to me i noticed that mr razumov passed the tip of his tongue over his lips just as a parched feverish man might do he took her hand in its black glove which closed on his and held itdetained it quite visibly to me against a drawingback movement  thank you once more forfor understanding me she went on warmly he interrupted her with a certain effect of roughness i didnt like him speaking to this frank creature so much from under the brim of his hat as it were and he produced a faint rasping voice quite like a man with a parched throat  what is there to thank me for understand you how did i understand you you had better know that i understand nothing i was aware that you wanted to see me in this garden i could not come before i was hindered and even today you seelate  she still held his hand  i can at any rate thank you for not dismissing me from your mind as a weak emotional girl no doubt i want sustaining i am very ignorant but i can be trusted indeed i can  you are ignorant he repeated thoughtfully he had raised his head and was looking straight into her face now while she held his hand they stood like this for a long moment she released his hand  yes you did come late it was good of you to come on the chance of me having loitered beyond my time i was talking with this good friend here i was talking of you yes kirylo sidorovitch of you he was with me when i first heard of your being here in geneva he can tell you what comfort it was to my bewildered spirit to hear that news he knew i meant to seek you out it was the only object of my accepting the invitation of peter ivanovitch  peter ivanovitch talked to you of me he interrupted in that wavering hoarse voice which suggested a horribly dry throat  very little just told me your name and that you had arrived here why should i have asked for more what could he have told me that i did not know already from my brothers letter three lines and how much they meant to me i will show them to you one day kirylo sidorovitch but now i must go the first talk between us cannot be a matter of five minutes so we had better not begin  i had been standing a little aside seeing them both in profile at that moment it occurred to me that mr razumovs face was older than his age  if motherthe girl had turned suddenly to me were to wake up in my absence so much longer than usual she would perhaps question me she seems to miss me more you know of late she would want to know what delayed meand you see it would be painful for me to dissemble before her  i understood the point very well for the same reason she checked what seemed to be on mr razumovs part a movement to accompany her  no no i go alone but meet me here as soon as possible then to me in a lower significant tone  mother may be sitting at the window at this moment looking down the street she must not know anything of mr razumovs presence here tilltill something is arranged she paused before she added a little louder but still speaking to me mr razumov does not quite understand my difficulty but you know what it is   v   with a quick inclination of the head for us both and an earnest friendly glance at the young man miss haldin left us covering our heads and looking after her straight supple figure receding rapidly her walk was not that hybrid and uncertain gliding affected by some women but a frank strong healthy movement forward rapidly she increased the distancedisappeared with suddenness at last i discovered only then that mr razumov after ramming his hat well over his brow was looking me over from head to foot i dare say i was a very unexpected fact for that young russian to stumble upon i caught in his physiognomy in his whole bearing an expression compounded of curiosity and scorn tempered by alarmas though he had been holding his breath while i was not looking but his eyes met mine with a gaze direct enough i saw then for the first time that they were of a clear brown colour and fringed with thick black eyelashes they were the youngest feature of his face not at all unpleasant eyes he swayed slightly leaning on his stick and generally hung in the wind it flashed upon me that in leaving us together miss haldin had an intentionthat something was entrusted to me since by a mere accident i had been found at hand on this assumed ground i put all possible friendliness into my manner i cast about for some right thing to say and suddenly in miss haldins last words i perceived the clue to the nature of my mission  no i said gravely if with a smile you cannot be expected to understand  his cleanshaven lip quivered ever so little before he said as if wickedly amused  but havent you heard just now i was thanked by that young lady for understanding so well  i looked at him rather hard was there a hidden and inexplicable sneer in this retort no it was not that it might have been resentment yes but what had he to resent he looked as though he had not slept very well of late i could almost feel on me the weight of his unrefreshed motionless stare the stare of a man who lies unwinking in the dark angrily passive in the toils of disastrous thoughts now when i know how true it was i can honestly affirm that this was the effect he produced on me it was painful in a curiously indefinite wayfor of course the definition comes to me now while i sit writing in the fullness of my knowledge but this is what the effect was at that time of absolute ignorance this new sort of uneasiness which he seemed to be forcing upon me i attempted to put down by assuming a conversational easy familiarity  that extremely charming and essentially admirable young girl i amas you seeold enough to be frank in my expressions was referring to her own feelings surely you must have understood that much  he made such a brusque movement that he even tottered a little  must understand this not expected to understand that i may have other things to do and the girl is charming and admirable welland if she is i suppose i can see that for myself  this sally would have been insulting if his voice had not been practically extinct dried up in his throat and the rustling effort of his speech too painful to give real offence  i remained silent checked between the obvious fact and the subtle impression it was open to me to leave him there and then but the sense of having been entrusted with a mission the suggestion of miss haldins last glance was strong upon me after a moment of reflection i said  shall we walk together a little  he shrugged his shoulders so violently that he tottered again i saw it out of the corner of my eye as i moved on with him at my elbow he had fallen back a little and was practically out of my sight unless i turned my head to look at him i did not wish to indispose him still further by an appearance of marked curiosity it might have been distasteful to such a young and secret refugee from under the pestilential shadow hiding the true kindly face of his land and the shadow the attendant of his countrymen stretching across the middle of europe was lying on him too darkening his figure to my mental vision without doubt i said to myself he seems a sombre even a desperate revolutionist but he is young he may be unselfish and humane capable of compassion of  i heard him clear gratingly his parched throat and became all attention  this is beyond everything were his first words it is beyond everything i find you here for no reason that i can understand in possession of something i cannot be expected to understand a confidant a foreigner talking about an admirable russian girl is the admirable girl a fool i begin to wonder what are you at what is your object  he was barely audible as if his throat had no more resonance than a dry rag a piece of tinder it was so pitiful that i found it extremely easy to control my indignation  when you have lived a little longer mr razumov you will discover that no woman is an absolute fool i am not a feminist like that illustrious author peter ivanovitch who to say the truth is not a little suspect to me  he interrupted me in a surprising note of whispering astonishment  suspect to you peter ivanovitch suspect to you to you  yes in a certain aspect he is i said dismissing my remark lightly as i was saying mr razumov when you have lived long enough you will learn to discriminate between the noble trustfulness of a nature foreign to every meanness and the flattered credulity of some women though even the credulous silly as they may be unhappy as they are sure to be are never absolute fools it is my belief that no woman is ever completely deceived those that are lost leap into the abyss with their eyes open if all the truth were known  upon my word he cried at my elbow what is it to me whether women are fools or lunatics i really dont care what you think of them ii am not interested in them i let them be i am not a young man in a novel how do you know that i want to learn anything about women what is the meaning of all this  the object you mean of this conversation which i admit i have forced upon you in a measure  forced object he repeated still keeping half a pace or so behind me you wanted to talk about women apparently thats a subject but i dont care for it i have never in fact i have had other subjects to think about  i am concerned here with one woman onlya young girlthe sister of your dead friendmiss haldin surely you can think a little of her what i meant from the first was that there is a situation which you cannot be expected to understand  i listened to his unsteady footfalls by my side for the space of several strides  i think that it may prepare the ground for your next interview with miss haldin if i tell you of it i imagine that she might have had something of the kind in her mind when she left us together i believe myself authorized to speak the peculiar situation i have alluded to has arisen in the first grief and distress of victor haldins execution there was something peculiar in the circumstances of his arrest you no doubt know the whole truth  i felt my arm seized above the elbow and next instant found myself swung so as to face mr razumov  you spring up from the ground before me with this talk who the devil are you this is not to be borne why what for what do you know what is or is not peculiar what have you to do with any confounded circumstances or with anything that happens in russia anyway  he leaned on his stick with his other hand heavily and when he let go my arm i was certain in my mind that he was hardly able to keep on his feet  let us sit down at one of these vacant tables i proposed disregarding this display of unexpectedly profound emotion it was not without its effect on me i confess i was sorry for him  what tables what are you talking about ohthe empty tables the tables there certainly i will sit at one of the empty tables  i led him away from the path to the very centre of the raft of deals before the chalet the swiss couple were gone by that time we were alone on the raft so to speak mr razumov dropped into a chair let fall his stick and propped on his elbows his head between his hands stared at me persistently openly and continuously while i signalled the waiter and ordered some beer i could not quarrel with this silent inspection very well because truth to tell i felt somewhat guilty of having been sprung on him with some abruptnessof having sprung from the ground as he expressed it  while waiting to be served i mentioned that born from parents settled in st petersburg i had acquired the language as a child the town i did not remember having left it for good as a boy of nine but in later years i had renewed my acquaintance with the language he listened without as much as moving his eyes the least little bit he had to change his position when the beer came and the instant draining of his glass revived him he leaned back in his chair and folding his arms across his chest continued to stare at me squarely it occurred to me that his cleanshaven almost swarthy face was really of the very mobile sort and that the absolute stillness of it was the acquired habit of a revolutionist of a conspirator everlastingly on his guard against selfbetrayal in a world of secret spies  but you are an englishmana teacher of english literature he murmured in a voice that was no longer issuing from a parched throat i have heard of you people told me you have lived here for years  quite true more than twenty years and i have been assisting miss haldin with her english studies  you have been reading english poetry with her he said immovable now like another man altogether a complete stranger to the man of the heavy and uncertain footfalls a little while agoat my elbow  yes english poetry i said but the trouble of which i speak was caused by an english newspaper  he continued to stare at me i dont think he was aware that the story of the midnight arrest had been ferreted out by an english journalist and given to the world when i explained this to him he muttered contemptuously it may have been altogether a lie  i should think you are the best judge of that i retorted a little disconcerted i must confess that to me it looks to be true in the main  how can you tell truth from lies he queried in his new immovable manner  i dont know how you do it in russia i began rather nettled by his attitude he interrupted me  in russia and in general everywherein a newspaper for instance the colour of the ink and the shapes of the letters are the same  well there are other trifles one can go by the character of the publication the general verisimilitude of the news the consideration of the motive and so on i dont trust blindly the accuracy of special correspondentsbut why should this one have gone to the trouble of concocting a circumstantial falsehood on a matter of no importance to the world  thats what it is he grumbled whats going on with us is of no importancea mere sensational story to amuse the readers of the papersthe superior contemptuous europe it is hateful to think of but let them wait a bit  he broke off on this sort of threat addressed to the western world disregarding the anger in his stare i pointed out that whether the journalist was well or illinformed the concern of the friends of these ladies was with the effect the few lines of print in question had producedthe effect alone and surely he must be counted as one of the friendsif only for the sake of his late comrade and intimate fellowrevolutionist at that point i thought he was going to speak vehemently but he only astounded me by the convulsive start of his whole body he restrained himself folded his loosened arms tighter across his chest and sat back with a smile in which there was a twitch of scorn and malice  yes a comrade and an intimate very well he said  i ventured to speak to you on that assumption and i cannot be mistaken i was present when peter ivanovitch announced your arrival here to miss haldin and i saw her relief and thankfulness when your name was mentioned afterwards she showed me her brothers letter and read out the few words in which he alludes to you what else but a friend could you have been  obviously thats perfectly well known a friend quite correct go on you were talking of some effect  i said to myself he puts on the callousness of a stern revolutionist the insensibility to common emotions of a man devoted to a destructive idea he is young and his sincerity assumes a pose before a stranger a foreigner an old man youth must assert itself as concisely as possible i exposed to him the state of mind poor mrs haldin had been thrown into by the news of her sons untimely end  he listenedi felt itwith profound attention his level stare deflected gradually downwards left my face and rested at last on the ground at his feet  you can enter into the sisters feelings as you said i have only read a little english poetry with her and i wont make myself ridiculous in your eyes by trying to speak of her but you have seen her she is one of these rare human beings that do not want explaining at least i think so they had only that son that brother for a link with the wider world with the future the very groundwork of active existence for nathalie haldin is gone with him can you wonder then that she turns with eagerness to the only man her brother mentions in his letters your name is a sort of legacy  what could he have written of me he cried in a low exasperated tone  only a few words it is not for me to repeat them to you mr razumov but you may believe my assertion that these words are forcible enough to make both his mother and his sister believe implicitly in the worth of your judgment and in the truth of anything you may have to say to them its impossible for you now to pass them by like strangers  i paused and for a moment sat listening to the footsteps of the few people passing up and down the broad central walk while i was speaking his head had sunk upon his breast above his folded arms he raised it sharply  must i go then and lie to that old woman  it was not anger it was something else something more poignant and not so simple i was aware of it sympathetically while i was profoundly concerned at the nature of that exclamation  dear me wont the truth do then i hoped you could have told them something consoling i am thinking of the poor mother now your russia is a cruel country  he moved a little in his chair  yes i repeated i thought you would have had something authentic to tell  the twitching of his lips before he spoke was curious  what if it is not worth telling  not worthfrom what point of view i dont understand  from every point of view  i spoke with some asperity  i should think that anything which could explain the circumstances of that midnight arrest  reported by a journalist for the amusement of the civilized europe he broke in scornfully  yes reported but arent they true i cant make out your attitude in this either the man is a hero to you or  he approached his face with fiercely distended nostrils close to mine so suddenly that i had the greatest difficulty in not starting back  you ask me i suppose it amuses you all this look here i am a worker i studied yes i studied very hard there is intelligence here he tapped his forehead with his fingertips dont you think a russian may have sane ambitions yesi had even prospects certainly i had and now you see me here abroad everything gone lost sacrificed you see me hereand you ask you see me dont yousitting before you  he threw himself back violently i kept outwardly calm  yes i see you here and i assume you are here on account of the haldin affair  his manner changed  you call it the haldin affairdo you he observed indifferently  i have no right to ask you anything i said i wouldnt presume but in that case the mother and the sister of him who must be a hero in your eyes cannot be indifferent to you the girl is a frank and generous creature having the noblestwellillusions you will tell her nothingor you will tell her everything but speaking now of the object with which ive approached you first we have to deal with the morbid state of the mother perhaps something could be invented under your authority as a cure for a distracted and suffering soul filled with maternal affection  his air of weary indifference was accentuated i could not help thinking wilfully  oh yes something might he mumbled carelessly  he put his hand over his mouth to conceal a yawn when he uncovered his lips they were smiling faintly  pardon me this has been a long conversation and i have not had much sleep the last two nights  this unexpected somewhat insolent sort of apology had the merit of being perfectly true he had had no nightly rest to speak of since that day when in the grounds of the chateau borel the sister of victor haldin had appeared before him the perplexities and the complex terrorsi may sayof this sleeplessness are recorded in the document i was to see laterthe document which is the main source of this narrative at the moment he looked to me convincingly tired gone slack all over like a man who has passed through some sort of crisis  i have had a lot of urgent writing to do he added  i rose from my chair at once and he followed my example without haste a little heavily  i must apologize for detaining you so long i said  why apologize one cant very well go to bed before night and you did not detain me i could have left you at any time  i had not stayed with him to be offended  i am glad you have been sufficiently interested i said calmly no merit of mine thoughthe commonest sort of regard for the mother of your friend was enough as to miss haldin herself she at one time was disposed to think that her brother had been betrayed to the police in some way  to my great surprise mr razumov sat down again suddenly i stared at him and i must say that he returned my stare without winking for quite a considerable time  in some way he mumbled as if he had not understood or could not believe his ears  some unforeseen event a sheer accident might have done that i went on or as she characteristically put it to me the folly or weakness of some unhappy fellowrevolutionist  folly or weakness he repeated bitterly  she is a very generous creature i observed after a time the man admired by victor haldin fixed his eyes on the ground i turned away and moved off apparently unnoticed by him i nourished no resentment of the moody brusqueness with which he had treated me the sentiment i was carrying away from that conversation was that of hopelessness before i had got fairly clear of the raft of chairs and tables he had rejoined me  hm yes i heard him at my elbow again but what do you think  i did not look round even  i think that you people are under a curse  he made no sound it was only on the pavement outside the gate that i heard him again  i should like to walk with you a little  after all i preferred this enigmatical young man to his celebrated compatriot the great peter ivanovitch but i saw no reason for being particularly gracious  i am going now to the railway station by the shortest way from here to meet a friend from england i said for all answer to his unexpected proposal i hoped that something informing could come of it as we stood on the curbstone waiting for a tramcar to pass he remarked gloomily  i like what you said just now  do you  we stepped off the pavement together  the great problem he went on is to understand thoroughly the nature of the curse  thats not very difficult i think  i think so too he agreed with me and his readiness strangely enough did not make him less enigmatical in the least  a curse is an evil spell i tried him again and the important the great problem is to find the means to break it  yes to find the means  that was also an assent but he seemed to be thinking of something else we had crossed diagonally the open space before the theatre and began to descend a broad sparely frequented street in the direction of one of the smaller bridges he kept on by my side without speaking for a long time  you are not thinking of leaving geneva soon i asked  he was silent for so long that i began to think i had been indiscreet and should get no answer at all yet on looking at him i almost believed that my question had caused him something in the nature of positive anguish i detected it mainly in the clasping of his hands in which he put a great force stealthily once however he had overcome that sort of agonizing hesitation sufficiently to tell me that he had no such intention he became rather communicativeat least relatively to the former offhand curtness of his speeches the tone too was more amiable he informed me that he intended to study and also to write he went even so far as to tell me he had been to stuttgart stuttgart i was aware was one of the revolutionary centres the directing committee of one of the russian parties i cant tell now which was located in that town it was there that he got into touch with the active work of the revolutionists outside russia  i have never been abroad before he explained in a rather inanimate voice now then after a slight hesitation altogether different from the agonizing irresolution my first simple question whether he meant to stay in geneva had aroused he made me an unexpected confidence  the fact is i have received a sort of mission from them  which will keep you here in geneva  yes here in this odious  i was satisfied with my faculty for putting two and two together when i drew the inference that the mission had something to do with the person of the great peter ivanovitch but i kept that surmise to myself naturally and mr razumov said nothing more for some considerable time it was only when we were nearly on the bridge we had been making for that he opened his lips again abruptly  could i see that precious article anywhere  i had to think for a moment before i saw what he was referring to  it has been reproduced in parts by the press here there are files to be seen in various places my copy of the english newspaper i have left with miss haldin i remember on the day after it reached me i was sufficiently worried by seeing it lying on a table by the side of the poor mothers chair for weeks then it disappeared it was a relief i assure you  he had stopped short  i trust i continued that you will find time to see these ladies fairly oftenthat you will make time  he stared at me so queerly that i hardly know how to define his aspect i could not understand it in this connexion at all what ailed him i asked myself what strange thought had come into his head what vision of all the horrors that can be seen in his hopeless country had come suddenly to haunt his brain if it were anything connected with the fate of victor haldin then i hoped earnestly he would keep it to himself for ever i was to speak plainly so shocked that i tried to conceal my impression byheaven forgive mea smile and the assumption of a light manner  surely i exclaimed that neednt cost you a great effort  he turned away from me and leaned over the parapet of the bridge for a moment i waited looking at his back and yet i assure you i was not anxious just then to look at his face again he did not move at all he did not mean to move i walked on slowly on my way towards the station and at the end of the bridge i glanced over my shoulder no he had not moved he hung well over the parapet as if captivated by the smooth rush of the blue water under the arch the current there is swift extremely swift it makes some people dizzy i myself can never look at it for any length of time without experiencing a dread of being suddenly snatched away by its destructive force some brains cannot resist the suggestion of irresistible power and of headlong motion  it apparently had a charm for mr razumov i left him hanging far over the parapet of the bridge the way he had behaved to me could not be put down to mere boorishness there was something else under his scorn and impatience perhaps i thought with sudden approach to hidden truth it was the same thing which had kept him over a week nearly ten days indeed from coming near miss haldin but what it was i could not tell    part third    i   the water under the bridge ran violent and deep its slightly undulating rush seemed capable of scouring out a channel for itself through solid granite while you looked but had it flowed through razumovs breast it could not have washed away the accumulated bitterness the wrecking of his life had deposited there  what is the meaning of all this he thought staring downwards at the headlong flow so smooth and clean that only the passage of a faint airbubble or a thin vanishing streak of foam like a white hair disclosed its vertiginous rapidity its terrible force why has that meddlesome old englishman blundered against me and what is this silly tale of a crazy old woman  he was trying to think brutally on purpose but he avoided any mental reference to the young girl a crazy old woman he repeated to himself it is a fatality or ought i to despise all this as absurd but no i am wrong i cant afford to despise anything an absurdity may be the startingpoint of the most dangerous complications how is one to guard against it it puts to rout ones intelligence the more intelligent one is the less one suspects an absurdity  a wave of wrath choked his thoughts for a moment it even made his body leaning over the parapet quiver then he resumed his silent thinking like a secret dialogue with himself and even in that privacy his thought had some reservations of which he was vaguely conscious  after all this is not absurd it is insignificant it is absolutely insignificantabsolutely the craze of an old womanthe fussy officiousness of a blundering elderly englishman what devil put him in the way havent i treated him cavalierly enough havent i just thats the way to treat these meddlesome persons is it possible that he still stands behind my back waiting  razumov felt a faint chill run down his spine it was not fear he was certain that it was not fearnot fear for himselfbut it was all the same a sort of apprehension as if for another for some one he knew without being able to put a name on the personality but the recollection that the officious englishman had a train to meet tranquillized him for a time it was too stupid to suppose that he should be wasting his time in waiting it was unnecessary to look round and make sure  but what did the man mean by his extraordinary rigmarole about the newspaper and that crazy old woman he thought suddenly it was a damnable presumption anyhow something that only an englishman could be capable of all this was a sort of sport for himthe sport of revolutiona game to look at from the height of his superiority and what on earth did he mean by his exclamation wont the truth do  razumov pressed his folded arms to the stone coping over which he was leaning with force wont the truth do the truth for the crazy old mother of the  the young man shuddered again yes the truth would do apparently it would do exactly and receive thanks he thought formulating the unspoken words cynically fall on my neck in gratitude no doubt he jeered mentally but this mood abandoned him at once he felt sad as if his heart had become empty suddenly well i must be cautious he concluded coming to himself as though his brain had been awakened from a trance there is nothing no one too insignificant too absurd to be disregarded he thought wearily i must be cautious  razumov pushed himself with his hand away from the balustrade and retracing his steps along the bridge walked straight to his lodgings where for a few days he led a solitary and retired existence he neglected peter ivanovitch to whom he was accredited by the stuttgart group he never went near the refugee revolutionists to whom he had been introduced on his arrival he kept out of that world altogether and he felt that such conduct causing surprise and arousing suspicion contained an element of danger for himself  this is not to say that during these few days he never went out i met him several times in the streets but he gave me no recognition once going home after an evening call on the ladies haldin i saw him crossing the dark roadway of the boulevard des philosophes he had a broadbrimmed soft hat and the collar of his coat turned up i watched him make straight for the house but instead of going in he stopped opposite the still lighted windows and after a time went away down a sidestreet  i knew that he had not been to see mrs haldin yet miss haldin told me he was reluctant moreover the mental condition of mrs haldin had changed she seemed to think now that her son was living and she perhaps awaited his arrival her immobility in the great armchair in front of the window had an air of expectancy even when the blind was down and the lamps lighted  for my part i was convinced that she had received her deathstroke miss haldin to whom of course i said nothing of my forebodings thought that no good would come from introducing mr razumov just then an opinion which i shared fully i knew that she met the young man on the bastions once or twice i saw them strolling slowly up the main alley they met every day for weeks i avoided passing that way during the hour when miss haldin took her exercise there one day however in a fit of absentmindedness i entered the gates and came upon her walking alone i stopped to exchange a few words mr razumov failed to turn up and we began to talk about himnaturally  did he tell you anything definite about your brothers activitieshis end i ventured to ask  no admitted miss haldin with some hesitation nothing definite  i understood well enough that all their conversations must have been referred mentally to that dead man who had brought them together that was unavoidable but it was in the living man that she was interested that was unavoidable too i suppose and as i pushed my inquiries i discovered that he had disclosed himself to her as a by no means conventional revolutionist contemptuous of catchwords of theories of men too i was rather pleased at thatbut i was a little puzzled  his mind goes forward far ahead of the struggle miss haldin explained of course he is an actual worker too she added  and do you understand him i inquired pointblank  she hesitated again not altogether she murmured  i perceived that he had fascinated her by an assumption of mysterious reserve  do you know what i think she went on breaking through her reserved almost reluctant attitude i think that he is observing studying me to discover whether i am worthy of his trust  and that pleases you  she kept mysteriously silent for a moment then with energy but in a confidential tone  i am convinced she declared that this extraordinary man is meditating some vast plan some great undertaking he is possessed by ithe suffers from itand from being alone in the world  and so hes looking for helpers i commented turning away my head  again there was a silence  why not she said at last  the dead brother the dying mother the foreign friend had fallen into a distant background but at the same time peter ivanovitch was absolutely nowhere now and this thought consoled me yet i saw the gigantic shadow of russian life deepening around her like the darkness of an advancing night it would devour her presently i inquired after mrs haldinthat other victim of the deadly shade  a remorseful uneasiness appeared in her frank eyes mother seemed no worse but if i only knew what strange fancies she had sometimes then miss haldin glancing at her watch declared that she could not stay a moment longer and with a hasty handshake ran off lightly  decidedly mr razumov was not to turn up that day incomprehensible youth  but less than an hour afterwards while crossing the place mollard i caught sight of him boarding a south shore tramcar  hes going to the chateau borel i thought   after depositing razumov at the gates of the chateau borel some half a mile or so from the town the car continued its journey between two straight lines of shady trees across the roadway in the sunshine a short wooden pier jutted into the shallow pale water which farther out had an intense blue tint contrasting unpleasantly with the green orderly slopes on the opposite shore the whole view with the harbour jetties of white stone underlining lividly the dark front of the town to the left and the expanding space of water to the right with jutting promontories of no particular character had the uninspiring glittering quality of a very fresh oleograph razumov turned his back on it with contempt he thought it odiousoppressively odiousin its unsuggestive finish the very perfection of mediocrity attained at last after centuries of toil and culture and turning his back on it he faced the entrance to the grounds of the chateau borel  the bars of the central way and the wroughtiron arch between the dark weatherstained stone piers were very rusty and though fresh tracks of wheels ran under it the gate looked as if it had not been opened for a very long time but close against the lodge built of the same grey stone as the piers its windows were all boarded up there was a small side entrance the bars of that were rusty too it stood ajar and looked as though it had not been closed for a long time in fact razumov trying to push it open a little wider discovered it was immovable  democratic virtue there are no thieves here apparently he muttered to himself with displeasure before advancing into the grounds he looked back sourly at an idle working man lounging on a bench in the clean broad avenue the fellow had thrown his feet up one of his arms hung over the low back of the public seat he was taking a day off in lordly repose as if everything in sight belonged to him  elector eligible enlightened razumov muttered to himself a brute all the same  razumov entered the grounds and walked fast up the wide sweep of the drive trying to think of nothingto rest his head to rest his emotions too but arriving at the foot of the terrace before the house he faltered affected physically by some invisible interference the mysteriousness of his quickened heartbeats startled him he stopped short and looked at the brick wall of the terrace faced with shallow arches meagrely clothed by a few unthriving creepers with an illkept narrow flowerbed along its foot  it is here he thought with a sort of awe it is hereon this very spot  he was tempted to flight at the mere recollection of his first meeting with nathalie haldin he confessed it to himself but he did not move and that not because he wished to resist an unworthy weakness but because he knew that he had no place to fly to moreover he could not leave geneva he recognized even without thinking that it was impossible it would have been a fatal admission an act of moral suicide it would have been also physically dangerous slowly he ascended the stairs of the terrace flanked by two stained greenish stone urns of funereal aspect  across the broad platform where a few blades of grass sprouted on the discoloured gravel the door of the house with its groundfloor windows shuttered faced him wide open he believed that his approach had been noted because framed in the doorway without his tall hat peter ivanovitch seemed to be waiting for his approach  the ceremonious black frockcoat and the bared head of europes greatest feminist accentuated the dubiousness of his status in the house rented by madame de s his egeria his aspect combined the formality of the caller with the freedom of the proprietor florid and bearded and masked by the dark blue glasses he met the visitor and at once took him familiarly under the arm  razumov suppressed every sign of repugnance by an effort which the constant necessity of prudence had rendered almost mechanical and this necessity had settled his expression in a cast of austere almost fanatical aloofness the heroic fugitive impressed afresh by the severe detachment of this new arrival from revolutionary russia took a conciliatory even a confidential tone madame de s was resting after a bad night she often had bad nights he had left his hat upstairs on the landing and had come down to suggest to his young friend a stroll and a good openhearted talk in one of the shady alleys behind the house after voicing this proposal the great man glanced at the unmoved face by his side and could not restrain himself from exclaiming  on my word young man you are an extraordinary person  i fancy you are mistaken peter ivanovitch if i were really an extraordinary person i would not be here walking with you in a garden in switzerland canton of geneva commune ofwhats the name of the commune this place belongs to never mindthe heart of democracy anyhow a fit heart for it no bigger than a parched pea and about as much value i am no more extraordinary than the rest of us russians wandering abroad  but peter ivanovitch dissented emphatically  no no you are not ordinary i have some experience of russians who arewellliving abroad you appear to me and to others too a marked personality  what does he mean by this razumov asked himself turning his eyes fully on his companion the face of peter ivanovitch expressed a meditative seriousness  you dont suppose kirylo sidorovitch that i have not heard of you from various points where you made yourself known on your way here i have had letters  oh we are great in talking about each other interjected razumov who had listened with great attention gossip tales suspicions and all that sort of thing we know how to deal in to perfection calumny even  in indulging in this sally razumov managed very well to conceal the feeling of anxiety which had come over him at the same time he was saying to himself that there could be no earthly reason for anxiety he was relieved by the evident sincerity of the protesting voice  heavens cried peter ivanovitch what are you talking about what reason can you have to  the great exile flung up his arms as if words had failed him in sober truth razumov was satisfied yet he was moved to continue in the same vein  i am talking of the poisonous plants which flourish in the world of conspirators like evil mushrooms in a dark cellar  you are casting aspersions remonstrated peter ivanovitch which as far as you are concerned  no razumov interrupted without heat indeed i dont want to cast aspersions but its just as well to have no illusions  peter ivanovitch gave him an inscrutable glance of his dark spectacles accompanied by a faint smile  the man who says that he has no illusions has at least that one he said in a very friendly tone but i see how it is kirylo sidorovitch you aim at stoicism  stoicism thats a pose of the greeks and the romans lets leave it to them we are russians that ischildren that issincere that iscynical if you like but thats not a pose  a long silence ensued they strolled slowly under the limetrees peter ivanovitch had put his hands behind his back razumov felt the ungravelled ground of the deeply shaded walk damp and as if slippery under his feet he asked himself with uneasiness if he were saying the right things the direction of the conversation ought to have been more under his control he reflected the great man appeared to be reflecting on his side too he cleared his throat slightly and razumov felt at once a painful reawakening of scorn and fear  i am astonished began peter ivanovitch gently supposing you are right in your indictment how can you raise any question of calumny or gossip in your case it is unreasonable the fact is kirylo sidorovitch there is not enough known of you to give hold to gossip or even calumny just now you are a man associated with a great deed which had been hoped for and tried for too without success people have perished for attempting that which you and haldin have done at last you come to us out of russia with that prestige but you cannot deny that you have not been communicative kirylo sidorovitch people you have met imparted their impressions to me one wrote this another that but i form my own opinions i waited to see you first you are a man out of the common thats positively so you are close very close this taciturnity this severe brow this something inflexible and secret in you inspires hopes and a little wonder as to what you may mean there is something of a brutus  pray spare me those classical allusions burst out razumov nervously what comes junius brutus to do here it is ridiculous do you mean to say he added sarcastically but lowering his voice that the russian revolutionists are all patricians and that i am an aristocrat  peter ivanovitch who had been helping himself with a few gestures clasped his hands again behind his back and made a few steps pondering  not all patricians he muttered at last but you at any rate are one of us  razumov smiled bitterly  to be sure my name is not gugenheimer he said in a sneering tone i am not a democratic jew how can i help it not everybody has such luck i have no name i have no  the european celebrity showed a great concern he stepped back a pace and his arms flew in front of his person extended deprecatory almost entreating his deep bass voice was full of pain  but my dear young friend he cried my dear kirylo sidorovitch  razumov shook his head  the very patronymic you are so civil as to use when addressing me i have no legal right tobut what of that i dont wish to claim it i have no father so much the better but i will tell you what my mothers grandfather was a peasanta serf see how much i am one of you i dont want anyone to claim me but russia cant disown me she cannot  razumov struck his breast with his fist  i am it  peter ivanovitch walked on slowly his head lowered razumov followed vexed with himself that was not the right sort of talk all sincerity was an imprudence yet one could not renounce truth altogether he thought with despair peter ivanovitch meditating behind his dark glasses became to him suddenly so odious that if he had had a knife he fancied he could have stabbed him not only without compunction but with a horrible triumphant satisfaction his imagination dwelt on that atrocity in spite of himself it was as if he were becoming lightheaded it is not what is expected of me he repeated to himself it is not what isi could get away by breaking the fastening on the little gate i see there in the back wall it is a flimsy lock nobody in the house seems to know he is here with me oh yes the hat these women would discover presently the hat he has left on the landing they would come upon him lying dead in this damp gloomy shadebut i would be gone and no one could everlord am i going mad he asked himself in a fright  the great man was heardmusing in an undertone  hm yes thatno doubtin a certain sense he raised his voice there is a deal of pride about you  the intonation of peter ivanovitch took on a homely familiar ring acknowledging in a way razumovs claim to peasant descent  a great deal of pride brother kirylo and i dont say that you have no justification for it i have admitted you had i have ventured to allude to the facts of your birth simply because i attach no mean importance to it you are one of usun des notres i reflect on that with satisfaction  i attach some importance to it also said razumov quietly i wont even deny that it may have some importance for you too he continued after a slight pause and with a touch of grimness of which he was himself aware with some annoyance he hoped it had escaped the perception of peter ivanovitch but suppose we talk no more about it  well we shall notnot after this one time kirylo sidorovitch persisted the noble archpriest of revolution this shall be the last occasion you cannot believe for a moment that i had the slightest idea of wounding your feelings you are clearly a superior naturethats how i read you quite above the commonhmsusceptibilities but the fact is kirylo sidorovitch i dont know your susceptibilities nobody out of russia knows much of youas yet  you have been watching me suggested razumov  yes  the great man had spoken in a tone of perfect frankness but as they turned their faces to each other razumov felt baffled by the dark spectacles under their cover peter ivanovitch hinted that he had felt for some time the need of meeting a man of energy and character in view of a certain project he said nothing more precise however and after some critical remarks upon the personalities of the various members of the committee of revolutionary action in stuttgart he let the conversation lapse for quite a long while they paced the alley from end to end razumov silent too raised his eyes from time to time to cast a glance at the back of the house it offered no sign of being inhabited with its grimy weatherstained walls and all the windows shuttered from top to bottom it looked damp and gloomy and deserted it might very well have been haunted in traditional style by some doleful groaning futile ghost of a middleclass order the shades evoked as worldly rumour had it by madame de s to meet statesmen diplomatists deputies of various european parliaments must have been of another sort razumov had never seen madame de s but in the carriage  peter ivanovitch came out of his abstraction  two things i may say to you at once i believe first that neither a leader nor any decisive action can come out of the dregs of a people now if you ask me what are the dregs of a peoplehmit would take too long to tell you would be surprised at the variety of ingredients that for me go to the making up of these dregsof that which ought must remain at the bottom moreover such a statement might be subject to discussion but i can tell you what is not the dregs on that it is impossible for us to disagree the peasantry of a people is not the dregs neither is its highest classwellthe nobility reflect on that kirylo sidorovitch i believe you are well fitted for reflection everything in a people that is not genuine not its own by origin or development iswelldirt intelligence in the wrong place is that foreignbred doctrines are that dirt dregs the second thing i would offer to your meditation is this that for us at this moment there yawns a chasm between the past and the future it can never be bridged by foreign liberalism all attempts at it are either folly or cheating bridged it can never be it has to be filled up  a sort of sinister jocularity had crept into the tones of the burly feminist he seized razumovs arm above the elbow and gave it a slight shake  do you understand enigmatical young man it has got to be just filled up  razumov kept an unmoved countenance  dont you think that i have already gone beyond meditation on that subject he said freeing his arm by a quiet movement which increased the distance a little between himself and peter ivanovitch as they went on strolling abreast and he added that surely whole cartloads of words and theories could never fill that chasm no meditation was necessary a sacrifice of many lives could alonehe fell silent without finishing the phrase  peter ivanovitch inclined his big hairy head slowly after a moment he proposed that they should go and see if madame de s was now visible  we shall get some tea he said turning out of the shaded gloomy walk with a brisker step  the lady companion had been on the look out her dark skirt whisked into the doorway as the two men came in sight round the corner she ran off somewhere altogether and had disappeared when they entered the hall in the crude light falling from the dusty glass skylight upon the black and white tessellated floor covered with muddy tracks their footsteps echoed faintly the great feminist led the way up the stairs on the balustrade of the firstfloor landing a shiny tall hat reposed rim upwards opposite the double door of the drawingroom haunted it was said by evoked ghosts and frequented it was to be supposed by fugitive revolutionists the cracked white paint of the panels the tarnished gilt of the mouldings permitted one to imagine nothing but dust and emptiness within before turning the massive brass handle peter ivanovitch gave his young companion a sharp partly critical partly preparatory glance  no one is perfect he murmured discreetly thus the possessor of a rare jewel might before opening the casket warn the profane that no gem perhaps is flawless  he remained with his hand on the doorhandle so long that razumov assented by a moody no  perfection itself would not produce that effect pursued peter ivanovitch in a world not meant for it but you shall find there a mindnothe quintessence of feminine intuition which will understand any perplexity you may be suffering from by the irresistible enlightening force of sympathy nothing can remain obscure before thatthatinspired yes inspired penetration this true light of femininity  the gaze of the dark spectacles in its glossy steadfastness gave his face an air of absolute conviction razumov felt a momentary shrinking before that closed door  penetration light he stammered out do you mean some sort of thoughtreading  peter ivanovitch seemed shocked  i mean something utterly different he retorted with a faint pitying smile  razumov began to feel angry very much against his wish  this is very mysterious he muttered through his teeth  you dont object to being understood to being guided queried the great feminist razumov exploded in a fierce whisper  in what sense be pleased to understand that i am a serious person who do you take me for  they looked at each other very closely razumovs temper was cooled by the impenetrable earnestness of the blue glasses meeting his stare peter ivanovitch turned the handle at last  you shall know directly he said pushing the door open  a lowpitched grating voice was heard within the room  enfin  in the doorway his blackcoated bulk blocking the view peter ivanovitch boomed in a hearty tone with something boastful in it  yes here i am  he glanced over his shoulder at razumov who waited for him to move on  and i am bringing you a proved conspiratora real one this time un vrai celui la  this pause in the doorway gave the proved conspirator time to make sure that his face did not betray his angry curiosity and his mental disgust  these sentiments stand confessed in mr razumovs memorandum of his first interview with madame de s the very words i use in my narrative are written where their sincerity cannot be suspected the record which could not have been meant for anyones eyes but his own was not i think the outcome of that strange impulse of indiscretion common to men who lead secret lives and accounting for the invariable existence of compromising documents in all the plots and conspiracies of history mr razumov looked at it i suppose as a man looks at himself in a mirror with wonder perhaps with anguish with anger or despair yes as a threatened man may look fearfully at his own face in the glass formulating to himself reassuring excuses for his appearance marked by the taint of some insidious hereditary disease   ii   the egeria of the russian mazzini produced at first view a strong effect by the deathlike immobility of an obviously painted face the eyes appeared extraordinarily brilliant the figure in a closefitting dress admirably made but by no means fresh had an elegant stiffness the rasping voice inviting him to sit down the rigidity of the upright attitude with one arm extended along the back of the sofa the white gleam of the big eyeballs setting off the black fathomless stare of the enlarged pupils impressed razumov more than anything he had seen since his hasty and secret departure from st petersburg a witch in parisian clothes he thought a portent he actually hesitated in his advance and did not even comprehend at first what the rasping voice was saying  sit down draw your chair nearer me there  he sat down at close quarters the rouged cheekbones the wrinkles the fine lines on each side of the vivid lips astounded him he was being received graciously with a smile which made him think of a grinning skull  we have been hearing about you for some time  he did not know what to say and murmured some disconnected words the grinning skull effect vanished  and do you know that the general complaint is that you have shown yourself very reserved everywhere  razumov remained silent for a time thinking of his answer  i dont you see am a man of action he said huskily glancing upwards  peter ivanovitch stood in portentous expectant silence by the side of his chair a slight feeling of nausea came over razumov what could be the relations of these two people to each other she like a galvanized corpse out of some hoffmans talehe the preacher of feminist gospel for all the world and a superrevolutionist besides this ancient painted mummy with unfathomable eyes and this burly bullnecked deferentialwhat was it witchcraft fascination its for her money he thought she has millions  the walls the floor of the room were bare like a barn the few pieces of furniture had been discovered in the garrets and dragged down into service without having been properly dusted even it was the refuse the bankers widow had left behind her the windows without curtains had an indigent sleepless look in two of them the dirty yellowywhite blinds had been pulled down all this spoke not of poverty but of sordid penuriousness  the hoarse voice on the sofa uttered angrily  you are looking round kirylo sidorovitch i have been shamefully robbed positively ruined  a rattling laugh which seemed beyond her control interrupted her for a moment  a slavish nature would find consolation in the fact that the principal robber was an exalted and almost a sacrosanct persona grand duke in fact do you understand mr razumov a grand dukeno you have no idea what thieves those people are downright thieves  her bosom heaved but her left arm remained rigidly extended along the back of the couch  you will only upset yourself breathed out a deep voice which to razumovs startled glance seemed to proceed from under the steady spectacles of peter ivanovitch rather than from his lips which had hardly moved  what of hat i say thieves voleurs voleurs  razumov was quite confounded by this unexpected clamour which had in it something of wailing and croaking and more than a suspicion of hysteria  voleurs voleurs vol  no power on earth can rob you of your genius shouted peter ivanovitch in an overpowering bass but without stirring without a gesture of any kind a profound silence fell  razumov remained outwardly impassive what is the meaning of this performance he was asking himself but with a preliminary sound of bumping outside some door behind him the lady companion in a threadbare black skirt and frayed blouse came in rapidly walking on her heels and carrying in both hands a big russian samovar obviously too heavy for her razumov made an instinctive movement to help which startled her so much that she nearly dropped her hissing burden she managed however to land it on the table and looked so frightened that razumov hastened to sit down she produced then from an adjacent room four glass tumblers a teapot and a sugarbasin on a black iron tray  the rasping voice asked from the sofa abruptly  les gateaux have you remembered to bring the cakes  peter ivanovitch without a word marched out on to the landing and returned instantly with a parcel wrapped up in white glazed paper which he must have extracted from the interior of his hat with imperturbable gravity he undid the string and smoothed the paper open on a part of the table within reach of madame de ss hand the lady companion poured out the tea then retired into a distant corner out of everybodys sight from time to time madame de s extended a clawlike hand glittering with costly rings towards the paper of cakes took up one and devoured it displaying her big false teeth ghoulishly meantime she talked in a hoarse tone of the political situation in the balkans she built great hopes on some complication in the peninsula for arousing a great movement of national indignation in russia against these thievesthieves thieves  you will only upset yourself peter ivanovitch interposed raising his glassy gaze he smoked cigarettes and drank tea in silence continuously when he had finished a glass he flourished his hand above his shoulder at that signal the lady companion ensconced in her corner with round eyes like a watchful animal would dart out to the table and pour him out another tumblerful  razumov looked at her once or twice she was anxious tremulous though neither madame de s nor peter ivanovitch paid the slightest attention to her what have they done between them to that forlorn creature razumov asked himself have they terrified her out of her senses with ghosts or simply have they only been beating her when she gave him his second glass of tea he noticed that her lips trembled in the manner of a scared person about to burst into speech but of course she said nothing and retired into her corner as if hugging to herself the smile of thanks he gave her  she may be worth cultivating thought razumov suddenly  he was calming down getting hold of the actuality into which he had been thrownfor the first time perhaps since victor haldin had entered his roomand had gone out again he was distinctly aware of being the object of the famousor notoriousmadame de ss ghastly graciousness  madame de s was pleased to discover that this young man was different from the other types of revolutionist members of committees secret emissaries vulgar and unmannerly fugitive professors rough students excobblers with apostolic faces consumptive and ragged enthusiasts hebrew youths common fellows of all sorts that used to come and go around peter ivanovitchfanatics pedants proletarians all it was pleasant to talk to this young man of notably good appearancefor madame de s was not always in a mystical state of mind razumovs taciturnity only excited her to a quicker more voluble utterance it still dealt with the balkans she knew all the statesmen of that region turks bulgarians montenegrins roumanians greeks armenians and nondescripts young and old the living and the dead with some money an intrigue could be started which would set the peninsula in a blaze and outrage the sentiment of the russian people a cry of abandoned brothers could be raised and then with the nation seething with indignation a couple of regiments or so would be enough to begin a military revolution in st petersburg and make an end of these thieves  apparently ive got only to sit still and listen the silent razumov thought to himself as to that hairy and obscene brute in such terms did mr razumov refer mentally to the popular expounder of a feministic conception of social state as to him for all his cunning he too shall speak out some day  razumov ceased to think for a moment then a sombretoned reflection formulated itself in his mind ironical and bitter i have the gift of inspiring confidence he heard himself laughing aloud it was like a goad to the painted shinyeyed harridan on the sofa  you may well laugh she cried hoarsely what else can one do perfect swindlersand what base swindlers at that cheap germansholsteingottorps though indeed its hardly safe to say who and what they are a family that counts a creature like catherine the great in its ancestryyou understand  you are only upsetting yourself said peter ivanovitch patiently but in a firm tone this admonition had its usual effect on the egeria she dropped her thick discoloured eyelids and changed her position on the sofa all her angular and lifeless movements seemed completely automatic now that her eyes were closed presently she opened them very full peter ivanovitch drank tea steadily without haste  well i declare she addressed razumov directly the people who have seen you on your way here are right you are very reserved you havent said twenty words altogether since you came in you let nothing of your thoughts be seen in your face either  i have been listening madame said razumov using french for the first time hesitatingly not being certain of his accent but it seemed to produce an excellent impression madame de s looked meaningly into peter ivanovitchs spectacles as if to convey her conviction of this young mans merit she even nodded the least bit in his direction and razumov heard her murmur under her breath the words later on in the diplomatic service which could not but refer to the favourable impression he had made the fantastic absurdity of it revolted him because it seemed to outrage his ruined hopes with the vision of a mockcareer peter ivanovitch impassive as though he were deaf drank some more tea razumov felt that he must say something  yes he began deliberately as if uttering a meditated opinion clearly even in planning a purely military revolution the temper of the people should be taken into account  you have understood me perfectly the discontent should be spiritualized that is what the ordinary heads of revolutionary committees will not understand they arent capable of it for instance mordatiev was in geneva last month peter ivanovitch brought him here you know mordatiev well yesyou have heard of him they call him an eaglea hero he has never done half as much as you have never attemptednot half  madame de s agitated herself angularly on the sofa  we of course talked to him and do you know what he said to me what have we to do with balkan intrigues we must simply extirpate the scoundrels extirpate is all very wellbut what then the imbecile i screamed at him but you must spiritualizedont you understandspiritualize the discontent  she felt nervously in her pocket for a handkerchief she pressed it to her lips  spiritualize said razumov interrogatively watching her heaving breast the long ends of an old black lace scarf she wore over her head slipped off her shoulders and hung down on each side of her ghastly rosy cheeks  an odious creature she burst out again imagine a man who takes five lumps of sugar in his tea yes i said spiritualize how else can you make discontent effective and universal  listen to this young man peter ivanovitch made himself heard solemnly effective and universal  razumov looked at him suspiciously  some say hunger will do that he remarked  yes i know our people are starving in heaps but you cant make famine universal and it is not despair that we want to create there is no moral support to be got out of that it is indignation  madame de s let her thin extended arm sink on her knees  i am not a mordatiev began razumov  bien sur murmured madame de s  though i too am ready to say extirpate extirpate but in my ignorance of political work permit me to ask a balkanwellintrigue wouldnt that take a very long time  peter ivanovitch got up and moved off quietly to stand with his face to the window razumov heard a door close he turned his head and perceived that the lady companion had scuttled out of the room  in matters of politics i am a supernaturalist madame de s broke the silence harshly  peter ivanovitch moved away from the window and struck razumov lightly on the shoulder this was a signal for leaving but at the same time he addressed madame de s in a peculiar reminding tone  eleanor  whatever it meant she did not seem to hear him she leaned back in the corner of the sofa like a wooden figure the immovable peevishness of the face framed in the limp rusty lace had a character of cruelty  as to extirpating she croaked at the attentive razumov there is only one class in russia which must be extirpated only one and that class consists of only one family you understand me that one family must be extirpated  her rigidity was frightful like the rigor of a corpse galvanized into harsh speech and glittering stare by the force of murderous hate the sight fascinated razumovyet he felt more selfpossessed than at any other time since he had entered this weirdly bare room he was interested but the great feminist by his side again uttered his appeal  eleanor  she disregarded it her carmine lips vaticinated with an extraordinary rapidity the liberating spirit would use arms before which rivers would part like jordan and ramparts fall down like the walls of jericho the deliverance from bondage would be effected by plagues and by signs by wonders and by war the women  eleanor  she ceased she had heard him at last she pressed her hand to her forehead  what is it ah yes that girlthe sister of  it was miss haldin that she meant that young girl and her mother had been leading a very retired life they were provincial ladieswere they not the mother had been very beautifultraces were left yet peter ivanovitch when he called there for the first time was greatly struckbut the cold way they received him was really surprising  he is one of our national glories madams de s cried out with sudden vehemence all the world listens to him  i dont know these ladies said razumov loudly rising from his chair  what are you saying kirylo sidorovitch i understand that she was talking to you here in the garden the other day  yes in the garden said razumov gloomily then with an effort she made herself known to me  and then ran away from us all madame de s continued with ghastly vivacity after coming to the very door what a peculiar proceeding well i have been a shy little provincial girl at one time yes razumov she fell into this familiarity intentionally with an appalling grimace of graciousness razumov gave a perceptible start yes thats my origin a simple provincial family  you are a marvel peter ivanovich uttered  but it was to razumov that she gave her deathshead smile her tone was quite imperious  you must bring the wild young thing here she is wanted i reckon upon your successmind  she is not a wild young thing muttered razumov in a surly voice  well thenthats all the same she may be one of these young conceited democrats do you know what i think i think she is very much like you in character there is a smouldering fire of scorn in you you are darkly selfsufficient but i can see your very soul  her shiny eyes had a dry intense stare which missing razumov gave him an absurd notion that she was looking at something which was visible to her behind him he cursed himself for an impressionable fool and asked with forced calmness  what is it you see anything resembling me  she moved her rigidly set face from left to right negatively  some sort of phantom in my image pursued razumov slowly for i suppose a soul when it is seen is just that a vain thing there are phantoms of the living as well as of the dead  the tenseness of madame de ss stare had relaxed and now she looked at razumov in a silence that became disconcerting  i myself have had an experience he stammered out as if compelled ive seen a phantom once the unnaturally red lips moved to frame a question harshly  of a dead person  no living  a friend  no  an enemy  i hated him  ah it was not a woman then  a woman repeated razumov his eyes looking straight into the eyes of madame de s why should it have been a woman and why this conclusion why should i not have been able to hate a woman  as a matter of fact the idea of hating a woman was new to him at that moment he hated madame de s but it was not exactly hate it was more like the abhorrence that may be caused by a wooden or plaster figure of a repulsive kind she moved no more than if she were such a figure even her eyes whose unwinking stare plunged into his own though shining were lifeless as though they were as artificial as her teeth for the first time razumov became aware of a faint perfume but faint as it was it nauseated him exceedingly again peter ivanovitch tapped him slightly on the shoulder thereupon he bowed and was about to turn away when he received the unexpected favour of a bony inanimate hand extended to him with the two words in hoarse french  au revoir  he bowed over the skeleton hand and left the room escorted by the great man who made him go out first the voice from the sofa cried after them  you remain here pierre  certainly ma chere amie  but he left the room with razumov shutting the door behind him the landing was prolonged into a bare corridor right and left desolate perspectives of white and gold decoration without a strip of carpet the very light pouring through a large window at the end seemed dusty and a solitary speck reposing on the balustrade of white marblethe silk tophat of the great feministasserted itself extremely black and glossy in all that crude whiteness  peter ivanovitch escorted the visitor without opening his lips even when they had reached the head of the stairs peter ivanovitch did not break the silence razumovs impulse to continue down the flight and out of the house without as much as a nod abandoned him suddenly he stopped on the first step and leaned his back against the wall below him the great hall with its chequered floor of black and white seemed absurdly large and like some public place where a great power of resonance awaits the provocation of footfalls and voices as if afraid of awakening the loud echoes of that empty house razumov adopted a low tone  i really have no mind to turn into a dilettante spiritualist  peter ivanovitch shook his head slightly very serious  or spend my time in spiritual ecstasies or sublime meditations upon the gospel of feminism continued razumov i made my way here for my share of actionaction most respected peter ivanovitch it was not the great european writer who attracted me here to this odious town of liberty it was somebody much greater it was the idea of the chief which attracted me there are starving young men in russia who believe in you so much that it seems the only thing that keeps them alive in their misery think of that peter ivanovitch no but only think of that  the great man thus entreated perfectly motionless and silent was the very image of patient placid respectability  of course i dont speak of the people they are brutes added razumov in the same subdued but forcible tone at this a protesting murmur issued from the heroic fugitives beard a murmur of authority  saychildren  no brutes razumov insisted bluntly  but they are sound they are innocent the great man pleaded in a whisper  as far as that goes a brute is sound enough razumov raised his voice at last and you cant deny the natural innocence of a brute but whats the use of disputing about names you just try to give these children the power and stature of men and see what they will be like you just give it to them and see but never mind i tell you peter ivanovitch that half a dozen young men do not come together nowadays in a shabby students room without your name being whispered not as a leader of thought but as a centre of revolutionary energiesthe centre of action what else has drawn me near you do you think it is not what all the world knows of you surely its precisely what the world at large does not know i was irresistibly drawnlet us say impelled yes impelled or rather compelled drivendriven repented razumov loudly and ceased as if startled by the hollow reverberation of the word driven along two bare corridors and in the great empty hall  peter ivanovitch did not seem startled in the least the young man could not control a dry uneasy laugh the great revolutionist remained unmoved with an effect of commonplace homely superiority  curse him said razumov to himself he is waiting behind his spectacles for me to give myself away then aloud with a satanic enjoyment of the scorn prompting him to play with the greatness of the great man  ah peter ivanovitch if you only knew the force which drewno which drove me towards you the irresistible force  he did not feel any desire to laugh now this time peter ivanovitch moved his head sideways knowingly as much as to say dont i this expressive movement was almost imperceptible razumov went on in secret derision  all these days you have been trying to read me peter ivanovitch that is natural i have perceived it and i have been frank perhaps you may think i have not been very expansive but with a man like you it was not needed it would have looked like an impertinence perhaps and besides we russians are prone to talk too much as a rule i have always felt that and yet as a nation we are dumb i assure you that i am not likely to talk to you so much againha ha  razumov still keeping on the lower step came a little nearer to the great man  you have been condescending enough i quite understood it was to lead me on you must render me the justice that i have not tried to please i have been impelled compelled or rather sentlet us say senttowards you for a work that no one but myself can do you would call it a harmless delusion a ridiculous delusion at which you dont even smile it is absurd of me to talk like this yet some day you shall remember these words i hope enough of this here i stand before youconfessed but one thing more i must add to complete it a mere blind tool i can never consent to be  whatever acknowledgment razumov was prepared for he was not prepared to have both his hands seized in the great mans grasp the swiftness of the movement was aggressive enough to startle the burly feminist could not have been quicker had his purpose been to jerk razumov treacherously up on the landing and bundle him behind one of the numerous closed doors near by this idea actually occurred to razumov his hands being released after a darkly eloquent squeeze he smiled with a beating heart straight at the beard and the spectacles hiding that impenetrable man  he thought to himself it stands confessed in his handwriting i wont move from here till he either speaks or turns away this is a duel many seconds passed without a sign or sound  yes yes the great man said hurriedly in subdued tones as if the whole thing had been a stolen breathless interview exactly come to see us here in a few days this must be gone into deeplydeeply between you and me quite to the bottom to theand by the by you must bring along natalia victorovnayou know the haldin girl  am i to take this as my first instruction from you inquired razumov stiffly  peter ivanovitch seemed perplexed by this new attitude  ah hm you are naturally the proper personla personne indiquee every one shall be wanted presently every one  he bent down from the landing over razumov who had lowered his eyes  the moment of action approaches he murmured  razumov did not look up he did not move till he heard the door of the drawingroom close behind the greatest of feminists returning to his painted egeria then he walked down slowly into the hall the door stood open and the shadow of the house was lying aslant over the greatest part of the terrace while crossing it slowly he lifted his hat and wiped his damp forehead expelling his breath with force to get rid of the last vestiges of the air he had been breathing inside he looked at the palms of his hands and rubbed them gently against his thighs  he felt bizarre as it may seem as though another self an independent sharer of his mind had been able to view his whole person very distinctly indeed this is curious he thought after a while he formulated his opinion of it in the mental ejaculation beastly this disgust vanished before a marked uneasiness this is an effect of nervous exhaustion he reflected with weary sagacity how am i to go on day after day if i have no more power of resistancemoral resistance  he followed the path at the foot of the terrace moral resistance moral resistance he kept on repeating these words mentally moral endurance yes that was the necessity of the situation an immense longing to make his way out of these grounds and to the other end of the town of throwing himself on his bed and going to sleep for hours swept everything clean out of his mind for a moment is it possible that i am but a weak creature after all he asked himself in sudden alarm eh whats that  he gave a start as if awakened from a dream he even swayed a little before recovering himself  ah you stole away from us quietly to walk about here he said  the lady companion stood before him but how she came there he had not the slightest idea her folded arms were closely cherishing the cat  i have been unconscious as i walked its a positive fact said razumov to himself in wonder he raised his hat with marked civility  the sallow woman blushed duskily she had her invariably scared expression as if somebody had just disclosed to her some terrible news but she held her ground razumov noticed without timidity she is incredibly shabby he thought in the sunlight her black costume looked greenish with here and there threadbare patches where the stuff seemed decomposed by age into a velvety black furry state her very hair and eyebrows looked shabby razumov wondered whether she were sixty years old her figure though was young enough he observed that she did not appear starved but rather as if she had been fed on unwholesome scraps and leavings of plates  razumov smiled amiably and moved out of her way she turned her head to keep her scared eyes on him  i know what you have been told in there she affirmed without preliminaries her tone in contrast with her manner had an unexpectedly assured character which put razumov at his ease  do you you must have heard all sorts of talk on many occasions in there  she varied her phrase with the same incongruous effect of positiveness  i know to a certainty what you have been told to do  really razumov shrugged his shoulders a little he was about to pass on with a bow when a sudden thought struck him yes to be sure in your confidential position you are aware of many things he murmured looking at the cat  that animal got a momentary convulsive hug from the lady companion  everything was disclosed to me a long time ago she said  everything razumov repeated absently  peter ivanovitch is an awful despot she jerked out  razumov went on studying the stripes on the grey fur of the cat  an iron will is an integral part of such a temperament how else could he be a leader and i think that you are mistaken in  there she cried you tell me that i am mistaken but i tell you all the same that he cares for no one she jerked her head up dont you bring that girl here thats what you have been told to doto bring that girl here listen to me you had better tie a stone round her neck and throw her into the lake  razumov had a sensation of chill and gloom as if a heavy cloud had passed over the sun  the girl he said what have i to do with her  but you have been told to bring nathalie haldin here am i not right of course i am right i was not in the room but i know i know peter ivanovitch sufficiently well he is a great man great men are horrible well thats it have nothing to do with her thats the best you can do unless you want her to become like medisillusioned disillusioned  like you repeated razumov glaring at her face as devoid of all comeliness of feature and complexion as the most miserable beggar is of money he smiled still feeling chilly a peculiar sensation which annoyed him disillusioned as to peter ivanovitch is that all you have lost  she declared looking frightened but with immense conviction peter ivanovitch stands for everything then she added in another tone keep the girl away from this house  and are you absolutely inciting me to disobey peter ivanovitch just becausebecause you are disillusioned  she began to blink  directly i saw you for the first time i was comforted you took your hat off to me you looked as if one could trust you oh  she shrank before razumovs savage snarl of i have heard something like this before  she was so confounded that she could do nothing but blink for a long time  it was your humane manner she explained plaintively i have been starving for i wont say kindness but just for a little civility for i dont know how long and now you are angry  but no on the contrary he protested i am very glad you trust me its possible that later on i may  yes if you were to get ill she interrupted eagerly or meet some bitter trouble you would find i am not a useless fool you have only to let me know i will come to you i will indeed and i will stick to you misery and i are old acquaintancesbut this life here is worse than starving  she paused anxiously then in a voice for the first time sounding really timid she added  or if you were engaged in some dangerous work sometimes a humble companioni would not want to know anything i would follow you with joy i could carry out orders i have the courage  razumov looked attentively at the scared round eyes at the withered sallow round cheeks they were quivering about the corners of the mouth  she wants to escape from here he thought  suppose i were to tell you that i am engaged in dangerous work he uttered slowly  she pressed the cat to her threadbare bosom with a breathless exclamation ah then not much above a whisper under peter ivanovitch  no not under peter ivanovitch  he read admiration in her eyes and made an effort to smile  thenalone  he held up his closed hand with the index raised like this finger he said  she was trembling slightly but it occurred to razumov that they might have been observed from the house and he became anxious to be gone she blinked raising up to him her puckered face and seemed to beg mutely to be told something more to be given a word of encouragement for her starving grotesque and pathetic devotion  can we be seen from the house asked razumov confidentially  she answered without showing the slightest surprise at the question  no we cant on account of this end of the stables and she added with an acuteness which surprised razumov but anybody looking out of an upstairs window would know that you have not passed through the gates yet  whos likely to spy out of the window queried razumov peter ivanovitch  she nodded  why should he trouble his head  he expects somebody this afternoon  you know the person  theres more than one  she had lowered her eyelids razumov looked at her curiously  of course you hear everything they say  she murmured without any animosity  so do the tables and chairs  he understood that the bitterness accumulated in the heart of that helpless creature had got into her veins and like some subtle poison had decomposed her fidelity to that hateful pair it was a great piece of luck for him he reflected because women are seldom venal after the manner of men who can be bought for material considerations she would be a good ally though it was not likely that she was allowed to hear as much as the tables and chairs of the chateau borel that could not be expected but still and at any rate she could be made to talk  when she looked up her eyes met the fixed stare of razumov who began to speak at once  well well dearbut upon my word i havent the pleasure of knowing your name yet isnt it strange  for the first time she made a movement of the shoulders  is it strange no one is told my name no one cares no one talks to me no one writes to me my parents dont even know if im alive i have no use for a name and i have almost forgotten it myself  razumov murmured gravely yes but still  she went on much slower with indifference  you may call me tekla then my poor andrei called me so i was devoted to him he lived in wretchedness and suffering and died in misery that is the lot of all us russians nameless russians there is nothing else for us and no hope anywhere unless  unless what  unless all these people with names are done away with she finished blinking and pursing up her lips  it will be easier to call you tekla as you direct me said razumov if you consent to call me kirylo when we are talking like thisquietlyonly you and me  and he said to himself heres a being who must be terribly afraid of the world else she would have run away from this situation before then he reflected that the mere fact of leaving the great man abruptly would make her a suspect she could expect no support or countenance from anyone this revolutionist was not fit for an independent existence  she moved with him a few steps blinking and nursing the cat with a small balancing movement of her arms  yesonly you and i thats how i was with my poor andrei only he was dying killed by these official bruteswhile you you are strong you kill the monsters you have done a great deed peter ivanovitch himself must consider you welldont forget meespecially if you are going back to work in russia i could follow you carrying anything that was wantedat a distance you know or i could watch for hours at the corner of a street if necessaryin wet or snowyes i couldall day long or i could write for you dangerous documents lists of names or instructions so that in case of mischance the handwriting could not compromise you and you need not be afraid if they were to catch me i would know how to keep dumb we women are not so easily daunted by pain i heard peter ivanovitch say it is our blunt nerves or something we can stand it better and its true i would just as soon bite my tongue out and throw it at them as not whats the good of speech to me who would ever want to hear what i could say ever since i closed the eyes of my poor andrei i havent met a man who seemed to care for the sound of my voice i should never have spoken to you if the very first time you appeared here you had not taken notice of me so nicely i could not help speaking of you to that charming dear girl oh the sweet creature and strong one can see that at once if you have a heart dont let her set her foot in here goodbye  razumov caught her by the arm her emotion at being thus seized manifested itself by a short struggle after which she stood still not looking at him  but you can tell me he spoke in her ear why theythese people in that house thereare so anxious to get hold of her  she freed herself to turn upon him as if made angry by the question  dont you understand that peter ivanovitch must direct inspire influence it is the breath of his life there can never be too many disciples he cant bear thinking of anyone escaping him and a woman too there is nothing to be done without women he says he has written it he  the young man was staring at her passion when she broke off suddenly and ran away behind the stable   iii   razumov thus left to himself took the direction of the gate but on this day of many conversations he discovered that very probably he could not leave the grounds without having to hold another one  stepping in view from beyond the lodge appeared the expected visitors of peter ivanovitch a small party composed of two men and a woman they noticed him too immediately and stopped short as if to consult but in a moment the woman moving aside motioned with her arm to the two men who leaving the drive at once struck across the large neglected lawn or rather grassplot and made directly for the house the woman remained on the path waiting for razumovs approach she had recognized him he too had recognized her at the first glance he had been made known to her at zurich where he had broken his journey while on his way from dresden they had been much together for the three days of his stay  she was wearing the very same costume in which he had seen her first a blouse of crimson silk made her noticeable at a distance with that she wore a short brown skirt and a leather belt her complexion was the colour of coffee and milk but very clear her eyes black and glittering her figure erect a lot of thick hair nearly white was done up loosely under a dusty tyrolese hat of dark cloth which seemed to have lost some of its trimmings  the expression of her face was grave intent so grave that razumov after approaching her close felt obliged to smile she greeted him with a manly handgrasp  what are you going away she exclaimed how is that razumov  i am going away because i havent been asked to stay razumov answered returning the pressure of her hand with much less force than she had put into it  she jerked her head sideways like one who understands meantime razumovs eyes had strayed after the two men they were crossing the grassplot obliquely without haste the shorter of the two was buttoned up in a narrow overcoat of some thin grey material which came nearly to his heels his companion much taller and broader wore a short closefitting jacket and tight trousers tucked into shabby topboots  the woman who had sent them out of razumovs way apparently spoke in a businesslike voice  i had to come rushing from zurich on purpose to meet the train and take these two along here to see peter ivanovitch ive just managed it  ah indeed razumov said perfunctorily and very vexed at her staying behind to talk to him from zurichyes of course and these two they come from  she interrupted without emphasis  from quite another direction from a distance too a considerable distance  razumov shrugged his shoulders the two men from a distance after having reached the wall of the terrace disappeared suddenly at its foot as if the earth had opened to swallow them up  oh well they have just come from america the woman in the crimson blouse shrugged her shoulders too a little before making that statement the time is drawing near she interjected as if speaking to herself i did not tell them who you were yakovlitch would have wanted to embrace you  is that he with the wisp of hair hanging from his chin in the long coat  youve guessed aright thats yakovlitch  and they could not find their way here from the station without you coming on purpose from zurich to show it to them verily without women we can do nothing so it stands written and apparently so it is  he was conscious of an immense lassitude under his effort to be sarcastic and he could see that she had detected it with those steady brilliant black eyes  what is the matter with you  i dont know nothing ive had a devil of a day  she waited with her black eyes fixed on his face then  what of that you men are so impressionable and selfconscious one day is like another hard hardand theres an end of it till the great day comes i came over for a very good reason they wrote to warn peter ivanovitch of their arrival but where from only from cherbourg on a bit of ships notepaper anybody could have done that yakovlitch has lived for years and years in america i am the only one at hand who had known him well in the old days i knew him very well indeed so peter ivanovitch telegraphed asking me to come its natural enough is it not  you came to vouch for his identity inquired razumov  yes something of the kind fifteen years of a life like his make changes in a man lonely like a crow in a strange country when i think of yakovlitch before he went to america  the softness of the low tone caused razumov to glance at her sideways she sighed her black eyes were looking away she had plunged the fingers of her right hand deep into the mass of nearly white hair and stirred them there absently when she withdrew her hand the little hat perched on the top of her head remained slightly tilted with a queer inquisitive effect contrasting strongly with the reminiscent murmur that escaped her  we were not in our first youth even then but a man is a child always  razumov thought suddenly they have been living together then aloud  why didnt you follow him to america he asked pointblank  she looked up at him with a perturbed air  dont you remember what was going on fifteen years ago it was a time of activity the revolution has its history by this time you are in it and yet you dont seem to know it yakovlitch went away then on a mission i went back to russia it had to be so afterwards there was nothing for him to come back to  ah indeed muttered razumov with affected surprise nothing  what are you trying to insinuate she exclaimed quickly well and what then if he did get discouraged a little  he looks like a yankee with that goatee hanging from his chin a regular uncle sam growled razumov well and you you who went to russia you did not get discouraged  never mind yakovlitch is a man who cannot be doubted he at any rate is the right sort  her black penetrating gaze remained fixed upon razumov while she spoke and for a moment afterwards  pardon me razumov inquired coldly but does it mean that you for instance think that i am not the right sort  she made no protest gave no sign of having heard the question she continued looking at him in a manner which he judged not to be absolutely unfriendly in zurich when he passed through she had taken him under her charge in a way and was with him from morning till night during his stay of two days she took him round to see several people at first she talked to him a great deal and rather unreservedly but always avoiding all reference to herself towards the middle of the second day she fell silent attending him zealously as before and even seeing him off at the railway station where she pressed his hand firmly through the lowered carriage window and stepping back without a word waited till the train moved he had noticed that she was treated with quiet regard he knew nothing of her parentage nothing of her private history or political record he judged her from his own private point of view as being a distinct danger in his path judged is not perhaps the right word it was more of a feeling the summing up of slight impressions aided by the discovery that he could not despise her as he despised all the others he had not expected to see her again so soon  no decidedly her expression was not unfriendly yet he perceived an acceleration in the beat of his heart the conversation could not be abandoned at that point he went on in accents of scrupulous inquiry  is it perhaps because i dont seem to accept blindly every development of the general doctrinesuch for instance as the feminism of our great peter ivanovitch if that is what makes me suspect then i can only say i would scorn to be a slave even to an idea  she had been looking at him all the time not as a listener looks at one but as if the words he chose to say were only of secondary interest when he finished she slipped her hand by a sudden and decided movement under his arm and impelled him gently towards the gate of the grounds he felt her firmness and obeyed the impulsion at once just as the other two men had a moment before obeyed unquestioningly the wave of her hand  they made a few steps like this  no razumov your ideas are probably all right she said you may be valuablevery valuable whats the matter with you is that you dont like us  she released him he met her with a frosty smile  am i expected then to have love as well as convictions  she shrugged her shoulders  you know very well what i mean people have been thinking you not quite wholehearted i have heard that opinion from one side and another but i have understood you at the end of the first day  razumov interrupted her speaking steadily  i assure you that your perspicacity is at fault here  what phrases he uses she exclaimed parenthetically ah kirylo sidorovitch you like other men are fastidious full of selflove and afraid of trifles moreover you had no training what you want is to be taken in hand by some woman i am sorry i am not staying here a few days i am going back to zurich tomorrow and shall take yakovlitch with me most likely  this information relieved razumov  i am sorry too he said but all the same i dont think you understand me  he breathed more freely she did not protest but asked and how did you get on with peter ivanovitch you have seen a good deal of each other how is it between you two  not knowing what answer to make the young man inclined his head slowly  her lips had been parted in expectation she pressed them together and seemed to reflect  thats all right  this had a sound of finality but she did not leave him it was impossible to guess what she had in her mind razumov muttered  it is not of me that you should have asked that question in a moment you shall see peter ivanovitch himself and the subject will come up naturally he will be curious to know what has delayed you so long in this garden  no doubt peter ivanovitch will have something to say to me several things he may even speak of youquestion me peter ivanovitch is inclined to trust me generally  question you thats very likely  she smiled half serious  welland what shall i say to him  i dont know you may tell him of your discovery  whats that  whymy lack of love for   oh thats between ourselves she interrupted it was hard to say whether in jest or earnest  i see that you want to tell peter ivanovitch something in my favour said razumov with grim playfulness well then you can tell him that i am very much in earnest about my mission i mean to succeed  you have been given a mission she exclaimed quickly  it amounts to that i have been told to bring about a certain event  she looked at him searchingly  a mission she repeated very grave and interested all at once what sort of mission  something in the nature of propaganda work  ah far away from here  no not very far said razumov restraining a sudden desire to laugh although he did not feel joyous in the least  so she said thoughtfully well i am not asking questions its sufficient that peter ivanovitch should know what each of us is doing everything is bound to come right in the end  you think so  i dont think young man i just simply believe it  and is it to peter ivanovitch that you owe that faith  she did not answer the question and they stood idle silent as if reluctant to part with each other  thats just like a man she murmured at last as if it were possible to tell how a belief comes to one her thin mephistophelian eyebrows moved a little truly there are millions of people in russia who would envy the life of dogs in this country it is a horror and a shame to confess this even between ourselves one must believe for very pity this cant go on no it cant go on for twenty years i have been coming and going looking neither to the left nor to the right what are you smiling to yourself for you are only at the beginning you have begun well but you just wait till you have trodden every particle of yourself under your feet in your comings and goings for that is what it comes to youve got to trample down every particle of your own feelings for stop you cannot you must not i have been young toobut perhaps you think that i am complainingeh  i dont think anything of the sort protested razumov indifferently  i dare say you dont you dear superior creature you dont care  she plunged her fingers into the bunch of hair on the left side and that brusque movement had the effect of setting the tyrolese hat straight on her head she frowned under it without animosity in the manner of an investigator razumov averted his face carelessly  you men are all alike you mistake luck for merit you do it in good faith too i would not be too hard on you its masculine nature you men are ridiculously pitiful in your aptitude to cherish childish illusions down to the very grave there are a lot of us who have been at work for fifteen yearsi mean constantlytrying one way after another underground and above ground looking neither to the right nor to the left i can talk about it i have been one of these that never rested there whats the use of talking look at my grey hairs and here two babies come alongi mean you and haldinyou come along and manage to strike a blow at the very first try  at the name of haldin falling from the rapid and energetic lips of the woman revolutionist razumov had the usual brusque consciousness of the irrevocable but in all the months which had passed over his head he had become hardened to the experience the consciousness was no longer accompanied by the blank dismay and the blind anger of the early days he had argued himself into new beliefs and he had made for himself a mental atmosphere of gloomy and sardonic reverie a sort of murky medium through which the event appeared like a featureless shadow having vaguely the shape of a man a shape extremely familiar yet utterly inexpressive except for its air of discreet waiting in the dusk it was not alarming  what was he like the woman revolutionist asked unexpectedly  what was he like echoed razumov making a painful effort not to turn upon her savagely but he relieved himself by laughing a little while he stole a glance at her out of the corners of his eyes this reception of her inquiry disturbed her  how like a woman he went on what is the good of concerning yourself with his appearance whatever it was he is removed beyond all feminine influences now  a frown making three folds at the root of her nose accentuated the mephistophelian slant of her eyebrows  you suffer razumov she suggested in her low confident voice  what nonsense razumov faced the woman fairly but now i think of it i am not sure that he is beyond the influence of one woman at least the one over theremadame de s you know formerly the dead were allowed to rest but now it seems they are at the beck and call of a crazy old harridan we revolutionists make wonderful discoveries it is true that they are not exactly our own we have nothing of our own but couldnt the friend of peter ivanovitch satisfy your feminine curiosity couldnt she conjure him up for youhe jested like a man in pain  her concentrated frowning expression relaxed and she said a little wearily let us hope she will make an effort and conjure up some tea for us but that is by no means certain i am tired razumov  you tired what a confession well there has been tea up there i had some if you hurry on after yakovlitch instead of wasting your time with such an unsatisfactory sceptical person as myself you may find the ghost of itthe cold ghost of itstill lingering in the temple but as to you being tired i can hardly believe it we are not supposed to be we mustnt we cant the other day i read in some paper or other an alarmist article on the tireless activity of the revolutionary parties it impresses the world its our prestige  he flings out continually these flouts and sneers the woman in the crimson blouse spoke as if appealing quietly to a third person but her black eyes never left razumovs face and what for pray simply because some of his conventional notions are shocked some of his petty masculine standards you might think he was one of these nervous sensitives that come to a bad end and yet she went on after a short reflective pause and changing the mode of her address and yet i have just learned something which makes me think that you are a man of character kirylo sidorovitch yes indeedyou are  the mysterious positiveness of this assertion startled razumov their eyes met he looked away and through the bars of the rusty gate stared at the clean wide road shaded by the leafy trees an electric tramcar quite empty ran along the avenue with a metallic rustle it seemed to him he would have given anything to be sitting inside all alone he was inexpressibly weary weary in every fibre of his body but he had a reason for not being the first to break off the conversation at any instant in the visionary and criminal babble of revolutionists some momentous words might fall on his ear from her lips from anybodys lips as long as he managed to preserve a clear mind and to keep down his irritability there was nothing to fear the only condition of success and safety was indomitable willpower he reminded himself  he longed to be on the other side of the bars as though he were actually a prisoner within the grounds of this centre of revolutionary plots of this house of folly of blindness of villainy and crime silently he indulged his wounded spirit in a feeling of immense moral and mental remoteness he did not even smile when he heard her repeat the words  yes a strong character  he continued to gaze through the bars like a moody prisoner not thinking of escape but merely pondering upon the faded memories of freedom  if you dont look out he mumbled still looking away you shall certainly miss seeing as much as the mere ghost of that tea  she was not to be shaken off in such a way as a matter of fact he had not expected to succeed  never mind it will be no great loss i mean the missing of her tea and only the ghost of it at that as to the lady you must understand that she has her positive uses see that razumov  he turned his head at this imperative appeal and saw the woman revolutionist making the motions of counting money into the palm of her hand  thats what it is you see  razumov uttered a slow i see and returned to his prisonerlike gazing upon the neat and shady road  material means must be obtained in some way and this is easier than breaking into banks more certain too there i am joking what is he muttering to himself now she cried under her breath  my admiration of peter ivanovitchs devoted selfsacrifice thats all its enough to make one sick  oh you squeamish masculine creature sick makes him sick and what do you know of the truth of it theres no looking into the secrets of the heart peter ivanovitch knew her years ago in his worldly days when he was a young officer in the guards it is not for us to judge an inspired person thats where you men have an advantage you are inspired sometimes both in thought and action i have always admitted that when you are inspired when you manage to throw off your masculine cowardice and prudishness you are not to be equalled by us only how seldom whereas the silliest woman can always be made of use and why because we have passion unappeasable passion i should like to know what he is smiling at  i am not smiling protested razumov gloomily  well how is one to call it you made some sort of face yes i know you men can love here and hate there and desire something or otherand you make a great todo about it and you call it passion yes while it lasts but we women are in love with love and with hate with these very things i tell you and with desire itself thats why we cant be bribed off so easily as you men in life you see there is not much choice you have either to rot or to burn and there is not one of us painted or unpainted that would not rather burn than rot  she spoke with energy but in a matteroffact tone razumovs attention had wandered away on a track of its ownoutside the bars of the gatebut not out of earshot he stuck his hands into the pockets of his coat  rot or burn powerfully stated painted or unpainted very vigorous painted ordo tell meshe would be infernally jealous of him wouldnt she  who what the baroness eleanor maximovna jealous of peter ivanovitch heavens are these the questions the mans mind is running on such a thing is not to be thought of  why cant a wealthy old woman be jealous or are they all pure spirits together  but what put it into your head to ask such a question she wondered  nothing i just asked masculine frivolity if you like  i dont like she retorted at once it is not the time to be frivolous what are you flinging your very heart against or perhaps you are only playing a part  razumov had felt that womans observation of him like a physical contact like a hand resting lightly on his shoulder at that moment he received the mysterious impression of her having made up her mind for a closer grip he stiffened himself inwardly to bear it without betraying himself  playing a part he repeated presenting to her an unmoved profile it must be done very badly since you see through the assumption  she watched him her forehead drawn into perpendicular folds the thin black eyebrows diverging upwards like the antennae of an insect he added hardly audibly  you are mistaken i am doing it no more than the rest of us  who is doing it she snapped out  who everybody he said impatiently you are a materialist arent you  eh my dear soul i have outlived all that nonsense  but you must remember the definition of cabanis man is a digestive tube i imagine now  i spit on him  what on cabanis all right but you cant ignore the importance of a good digestion the joy of lifeyou know the joy of lifedepends on a sound stomach whereas a bad digestion inclines one to scepticism breeds black fancies and thoughts of death these are facts ascertained by physiologists well i assure you that ever since i came over from russia i have been stuffed with indigestible foreign concoctions of the most nauseating kindpah  you are joking she murmured incredulously he assented in a detached way  yes it is all a joke its hardly worth while talking to a man like me yet for that very reason men have been known to take their own life  on the contrary i think it is worth while talking to you  he kept her in the corner of his eye she seemed to be thinking out some scathing retort but ended by only shrugging her shoulders slightly  shallow talk i suppose one must pardon this weakness in you she said putting a special accent on the last word there was something anxious in her indulgent conclusion  razumov noted the slightest shades in this conversation which he had not expected for which he was not prepared that was it i was not prepared he said to himself it has taken me unawares it seemed to him that if he only could allow himself to pant openly like a dog for a time this oppression would pass away i shall never be found prepared he thought with despair he laughed a little saying as lightly as he could  thanks i dont ask for mercy then affecting a playful uneasiness but arent you afraid peter ivanovitch might suspect us of plotting something unauthorized together by the gate here  no i am not afraid you are quite safe from suspicions while you are with me my dear young man the humorous gleam in her black eyes went out peter ivanovitch trusts me she went on quite austerely he takes my advice i am his right hand as it were in certain most important things that amuses you what do you think i am boasting  god forbid i was just only saying to myself that peter ivanovitch seems to have solved the woman question pretty completely  even as he spoke he reproached himself for his words for his tone all day long he had been saying the wrong things it was folly worse than folly it was weakness it was this disease of perversity overcoming his will was this the way to meet speeches which certainly contained the promise of future confidences from that woman who apparently had a great store of secret knowledge and so much influence why give her this puzzling impression but she did not seem inimical there was no anger in her voice it was strangely speculative  one does not know what to think razumov you must have bitten something bitter in your cradle razumov gave her a sidelong glance  hm something bitter thats an explanation he muttered only it was much later and dont you think sophia antonovna that you and i come from the same cradle  the woman whose name he had forced himself at last to pronounce he had experienced a strong repugnance in letting it pass his lips the woman revolutionist murmured after a pause  you meanrussia  he disdained even to nod she seemed softened her black eyes very still as though she were pursuing the simile in her thoughts to all its tender associations but suddenly she knitted her brows in a mephistophelian frown  yes perhaps no wonder then yes one lies there lapped up in evils watched over by beings that are worse than ogres ghouls and vampires they must be driven away destroyed utterly in regard of that task nothing else matters if men and women are determined and faithful thats how i came to feel in the end the great thing is not to quarrel amongst ourselves about all sorts of conventional trifles remember that razumov  razumov was not listening he had even lost the sense of being watched in a sort of heavy tranquillity his uneasiness his exasperation his scorn were blunted at last by all these trying hours it seemed to him that now they were blunted for ever i am a match for them all he thought with a conviction too firm to be exulting the woman revolutionist had ceased speaking he was not looking at her there was no one passing along the road he almost forgot that he was not alone he heard her voice again curt businesslike and yet betraying the hesitation which had been the real reason of her prolonged silence  i say razumov  razumov whose face was turned away from her made a grimace like a man who hears a false note  tell me is it true that on the very morning of the deed you actually attended the lectures at the university  an appreciable fraction of a second elapsed before the real import of the question reached him like a bullet which strikes some time after the flash of the fired shot luckily his disengaged hand was ready to grip a bar of the gate he held it with a terrible force but his presence of mind was gone he could make only a sort of gurgling grumpy sound  come kirylo sidorovitch she urged him i know you are not a boastful man that one must say for you you are a silent man too silent perhaps you are feeding on some bitterness of your own you are not an enthusiast you are perhaps all the stronger for that but you might tell me one would like to understand you a little more i was so immensely struck have you really done it  he got his voice back the shot had missed him it had been fired at random altogether more like a signal for coming to close quarters it was to be a plain struggle for selfpreservation and she was a dangerous adversary too but he was ready for battle he was so ready that when he turned towards her not a muscle of his face moved  certainly he said without animation secretly strung up but perfectly sure of himself lecturescertainly but what makes you ask  it was she who was animated  i had it in a letter written by a young man in petersburg one of us of course you were seenyou were observed with your notebook impassible taking notes  he enveloped her with his fixed stare  what of that  i call such coolness superbthats all it is a proof of uncommon strength of character the young man writes that nobody could have guessed from your face and manner the part you had played only some two hours beforethe great momentous glorious part  oh no nobody could have guessed assented razumov gravely because dont you see nobody at that time  yes yes but all the same you are a man of exceptional fortitude it seems you looked exactly as usual it was remembered afterwards with wonder  it cost me no effort razumov declared with the same staring gravity  then its almost more wonderful still she exclaimed and fell silent while razumov asked himself whether he had not said there something utterly unnecessaryor even worse  she raised her head eagerly  your intention was to stay in russia you had planned  no interrupted razumov without haste i had made no plans of any sort  you just simply walked away she struck in  he bowed his head in slow assent simplyyes he had gradually released his hold on the bar of the gate as though he had acquired the conviction that no random shot could knock him over now and suddenly he was inspired to add the snow was coming down very thick you know  she had a slight appreciative movement of the head like an expert in such enterprises very interested capable of taking every point professionally razumov remembered something he had heard  i turned into a narrow side street you understand he went on negligently and paused as if it were not worth talking about then he remembered another detail and dropped it before her like a disdainful dole to her curiosity  i felt inclined to lie down and go to sleep there  she clicked her tongue at that symptom very struck indeed then  but the notebook the amazing notebook man you dont mean to say you had put it in your pocket beforehand she cried  razumov gave a start it might have been a sign of impatience  i went home straight home to my rooms he said distinctly  the coolness of the man you dared  why not i assure you i was perfectly calm ha calmer than i am now perhaps  i like you much better as you are now than when you indulge that bitter vein of yours razumov and nobody in the house saw you returneh that might have appeared queer  no one razumov said firmly dvornik landlady girl all out of the way i went up like a shadow it was a murky morning the stairs were dark i glided up like a phantom fate luck what do you think  i just see it the eyes of the woman revolutionist snapped darkly welland then you considered  razumov had it all ready in his head  no i looked at my watch since you want to know there was just time i took that notebook and ran down the stairs on tiptoe have you ever listened to the pitpat of a man running round and round the shaft of a deep staircase they have a gaslight at the bottom burning night and day i suppose its gleaming down there now the sound dies outthe flame winks  he noticed the vacillation of surprise passing over the steady curiosity of the black eyes fastened on his face as if the woman revolutionist received the sound of his voice into her pupils instead of her ears he checked himself passed his hand over his forehead confused like a man who has been dreaming aloud  where could a student be running if not to his lectures in the morning at night its another matter i did not care if all the house had been there to look at me but i dont suppose there was anyone its best not to be seen or heard aha the people that are neither seen nor heard are the lucky onesin russia dont you admire my luck  astonishing she said if you have luck as well as determination then indeed you are likely to turn out an invaluable acquisition for the work in hand  her tone was earnest and it seemed to razumov that it was speculative even as though she were already apportioning him in her mind his share of the work her eyes were cast down he waited not very alert now but with the grip of the everpresent danger giving him an air of attentive gravity who could have written about him in that letter from petersburg a fellow student surelysome imbecile victim of revolutionary propaganda some foolish slave of foreign subversive ideals a long faminestricken rednosed figure presented itself to his mental search that must have been the fellow  he smiled inwardly at the absolute wrongheadedness of the whole thing the selfdeception of a criminal idealist shattering his existence like a thunderclap out of a clear sky and reechoing amongst the wreckage in the false assumptions of those other fools fancy that hungry and piteous imbecile furnishing to the curiosity of the revolutionist refugees this utterly fantastic detail he appreciated it as by no means constituting a danger on the contrary as things stood it was for his advantage rather a piece of sinister luck which had only to be accepted with proper caution  and yet razumov he heard the musing voice of the woman you have not the face of a lucky man she raised her eyes with renewed interest and so that was the way of it after doing your work you simply walked off and made for your rooms that sort of thing succeeds sometimes i suppose it was agreed beforehand that once the business over each of you would go his own way  razumov preserved the seriousness of his expression and the deliberate if cautious manner of speaking  was not that the best thing to do he asked in a dispassionate tone and anyway he added after waiting a moment we did not give much thought to what would come after we never discussed formally any line of conduct it was understood i think  she approved his statement with slight nods  you of course wished to remain in russia  in st petersburg itself emphasized razumov it was the only safe course for me and moreover i had nowhere else to go  yes yes i know clearly and the otherthis wonderful haldin appearing only to be regrettedyou dont know what he intended  razumov had foreseen that such a question would certainly come to meet him sooner or later he raised his hands a little and let them fall helplessly by his sidenothing more  it was the whitehaired woman conspirator who was the first to break the silence  very curious she pronounced slowly and you did not think kirylo sidorovitch that he might perhaps wish to get in touch with you again  razumov discovered that he could not suppress the trembling of his lips but he thought that he owed it to himself to speak a negative sign would not do again speak he must if only to get at the bottom of what that st petersburg letter might have contained  i stayed at home next day he said bending down a little and plunging his glance into the black eyes of the woman so that she should not observe the trembling of his lips yes i stayed at home as my actions are remembered and written about then perhaps you are aware that i was not seen at the lectures next day eh you didnt know well i stopped at homethe livelong day  as if moved by his agitated tone she murmured a sympathetic i see it must have been trying enough  you seem to understand ones feelings said razumov steadily it was trying it was horrible it was an atrocious day it was not the last  yes i understand afterwards when you heard they had got him dont i know how one feels after losing a comrade in the good fight ones ashamed of being left and i can remember so many never mind they shall be avenged before long and what is death at any rate it is not a shameful thing like some kinds of life  razumov felt something stir in his breast a sort of feeble and unpleasant tremor  some kinds of life he repeated looking at her searchingly  the subservient submissive life life no vegetation on the filthy heap of iniquity which the world is life razumov not to be vile must be a revolta pitiless protestall the time  she calmed down the gleam of suffused tears in her eyes dried out instantly by the heat of her passion and it was in her capable businesslike manner that she went on  you understand me razumov you are not an enthusiast but there is an immense force of revolt in you i felt it from the first directly i set my eyes on youyou rememberin zurich oh you are full of bitter revolt that is good indignation flags sometimes revenge itself may become a weariness but that uncompromising sense of necessity and justice which armed your and haldins hands to strike down that fanatical brutefor it was thatnothing but that i have been thinking it out it could have been nothing else but that  razumov made a slight bow the irony of which was concealed by an almost sinister immobility of feature  i cant speak for the dead as for myself i can assure you that my conduct was dictated by necessity and by the sense ofwellretributive justice  good that he said to himself while her eyes rested upon him black and impenetrable like the mental caverns where revolutionary thought should sit plotting the violent way of its dream of changes as if anything could be changed in this world of men nothing can be changedneither happiness nor misery they can only be displaced at the cost of corrupted consciences and broken livesa futile game for arrogant philosophers and sanguinary triflers those thoughts darted through razumovs head while he stood facing the old revolutionary hand the respected trusted and influential sophia antonovna whose word had such a weight in the active section of every party she was much more representative than the great peter ivanovitch stripped of rhetoric mysticism and theories she was the true spirit of destructive revolution and she was the personal adversary he had to meet it gave him a feeling of triumphant pleasure to deceive her out of her own mouth the epigrammatic saying that speech has been given to us for the purpose of concealing our thoughts came into his mind of that cynical theory this was a very subtle and a very scornful application flouting in its own words the very spirit of ruthless revolution embodied in that woman with her white hair and black eyebrows like slightly sinuous lines of indian ink drawn together by the perpendicular folds of a thoughtful frown  thats it retributive no pity was the conclusion of her silence and this once broken she went on impulsively in short vibrating sentences  listen to my story razumov her father was a clever but unlucky artisan no joy had lighted up his laborious days he died at fifty all the years of his life he had panted under the thumb of masters whose rapacity exacted from him the price of the water of the salt of the very air he breathed taxed the sweat of his brow and claimed the blood of his sons no protection no guidance what had society to say to him be submissive and be honest if you rebel i shall kill you if you steal i shall imprison you but if you suffer i have nothing for younothing except perhaps a beggarly dole of breadbut no consolation for your trouble no respect for your manhood no pity for the sorrows of your miserable life  and so he laboured he suffered and he died he died in the hospital standing by the common grave she thought of his tormented existenceshe saw it whole she reckoned the simple joys of life the birthright of the humblest of which his gentle heart had been robbed by the crime of a society which nothing can absolve  yes razumov she continued in an impressive lowered voice it was like a lurid light in which i stood still almost a child and cursed not the toil not the misery which had been his lot but the great social iniquity of the system resting on unrequited toil and unpitied sufferings from that moment i was a revolutionist  razumov trying to raise himself above the dangerous weaknesses of contempt or compassion had preserved an impassive countenance she with an unaffected touch of mere bitterness the first he could notice since he had come in contact with the woman went on  as i could not go to the church where the priests of the system exhorted such unconsidered vermin as i to resignation i went to the secret societies as soon as i knew how to find my way i was sixteen years oldno more razumov andlook at my white hair  in these last words there was neither pride nor sadness the bitterness too was gone  there is a lot of it i had always magnificent hair even as a chit of a girl only at that time we were cutting it short and thinking that there was the first step towards crushing the social infamy crush the infamy a fine watchword i would placard it on the walls of prisons and palaces carve it on hard rocks hang it out in letters of fire on that empty sky for a sign of hope and terrora portent of the end  you are eloquent sophia antonovna razumov interrupted suddenly only so far you seem to have been writing it in water  she was checked but not offended who knows very soon it may become a fact written all over that great land of ours she hinted meaningly and then one would have lived long enough white hair wont matter  razumov looked at her white hair and this mark of so many uneasy years seemed nothing but a testimony to the invincible vigour of revolt it threw out into an astonishing relief the unwrinkled face the brilliant black glance the upright compact figure the simple brisk selfpossession of the mature personalityas though in her revolutionary pilgrimage she had discovered the secret not of everlasting youth but of everlasting endurance  how unrussian she looked thought razumov her mother might have been a jewess or an armenian or devil knew what he reflected that a revolutionist is seldom true to the settled type all revolt is the expression of strong individualismran his thought vaguely one can tell them a mile off in any society in any surroundings it was astonishing that the police  we shall not meet again very soon i think she was saying i am leaving tomorrow  for zurich razumov asked casually but feeling relieved not from any distinct apprehension but from a feeling of stress as if after a wrestling match  yes zurichand farther on perhaps much farther another journey when i think of all my journeys the last must come some day never mind razumov we had to have a good long talk i would have certainly tried to see you if we had not met peter ivanovitch knows where you live yes i meant to have asked himbut its better like this you see we expect two more men and i had much rather wait here talking with you than up there at the house with  having cast a glance beyond the gate she interrupted herself here they are she said rapidly well kirylo sidorovitch we shall have to say goodbye presently   iv   in his incertitude of the ground on which he stood razumov felt perturbed turning his head quickly he saw two men on the opposite side of the road seeing themselves noticed by sophia antonovna they crossed over at once and passed one after another through the little gate by the side of the empty lodge they looked hard at the stranger but without mistrust the crimson blouse being a flaring safety signal the first great white hairless face double chin prominent stomach which he seemed to carry forward consciously within a strongly distended overcoat only nodded and averted his eyes peevishly his companionlean flushed cheekbones a military red moustache below a sharp salient noseapproached at once sophia antonovna greeting her warmly his voice was very strong but inarticulate it sounded like a deep buzzing the woman revolutionist was quietly cordial  this is razumov she announced in a clear voice  the lean newcomer made an eager halfturn he will want to embrace me thought our young man with a deep recoil of all his being while his limbs seemed too heavy to move but it was a groundless alarm he had to do now with a generation of conspirators who did not kiss each other on both cheeks and raising an arm that felt like lead he dropped his hand into a largelyoutstretched palm fleshless and hot as if dried up by fever giving a bony pressure expressive seeming to say between us theres no need of words the man had big wideopen eyes razumov fancied he could see a smile behind their sadness  this is razumov sophia antonovna repeated loudly for the benefit of the fat man who at some distance displayed the profile of his stomach  no one moved everything sounds attitudes movements and immobility seemed to be part of an experiment the result of which was a thin voice piping with comic peevishness  oh yes razumov we have been hearing of nothing but mr razumov for months for my part i confess i would rather have seen haldin on this spot instead of mr razumov  the squeaky stress put on the name razumovmr razumov pierced the ear ridiculously like the falsetto of a circus clown beginning an elaborate joke astonishment was razumovs first response followed by sudden indignation  whats the meaning of this he asked in a stern tone  tut silliness hes always like that sophia antonovna was obviously vexed but she dropped the information necator from her lips just loud enough to be heard by razumov the abrupt squeaks of the fat man seemed to proceed from that thing like a balloon he carried under his overcoat the stolidity of his attitude the big feet the lifeless hanging hands the enormous bloodless cheek the thin wisps of hair straggling down the fat nape of the neck fascinated razumov into a stare on the verge of horror and laughter  nikita surnamed necator with a sinister aptness of alliteration razumov had heard of him he had heard so much since crossing the frontier of these celebrities of the militant revolution the legends the stories the authentic chronicle which now and then peeps out before a halfincredulous world razumov had heard of him he was supposed to have killed more gendarmes and police agents than any revolutionist living he had been entrusted with executions  the paper with the letters nn the very pseudonym of murder found pinned on the stabbed breast of a certain notorious spy this picturesque detail of a sensational murder case had got into the newspapers was the mark of his handiwork by order of the committeenn a corner of the curtain lifted to strike the imagination of the gaping world he was said to have been innumerable times in and out of russia the necator of bureaucrats of provincial governors of obscure informers he lived between whiles razumov had heard on the shores of the lake of como with a charming wife devoted to the cause and two young children but how could that creature so grotesque as to set town dogs barking at its mere sight go about on those deadly errands and slip through the meshes of the police  what now what now the voice squeaked i am only sincere its not denied that the other was the leading spirit well it would have been better if he had been the one spared to us more useful i am not a sentimentalist say what i thinkonly natural  squeak squeak squeak without a gesture without a stirthe horrible squeaky burlesque of professional jealousythis man of a sinister alliterative nickname this executioner of revolutionary verdicts the terrifying nn exasperated like a fashionable tenor by the attention attracted to the performance of an obscure amateur sophia antonovna shrugged her shoulders the comrade with the martial red moustache hurried towards razumov full of conciliatory intentions in his strong buzzing voice  devil take it and in this place too in the public street so to speak but you can see yourself how it is one of his fantastic sallies absolutely of no consequence  pray dont concern yourself cried razumov going off into a long fit of laughter dont mention it  the other his hectic flush like a pair of burns on his cheekbones stared for a moment and burst out laughing too razumov whose hilarity died out all at once made a step forward  enough of this he began in a clear incisive voice though he could hardly control the trembling of his legs i will have no more of it i shall not permit anyone i can see very well what you are at with those allusions inquire investigate i defy you but i will not be played with  he had spoken such words before he had been driven to cry them out in the face of other suspicions it was an infernal cycle bringing round that protest like a fatal necessity of his existence but it was no use he would be always played with luckily life does not last for ever  i wont have it he shouted striking his fist into the palm of his other hand  kirylo sidorovitchwhat has come to you the woman revolutionist interfered with authority they were all looking at razumov now the slayer of spies and gendarmes had turned about presenting his enormous stomach in full like a shield  dont shout there are people passing sophia antonovna was apprehensive of another outburst a steamlaunch from monrepos had come to the landingstage opposite the gate its hoarse whistle and the churning noise alongside all unnoticed had landed a small bunch of local passengers who were dispersing their several ways only a specimen of early tourist in knickerbockers conspicuous by a brandnew yellow leather glasscase hung about for a moment scenting something unusual about these four people within the rusty iron gates of what looked the grounds run wild of an unoccupied private house ah if he had only known what the chance of commonplace travelling had suddenly put in his way but he was a wellbred person he averted his gaze and moved off with short steps along the avenue on the watch for a tramcar  a gesture from sophia antonovna leave him to me had sent the two men awaythe buzzing of the inarticulate voice growing fainter and fainter and the thin pipe of what now whats the matter reduced to the proportions of a squeaking toy by the distance they had left him to her so many things could be left safely to the experience of sophia antonovna and at once her black eyes turned to razumov her mind tried to get at the heart of that outburst it had some meaning no one is born an active revolutionist the change comes disturbingly with the force of a sudden vocation bringing in its train agonizing doubts assertive violences an unstable state of the soul till the final appeasement of the convert in the perfect fierceness of conviction she had seenoften had only divinedscores of these young men and young women going through an emotional crisis this young man looked like a moody egotist and besides it was a speciala unique case she had never met an individuality which interested and puzzled her so much  take care razumov my good friend if you carry on like this you will go mad you are angry with everybody and bitter with yourself and on the look out for something to torment yourself with  its intolerable razumov could only speak in gasps you must admit that i can have no illusions on the attitude whichit isnt clearor rather only too clear  he made a gesture of despair it was not his courage that failed him the choking fumes of falsehood had taken him by the throatthe thought of being condemned to struggle on and on in that tainted atmosphere without the hope of ever renewing his strength by a breath of fresh air  a glass of cold water is what you want sophia antonovna glanced up the grounds at the house and shook her head then out of the gate at the brimful placidity of the lake with a halfcomical shrug of the shoulders she gave the remedy up in the face of that abundance  it is you my dear soul who are flinging yourself at something which does not exist what is it selfreproach or what its absurd you couldnt have gone and given yourself up because your comrade was taken  she remonstrated with him reasonably at some length too he had nothing to complain of in his reception every newcomer was discussed more or less everybody had to be thoroughly understood before being accepted no one that she could remember had been shown from the first so much confidence soon very soon perhaps sooner than he expected he would be given an opportunity of showing his devotion to the sacred task of crushing the infamy  razumov listening quietly thought it may be that she is trying to lull my suspicions to sleep on the other hand it is obvious that most of them are fools he moved aside a couple of paces and folding his arms on his breast leaned back against the stone pillar of the gate  as to what remains obscure in the fate of that poor haldin sophia antonovna dropped into a slowness of utterance which was to razumov like the falling of molten lead drop by drop as to thatthough no one ever hinted that either from fear or neglect your conduct has not been what it should have beenwell i have a bit of intelligence  razumov could not prevent himself from raising his head and sophia antonovna nodded slightly  i have you remember that letter from st petersburg i mentioned to you a moment ago  the letter perfectly some busybody has been reporting my conduct on a certain day its rather sickening i suppose our police are greatly edified when they open these interesting andandsuperfluous letters  oh dear no the police do not get hold of our letters as easily as you imagine the letter in question did not leave st petersburg till the ice broke up it went by the first english steamer which left the neva this spring they have a fireman on boardone of us in fact it has reached me from hull  she paused as if she were surprised at the sullen fixity of razumovs gaze but went on at once and much faster  we have some of our people there whobut never mind the writer of the letter relates an incident which he thinks may possibly be connected with haldins arrest i was just going to tell you when those two men came along  that also was an incident muttered razumov of a very charming kindfor me  leave off that cried sophia antonovna nobody cares for nikitas barking theres no malice in him listen to what i have to say you may be able to throw a light there was in st petersburg a sort of town peasanta man who owned horses he came to town years ago to work for some relation as a driver and ended by owning a cab or two  she might well have spared herself the slight effort of the gesture wait razumov did not mean to speak he could not have interrupted her now not to save his life the contraction of his facial muscles had been involuntary a mere surface stir leaving him sullenly attentive as before  he was not a quite ordinary man of his classit seems she went on the people of the housemy informant talked with many of themyou know one of those enormous houses of shame and misery  sophia antonovna need not have enlarged on the character of the house razumov saw clearly towering at her back a dark mass of masonry veiled in snowflakes with the long row of windows of the eatingshop shining greasily very near the ground the ghost of that night pursued him he stood up to it with rage and with weariness  did the late haldin ever by chance speak to you of that house sophia antonovna was anxious to know  yes razumov making that answer wondered whether he were falling into a trap it was so humiliating to lie to these people that he probably could not have said no he mentioned to me once he added as if making an effort of memory a house of that sort he used to visit some workmen there  exactly  sophia antonovna triumphed her correspondent had discovered that fact quite accidentally from the talk of the people of the house having made friends with a workman who occupied a room there they described haldins appearance perfectly he brought comforting words of hope into their misery he came irregularly but he came very often andher correspondent wrotesometimes he spent a night in the house sleeping they thought in a stable which opened upon the inner yard  note that razumov in a stable  razumov had listened with a sort of ferocious but amused acquiescence  yes in the straw it was probably the cleanest spot in the whole house  no doubt assented the woman with that deep frown which seemed to draw closer together her black eyes in a sinister fashion no fourfooted beast could stand the filth and wretchedness so many human beings were condemned to suffer from in russia the point of this discovery was that it proved haldin to have been familiar with that horseowning peasanta reckless independent freeliving fellow not much liked by the other inhabitants of the house he was believed to have been the associate of a band of housebreakers some of these got captured not while he was driving them however but still there was a suspicion against the fellow of having given a hint to the police and  the woman revolutionist checked herself suddenly  and you have you ever heard your friend refer to a certain ziemianitch  razumov was ready for the name he had been looking out for the question when it comes i shall own up he had said to himself but he took his time  to be sure he began slowly ziemianitch a peasant owning a team of horses yes on one occasion ziemianitch certainly ziemianitch of the horses how could it have slipped my memory like this one of the last conversations we had together  that meanssophia antonovna looked very gravethat means razumov it was very shortly beforeeh  before what shouted razumov advancing at the woman who looked astonished but stood her ground before oh of course it was before how could it have been after only a few hours before  and he spoke of him favourably  with enthusiasm the horses of ziemianitch the free soul of ziemianitch  razumov took a savage delight in the loud utterance of that name which had never before crossed his lips audibly he fixed his blazing eyes on the woman till at last her fascinated expression recalled him to himself  the late haldin he said holding himself in with downcast eyes was inclined to take sudden fancies to people ononwhat shall i sayinsufficient grounds  there sophia antonovna clapped her hands that to my mind settles it the suspicions of my correspondent were aroused  aha your correspondent razumov said in an almost openly mocking tone what suspicions how aroused by this ziemianitch probably some drunken gabbling plausible  you talk as if you had known him  razumov looked up  no but i knew haldin  sophia antonovna nodded gravely  i see every word you say confirms to my mind the suspicion communicated to me in that very interesting letter this ziemianitch was found one morning hanging from a hook in the stabledead  razumov felt a profound trouble it was visible because sophia antonovna was moved to observe vivaciously  aha you begin to see  he saw it clearly enoughin the light of a lantern casting spokes of shadow in a cellarlike stable the body in a sheepskin coat and long boots hanging against the wall a pointed hood with the ends wound about up to the eyes hid the face but that does not concern me he reflected it does not affect my position at all he never knew who had thrashed him he could not have known razumov felt sorry for the old lover of the bottle and women  yes some of them end like that he muttered what is your idea sophia antonovna  it was really the idea of her correspondent but sophia antonovna had adopted it fully she stated it in one wordremorse razumov opened his eyes very wide at that sophia antonovnas informant by listening to the talk of the house by putting this and that together had managed to come very near to the truth of haldins relation to ziemianitch  it is i who can tell you what you were not certain ofthat your friend had some plan for saving himself afterwards for getting out of st petersburg at any rate perhaps that and no more trusting to luck for the rest and that fellows horses were part of the plan  they have actually got at the truth razumov marvelled to himself while he nodded judicially yes thats possible very possible but the woman revolutionist was very positive that it was so first of all a conversation about horses between haldin and ziemianitch had been partly overheard then there were the suspicions of the people in the house when their young gentleman they did not know haldin by his name ceased to call at the house some of them used to charge ziemianitch with knowing something of this absence he denied it with exasperation but the fact was that ever since haldins disappearance he was not himself growing moody and thin finally during a quarrel with some woman to whom he was making up in which most of the inmates of the house took part apparently he was openly abused by his chief enemy an athletic pedlar for an informer and for having driven our young gentleman to siberia the same as you did those young fellows who broke into houses in consequence of this there was a fight and ziemianitch got flung down a flight of stairs thereupon he drank and moped for a week and then hanged himself  sophia antonovna drew her conclusions from the tale she charged ziemianitch either with drunken indiscretion as to a driving job on a certain date overheard by some spy in some low grogshopperhaps in the very eatingshop on the ground floor of the houseor maybe a downright denunciation followed by remorse a man like that would be capable of anything people said he was a flighty old chap and if he had been once before mixed up with the policeas seemed certain though he always denied itin connexion with these thieves he would be sure to be acquainted with some police underlings always on the look out for something to report possibly at first his tale was not made anything of till the day that scoundrel de p got his deserts ah but then every bit and scrap of hint and information would be acted on and fatally they were bound to get haldin  sophia antonovna spread out her handsfatally  fatalitychance razumov meditated in silent astonishment upon the queer verisimilitude of these inferences they were obviously to his advantage  it is right now to make this conclusive evidence known generally sophia antonovna was very calm and deliberate again she had received the letter three days ago but did not write at once to peter ivanovitch she knew then that she would have the opportunity presently of meeting several men of action assembled for an important purpose  i thought it would be more effective if i could show the letter itself at large i have it in my pocket now you understand how pleased i was to come upon you  razumov was saying to himself she wont offer to show the letter to me not likely has she told me everything that correspondent of hers has found out he longed to see the letter but he felt he must not ask  tell me please was this an investigation ordered as it were  no no she protested there you are again with your sensitiveness it makes you stupid dont you see there was no startingpoint for an investigation even if any one had thought of it a perfect blank thats exactly what some people were pointing out as the reason for receiving you cautiously it was all perfectly accidental arising from my informant striking an acquaintance with an intelligent skindresser lodging in that particular slumhouse a wonderful coincidence  a pious person suggested razumov with a pale smile would say that the hand of god has done it all  my poor father would have said that sophia antonovna did not smile she dropped her eyes not that his god ever helped him its a long time since god has done anything for the people anyway its done  all this would be quite final said razumov with every appearance of reflective impartiality if there was any certitude that the our young gentleman of these people was victor haldin have we got that  yes theres no mistake my correspondent was as familiar with haldins personal appearance as with your own the woman affirmed decisively  its the rednosed fellow beyond a doubt razumov said to himself with reawakened uneasiness had his own visit to that accursed house passed unnoticed it was barely possible yet it was hardly probable it was just the right sort of food for the popular gossip that gaunt busybody had been picking up but the letter did not seem to contain any allusion to that unless she had suppressed it and if so why if it had really escaped the prying of that hungerstricken democrat with a confounded genius for recognizing people from description it could only be for a time he would come upon it presently and hasten to write another letterand then  for all the envenomed recklessness of his temper fed on hate and disdain razumov shuddered inwardly it guarded him from common fear but it could not defend him from disgust at being dealt with in any way by these people it was a sort of superstitious dread now since his position had been made more secure by their own folly at the cost of ziemianitch he felt the need of perfect safety with its freedom from direct lying with its power of moving amongst them silent unquestioning listening impenetrable like the very fate of their crimes and their folly was this advantage his already or not yet or never would be  well sophia antonovna his air of reluctant concession was genuine in so far that he was really loath to part with her without testing her sincerity by a question it was impossible to bring about in any way well sophia antonovna if that is so then  the creature has done justice to himself the woman observed as if thinking aloud  what ah yes remorse razumov muttered with equivocal contempt  dont be harsh kirylo sidorovitch if you have lost a friend there was no hint of softness in her tone only the black glitter of her eyes seemed detached for an instant from vengeful visions he was a man of the people the simple russian soul is never wholly impenitent its something to know that  consoling insinuated razumov in a tone of inquiry  leave off railing she checked him explosively remember razumov that women children and revolutionists hate irony which is the negation of all saving instincts of all faith of all devotion of all action dont rail leave off i dont know how it is but there are moments when you are abhorrent to me  she averted her face a languid silence as if all the electricity of the situation had been discharged in this flash of passion lasted for some time razumov had not flinched suddenly she laid the tips of her fingers on his sleeve  dont mind  i dont mind he said very quietly  he was proud to feel that she could read nothing on his face he was really mollified relieved if only for a moment from an obscure oppression and suddenly he asked himself why the devil did i go to that house it was an imbecile thing to do  a profound disgust came over him sophia antonovna lingered talking in a friendly manner with an evident conciliatory intention and it was still about the famous letter referring to various minute details given by her informant who had never seen ziemianitch the victim of remorse had been buried several weeks before her correspondent began frequenting the house itthe housecontained very good revolutionary material the spirit of the heroic haldin had passed through these dens of black wretchedness with a promise of universal redemption from all the miseries that oppress mankind razumov listened without hearing gnawed by the newborn desire of safety with its independence from that degrading method of direct lying which at times he found it almost impossible to practice  no the point he wanted to hear about could never come into this conversation there was no way of bringing it forward he regretted not having composed a perfect story for use abroad in which his fatal connexion with the house might have been owned up to but when he left russia he did not know that ziemianitch had hanged himself and anyway who could have foreseen this womans informant stumbling upon that particular slum of all the slums awaiting destruction in the purifying flame of social revolution who could have foreseen nobody its a perfect diabolic surprise thought razumov calmfaced in his attitude of inscrutable superiority nodding assent to sophia antonovnas remarks upon the psychology of the people oh yescertainly rather coldly but with a nervous longing in his fingers to tear some sort of confession out of her throat  then at the very last on the point of separating the feeling of relaxed tension already upon him he heard sophia antonovna allude to the subject of his uneasiness how it came about he could only guess his mind being absent at the moment but it must have sprung from sophia antonovnas complaints of the illogical absurdity of the people for instancethat ziemianitch was notoriously irreligious and yet in the last weeks of his life he suffered from the notion that he had been beaten by the devil  the devil repeated razumov as though he had not heard aright  the actual devil the devil in person you may well look astonished kirylo sidorovitch early on the very night poor haldin was taken a complete stranger turned up and gave ziemianitch a most fearful thrashing while he was lying deaddrunk in the stable the wretched creatures body was one mass of bruises he showed them to the people in the house  but you sophia antonovna you dont believe in the actual devil  do you retorted the woman curtly not but that there are plenty of men worse than devils to make a hell of this earth she muttered to herself  razumov watched her vigorous and whitehaired with the deep fold between her thin eyebrows and her black glance turned idly away it was obvious that she did not make much of the storyunless indeed this was the perfection of duplicity a dark young man she explained further never seen there before never seen afterwards why are you smiling razumov  at the devil being still young after all these ages he answered composedly but who was able to describe him since the victim you say was deaddrunk at the time  oh the eatinghouse keeper has described him an overbearing swarthy young man in a students cloak who came rushing in demanded ziemianitch beat him furiously and rushed away without a word leaving the eatinghouse keeper paralysed with astonishment  does he too believe it was the devil  that i cant say i am told hes very reserved on the matter those sellers of spirits are great scoundrels generally i should think he knows more of it than anybody  well and you sophia antonovna whats your theory asked razumov in a tone of great interest yours and your informants who is on the spot  i agree with him some policehound in disguise who else could beat a helpless man so unmercifully as for the rest if they were out that day on every trail old and new it is probable enough that they might have thought it just as well to have ziemianitch at hand for more information or for identification or what not some scoundrelly detective was sent to fetch him along and being vexed at finding him so drunk broke a stable fork over his ribs later on after they had the big game safe in the net they troubled their heads no more about that peasant  such were the last words of the woman revolutionist in this conversation keeping so close to the truth departing from it so far in the verisimilitude of thoughts and conclusions as to give one the notion of the invincible nature of human error a glimpse into the utmost depths of selfdeception razumov after shaking hands with sophia antonovna left the grounds crossed the road and walking out on the little steamboat pier leaned over the rail  his mind was at ease ease such as he had not known for many days ever since that nightthe night the conversation with the woman revolutionist had given him the view of his danger at the very moment this danger vanished characteristically enough i ought to have foreseen the doubts that would arise in those peoples minds he thought then his attention being attracted by a stone of peculiar shape which he could see clearly lying at the bottom he began to speculate as to the depth of water in that spot but very soon with a start of wonder at this extraordinary instance of illtimed detachment he returned to his train of thought i ought to have told very circumstantial lies from the first he said to himself with a mortal distaste of the mere idea which silenced his mental utterance for quite a perceptible interval luckily thats all right now he reflected and after a time spoke to himself half aloud thanks to the devil and laughed a little  the end of ziemianitch then arrested his wandering thoughts he was not exactly amused at the interpretation but he could not help detecting in it a certain piquancy he owned to himself that had he known of that suicide before leaving russia he would have been incapable of making such excellent use of it for his own purposes he ought to be infinitely obliged to the fellow with the red nose for his patience and ingenuity a wonderful psychologist apparently he said to himself sarcastically remorse indeed it was a striking example of your true conspirators blindness of the stupid subtlety of people with one idea this was a drama of love not of conscience razumov continued to himself mockingly a woman the old fellow was making up to a robust pedlar clearly a rival throwing him down a flight of stairs and at sixty for a lifelong lover it was not an easy matter to get over that was a feminist of a different stamp from peter ivanovitch even the comfort of the bottle might conceivably fail him in this supreme crisis at such an age nothing but a halter could cure the pangs of an unquenchable passion and besides there was the wild exasperation aroused by the unjust aspersions and the contumely of the house with the maddening impossibility to account for that mysterious thrashing added to these simple and bitter sorrows devil eh razumov exclaimed with mental excitement as if he had made an interesting discovery ziemianitch ended by falling into mysticism so many of our true russian souls end in that way very characteristic he felt pity for ziemianitch a large neutral pity such as one may feel for an unconscious multitude a great people seen from abovelike a community of crawling ants working out its destiny it was as if this ziemianitch could not possibly have done anything else and sophia antonovnas cocksure and contemptuous some policehound was characteristically russian in another way but there was no tragedy there this was a comedy of errors it was as if the devil himself were playing a game with all of them in turn first with him then with ziemianitch then with those revolutionists the devils own game this he interrupted his earnest mental soliloquy with a jocular thought at his own expense hallo i am falling into mysticism too  his mind was more at ease than ever turning about he put his back against the rail comfortably all this fits with marvellous aptness he continued to think the brilliance of my reputed exploit is no longer darkened by the fate of my supposed colleague the mystic ziemianitch accounts for that an incredible chance has served me no more need of lies i shall have only to listen and to keep my scorn from getting the upper hand of my caution  he sighed folded his arms his chin dropped on his breast and it was a long time before he started forward from that pose with the recollection that he had made up his mind to do something important that day what it was he could not immediately recall yet he made no effort of memory for he was uneasily certain that he would remember presently  he had not gone more than a hundred yards towards the town when he slowed down almost faltered in his walk at the sight of a figure walking in the contrary direction draped in a cloak under a soft broadbrimmed hat picturesque but diminutive as if seen through the big end of an operaglass it was impossible to avoid that tiny man for there was no issue for retreat  another one going to that mysterious meeting thought razumov he was right in his surmise only this one unlike the others who came from a distance was known to him personally still he hoped to pass on with a mere bow but it was impossible to ignore the little thin hand with hairy wrist and knuckles protruded in a friendly wave from under the folds of the cloak worn spanishwise in disregard of a fairly warm day a corner flung over the shoulder  and how is herr razumov sounded the greeting in german by that alone made more odious to the object of the affable recognition at closer quarters the diminutive personage looked like a reduction of an ordinarysized man with a lofty brow bared for a moment by the raising of the hat the great pepperand salt full beard spread over the proportionally broad chest a fine bold nose jutted over a thin mouth hidden in the mass of fine hair all this accented features strong limbs in their relative smallness appeared delicate without the slightest sign of debility the eyes alone almondshaped and brown were too big with the whites slightly bloodshot by much pen labour under a lamp the obscure celebrity of the tiny man was well known to razumov polyglot of unknown parentage of indefinite nationality anarchist with a pedantic and ferocious temperament and an amazingly inflammatory capacity for invective he was a power in the background this violent pamphleteer clamouring for revolutionary justice this julius laspara editor of the living word confidant of conspirators inditer of sanguinary menaces and manifestos suspected of being in the secret of every plot laspara lived in the old town in a sombre narrow house presented to him by a naive middleclass admirer of his humanitarian eloquence with him lived his two daughters who overtopped him head and shoulders and a pastyfaced lean boy of six languishing in the dark rooms in blue cotton overalls and clumsy boots who might have belonged to either one of them or to neither no stranger could tell julius laspara no doubt knew which of his girls it was who after casually vanishing for a few years had as casually returned to him possessed of that child but with admirable pedantry he had refrained from asking her for detailsno not so much as the name of the father because maternity should be an anarchist function razumov had been admitted twice to that suite of several small dark rooms on the top floor dusty windowpanes litter of all sorts of sweepings all over the place halffull glasses of tea forgotten on every table the two laspara daughters prowling about enigmatically silent sleepyeyed corsetless and generally in their want of shape and the disorder of their rumpled attire resembling old dolls the great but obscure julius his feet twisted round his threelegged stool always ready to receive the visitors the pen instantly dropped the body screwed round with a striking display of the lofty brow and of the great austere beard when he got down from his stool it was as though he had descended from the heights of olympus he was dwarfed by his daughters by the furniture by any caller of ordinary stature but he very seldom left it and still more rarely was seen walking in broad daylight  it must have been some matter of serious importance which had driven him out in that direction that afternoon evidently he wished to be amiable to that young man whose arrival had made some sensation in the world of political refugees in russian now which he spoke as he spoke and wrote four or five other european languages without distinction and without force other than that of invective he inquired if razumov had taken his inscriptions at the university as yet and the young man shaking his head negatively  theres plenty of time for that but meantime are you not going to write something for us  he could not understand how any one could refrain from writing on anything social economic historicalanything any subject could be treated in the right spirit and for the ends of social revolution and as it happened a friend of his in london had got in touch with a review of advanced ideas we must educate educate everybodydevelop the great thought of absolute liberty and of revolutionary justice  razumov muttered rather surlily that he did not even know english  write in russian well have it translated there can be no difficulty why without seeking further there is miss haldin my daughters go to see her sometimes he nodded significantly she does nothing has never done anything in her life she would be quite competent with a little assistance only write you know you must and so goodbye for the present  he raised his arm and went on razumov backed against the low wall looked after him spat violently and went on his way with an angry mutter  cursed jew  he did not know anything about it julius laspara might have been a transylvanian a turk an andalusian or a citizen of one of the hanse towns for anything he could tell to the contrary but this is not a story of the west and this exclamation must be recorded accompanied by the comment that it was merely an expression of hate and contempt best adapted to the nature of the feelings razumov suffered from at the time he was boiling with rage as though he had been grossly insulted he walked as if blind following instinctively the shore of the diminutive harbour along the quay through a pretty dull garden where dull people sat on chairs under the trees till his fury abandoning him he discovered himself in the middle of a long broad bridge he slowed down at once to his right beyond the toylike jetties he saw the green slopes framing the petit lac in all the marvellous banality of the picturesque made of painted cardboard with the more distant stretch of water inanimate and shining like a piece of tin  he turned his head away from that view for the tourists and walked on slowly his eyes fixed on the ground one or two persons had to get out of his way and then turned round to give a surprised stare to his profound absorption the insistence of the celebrated subversive journalist rankled in his mind strangely write must write he write a sudden light flashed upon him to write was the very thing he had made up his mind to do that day he had made up his mind irrevocably to that step and then had forgotten all about it that incorrigible tendency to escape from the grip of the situation was fraught with serious danger he was ready to despise himself for it what was it levity or deepseated weakness or an unconscious dread  is it that i am shrinking it cant be its impossible to shrink now would be worse than moral suicide it would be nothing less than moral damnation he thought is it possible that i have a conventional conscience  he rejected that hypothesis with scorn and checked on the edge of the pavement made ready to cross the road and proceed up the wide street facing the head of the bridge and that for no other reason except that it was there before him but at the moment a couple of carriages and a slowmoving cart interposed and suddenly he turned sharp to the left following the quay again but now away from the lake  it may be just my health he thought allowing himself a very unusual doubt of his soundness for with the exception of a childish ailment or two he had never been ill in his life but that was a danger too only it seemed as though he were being looked after in a specially remarkable way if i believed in an active providence razumov said to himself amused grimly i would see here the working of an ironical finger to have a julius laspara put in my way as if expressly to remind me of my purpose iswrite he had said i must writei must indeed i shall writenever fear certainly thats why i am here and for the future i shall have something to write about  he was exciting himself by this mental soliloquy but the idea of writing evoked the thought of a place to write in of shelter of privacy and naturally of his lodgings mingled with a distaste for the necessary exertion of getting there with a mistrust as of some hostile influence awaiting him within those odious four walls  suppose one of these revolutionists he asked himself were to take a fancy to call on me while i am writing the mere prospect of such an interruption made him shudder one could lock ones door or ask the tobacconist downstairs some sort of a refugee himself to tell inquirers that one was not in not very good precautions those the manner of his life he felt must be kept clear of every cause for suspicion or even occasion for wonder down to such trifling occurrences as a delay in opening a locked door i wish i were in the middle of some field miles away from everywhere he thought  he had unconsciously turned to the left once more and now was aware of being on a bridge again this one was much narrower than the other and instead of being straight made a sort of elbow or angle at the point of that angle a short arm joined it to a hexagonal islet with a soil of gravel and its shores faced with dressed stone a perfection of puerile neatness a couple of tall poplars and a few other trees stood grouped on the clean dark gravel and under them a few garden benches and a bronze effigy of jean jacques rousseau seated on its pedestal  on setting his foot on it razumov became aware that except for the woman in charge of the refreshment chalet he would be alone on the island there was something of naive odious and inane simplicity about that unfrequented tiny crumb of earth named after jean jacques rousseau something pretentious and shabby too he asked for a glass of milk which he drank standing at one draught nothing but tea had passed his lips since the morning and was going away with a weary lagging step when a thought stopped him short he had found precisely what he needed if solitude could ever be secured in the open air in the middle of a town he would have it there on this absurd island together with the faculty of watching the only approach  he went back heavily to a garden seat dropped into it this was the place for making a beginning of that writing which had to be done the materials he had on him i shall always come here he said to himself and afterwards sat for quite a long time motionless without thought and sight and hearing almost without life he sat long enough for the declining sun to dip behind the roofs of the town at his back and throw the shadow of the houses on the lake front over the islet before he pulled out of his pocket a fountain pen opened a small notebook on his knee and began to write quickly raising his eyes now and then at the connecting arm of the bridge these glances were needless the people crossing over in the distance seemed unwilling even to look at the islet where the exiled effigy of the author of the social contract sat enthroned above the bowed head of razumov in the sombre immobility of bronze after finishing his scribbling razumov with a sort of feverish haste put away the pen then rammed the notebook into his pocket first tearing out the written pages with an almost convulsive brusqueness but the folding of the flimsy batch on his knee was executed with thoughtful nicety that done he leaned back in his seat and remained motionless the papers holding in his left hand the twilight had deepened he got up and began to pace to and fro slowly under the trees  there can be no doubt that now i am safe he thought his fine ear could detect the faintly accentuated murmurs of the current breaking against the point of the island and he forgot himself in listening to them with interest but even to his acute sense of hearing the sound was too elusive  extraordinary occupation i am giving myself up to he murmured and it occurred to him that this was about the only sound he could listen to innocently and for his own pleasure as it were yes the sound of water the voice of the windcompletely foreign to human passions all the other sounds of this earth brought contamination to the solitude of a soul  this was mr razumovs feeling the soul of course being his own and the word being used not in the theological sense but standing as far as i can understand it for that part of mr razumov which was not his body and more specially in danger from the fires of this earth and it must be admitted that in mr razumovs case the bitterness of solitude from which he suffered was not an altogether morbid phenomenon    part four    i   that i should at the beginning of this retrospect mention again that mr razumovs youth had no one in the world as literally no one as it can be honestly affirmed of any human being is but a statement of fact from a man who believes in the psychological value of facts there is also perhaps a desire of punctilious fairness unidentified with anyone in this narrative where the aspects of honour and shame are remote from the ideas of the western world and taking my stand on the ground of common humanity it is for that very reason that i feel a strange reluctance to state baldly here what every reader has most likely already discovered himself such reluctance may appear absurd if it were not for the thought that because of the imperfection of language there is always something ungracious and even disgraceful in the exhibition of naked truth but the time has come when councillor of state mikulin can no longer be ignored his simple question where to on which we left mr razumov in st petersburg throws a light on the general meaning of this individual case  where to was the answer in the form of a gentle question to what we may call mr razumovs declaration of independence the question was not menacing in the least and indeed had the ring of innocent inquiry had it been taken in a merely topographical sense the only answer to it would have appeared sufficiently appalling to mr razumov where to back to his rooms where the revolution had sought him out to put to a sudden test his dormant instincts his halfconscious thoughts and almost wholly unconscious ambitions by the touch as of some furious and dogmatic religion with its call to frantic sacrifices its tender resignations its dreams and hopes uplifting the soul by the side of the most sombre moods of despair and mr razumov had let go the doorhandle and had come back to the middle of the room asking councillor mikulin angrily what do you mean by it  as far as i can tell councillor mikulin did not answer that question he drew mr razumov into familiar conversation it is the peculiarity of russian natures that however strongly engaged in the drama of action they are still turning their ear to the murmur of abstract ideas this conversation and others later on need not be recorded suffice it to say that it brought mr razumov as we know him to the test of another faith there was nothing official in its expression and mr razumov was led to defend his attitude of detachment but councillor mikulin would have none of his arguments for a man like you were his last weighty words in the discussion such a position is impossible dont forget that i have seen that interesting piece of paper i understand your liberalism i have an intellect of that kind myself reform for me is mainly a question of method but the principle of revolt is a physical intoxication a sort of hysteria which must be kept away from the masses you agree to this without reserve dont you because you see kirylo sidorovitch abstention reserve in certain situations come very near to political crime the ancient greeks understood that very well  mr razumov listening with a faint smile asked councillor mikulin pointblank if this meant that he was going to have him watched  the high official took no offence at the cynical inquiry  no kirylo sidorovitch he answered gravely i dont mean to have you watched  razumov suspecting a lie affected yet the greatest liberty of mind during the short remainder of that interview the older man expressed himself throughout in familiar terms and with a sort of shrewd simplicity razumov concluded that to get to the bottom of that mind was an impossible feat a great disquiet made his heart beat quicker the high official issuing from behind the desk was actually offering to shake hands with him  goodbye mr razumov an understanding between intelligent men is always a satisfactory occurrence is it not and of course these rebel gentlemen have not the monopoly of intelligence  i presume that i shall not be wanted any more razumov brought out that question while his hand was still being grasped councillor mikulin released it slowly  that mr razumov he said with great earnestness is as it may be god alone knows the future but you may rest assured that i never thought of having you watched you are a young man of great independence yes you are going away free as air but you shall end by coming back to us  i i razumov exclaimed in an appalled murmur of protest what for he added feebly  yes you yourself kirylo sidorovitch the high police functionary insisted in a low severe tone of conviction you shall be coming back to us some of our greatest minds had to do that in the end  you have no better friend than prince k and as to myself it is a long time now since ive been honoured by his  he glanced down his beard  i wont detain you any longer we live in difficult times in times of monstrous chimeras and evil dreams and criminal follies we shall certainly meet once more it may be some little time though before we do till then may heaven send you fruitful reflections once in the street razumov started off rapidly without caring for the direction at first he thought of nothing but in a little while the consciousness of his position presented itself to him as something so ugly dangerous and absurd the difficulty of ever freeing himself from the toils of that complication so insoluble that the idea of going back and as he termed it to himself confessing to councillor mikulin flashed through his mind  go back what for confess to what i have been speaking to him with the greatest openness he said to himself with perfect truth what else could i tell him that i have undertaken to carry a message to that brute ziemianitch establish a false complicity and destroy what chance of safety i have won for nothingwhat folly  yet he could not defend himself from fancying that councillor mikulin was perhaps the only man in the world able to understand his conduct to be understood appeared extremely fascinating  on the way home he had to stop several times all his strength seemed to run out of his limbs and in the movement of the busy streets isolated as if in a desert he remained suddenly motionless for a minute or so before he could proceed on his way he reached his rooms at last  then came an illness something in the nature of a low fever which all at once removed him to a great distance from the perplexing actualities from his very room even he never lost consciousness he only seemed to himself to be existing languidly somewhere very far away from everything that had ever happened to him he came out of this state slowly with an effect that is to say of extreme slowness though the actual number of days was not very great and when he had got back into the middle of things they were all changed subtly and provokingly in their nature inanimate objects human faces the landlady the rustic servantgirl the staircase the streets the very air he tackled these changed conditions in a spirit of severity he walked to and fro to the university ascended stairs paced the passages listened to lectures took notes crossed courtyards in angry aloofness his teeth set hard till his jaws ached  he was perfectly aware of madcap kostia gazing like a young retriever from a distance of the famished student with the red drooping nose keeping scrupulously away as desired of twenty others perhaps he knew well enough to speak to and they all had an air of curiosity and concern as if they expected something to happen this cant last much longer thought razumov more than once on certain days he was afraid that anyone addressing him suddenly in a certain way would make him scream out insanely a lot of filthy abuse often after returning home he would drop into a chair in his cap and cloak and remain still for hours holding some book he had got from the library in his hand or he would pick up the little penknife and sit there scraping his nails endlessly and feeling furious all the timesimply furious this is impossible he would mutter suddenly to the empty room  fact to be noted this room might conceivably have become physically repugnant to him emotionally intolerable morally uninhabitable but no nothing of the sort and he had himself dreaded it at first nothing of the sort happened on the contrary he liked his lodgings better than any other shelter he who had never known a home had ever hired before he liked his lodgings so well that often on that very account he found a certain difficulty in making up his mind to go out it resembled a physical seduction such as for instance makes a man reluctant to leave the neighbourhood of a fire on a cold day  for as at that time he seldom stirred except to go to the university what else was there to do it followed that whenever he went abroad he felt himself at once closely involved in the moral consequences of his act it was there that the dark prestige of the haldin mystery fell on him clung to him like a poisoned robe it was impossible to fling off he suffered from it exceedingly as well as from the conversational commonplace unavoidable intercourse with the other kind of students they must be wondering at the change in me he reflected anxiously he had an uneasy recollection of having savagely told one or two innocent nice enough fellows to go to the devil once a married professor he used to call upon formerly addressed him in passing how is it we never see you at our wednesdays now kirylo sidorovitch razumov was conscious of meeting this advance with odious muttering boorishness the professor was obviously too astonished to be offended all this was bad and all this was haldin always haldinnothing but haldineverywhere haldin a moral spectre infinitely more effective than any visible apparition of the dead it was only the room through which that man had blundered on his way from crime to death that his spectre did not seem to be able to haunt not to be exact that he was ever completely absent from it but that there he had no sort of power there it was razumov who had the upper hand in a composed sense of his own superiority a vanquished phantomnothing more often in the evening his repaired watch faintly ticking on the table by the side of the lighted lamp razumov would look up from his writing and stare at the bed with an expectant dispassionate attention nothing was to be seen there he never really supposed that anything ever could be seen there after a while he would shrug his shoulders slightly and bend again over his work for he had gone to work and at first with some success his unwillingness to leave that place where he was safe from haldin grew so strong that at last he ceased to go out at all from early morning till far into the night he wrote he wrote for nearly a week never looking at the time and only throwing himself on the bed when he could keep his eyes open no longer then one afternoon quite casually he happened to glance at his watch he laid down his pen slowly  at this very hour was his thought the fellow stole unseen into this room while i was out and there he sat quiet as a mouseperhaps in this very chair razumov got up and began to pace the floor steadily glancing at the watch now and then this is the time when i returned and found him standing against the stove he observed to himself when it grew dark he lit his lamp later on he interrupted his tramping once more only to wave away angrily the girl who attempted to enter the room with tea and something to eat on a tray and presently he noted the watch pointing at the hour of his own going forth into the falling snow on that terrible errand  complicity he muttered faintly and resumed his pacing keeping his eye on the hands as they crept on slowly to the time of his return  and after all he thought suddenly i might have been the chosen instrument of providence this is a manner of speaking but there may be truth in every manner of speaking what if that absurd saying were true in its essence  he meditated for a while then sat down his legs stretched out with stony eyes and with his arms hanging down on each side of the chair like a man totally abandoned by providencedesolate  he noted the time of haldins departure and continued to sit still for another halfhour then muttering and now to work drew up to the table seized the pen and instantly dropped it under the influence of a profoundly disquieting reflection theres three weeks gone by and no word from mikulin  what did it mean was he forgotten possibly then why not remain forgottencreep in somewhere hide but where how with whom in what hole and was it to be for ever or what  but a retreat was big with shadowy dangers the eye of the social revolution was on him and razumov for a moment felt an unnamed and despairing dread mingled with an odious sense of humiliation was it possible that he no longer belonged to himself this was damnable but why not simply keep on as before study advance work hard as if nothing had happened and first of all win the silver medal acquire distinction become a great reforming servant of the greatest of states servant too of the mightiest homogeneous mass of mankind with a capability for logical guided development in a brotherly solidarity of force and aim such as the world had never dreamt of the russian nation  calm resolved steady in his great purpose he was stretching his hand towards the pen when he happened to glance towards the bed he rushed at it enraged with a mental scream its you crazy fanatic who stands in the way he flung the pillow on the floor violently tore the blankets aside nothing there and turning away he caught for an instant in the air like a vivid detail in a dissolving view of two heads the eyes of general t and of privycouncillor mikulin side by side fixed upon him quite different in character but with the same unflinching and weary and yet purposeful expressionservants of the nation  razumov tottered to the washstand very alarmed about himself drank some water and bathed his forehead this will pass and leave no trace he thought confidently i am all right but as to supposing that he had been forgotten it was perfect nonsense he was a marked man on that side and that was nothing it was what that miserable phantom stood for which had to be got out of the way if one only could go and spit it all out at some of themand take the consequences  he imagined himself accosting the rednosed student and suddenly shaking his fist in his face from that one though he reflected theres nothing to be got because he has no mind of his own hes living in a red democratic trance ah you want to smash your way into universal happiness my boy i will give you universal happiness you silly hypnotized ghoul you and what about my own happiness eh havent i got any right to it just because i can think for myself  and again but with a different mental accent razumov said to himself i am young everything can be lived down at that moment he was crossing the room slowly intending to sit down on the sofa and try to compose his thoughts but before he had got so far everything abandoned himhope courage belief in himself trust in men his heart had as it were suddenly emptied itself it was no use struggling on rest work solitude and the frankness of intercourse with his kind were alike forbidden to him everything was gone his existence was a great cold blank something like the enormous plain of the whole of russia levelled with snow and fading gradually on all sides into shadows and mists  he sat down with swimming head closed his eyes and remained like that sitting bolt upright on the sofa and perfectly awake for the rest of the night till the girl bustling into the outer room with the samovar thumped with her fist on the door calling out kirylo sidorovitch please it is time for you to get up  then pale like a corpse obeying the dread summons of judgement razumov opened his eyes and got up   nobody will be surprised to hear i suppose that when the summons came he went to see councillor mikulin it came that very morning while looking white and shaky like an invalid just out of bed he was trying to shave himself the envelope was addressed in the little attorneys handwriting that envelope contained another superscribed to razumov in prince ks hand with the request please forward under cover at once in a corner the note inside was an autograph of councillor mikulin the writer stated candidly that nothing had arisen which needed clearing up but nevertheless appointed a meeting with mr razumov at a certain address in town which seemed to be that of an oculist  razumov read it finished shaving dressed looked at the note again and muttered gloomily oculist he pondered over it for a time lit a match and burned the two envelopes and the enclosure carefully afterwards he waited sitting perfectly idle and not even looking at anything in particular till the appointed hour drew nearand then went out  whether looking at the unofficial character of the summons he might have refrained from attending to it is hard to say probably not at any rate he went but whats more he went with a certain eagerness which may appear incredible till it is remembered that councillor mikulin was the only person on earth with whom razumov could talk taking the haldin adventure for granted and haldin when once taken for granted was no longer a haunting falsehoodbreeding spectre whatever troubling power he exercised in all the other places of the earth razumov knew very well that at this oculists address he would be merely the hanged murderer of m de p and nothing more for the dead can live only with the exact intensity and quality of the life imparted to them by the living so mr razumov certain of relief went to meet councillor mikulin with he eagerness of a pursued person welcoming any sort of shelter  this much said there is no need to tell anything more of that first interview and of the several others to the morality of a western reader an account of these meetings would wear perhaps the sinister character of old legendary tales where the enemy of mankind is represented holding subtly mendacious dialogues with some tempted soul it is not my part to protest let me but remark that the evil one with his single passion of satanic pride for the only motive is yet on a larger modern view allowed to be not quite so black as he used to be painted with what greater latitude then should we appraise the exact shade of mere mortal man with his many passions and his miserable ingenuity in error always dazzled by the base glitter of mixed motives everlastingly betrayed by a shortsighted wisdom  councillor mikulin was one of those powerful officials who in a position not obscure not occult but simply inconspicuous exercise a great influence over the methods rather than over the conduct of affairs a devotion to church and throne is not in itself a criminal sentiment to prefer the will of one to the will of many does not argue the possession of a black heart or prove congenital idiocy councillor mikulin was not only a clever but also a faithful official privately he was a bachelor with a love of comfort living alone in an apartment of five rooms luxuriously furnished and was known by his intimates to be an enlightened patron of the art of female dancing later on the larger world first heard of him in the very hour of his downfall during one of those state trials which astonish and puzzle the average plain man who reads the newspapers by a glimpse of unsuspected intrigues and in the stir of vaguely seen monstrosities in that momentary mysterious disturbance of muddy waters councillor mikulin went under dignified with only a calm emphatic protest of his innocencenothing more no disclosures damaging to a harassed autocracy complete fidelity to the secrets of the miserable arcana imperii deposited in his patriotic breast a display of bureaucratic stoicism in a russian officials ineradicable almost sublime contempt for truth stoicism of silence understood only by the very few of the initiated and not without a certain cynical grandeur of selfsacrifice on the part of a sybarite for the terribly heavy sentence turned councillor mikulin civilly into a corpse and actually into something very much like a common convict  it seems that the savage autocracy no more than the divine democracy does not limit its diet exclusively to the bodies of its enemies it devours its friends and servants as well the downfall of his excellency gregory gregorievitch mikulin which did not occur till some years later completes all that is known of the man but at the time of m de ps murder or execution councillor mikulin under the modest style of head of department at the general secretariat exercised a wide influence as the confidant and righthand man of his former schoolfellow and lifelong friend general t one can imagine them talking over the case of mr razumov with the full sense of their unbounded power over all the lives in russia with cursory disdain like two olympians glancing at a worm the relationship with prince k was enough to save razumov from some carelessly arbitrary proceeding and it is also very probable that after the interview at the secretariat he would have been left alone councillor mikulin would not have forgotten him he forgot no one who ever fell under his observation but would have simply dropped him for ever councillor mikulin was a goodnatured man and wished no harm to anyone besides with his own reforming tendencies he was favourably impressed by that young student the son of prince k and apparently no fool  but as fate would have it while mr razumov was finding that no way of life was possible to him councillor mikulins discreet abilities were rewarded by a very responsible postnothing less than the direction of the general police supervision over europe and it was then and then only when taking in hand the perfecting of the service which watches the revolutionist activities abroad that he thought again of mr razumov he saw great possibilities of special usefulness in that uncommon young man on whom he had a hold already with his peculiar temperament his unsettled mind and shaken conscience a struggling in the toils of a false position it was as if the revolutionists themselves had put into his hand that tool so much finer than the common base instruments so perfectly fitted if only vested with sufficient credit to penetrate into places inaccessible to common informers providential providential and prince k taken into the secret was ready enough to adopt that mystical view too it will be necessary though to make a career for him afterwards he had stipulated anxiously oh absolutely we shall make that our affair mikulin had agreed prince ks mysticism was of an artless kind but councillor mikulin was astute enough for two  things and men have always a certain sense a certain side by which they must be got hold of if one wants to obtain a solid grasp and a perfect command the power of councillor mikulin consisted in the ability to seize upon that sense that side in the men he used it did not matter to him what it wasvanity despair love hate greed intelligent pride or stupid conceit it was all one to him as long as the man could be made to serve the obscure unrelated young student razumov in the moment of great moral loneliness was allowed to feel that he was an object of interest to a small group of people of high position prince k was persuaded to intervene personally and on a certain occasion gave way to a manly emotion which all unexpected as it was quite upset mr razumov the sudden embrace of that man agitated by his loyalty to a throne and by suppressed paternal affection was a revelation to mr razumov of something within his own breast  so that was it he exclaimed to himself a sort of contemptuous tenderness softened the young mans grim view of his position as he reflected upon that agitated interview with prince k this simpleminded worldly exguardsman and senator whose soft grey official whiskers had brushed against his cheek his aristocratic and convinced father was he a whit less estimable or more absurd than that faminestricken fanatical revolutionist the rednosed student  and there was some pressure too besides the persuasiveness mr razumov was always being made to feel that he had committed himself there was no getting away from that feeling from that soft unanswerable where to of councillor mikulin but no susceptibilities were ever hurt it was to be a dangerous mission to geneva for obtaining at a critical moment absolutely reliable information from a very inaccessible quarter of the inner revolutionary circle there were indications that a very serious plot was being matured the repose indispensable to a great country was at stake a great scheme of orderly reforms would be endangered the highest personages in the land were patriotically uneasy and so on in short councillor mikulin knew what to say this skill is to be inferred clearly from the mental and psychological selfconfession selfanalysis of mr razumovs written journalthe pitiful resource of a young man who had near him no trusted intimacy no natural affection to turn to  how all this preliminary work was concealed from observation need not be recorded the expedient of the oculist gives a sufficient instance councillor mikulin was resourceful and the task not very difficult any fellowstudent even the rednosed one was perfectly welcome to see mr razumov entering a private house to consult an oculist ultimate success depended solely on the revolutionary selfdelusion which credited razumov with a mysterious complicity in the haldin affair to be compromised in it was credit enoughand it was their own doing it was precisely that which stamped mr razumov as a providential man wide as poles apart from the usual type of agent for european supervision  and it was that which the secretariat set itself the task to foster by a course of calculated and false indiscretions  it came at last to this that one evening mr razumov was unexpectedly called upon by one of the thinking students whom formerly before the haldin affair he used to meet at various private gatherings a big fellow with a quiet unassuming manner and a pleasant voice  recognizing his voice raised in the anteroom may one come in razumov lounging idly on his couch jumped up suppose he were coming to stab me he thought sardonically and assuming a green shade over his left eye said in a severe tone come in  the other was embarrassed hoped he was not intruding  you havent been seen for several days and ive wondered he coughed a little eye better  nearly well now  good i wont stop a minute but you see i that is weanyway i have undertaken the duty to warn you kirylo sidorovitch that you are living in false security maybe  razumov sat still with his head leaning on his hand which nearly concealed the unshaded eye  i have that idea too  thats all right then everything seems quiet now but those people are preparing some move of general repression thats of course but it isnt that i came to tell you he hitched his chair closer dropped his voice you will be arrested before longwe fear  an obscure scribe in the secretariat had overheard a few words of a certain conversation and had caught a glimpse of a certain report this intelligence was not to be neglected  razumov laughed a little and his visitor became very anxious  ah kirylo sidorovitch this is no laughing matter they have left you alone for a while but indeed you had better try to leave the country kirylo sidorovitch while theres yet time  razumov jumped up and began to thank him for the advice with mocking effusiveness so that the other colouring up took himself off with the notion that this mysterious razumov was not a person to be warned or advised by inferior mortals  councillor mikulin informed the next day of the incident expressed his satisfaction hm ha exactly what was wanted to and glanced down his beard  i conclude said razumov that the moment has come for me to start on my mission  the psychological moment councillor mikulin insisted softlyvery gravelyas if awed  all the arrangements to give verisimilitude to the appearance of a difficult escape were made councillor mikulin did not expect to see mr razumov again before his departure these meetings were a risk and there was nothing more to settle  we have said everything to each other by now kirylo sidorovitch said the high official feelingly pressing razumovs hand with that unreserved heartiness a russian can convey in his manner there is nothing obscure between us and i will tell you what i consider myself fortunate in havinghmyour  he glanced down his beard and after a moment of thoughtful silence handed to razumov a halfsheet of notepaperan abbreviated note of matters already discussed certain points of inquiry the line of conduct agreed on a few hints as to personalities and so on it was the only compromising document in the case but as councillor mikulin observed it could be easily destroyed mr razumov had better not see any one nowtill on the other side of the frontier when of course it will be just that see and hear and  he glanced down his beard but when razumov declared his intention to see one person at least before leaving st petersburg councillor mikulin failed to conceal a sudden uneasiness the young mans studious solitary and austere existence was well known to him it was the greatest guarantee of fitness he became deprecatory had his dear kirylo sidorovitch considered whether in view of such a momentous enterprise it wasnt really advisable to sacrifice every sentiment  razumov interrupted the remonstrance scornfully it was not a young woman it was a young fool he wished to see for a certain purpose councillor mikulin was relieved but surprised  ah and what forprecisely  for the sake of improving the aspect of verisimilitude said razumov curtly in a desire to affirm his independence i must be trusted in what i do  councillor mikulin gave way tactfully murmuring oh certainly certainly your judgment  and with another handshake they parted  the fool of whom mr razumov had thought was the rich and festive student known as madcap kostia featherheaded loquacious excitable one could make certain of his utter and complete indiscretion but that riotous youth when reminded by razumov of his offers of service some time ago passed from his usual elation into boundless dismay  oh kirylo sidorovitch my dearest friendmy saviourwhat shall i do ive blown last night every rouble i had from my dad the other day cant you give me till thursday i shall rush round to all the usurers i know no of course you cant dont look at me like that what shall i do no use asking the old man i tell you hes given me a fistful of big notes three days ago miserable wretch that i am  he wrung his hands in despair impossible to confide in the old man they had given him a decoration a cross on the neck only last year and he had been cursing the modern tendencies ever since just then he would see all the intellectuals in russia hanged in a row rather than part with a single rouble  kirylo sidorovitch wait a moment dont despise me i have it ill yesill do itill break into his desk theres no help for it i know the drawer where he keeps his plunder and i can buy a chisel on my way home he will be terribly upset but you know the dear old duffer really loves me hell have to get over itand i too kirylo my dear soul if you can only wait for a few hourstill this eveningi shall steal all the blessed lot i can lay my hands on you doubt me why youve only to say the word  steal by all means said razumov fixing him stonily  to the devil with the ten commandments cried the other with the greatest animation its the new future now  but when he entered razumovs room late in the evening it was with an unaccustomed soberness of manner almost solemnly  its done he said  razumov sitting bowed his clasped hands hanging between his knees shuddered at the familiar sound of these words kostia deposited slowly in the circle of lamplight a small brownpaper parcel tied with a piece of string  as ive saidall i could lay my hands on the old boyll think the end of the world has come razumov nodded from the couch and contemplated the harebrained fellows gravity with a feeling of malicious pleasure  ive made my little sacrifice sighed mad kostia and ive to thank you kirylo sidorovitch for the opportunity  it has cost you something  yes it has you see the dear old duffer really loves me hell be hurt  and you believe all they tell you of the new future and the sacred will of the people  implicitly i would give my life only you see i am like a pig at a trough i am no good its my nature  razumov lost in thought had forgotten his existence till the youths voice entreating him to fly without loss of time roused him unpleasantly  all right wellgoodbye  i am not going to leave you till ive seen you out of st petersburg declared kostia unexpectedly with calm determination you cant refuse me that now for gods sake kirylo my soul the police may be here any moment and when they get you theyll immure you somewhere for agestill your hair turns grey i have down there the best trotter of dads stables and a light sledge we shall do thirty miles before the moon sets and find some roadside station  razumov looked up amazed the journey was decidedunavoidable he had fixed the next day for his departure on the mission and now he discovered suddenly that he had not believed in it he had gone about listening speaking thinking planning his simulated flight with the growing conviction that all this was preposterous as if anybody ever did such things it was like a game of makebelieve and now he was amazed here was somebody who believed in it with desperate earnestness if i dont go now at once thought razumov with a start of fear i shall never go he rose without a word and the anxious kostia thrust his cap on him helped him into his cloak or else he would have left the room bareheaded as he stood he was walking out silently when a sharp cry arrested him  kirylo  what he turned reluctantly in the doorway upright with a stiffly extended arm kostia his face set and white was pointing an eloquent forefinger at the brown little packet lying forgotten in the circle of bright light on the table razumov hesitated came back for it under the severe eyes of his companion at whom he tried to smile but the boyish mad youth was frowning its a dream thought razumov putting the little parcel into his pocket and descending the stairs nobody does such things the other held him under the arm whispering of dangers ahead and of what he meant to do in certain contingencies preposterous murmured razumov as he was being tucked up in the sledge he gave himself up to watching the development of the dream with extreme attention it continued on foreseen lines inexorably logicalthe long drive the wait at the small station sitting by a stove they did not exchange half a dozen words altogether kostia gloomy himself did not care to break the silence at parting they embraced twiceit had to be done and then kostia vanished out of the dream  when dawn broke razumov very still in a hot stuffy railwaycar full of bedding and of sleeping people in all its dimly lighted length rose quietly lowered the glass a few inches and flung out on the great plain of snow a small brownpaper parcel then he sat down again muffled up and motionless for the people he thought staring out of the window the great white desert of frozen hard earth glided past his eyes without a sign of human habitation  that had been a waking act and then the dream had him again prussia saxony wurtemberg faces sights wordsall a dream observed with an angry compelled attention zurich genevastill a dream minutely followed wearing one into harsh laughter to fury to deathwith the fear of awakening at the end   ii   perhaps life is just that reflected razumov pacing to and fro under the trees of the little island all alone with the bronze statue of rousseau a dream and a fear the dusk deepened the pages written over and torn out of his notebook were the firstfruit of his mission no dream that they contained the assurance that he was on the eve of real discoveries i think there is no longer anything in the way of my being completely accepted  he had resumed his impressions in those pages some of the conversations he even went so far as to write by the by i have discovered the personality of that terrible nn a horrible paunchy brute if i hear anything of his future movements i shall send a warning  the futility of all this overcame him like a curse even then he could not believe in the reality of his mission he looked round despairingly as if for some way to redeem his existence from that unconquerable feeling he crushed angrily in his hand the pages of the notebook this must be posted he thought  he gained the bridge and returned to the north shore where he remembered having seen in one of the narrower streets a little obscure shop stocked with cheap wood carvings its walls lined with extremely dirty cardboardbound volumes of a small circulating library they sold stationery there too a morose shabby old man dozed behind the counter a thin woman in black with a sickly face produced the envelope he had asked for without even looking at him razumov thought that these people were safe to deal with because they no longer cared for anything in the world he addressed the envelope on the counter with the german name of a certain person living in vienna but razumov knew that this his first communication for councillor mikulin would find its way to the embassy there be copied in cypher by somebody trustworthy and sent on to its destination all safe along with the diplomatic correspondence that was the arrangement contrived to cover up the track of the information from all unfaithful eyes from all indiscretions from all mishaps and treacheries it was to make him safeabsolutely safe  he wandered out of the wretched shop and made for the post office it was then that i saw him for the second time that day he was crossing the rue mont blanc with every appearance of an aimless stroller he did not recognize me but i made him out at some distance he was very goodlooking i thought this remarkable friend of miss haldins brother i watched him go up to the letterbox and then retrace his steps again he passed me very close but i am certain he did not see me that time either he carried his head well up but he had the expression of a somnambulist struggling with the very dream which drives him forth to wander in dangerous places my thoughts reverted to natalia haldin to her mother he was all that was left to them of their son and brother  the westerner in me was discomposed there was something shocking in the expression of that face had i been myself a conspirator a russian political refugee i could have perhaps been able to draw some practical conclusion from this chance glimpse as it was it only discomposed me strongly even to the extent of awakening an indefinite apprehension in regard to natalia haldin all this is rather inexplicable but such was the origin of the purpose i formed there and then to call on these ladies in the evening after my solitary dinner it was true that i had met miss haldin only a few hours before but mrs haldin herself i had not seen for some considerable time the truth is i had shirked calling of late  poor mrs haldin i confess she frightened me a little she was one of those natures rare enough luckily in which one cannot help being interested because they provoke both terror and pity one dreads their contact for oneself and still more for those one cares for so clear it is that they are born to suffer and to make others suffer too it is strange to think that i wont say liberty but the mere liberalism of outlook which for us is a matter of words of ambitions of votes and if of feeling at all then of the sort of feeling which leaves our deepest affections untouched may be for other beings very much like ourselves and living under the same sky a heavy trial of fortitude a matter of tears and anguish and blood mrs haldin had felt the pangs of her own generation there was that enthusiast brother of hersthe officer they shot under nicholas a faintly ironic resignation is no armour for a vulnerable heart mrs haldin struck at through her children was bound to suffer afresh from the past and to feel the anguish of the future she was of those who do not know how to heal themselves of those who are too much aware of their heart who neither cowardly nor selfish look passionately at its woundsand count the cost  such thoughts as these seasoned my modest lonely bachelors meal if anybody wishes to remark that this was a roundabout way of thinking of natalia haldin i can only retort that she was well worth some concern she had all her life before her let it be admitted then that i was thinking of natalia haldins life in terms of her mothers character a manner of thinking about a girl permissible for an old man not too old yet to have become a stranger to pity there was almost all her youth before her a youth robbed arbitrarily of its natural lightness and joy overshadowed by an uneuropean despotism a terribly sombre youth given over to the hazards of a furious strife between equally ferocious antagonisms  i lingered over my thoughts more than i should have done one felt so helpless and even worseso unrelated in a way at the last moment i hesitated as to going there at all what was the good  the evening was already advanced when turning into the boulevard des philosophes i saw the light in the window at the corner the blind was down but i could imagine behind it mrs haldin seated in the chair in her usual attitude looking out for some one which had lately acquired the poignant quality of mad expectation  i thought that i was sufficiently authorized by the light to knock at the door the ladies had not retired as yet i only hoped they would not have any visitors of their own nationality a brokendown retired russian official was to be found there sometimes in the evening he was infinitely forlorn and wearisome by his mere dismal presence i think these ladies tolerated his frequent visits because of an ancient friendship with mr haldin the father or something of that sort i made up my mind that if i found him prosing away there in his feeble voice i should remain but a very few minutes  the door surprised me by swinging open before i could ring the bell i was confronted by miss haldin in hat and jacket obviously on the point of going out at that hour for the doctor perhaps  her exclamation of welcome reassured me it sounded as if i had been the very man she wanted to see my curiosity was awakened she drew me in and the faithful anna the elderly german maid closed the door but did not go away afterwards she remained near it as if in readiness to let me out presently it appeared that miss haldin had been on the point of going out to find me  she spoke in a hurried manner very unusual with her she would have gone straight and rung at mrs zieglers door late as it was for mrs zieglers habits  mrs ziegler the widow of a distinguished professor who was an intimate friend of mine lets me have three rooms out of her very large and fine apartment which she didnt give up after her husbands death but i have my own entrance opening on the same landing it was an arrangement of at least ten years standing i said that i was very glad that i had the idea to  miss haldin made no motion to take off her outdoor things i observed her heightened colour something pronouncedly resolute in her tone did i know where mr razumov lived  where mr razumov lived mr razumov at this hourso urgently i threw my arms up in sign of utter ignorance i had not the slightest idea where he lived if i could have foreseen her question only three hours ago i might have ventured to ask him on the pavement before the new post office building and possibly he would have told me but very possibly too he would have dismissed me rudely to mind my own business and possibly i thought remembering that extraordinary hallucined anguished and absent expression he might have fallen down in a fit from the shock of being spoken to i said nothing of all this to miss haldin not even mentioning that i had a glimpse of the young man so recently the impression had been so extremely unpleasant that i would have been glad to forget it myself  i dont see where i could make inquiries i murmured helplessly i would have been glad to be of use in any way and would have set off to fetch any man young or old for i had the greatest confidence in her common sense what made you think of coming to me for that information i asked  it wasnt exactly for that she said in a low voice she had the air of some one confronted by an unpleasant task  am i to understand that you must communicate with mr razumov this evening  natalia haldin moved her head affirmatively then after a glance at the door of the drawingroom said in french  cest maman and remained perplexed for a moment always serious not a girl to be put out by any imaginary difficulties my curiosity was suspended on her lips which remained closed for a moment what was mr razumovs connexion with this mention of her mother mrs haldin had not been informed of her sons friends arrival in geneva  may i hope to see your mother this evening i inquired  miss haldin extended her hand as if to bar the way  she is in a terrible state of agitation oh you would not he able to detect its inward but i who know mother i am appalled i havent the courage to face it any longer its all my fault i suppose i cannot play a part ive never before hidden anything from mother there has never been an occasion for anything of that sort between us but you know yourself the reason why i refrained from telling her at once of mr razumovs arrival here you understand dont you owing to her unhappy state andtherei am no actress my own feelings being strongly engaged i somehow i dont know she noticed something in my manner she thought i was concealing something from her she noticed my longer absences and in fact as i have been meeting mr razumov daily i used to stay away longer than usual when i went out goodness knows what suspicions arose in her mind you know that she has not been herself ever since so this evening shewho has been so awfully silent for weeksbegan to talk all at once she said that she did not want to reproach me that i had my character as she had her own that she did not want to pry into my affairs or even into my thoughts for her part she had never had anything to conceal from her childrencruel things to listen to and all this in her quiet voice with that poor wasted face as calm as a stone it was unbearable  miss haldin talked in an undertone and more rapidly than i had ever heard her speak before that in itself was disturbing the anteroom being strongly lighted i could see under the veil the heightened colour of her face she stood erect her left hand was resting lightly on a small table the other hung by her side without stirring now and then she caught her breath slightly  it was too startling just fancy she thought that i was making preparations to leave her without saying anything i knelt by the side of her chair and entreated her to think of what she was saying she put her hand on my head but she persists in her delusion all the same she had always thought that she was worthy of her childrens confidence but apparently it was not so her son could not trust her love nor yet her understandingand now i was planning to abandon her in the same cruel and unjust manner and so on and so on nothing i could say it is morbid obstinacy she said that she felt there was something some change in me if my convictions were calling me away why this secrecy as though she had been a coward or a weakling not safe to trust as if my heart could play traitor to my children she said it was hardly to be borne and she was smoothing my head all the time it was perfectly useless to protest she is ill her very soul is  i did not venture to break the silence which fell between us i looked into her eyes glistening through the veil  i changed she exclaimed in the same low tone my convictions calling me away it was cruel to hear this because my trouble is that i am weak and cannot see what i ought to do you know that and to end it all i did a selfish thing to remove her suspicions of myself i told her of mr razumov it was selfish of me you know we were completely right in agreeing to keep the knowledge away from her perfectly right directly i told her of our poor victors friend being here i saw how right we have been she ought to have been prepared but in my distress i just blurted it out mother got terribly excited at once how long has he been here what did he know and why did he not come to see us at once this friend of her victor what did that mean was she not to be trusted even with such memories as there were left of her son just think how i felt seeing her white like a sheet perfectly motionless with her thin hands gripping the arms of the chair i told her it was all my fault  i could imagine the motionless dumb figure of the mother in her chair there behind the door near which the daughter was talking to me the silence in there seemed to call aloud for vengeance against an historical fact and the modern instances of its working that view flashed through my mind but i could not doubt that miss haldin had had an atrocious time of it i quite understood when she said that she could not face the night upon the impression of that scene mrs haldin had given way to most awful imaginings to most fantastic and cruel suspicions all this had to be lulled at all costs and without loss of time it was no shock to me to learn that miss haldin had said to her i will go and bring him here at once there was nothing absurd in that cry no exaggeration of sentiment i was not even doubtful in my very well but how  it was perfectly right that she should think of me but what could i do in my ignorance of mr razumovs quarters  and to think he may be living near by within a stonesthrow perhaps she exclaimed  i doubted it but i would have gone off cheerfully to fetch him from the other end of geneva i suppose she was certain of my readiness since her first thought was to come to me but the service she meant to ask of me really was to accompany her to the chateau borel  i had an unpleasant mental vision of the dark road of the sombre grounds and the desolately suspicious aspect of that home of necromancy and intrigue and feminist adoration i objected that madame de s most likely would know nothing of what we wanted to find out neither did i think it likely that the young man would be found there i remembered my glimpse of his face and somehow gained the conviction that a man who looked worse than if he had seen the dead would want to shut himself up somewhere where he could be alone i felt a strange certitude that mr razumov was going home when i saw him  it is really of peter ivanovitch that i was thinking said miss haldin quietly  ah he of course would know i looked at my watch it was twenty minutes past nine only still  i would try his hotel then i advised he has rooms at the cosmopolitan somewhere on the top floor  i did not offer to go by myself simply from mistrust of the reception i should meet with but i suggested the faithful anna with a note asking for the information  anna was still waiting by the door at the other end of the room and we two discussed the matter in whispers miss haldin thought she must go herself anna was timid and slow time would be lost in bringing back the answer and from that point of view it was getting late for it was by no means certain that mr razumov lived near by  if i go myself miss haldin argued i can go straight to him from the hotel and in any case i should have to go out because i must explain to mr razumov personallyprepare him in a way you have no idea of mothers state of mind  her colour came and went she even thought that both for her mothers sake and for her own it was better that they should not be together for a little time anna whom her mother liked would be at hand  she could take her sewing into the room miss haldin continued leading the way to the door then addressing in german the maid who opened it before us you may tell my mother that this gentleman called and is gone with me to find mr razumov she must not be uneasy if i am away for some length of time  we passed out quickly into the street and she took deep breaths of the cool night air i did not even ask you she murmured  i should think not i said with a laugh the manner of my reception by the great feminist could not be considered now that he would be annoyed to see me and probably treat me to some solemn insolence i had no doubt but i supposed that he would not absolutely dare to throw me out and that was all i cared for wont you take my arm i asked  she did so in silence and neither of us said anything worth recording till i let her go first into the great hall of the hotel it was brilliantly lighted and with a good many people lounging about  i could very well go up there without you i suggested  i dont like to be left waiting in this place she said in a low voice  i will come too  i led her straight to the lift then at the top floor the attendant directed us to the right end of the corridor  the walls were white the carpet red electric lights blazed in profusion and the emptiness the silence the closed doors all alike and numbered made me think of the perfect order of some severely luxurious model penitentiary on the solitary confinement principle up there under the roof of that enormous pile for housing travellers no sound of any kind reached us the thick crimson felt muffled our footsteps completely we hastened on not looking at each other till we found ourselves before the very last door of that long passage then our eyes met and we stood thus for a moment lending ear to a faint murmur of voices inside  i suppose this is it i whispered unnecessarily i saw miss haldins lips move without a sound and after my sharp knock the murmur of voices inside ceased a profound stillness lasted for a few seconds and then the door was brusquely opened by a short blackeyed woman in a red blouse with a great lot of nearly white hair done up negligently in an untidy and unpicturesque manner her thin jetty eyebrows were drawn together i learned afterwards with interest that she was the famousor the notorioussophia antonovna but i was struck then by the quaint mephistophelian character of her inquiring glance because it was so curiously evilless soi may sayundevilish it got softened still more as she looked up at miss haldin who stated in her rich even voice her wish to see peter ivanovitch for a moment  i am miss haldin she added  at this with her brow completely smoothed out now but without a word in answer the woman in the red blouse walked away to a sofa and sat down leaving the door wide open  and from the sofa her hands lying on her lap she watched us enter with her black glittering eyes  miss haldin advanced into the middle of the room i faithful to my part of mere attendant remained by the door after closing it behind me the room quite a large one but with a low ceiling was scantily furnished and an electric bulb with a porcelain shade pulled low down over a big table with a very large map spread on it left its distant parts in a dim artificial twilight peter ivanovitch was not to be seen neither was mr razumov present but on the sofa near sophia antonovna a bonyfaced man with a goatee beard leaned forward with his hands on his knees staring hard with a kindly expression in a remote corner a broad pale face and a bulky shape could be made out uncouth and as if insecure on the low seat on which it rested the only person known to me was little julius laspara who seemed to have been poring over the map his feet twined tightly round the chairlegs he got down briskly and bowed to miss haldin looking absurdly like a hooknosed boy with a beautiful false pepperandsalt beard he advanced offering his seat which miss haldin declined she had only come in for a moment to say a few words to peter ivanovitch  his highpitched voice became painfully audible in the room  strangely enough i was thinking of you this very afternoon natalia victorovna i met mr razumov i asked him to write me an article on anything he liked you could translate it into englishwith such a teacher  he nodded complimentarily in my direction at the name of razumov an indescribable sound a sort of feeble squeak as of some angry small animal was heard in the corner occupied by the man who seemed much too large for the chair on which he sat i did not hear what miss haldin said laspara spoke again  its time to do something natalia victorovna but i suppose you have your own ideas why not write something yourself suppose you came to see us soon we could talk it over any advice  again i did not catch miss haldins words it was lasparas voice once more  peter ivanovitch hes retired for a moment into the other room we are all waiting for him the great man entering at that moment looked bigger taller quite imposing in a long dressinggown of some dark stuff it descended in straight lines down to his feet he suggested a monk or a prophet a robust figure of same desertdwellersomething asiatic and the dark glasses in conjunction with this costume made him more mysterious than ever in the subdued light  little laspara went back to his chair to look at the map the only brilliantly lit object in the room even from my distant position by the door i could make out by the shape of the blue part representing the water that it was a map of the baltic provinces peter ivanovitch exclaimed slightly advancing towards miss haldin checked himself on perceiving me very vaguely no doubt and peered with his dark bespectacled stare he must have recognized me by my grey hair because with a marked shrug of his broad shoulders he turned to miss haldin in benevolent indulgence he seized her hand in his thick cushioned palm and put his other big paw over it like a lid  while those two standing in the middle of the floor were exchanging a few inaudible phrases no one else moved in the room laspara with his back to us kneeling on the chair his elbows propped on the bigscale map the shadowy enormity in the corner the frankly staring man with the goatee on the sofa the woman in the red blouse by his sidenot one of them stirred i suppose that really they had no time for miss haldin withdrew her hand immediately from peter ivanovitch and before i was ready for her was moving to the door a disregarded westerner i threw it open hurriedly and followed her out my last glance leaving them all motionless in their varied poses peter ivanovitch alone standing up with his dark glasses like an enormous blind teacher and behind him the vivid patch of light on the coloured map pored over by the diminutive laspara  later on much later on at the time of the newspaper rumours they were vague and soon died out of an abortive military conspiracy in russia i remembered the glimpse i had of that motionless group with its central figure no details ever came out but it was known that the revolutionary parties abroad had given their assistance had sent emissaries in advance that even money was found to dispatch a steamer with a cargo of arms and conspirators to invade the baltic provinces and while my eyes scanned the imperfect disclosures in which the world was not much interested i thought that the old settled europe had been given in my person attending that russian girl something like a glimpse behind the scenes a short strange glimpse on the top floor of a great hotel of all places in the world the great man himself the motionless great bulk in the corner of the slayer of spies and gendarmes yakovlitch the veteran of ancient terrorist campaigns the woman with her hair as white as mine and the lively black eyes all in a mysterious halflight with the strongly lighted map of russia on the table the woman i had the opportunity to see again as we were waiting for the lift she came hurrying along the corridor with her eyes fastened on miss haldins face and drew her aside as if for a confidential communication it was not long a few words only  going down in the lift natalia haldin did not break the silence it was only when out of the hotel and as we moved along the quay in the fresh darkness spangled by the quay lights reflected in the black water of the little port on our left hand and with lofty piles of hotels on our right that she spoke  that was sophia antonovnayou know the woman  yes i knowthe famous  the same it appears that after we went out peter ivanovitch told them why i had come that was the reason she ran out after us she named herself to me and then she said you are the sister of a brave man who shall be remembered you may see better times i told her i hoped to see the time when all this would be forgotten even if the name of my brother were to be forgotten too something moved me to say that but you understand  yes i said you think of the era of concord and justice  yes there is too much hate and revenge in that work it must be done it is a sacrificeand so let it be all the greater destruction is the work of anger let the tyrants and the slayers be forgotten together and only the reconstructors be remembered  and did sophia antonovna agree with you i asked sceptically  she did not say anything except it is good for you to believe in love i should think she understood me then she asked me if i hoped to see mr razumov presently i said i trusted i could manage to bring him to see my mother this evening as my mother had learned of his being here and was morbidly impatient to learn if he could tell us something of victor he was the only friend of my brother we knew of and a great intimate she said oh your brotheryes please tell mr razumov that i have made public the story which came to me from st petersburg it concerns your brothers arrest she added he was betrayed by a man of the people who has since hanged himself mr razumov will explain it all to you i gave him the full information this afternoon and please tell mr razumov that sophia antonovna sends him her greetings i am going away early in the morningfar away  and miss haldin added after a moment of silencei was so moved by what i heard so unexpectedly that i simply could not speak to you before a man of the people oh our poor people  she walked slowly as if tired out suddenly her head drooped from the windows of a building with terraces and balconies came the banal sound of hotel music before the low mean portals of the casino two red posters blazed under the electric lamps with a cheap provincial effectand the emptiness of the quays the desert aspect of the streets had an air of hypocritical respectability and of inexpressible dreariness  i had taken for granted she had obtained the address and let myself be guided by her on the mont blanc bridge where a few dark figures seemed lost in the wide and long perspective defined by the lights she said  it isnt very far from our house i somehow thought it couldnt be the address is rue de carouge i think it must be one of those big new houses for artisans  she took my arm confidingly familiarly and accelerated her pace there was something primitive in our proceedings we did not think of the resources of civilization a late tramcar overtook us a row of fiacres stood by the railing of the gardens it never entered our heads to make use of these conveyances she was too hurried perhaps and as to myselfwell she had taken my arm confidingly as we were ascending the easy incline of the corraterie all the shops shuttered and no light in any of the windows as if all the mercenary population had fled at the end of the day she said tentatively  i could run in for a moment to have a look at mother it would not be much out of the way  i dissuaded her if mrs haldin really expected to see razumov that night it would have been unwise to show herself without him the sooner we got hold of the young man and brought him along to calm her mothers agitation the better she assented to my reasoning and we crossed diagonally the place de theatre bluish grey with its floor of slabs of stone under the electric light and the lonely equestrian statue all black in the middle in the rue de carouge we were in the poorer quarters and approaching the outskirts of the town vacant building plots alternated with high new houses at the corner of a side street the crude light of a whitewashed shop fell into the night fanlike through a wide doorway one could see from a distance the inner wall with its scantily furnished shelves and the deal counter painted brown that was the house approaching it along the dark stretch of a fence of tarred planks we saw the narrow pallid face of the cut angle five single windows high without a gleam in them and crowned by the heavy shadow of a jutting roof slope  we must inquire in the shop miss haldin directed me  a sallow thinly whiskered man wearing a dingy white collar and a frayed tie laid down a newspaper and leaning familiarly on both elbows far over the bare counter answered that the person i was inquiring for was indeed his locataire on the third floor but that for the moment he was out  for the moment i repeated after a glance at miss haldin does this mean that you expect him back at once  he was very gentle with ingratiating eyes and soft lips he smiled faintly as though he knew all about everything mr razumov after being absent all day had returned early in the evening he was very surprised about half an hour or a little more since to see him come down again mr razumov left his key and in the course of some words which passed between them had remarked that he was going out because he needed air  from behind the bare counter he went on smiling at us his head held between his hands air air but whether that meant a long or a short absence it was difficult to say the night was very close certainly  after a pause his ingratiating eyes turned to the door he added  the storm shall drive him in  theres going to be a storm i asked  why yes  as if to confirm his words we heard a very distant deep rumbling noise  consulting miss haldin by a glance i saw her so reluctant to give up her quest that i asked the shopkeeper in case mr razumov came home within half an hour to beg him to remain downstairs in the shop we would look in again presently  for all answer he moved his head imperceptibly the approval of miss haldin was expressed by her silence we walked slowly down the street away from the town the low garden walls of the modest villas doomed to demolition were overhung by the boughs of trees and masses of foliage lighted from below by gas lamps the violent and monotonous noise of the icy waters of the arve falling over a low dam swept towards us with a chilly draught of air across a great open space where a double line of lamplights outlined a street as yet without houses but on the other shore overhung by the awful blackness of the thundercloud a solitary dim light seemed to watch us with a weary stare when we had strolled as far as the bridge i said  we had better get back   in the shop the sickly man was studying his smudgy newspaper now spread out largely on the counter he just raised his head when i looked in and shook it negatively pursing up his lips i rejoined miss haldin outside at once and we moved off at a brisk pace she remarked that she would send anna with a note the first thing in the morning i respected her taciturnity silence being perhaps the best way to show my concern  the semirural street we followed on our return changed gradually to the usual town thoroughfare broad and deserted we did not meet four people altogether and the way seemed interminable because my companions natural anxiety had communicated itself sympathetically to me at last we turned into the boulevard des philosophes more wide more empty more deadthe very desolation of slumbering respectability at the sight of the two lighted windows very conspicuous from afar i had the mental vision of mrs haldin in her armchair keeping a dreadful tormenting vigil under the evil spell of an arbitrary rule a victim of tyranny and revolution a sight at once cruel and absurd   iii    you will come in for a moment said natalia haldin  i demurred on account of the late hour you know mother likes you so much she insisted  i will just come in to hear how your mother is  she said as if to herself i dont even know whether she will believe that i could not find mr razumov since she has taken it into her head that i am concealing something from her you may be able to persuade her  your mother may mistrust me too i observed  you why what could you have to conceal from her you are not a russian nor a conspirator  i felt profoundly my european remoteness and said nothing but i made up my mind to play my part of helpless spectator to the end the distant rolling of thunder in the valley of the rhone was coming nearer to the sleeping town of prosaic virtues and universal hospitality we crossed the street opposite the great dark gateway and miss haldin rang at the door of the apartment it was opened almost instantly as if the elderly maid had been waiting in the anteroom for our return her flat physiognomy had an air of satisfaction the gentleman was there she declared while closing the door  neither of us understood miss haldin turned round brusquely to her who  herr razumov she explained  she had heard enough of our conversation before we left to know why her young mistress was going out therefore when the gentleman gave his name at the door she admitted him at once  no one could have foreseen that miss haldin murmured with her serious grey eyes fixed upon mine and remembering the expression of the young mans face seen not much more than four hours ago the look of a haunted somnambulist i wondered with a sort of awe  you asked my mother first miss haldin inquired of the maid  no i announced the gentleman she answered surprised at our troubled faces  still i said in an undertone your mother was prepared  yes but he has no idea  it seemed to me she doubted his tact to her question how long the gentleman had been with her mother the maid told us that der herr had been in the drawingroom no more than a short quarter of an hour  she waited a moment then withdrew looking a little scared miss haldin gazed at me in silence  as things have turned out i said you happen to know exactly what your brothers friend has to tell your mother and surely after that  yes said natalia haldin slowly i only wonder as i was not here when he came if it wouldnt be better not to interrupt now  we remained silent and i suppose we both strained our ears but no sound reached us through the closed door the features of miss haldin expressed a painful irresolution she made a movement as if to go in but checked herself she had heard footsteps on the other side of the door it came open and razumov without pausing stepped out into the anteroom the fatigue of that day and the struggle with himself had changed him so much that i would have hesitated to recognize that face which only a few hours before when he brushed against me in front of the post office had been startling enough but quite different it had been not so livid then and its eyes not so sombre they certainly looked more sane now but there was upon them the shadow of something consciously evil  i speak of that because at first their glance fell on me though without any sort of recognition or even comprehension i was simply in the line of his stare i dont know if he had heard the bell or expected to see anybody he was going out i believe and i do not think that he saw miss haldin till she advanced towards him a step or two he disregarded the hand she put out  its you natalia victorovna perhaps you are surprisedat this late hour but you see i remembered our conversations in that garden i thought really it was your wish that i shouldwithout loss of timeso i came no other reason simply to tell  he spoke with difficulty i noticed that and remembered his declaration to the man in the shop that he was going out because he needed air if that was his object then it was clear that he had miserably failed with downcast eyes and lowered head he made an effort to pick up the strangled phrase  to tell what i have heard myself only todaytoday  through the door he had not closed i had a view of the drawingroom it was lighted only by a shaded lampmrs haldins eyes could not support either gas or electricity it was a comparatively big room and in contrast with the strongly lighted anteroom its length was lost in semitransparent gloom backed by heavy shadows and on that ground i saw the motionless figure of mrs haldin inclined slightly forward with a pale hand resting on the arm of the chair  she did not move with the window before her she had no longer that attitude suggesting expectation the blind was down and outside there was only the night sky harbouring a thundercloud and the town indifferent and hospitable in its cold almost scornful tolerationa respectable town of refuge to which all these sorrows and hopes were nothing her white head was bowed  the thought that the real drama of autocracy is not played on the great stage of politics came to me as fated to be a spectator i had this other glimpse behind the scenes something more profound than the words and gestures of the public play i had the certitude that this mother refused in her heart to give her son up after all it was more than rachels inconsolable mourning it was something deeper more inaccessible in its frightful tranquillity lost in the illdefined mass of the highbacked chair her white inclined profile suggested the contemplation of something in her lap as though a beloved head were resting there  i had this glimpse behind the scenes and then miss haldin passing by the young man shut the door it was not done without hesitation for a moment i thought that she would go to her mother but she sent in only an anxious glance perhaps if mrs haldin had movedbut no there was in the immobility of that bloodless face the dreadful aloofness of suffering without remedy  meantime the young man kept his eyes fixed on the floor the thought that he would have to repeat the story he had told already was intolerable to him he had expected to find the two women together and then he had said to himself it would be over for all timefor all time its lucky i dont believe in another world he had thought cynically  alone in his room after having posted his secret letter he had regained a certain measure of composure by writing in his secret diary he was aware of the danger of that strange selfindulgence he alludes to it himself but he could not refrain it calmed himit reconciled him to his existence he sat there scribbling by the light of a solitary candle till it occurred to him that having heard the explanation of haldins arrest as put forward by sophia antonovna it behoved him to tell these ladies himself they were certain to hear the tale through some other channel and then his abstention would look strange not only to the mother and sister of haldin but to other people also having come to this conclusion he did not discover in himself any marked reluctance to face the necessity and very soon an anxiety to be done with it began to torment him he looked at his watch no it was not absolutely too late  the fifteen minutes with mrs haldin were like the revenge of the unknown that white face that weak distinct voice that head at first turned to him eagerly then after a while bowed again and motionlessin the dim still light of the room in which his words which he tried to subdue resounded so loudlyhad troubled him like some strange discovery and there seemed to be a secret obstinacy in that sorrow something he could not understand at any rate something he had not expected was it hostile but it did not matter nothing could touch him now in the eyes of the revolutionists there was now no shadow on his past the phantom of haldin had been indeed walked over was left behind lying powerless and passive on the pavement covered with snow and this was the phantoms mother consumed with grief and white as a ghost he had felt a pitying surprise but that of course was of no importance mothers did not matter he could not shake off the poignant impression of that silent quiet whitehaired woman but a sort of sternness crept into his thoughts these were the consequences well what of it am i then on a bed of roses he had exclaimed to himself sitting at some distance with his eyes fixed upon that figure of sorrow he had said all he had to say to her and when he had finished she had not uttered a word she had turned away her head while he was speaking the silence which had fallen on his last words had lasted for five minutes or more what did it mean before its incomprehensible character he became conscious of anger in his stern mood the old anger against haldin reawakened by the contemplation of haldins mother and was it not something like enviousness which gripped his heart as if of a privilege denied to him alone of all the men that had ever passed through this world it was the other who had attained to repose and yet continued to exist in the affection of that mourning old woman in the thoughts of all these people posing for lovers of humanity it was impossible to get rid of him its myself whom i have given up to destruction thought razumov he has induced me to do it i cant shake him off  alarmed by that discovery he got up and strode out of the silent dim room with its silent old woman in the chair that mother he never looked back it was frankly a flight but on opening the door he saw his retreat cut off there was the sister he had never forgotten the sister only he had not expected to see her thenor ever any more perhaps her presence in the anteroom was as unforeseen as the apparition of her brother had been razumov gave a start as though he had discovered himself cleverly trapped he tried to smile but could not manage it and lowered his eyes must i repeat that silly story now he asked himself and felt a sinking sensation nothing solid had passed his lips since the day before but he was not in a state to analyse the origins of his weakness he meant to take up his hat and depart with as few words as possible but miss haldins swift movement to shut the door took him by surprise he half turned after her but without raising his eyes passively just as a feather might stir in the disturbed air the next moment she was back in the place she had started from with another halfturn on his part so that they came again into the same relative positions  yes yes she said hurriedly i am very grateful to you kirylo sidorovitch for coming at oncelike this only i wish i had did mother tell you  i wonder what she could have told me that i did not know before he said obviously to himself but perfectly audible because i always did know it he added louder as if in despair  he hung his head he had such a strong sense of natalia haldins presence that to look at her he felt would be a relief it was she who had been haunting him now he had suffered that persecution ever since she had suddenly appeared before him in the garden of the villa borel with an extended hand and the name of her brother on her lips the anteroom had a row of hooks on the wall nearest to the outer door while against the wall opposite there stood a small dark table and one chair the paper bearing a very faint design was all but white the light of an electric bulb high up under the ceiling searched that clear square box into its four bare corners crudely without shadowsa strange stage for an obscure drama  what do you mean asked miss haldin what is it that you knew always  he raised his face pale full of unexpressed suffering but that look in his eyes of dull absent obstinacy which struck and surprised everybody he was talking to began to pass way it was as though he were coming to himself in the awakened consciousness of that marvellous harmony of feature of lines of glances of voice which made of the girl before him a being so rare outside and as it were above the common notion of beauty he looked at her so long that she coloured slightly  what is it that you knew she repeated vaguely  that time he managed to smile  indeed if it had not been for a word of greeting or two i would doubt whether your mother was aware at all of my existence you understand  natalia haldin nodded her hands moved slightly by her side  yes is it not heartbreaking she has not shed a tear yetnot a single tear  not a tear and you natalia victorovna you have been able to cry  i have and then i am young enough kirylo sidorovitch to believe in the future but when i see my mother so terribly distracted i almost forget everything i ask myself whether one should feel proudor only resigned we had such a lot of people coming to see us there were utter strangers who wrote asking for permission to call to present their respects it was impossible to keep our door shut for ever you know that peter ivanovitch himself oh yes there was much sympathy but there were persons who exulted openly at that death then when i was left alone with poor mother all this seemed so wrong in spirit something not worth the price she is paying for it but directly i heard you were here in geneva kirylo sidorovitch i felt that you were the only person who could assist me  in comforting a bereaved mother yes he broke in in a manner which made her open her clear unsuspecting eyes but there is a question of fitness has this occurred to you  there was a breathlessness in his utterance which contrasted with the monstrous hint of mockery in his intention  why whispered natalia haldin with feeling who more fit than you  he had a convulsive movement of exasperation but controlled himself  indeed directly you heard that i was in geneva before even seeing me it is another proof of that confidence which  all at once his tone changed became more incisive and more detached  men are poor creatures natalia victorovna they have no intuition of sentiment in order to speak fittingly to a mother of her lost son one must have had some experience of the filial relation it is not the case with meif you must know the whole truth your hopes have to deal here with a breast unwarmed by any affection as the poet says that does not mean it is insensible he added in a lower tone  i am certain your heart is not unfeeling said miss haldin softly  no it is not as hard as a stone he went on in the same introspective voice and looking as if his heart were lying as heavy as a stone in that unwarmed breast of which he spoke no not so hard but how to prove what you give me credit forah thats another question no one has ever expected such a thing from me before no one whom my tenderness would have been of any use to and now you come you now no natalia victorovna its too late you come too late you must expect nothing from me  she recoiled from him a little though he had made no movement as if she had seen some change in his face charging his words with the significance of some hidden sentiment they shared together to me the silent spectator they looked like two people becoming conscious of a spell which had been lying on them ever since they first set eyes on each other had either of them cast a glance then in my direction i would have opened the door quietly and gone out but neither did and i remained every fear of indiscretion lost in the sense of my enormous remoteness from their captivity within the sombre horizon of russian problems the boundary of their eyes of their feelingsthe prison of their souls  frank courageous miss haldin controlled her voice in the midst of her trouble  what can this mean she asked as if speaking to herself  it may mean that you have given yourself up to vain imaginings while i have managed to remain amongst the truth of things and the realities of lifeour russian lifesuch as they are  they are cruel she murmured  and ugly dont forget thatand ugly look where you like look near you here abroad where you are and then look back at home whence you came  one must look beyond the present her tone had an ardent conviction  the blind can do that best i have had the misfortune to be born cleareyed and if you only knew what strange things i have seen what amazing and unexpected apparitions but why talk of all this  on the contrary i want to talk of all this with you she protested with earnest serenity the sombre humours of her brothers friend left her unaffected as though that bitterness that suppressed anger were the signs of an indignant rectitude she saw that he was not an ordinary person and perhaps she did not want him to be other than he appeared to her trustful eyes yes with you especially she insisted with you of all the russian people in the world a faint smile dwelt for a moment on her lips i am like poor mother in a way i too seem unable to give up our beloved dead who dont forget was all in all to us i dont want to abuse your sympathy but you must understand that it is in you that we can find all that is left of his generous soul  i was looking at him not a muscle of his face moved in the least and yet even at the time i did not suspect him of insensibility it was a sort of rapt thoughtfulness then he stirred slightly  you are going kirylo sidorovitch she asked  i going where oh yes but i must tell you first his voice was muffled and he forced himself to produce it with visible repugnance as if speech were something disgusting or deadly that story you knowthe story i heard this afternoon  i know the story already she said sadly  you know it have you correspondents in st petersburg too  no its sophia antonovna i have seen her just now she sends you her greetings she is going away tomorrow  he had lowered at last his fascinated glance she too was looking down and standing thus before each other in the glaring light between the four bare walls they seemed brought out from the confused immensity of the eastern borders to be exposed cruelly to the observation of my western eyes and i observed them there was nothing else to do my existence seemed so utterly forgotten by these two that i dared not now make a movement and i thought to myself that of course they had to come together the sister and the friend of that dead man the ideas the hopes the aspirations the cause of freedom expressed in their common affection for victor haldin the moral victim of autocracyall this must draw them to each other fatally her very ignorance and his loneliness to which he had alluded so strangely must work to that end and indeed i saw that the work was done already of course it was manifest that they must have been thinking of each other for a long time before they met she had the letter from that beloved brother kindling her imagination by the severe praise attached to that one name and for him to see that exceptional girl was enough the only cause for surprise was his gloomy aloofness before her clearly expressed welcome but he was young and however austere and devoted to his revolutionary ideals he was not blind the period of reserve was over he was coming forward in his own way i could not mistake the significance of this late visit for in what he had to say there was nothing urgent the true cause dawned upon me he had discovered that he needed her and she was moved by the same feeling it was the second time that i saw them together and i knew that next time they met i would not be there either remembered or forgotten i would have virtually ceased to exist for both these young people  i made this discovery in a very few moments meantime natalia haldin was telling razumov briefly of our peregrinations from one end of geneva to the other while speaking she raised her hands above her head to untie her veil and that movement displayed for an instant the seductive grace of her youthful figure clad in the simplest of mourning in the transparent shadow the hat rim threw on her face her grey eyes had an enticing lustre her voice with its unfeminine yet exquisite timbre was steady and she spoke quickly frank unembarrassed as she justified her action by the mental state of her mother a spasm of pain marred the generously confiding harmony of her features i perceived that with his downcast eyes he had the air of a man who is listening to a strain of music rather than to articulated speech and in the same way after she had ceased he seemed to listen yet motionless as if under the spell of suggestive sound he came to himself muttering  yes yes she has not shed a tear she did not seem to hear what i was saying i might have told her anything she looked as if no longer belonging to this world  miss haldin gave signs of profound distress her voice faltered you dont know how bad it has come to be she expects now to see him the veil dropped from her fingers and she clasped her hands in anguish it shall end by her seeing him she cried  razumov raised his head sharply and attached on her a prolonged thoughtful glance  hm thats very possible he muttered in a peculiar tone as if giving his opinion on a matter of fact i wonder what he checked himself  that would be the end her mind shall be gone then and her spirit will follow  miss haldin unclasped her hands and let them fall by her side  you think so he queried profoundly miss haldins lips were slightly parted something unexpected and unfathomable in that young mans character had fascinated her from the first no theres neither truth nor consolation to be got from the phantoms of the dead he added after a weighty pause i might have told her something true for instance that your brother meant to save his lifeto escape there can be no doubt of that but i did not  you did not but why  i dont know other thoughts came into my head he answered he seemed to me to be watching himself inwardly as though he were trying to count his own heartbeats while his eyes never for a moment left the face of the girl you were not there he continued i had made up my mind never to see you again  this seemed to take her breath away for a moment  you how is it possible  you may well ask however i think that i refrained from telling your mother from prudence i might have assured her that in the last conversation he held as a free man he mentioned you both  that last conversation was with you she struck in her deep moving voice some day you must  it was with me of you he said that you had trustful eyes and why i have not been able to forget that phrase i dont know it meant that there is in you no guile no deception no falsehood no suspicionnothing in your heart that could give you a conception of a living acting speaking lie if ever it came in your way that you are a predestined victim ha what a devilish suggestion  the convulsive uncontrolled tone of the last words disclosed the precarious hold he had over himself he was like a man defying his own dizziness in high places and tottering suddenly on the very edge of the precipice miss haldin pressed her hand to her breast the dropped black veil lay on the floor between them her movement steadied him he looked intently on that hand till it descended slowly and then raised again his eyes to her face but he did not give her time to speak  no you dont understand very well he had recovered his calm by a miracle of will so you talked with sophia antonovna  yes sophia antonovna told me miss haldin stopped wonder growing in her wide eyes  hm thats the respectable enemy he muttered as though he were alone  the tone of her references to you was extremely friendly remarked miss haldin after waiting for a while  is that your impression and she the most intelligent of the lot too things then are going as well as possible everything conspires toah these conspirators he said slowly with an accent of scorn they would get hold of you in no time you know natalia victorovna i have the greatest difficulty in saving myself from the superstition of an active providence its irresistible the alternative of course would be the personal devil of our simple ancestors but if so he has overdone it altogetherthe old father of liesour national patronour domestic god whom we take with us when we go abroad he has overdone it it seems that i am not simple enough thats it i ought to have known and i did know it he added in a tone of poignant distress which overcame my astonishment  this man is deranged i said to myself very much frightened  the next moment he gave me a very special impression beyond the range of commonplace definitions it was as though he had stabbed himself outside and had come in there to show it and more than thatas though he were turning the knife in the wound and watching the effect that was the impression rendered in physical terms one could not defend oneself from a certain amount of pity but it was for miss haldin already so tried in her deepest affections that i felt a serious concern her attitude her face expressed compassion struggling with doubt on the verge of terror  what is it kirylo sidorovitch there was a hint of tenderness in that cry he only stared at her in that complete surrender of all his faculties which in a happy lover would have had the name of ecstasy  why are you looking at me like this kirylo sidorovitch i have approached you frankly i need at this time to see clearly in myself she ceased for a moment as if to give him an opportunity to utter at last some word worthy of her exalted trust in her brothers friend his silence became impressive like a sign of a momentous resolution  in the end miss haldin went on appealingly  i have waited for you anxiously but now that you have been moved to come to us in your kindness you alarm me you speak obscurely it seems as if you were keeping back something from me  tell me natalia victorovna he was heard at last in a strange unringing voice whom did you see in that place  she was startled and as if deceived in her expectations  where in peter ivanovitchs rooms there was mr laspara and three other people  ha the vanguardthe forlorn hope of the great plot he commented to himself bearers of the spark to start an explosion which is meant to change fundamentally the lives of so many millions in order that peter ivanovitch should be the head of a state  you are teasing me she said our dear one told me once to remember that men serve always something greater than themselvesthe idea  our dear one he repeated slowly the effort he made to appear unmoved absorbed all the force of his soul he stood before her like a being with hardly a breath of life his eyes even as under great physical suffering had lost all their fire ah your brother but on your lips in your voice it soundsand indeed in you everything is divine i wish i could know the innermost depths of your thoughts of your feelings  but why kirylo sidorovitch she cried alarmed by these words coming out of strangely lifeless lips  have no fear it is not to betray you so you went there and sophia antonovna what did she tell you then  she said very little really she knew that i should hear everything from you she had no time for more than a few words miss haldins voice dropped and she became silent for a moment the man it appears has taken his life she said sadly  tell me natalia victorovna he asked after a pause do you believe in remorse  what a question  what can you know of it he muttered thickly it is not for such as you what i meant to ask was whether you believed in the efficacy of remorse  she hesitated as though she had not understood then her face lighted up  yes she said firmly  so he is absolved moreover that ziemianitch was a brute a drunken brute  a shudder passed through natalia haldin  but a man of the people razumov went on to whom they the revolutionists tell a tale of sublime hopes well the people must be forgiven and you must not believe all youve heard from that source either he added with a sort of sinister reluctance  you are concealing something from me she exclaimed  do you natalia victorovna believe in the duty of revenge  listen kirylo sidorovitch i believe that the future shall be merciful to us all revolutionist and reactionary victim and executioner betrayer and betrayed they shall all be pitied together when the light breaks on our black sky at last pitied and forgotten for without that there can be no union and no love  i hear no revenge for you then never not the least bit he smiled bitterly with his colourless lips you yourself are like the very spirit of that merciful future strange that it does not make it easier no but suppose that the real betrayer of your brotherziemianitch had a part in it too but insignificant and quite involuntarysuppose that he was a young man educated an intellectual worker thoughtful a man your brother might have trusted lightly perhaps but stillsuppose but theres a whole story there  and you know the story but why then  i have heard it there is a staircase in it and even phantoms but that does not matter if a man always serves something greater than himselfthe idea i wonder who is the greatest victim in that tale  in that tale miss haldin repeated she seemed turned into stone  do you know why i came to you it is simply because there is no one anywhere in the whole great world i could go to do you understand what i say not one to go to do you conceive the desolation of the thoughtno onetogoto  utterly misled by her own enthusiastic interpretation of two lines in the letter of a visionary under the spell of her own dread of lonely days in their overshadowed world of angry strife she was unable to see the truth struggling on his lips what she was conscious of was the obscure form of his suffering she was on the point of extending her hand to him impulsively when he spoke again  an hour after i saw you first i knew how it would be the terrors of remorse revenge confession anger hate fear are like nothing to the atrocious temptation which you put in my way the day you appeared before me with your voice with your face in the garden of that accursed villa  she looked utterly bewildered for a moment then with a sort of despairing insight went straight to the point  the story kirylo sidorovitch the story  there is no more to tell he made a movement forward and she actually put her hand on his shoulder to push him away but her strength failed her and he kept his ground though trembling in every limb it ends hereon this very spot he pressed a denunciatory finger to his breast with force and became perfectly still  i ran forward snatching up the chair and was in time to catch hold of miss haldin and lower her down as she sank into it she swung half round on my arm and remained averted from us both drooping over the back he looked at her with an appalling expressionless tranquillity incredulity struggling with astonishment anger and disgust deprived me for a time of the power of speech then i turned on him whispering from very rage  this is monstrous what are you staying for dont let her catch sight of you again go away he did not budge dont you understand that your presence is intolerableeven to me if theres any sense of shame in you  slowly his sullen eyes moved ill my direction how did this old man come here he muttered astounded  suddenly miss haldin sprang up from the chair made a few steps and tottered forgetting my indignation and even the man himself i hurried to her assistance i took her by the arm and she let me lead her into the drawingroom away from the lamp in the deeper dusk of the distant end the profile of mrs haldin her hands her whole figure had the stillness of a sombre painting miss haldin stopped and pointed mournfully at the tragic immobility of her mother who seemed to watch a beloved head lying in her lap  that gesture had an unequalled force of expression so farreaching in its human distress that one could not believe that it pointed out merely the ruthless working of political institutions after assisting miss haldin to the sofa i turned round to go back and shut the door framed in the opening in the searching glare of the white anteroom my eyes fell on razumov still there standing before the empty chair as if rooted for ever to the spot of his atrocious confession a wonder came over me that the mysterious force which had torn it out of him had failed to destroy his life to shatter his body it was there unscathed i stared at the broad line of his shoulders his dark head the amazing immobility of his limbs at his feet the veil dropped by miss haldin looked intensely black in the white crudity of the light he was gazing at it spellbound next moment stooping with an incredible savage swiftness he snatched it up and pressed it to his face with both hands something extreme astonishment perhaps dimmed my eyes so that he seemed to vanish before he moved  the slamming of the outer door restored my sight and i went on contemplating the empty chair in the empty anteroom the meaning of what i had seen reached my mind with a staggering shock i seized natalia haldin by the shoulder  that miserable wretch has carried off your veil i cried in the scared deadened voice of an awful discovery he  the rest remained unspoken i stepped back and looked down at her in silent horror her hands were lying lifelessly palms upwards on her lap she raised her grey eyes slowly shadows seemed to come and go in them as if the steady flame of her soul had been made to vacillate at last in the crosscurrents of poisoned air from the corrupted dark immensity claiming her for its own where virtues themselves fester into crimes in the cynicism of oppression and revolt  it is impossible to be more unhappy the languid whisper of her voice struck me with dismay it is impossible i feel my heart becoming like ice   iv   razumov walked straight home on the wet glistening pavement a heavy shower passed over him distant lightning played faintly against the fronts of the dumb houses with the shuttered shops all along the rue de carouge and now and then after the faint flash there was a faint sleepy rumble but the main forces of the thunderstorm remained massed down the rhone valley as if loath to attack the respectable and passionless abode of democratic liberty the seriousminded town of dreary hotels tendering the same indifferent hospitality to tourists of all nations and to international conspirators of every shade  the owner of the shop was making ready to close when razumov entered and without a word extended his hand for the key of his room on reaching it for him from a shelf the man was about to pass a small joke as to taking the air in a thunderstorm but after looking at the face of his lodger he only observed just to say something  youve got very wet  yes i am washed clean muttered razumov who was dripping from head to foot and passed through the inner door towards the staircase leading to his room  he did not change his clothes but after lighting the candle took off his watch and chain laid them on the table and sat down at once to write the book of his compromising record was kept in a locked drawer which he pulled out violently and did not even trouble to push back afterwards  in this queer pedantism of a man who had read thought lived pen in hand there is the sincerity of the attempt to grapple by the same means with another profounder knowledge after some passages which have been already made use of in the building up of this narrative or add nothing new to the psychological side of this disclosure there is even one more allusion to the silver medal in this last entry comes a page and a half of incoherent writing where his expression is baffled by the novelty and the mysteriousness of that side of our emotional life to which his solitary existence had been a stranger then only he begins to address directly the reader he had in his mind trying to express in broken sentences full of wonder and awe the sovereign he uses that very word power of her person over his imagination in which lay the dormant seed of her brothers words   the most trustful eyes in the worldyour brother said of you when he was as well as a dead man already and when you stood before me with your hand extended i remembered the very sound of his voice and i looked into your eyesand that was enough i knew that something had happened but i did not know then what but dont be deceived natalia victorovna i believed that i had in my breast nothing but an inexhaustible fund of anger and hate for you both i remembered that he had looked to you for the perpetuation of his visionary soul he this man who had robbed me of my hardworking purposeful existence i too had my guiding idea and remember that amongst us it is more difficult to lead a life of toil and selfdenial than to go out in the street and kill from conviction but enough of that hate or no hate i felt at once that while shunning the sight of you i could never succeed in driving away your image i would say addressing that dead man is this the way you are going to haunt me it is only later on that i understoodonly today only a few hours ago what could i have known of what was tearing me to pieces and dragging the secret for ever to my lips you were appointed to undo the evil by making me betray myself back into truth and peace you and you have done it in the same way too in which he ruined me by forcing upon me your confidence only what i detested him for in you ended by appearing noble and exalted but i repeat be not deceived i was given up to evil i exulted in having induced that silly innocent fool to steal his fathers money he was a fool but not a thief i made him one it was necessary i had to confirm myself in my contempt and hate for what i betrayed i have suffered from as many vipers in my heart as any social democrat of them allvanity ambitions jealousies shameful desires evil passions of envy and revenge i had my security stolen from me years of good work my best hopes listennow comes the true confession the other was nothing to save me your trustful eyes had to entice my thought to the very edge of the blackest treachery i could see them constantly looking at me with the confidence of your pure heart which had not been touched by evil things victor haldin had stolen the truth of my life from me who had nothing else in the world and he boasted of living on through you on this earth where i had no place to lay my head on she will marry some day he had saidand your eyes were trustful and do you know what i said to myself i shall steal his sisters soul from her when we met that first morning in the gardens and you spoke to me confidingly in the generosity of your spirit i was thinking yes he himself by talking of her trustful eyes has delivered her into my hands if you could have looked then into my heart you would have cried out aloud with terror and disgust  perhaps no one will believe the baseness of such an intention to be possible its certain that when we parted that morning i gloated over it i brooded upon the best way the old man you introduced me to insisted on walking with me i dont know who he is he talked of you of your lonely helpless state and every word of that friend of yours was egging me on to the unpardonable sin of stealing a soul could he have been the devil himself in the shape of an old englishman natalia victorovna i was possessed i returned to look at you every day and drink in your presence the poison of my infamous intention but i foresaw difficulties then sophia antonovna of whom i was not thinkingi had forgotten her existenceappears suddenly with that tale from st petersburg the only thing needed to make me safea trusted revolutionist for ever  it was as if ziemianitch had hanged himself to help me on to further crime the strength of falsehood seemed irresistible these people stood doomed by the folly and the illusion that was in themthey being themselves the slaves of lies natalia victorovna i embraced the might of falsehood i exulted in iti gave myself up to it for a time who could have resisted you yourself were the prize of it i sat alone in my room planning a life the very thought of which makes me shudder now like a believer who had been tempted to an atrocious sacrilege but i brooded ardently over its images the only thing was that there seemed to be no air in it and also i was afraid of your mother i never knew mine ive never known any kind of love there is something in the mere word of you i was not afraidforgive me for telling you this no not of you you were truth itself you could not suspect me as to your mother you yourself feared already that her mind had given way from grief who could believe anything against me had not ziemianitch hanged himself from remorse i said to myself lets put it to the test and be done with it once for all i trembled when i went in but your mother hardly listened to what i was saying to her and in a little while seemed to have forgotten my very existence i sat looking at her there was no longer anything between you and me you were defencelessand soon very soon you would be alone i thought of you defenceless for days you have talked with meopening your heart i remembered the shadow of your eyelashes over your grey trustful eyes and your pure forehead it is low like the forehead of statuescalm unstained it was as if your pure brow bore a light which fell on me searched my heart and saved me from ignominy from ultimate undoing and it saved you too pardon my presumption but there was that in your glances which seemed to tell me that you your light your truth i felt that i must tell you that i had ended by loving you and to tell you that i must first confess confess go outand perish  suddenly you stood before me you alone in all the world to whom i must confess you fascinated meyou have freed me from the blindness of anger and hatethe truth shining in you drew the truth out of me now i have done it and as i write here i am in the depths depths of anguish but there is air to breathe at lastair and by the by that old man sprang up from somewhere as i was speaking to you and raged at me like a disappointed devil i suffer horribly but i am not in despair there is only one more thing to do for me after thatif they let mei shall go away and bury myself in obscure misery in giving victor haldin up it was myself after all whom i have betrayed most basely you must believe what i say now you cant refuse to believe this most basely it is through you that i came to feel this so deeply after all it is they and not i who have the right on their sidetheirs is the strength of invisible powers so be it only dont be deceived natalia victorovna i am not converted have i then the soul of a slave no i am independentand therefore perdition is my lot  on these words he stopped writing shut the book and wrapped it in the black veil he had carried off he then ransacked the drawers for paper and string made up a parcel which he addressed to miss haldin boulevard des philosophes and then flung the pen away from him into a distant corner  this done he sat down with the watch before him he could have gone out at once but the hour had not struck yet the hour would be midnight there was no reason for that choice except that the facts and the words of a certain evening in his past were timing his conduct in the present the sudden power natalia haldin had gained over him he ascribed to the same cause you dont walk with impunity over a phantoms breast he heard himself mutter thus he saves me he thought suddenly he himself the betrayed man the vivid image of miss haldin seemed to stand by him watching him relentlessly she was not disturbing he had done with life and his thought even in her presence tried to take an impartial survey now his scorn extended to himself i had neither the simplicity nor the courage nor the selfpossession to be a scoundrel or an exceptionally able man for who with us in russia is to tell a scoundrel from an exceptionally able man  he was the puppet of his past because at the very stroke of midnight he jumped up and ran swiftly downstairs as if confident that by the power of destiny the house door would fly open before the absolute necessity of his errand and as a matter of fact just as he got to the bottom of the stairs it was opened for him by some people of the house coming home latetwo men and a woman he slipped out through them into the street swept then by a fitful gust of wind they were of course very much startled a flash of lightning enabled them to observe him walking away quickly one of the men shouted and was starting in pursuit but the woman had recognized him its all right its only that young russian from the third floor the darkness returned with a single clap of thunder like a gun fired for a warning of his escape from the prison of lies  he must have heard at some time or other and now remembered unconsciously that there was to be a gathering of revolutionists at the house of julius laspara that evening at any rate he made straight for the laspara house and found himself without surprise ringing at its street door which of course was closed by that time the thunderstorm had attacked in earnest the steep incline of the street ran with water the thick fall of rain enveloped him like a luminous veil in the play of lightning he was perfectly calm and between the crashes listened attentively to the delicate tinkling of the doorbell somewhere within the house  there was some difficulty before he was admitted his person was not known to that one of the guests who had volunteered to go downstairs and see what was the matter razumov argued with him patiently there could be no harm in admitting a caller he had something to communicate to the company upstairs  something of importance  thatll be for the hearers to judge  urgent  without a moments delay  meantime one of the laspara daughters descended the stairs small lamp in hand in a grimy and crumpled gown which seemed to hang on her by a miracle and looking more than ever like an old doll with a dusty brown wig dragged from under a sofa she recognized razumov at once  how do you do of course you may come in  following her light razumov climbed two flights of stairs from the lower darkness leaving the lamp on a bracket on the landing she opened a door and went in accompanied by the sceptical guest razumov entered last he closed the door behind him and stepping on one side put his back against the wall  the three little rooms en suite with low smoky ceilings and lit by paraffin lamps were crammed with people loud talking was going on in all three and teaglasses full halffull and empty stood everywhere even on the floor the other laspara girl sat dishevelled and languid behind an enormous samovar in the inner doorway razumov had a glimpse of the protuberance of a large stomach which he recognized only a few feet from him julius laspara was getting down hurriedly from his high stool  the appearance of the midnight visitor caused no small sensation laspara is very summary in his version of that nights happenings after some words of greeting disregarded by razumov laspara ignoring purposely his guests soaked condition and his extraordinary manner of presenting himself mentioned something about writing an article he was growing uneasy and razumov appeared absentminded i have written already all i shall ever write he said at last with a little laugh  the whole companys attention was riveted on the newcomer dripping with water deadly pale and keeping his position against the wall razumov put laspara gently aside as though he wished to be seen from head to foot by everybody by then the buzz of conversations had died down completely even in the most distant of the three rooms the doorway facing razumov became blocked by men and women who craned their necks and certainly seemed to expect something startling to happen  a squeaky insolent declaration was heard from that group  i know this ridiculously conceited individual  what individual asked razumov raising his bowed head and searching with his eyes all the eyes fixed upon him an intense surprised silence lasted for a time if its me  he stopped thinking over the form of his confession and found it suddenly unavoidably suggested by the fateful evening of his life  i am come here he began in a clear voice to talk of an individual called ziemianitch sophia antonovna has informed me that she would make public a certain letter from st petersburg  sophia antonovna has left us early in the evening said laspara its quite correct everybody here has heard  very well razumov interrupted with a shade of impatience for his heart was beating strongly then mastering his voice so far that there was even a touch of irony in his clear forcible enunciation  in justice to that individual the much illused peasant ziemianitch i now declare solemnly that the conclusions of that letter calumniate a man of the peoplea bright russian soul ziemianitch had nothing to do with the actual arrest of victor haldin  razumov dwelt on the name heavily and then waited till the faint mournful murmur which greeted it had died out  victor victorovitch haldin he began again acting with no doubt nobleminded imprudence took refuge with a certain student of whose opinions he knew nothing but what his own illusions suggested to his generous heart it was an unwise display of confidence but i am not here to appreciate the actions of victor haldin am i to tell you of the feelings of that student sought out in his obscure solitude and menaced by the complicity forced upon him am i to tell you what he did its a rather complicated story in the end the student went to general t himself and said i have the man who killed de p locked up in my room victor haldina student like myself  a great buzz arose in which razumov raised his voice  observethat man had certain honest ideals in view but i didnt come here to explain him  no but you must explain how you know all this came in grave tones from somebody  a vile coward this simple cry vibrated with indignation name him shouted other voices  what are you clamouring for said razumov disdainfully in the profound silence which fell on the raising of his hand havent you all understood that i am that man  laspara went away brusquely from his side and climbed upon his stool in the first forward surge of people towards him razumov expected to be torn to pieces but they fell back without touching him and nothing came of it but noise it was bewildering his head ached terribly in the confused uproar he made out several times the name of peter ivanovitch the word judgement and the phrase but this is a confession uttered by somebody in a desperate shriek in the midst of the tumult a young man younger than himself approached him with blazing eyes  i must beg you he said with venomous politeness to be good enough not to move from this spot till you are told what you are to do  razumov shrugged his shoulders i came in voluntarily  maybe but you wont go out till you are permitted retorted the other  he beckoned with his hand calling out louisa louisa come here please and presently one of the laspara girls they had been staring at razumov from behind the samovar came along trailing a bedraggled tail of dirty flounces and dragging with her a chair which she set against the door and sitting down on it crossed her legs the young man thanked her effusively and rejoined a group carrying on an animated discussion in low tones razumov lost himself for a moment  a squeaky voice screamed confession or no confession you are a police spy  the revolutionist nikita had pushed his way in front of razumov and faced him with his big livid cheeks his heavy paunch bull neck and enormous hands razumov looked at the famous slayer of gendarmes in silent disgust  and what are you he said very low then shut his eyes and rested the back of his head against the wall  it would be better for you to depart now razumov heard a mild sad voice and opened his eyes the gentle speaker was an elderly man with a great brush of fine hair making a silvery halo all round his keen intelligent face peter ivanovitch shall be informed of your confessionand you shall be directed  then turning to nikita nicknamed necator standing by he appealed to him in a murmur  what else can we do after this piece of sincerity he cannot be dangerous any longer  the other muttered better make sure of that before we let him go leave that to me i know how to deal with such gentlemen  he exchanged meaning glances with two or three men who nodded slightly then turning roughly to razumov you have heard you are not wanted here why dont you get out  the laspara girl on guard rose and pulled the chair out of the way unemotionally she gave a sleepy stare to razumov who started looked round the room and passed slowly by her as if struck by some sudden thought  i beg you to observe he said already on the landing that i had only to hold my tongue today of all days since i came amongst you i was made safe and today i made myself free from falsehood from remorseindependent of every single human being on this earth  he turned his back on the room and walked towards the stairs but at the violent crash of the door behind him he looked over his shoulder and saw that nikita with three others had followed him out they are going to kill me after all he thought  before he had time to turn round and confront them fairly they set on him with a rush he was driven headlong against the wall i wonder how he completed his thought nikita cried with a shrill laugh right in his face we shall make you harmless you wait a bit  razumov did not struggle the three men held him pinned against the wall while nikita taking up a position a little on one side deliberately swung off his enormous arm razumov looking for a knife in his hand saw it come at him open unarmed and received a tremendous blow on the side of his head over his ear at the same time he heard a faint dull detonating sound as if some one had fired a pistol on the other side of the wall a raging fury awoke in him at this outrage the people in lasparas rooms holding their breath listened to the desperate scuffling of four men all over the landing thuds against the walls a terrible crash against the very door then all of them went down together with a violence which seemed to shake the whole house razumov overpowered breathless crushed under the weight of his assailants saw the monstrous nikita squatting on his heels near his head while the others held him down kneeling on his chest gripping his throat lying across his legs  turn his face the other way the paunchy terrorist directed in an excited gleeful squeak  razumov could struggle no longer he was exhausted he had to watch passively the heavy open hand of the brute descend again in a degrading blow over his other ear it seemed to split his head in two and all at once the men holding him became perfectly silentsoundless as shadows in silence they pulled him brutally to his feet rushed with him noiselessly down the staircase and opening the door flung him out into the street  he fell forward and at once rolled over and over helplessly going down the short slope together with the rush of running rain water he came to rest in the roadway of the street at the bottom lying on his back with a great flash of lightning over his facea vivid silent flash of lightning which blinded him utterly he picked himself up and put his arm over his eyes to recover his sight not a sound reached him from anywhere and he began to walk staggering down a long empty street the lightning waved and darted round him its silent flames the water of the deluge fell ran leaped drovenoiseless like the drift of mist in this unearthly stillness his footsteps fell silent on the pavement while a dumb wind drove him on and on like a lost mortal in a phantom world ravaged by a soundless thunderstorm god only knows where his noiseless feet took him to that night here and there and back again without pause or rest of one place at least where they did lead him we heard afterwards and in the morning the driver of the first southshore tramcar clanging his bell desperately saw a bedraggled soaked man without a hat and walking in the roadway unsteadily with his head down step right in front of his car and go under  when they picked him up with two broken limbs and a crushed side razumov had not lost consciousness it was as though he had tumbled smashing himself into a world of mutes silent men moving unheard lifted him up laid him on the sidewalk gesticulating and grimacing round him their alarm horror and compassion a red face with moustaches stooped close over him lips moving eyes rolling razumov tried hard to understand the reason of this dumb show to those who stood around him the features of that stranger so grievously hurt seemed composed in meditation afterwards his eyes sent out at them a look of fear and closed slowly they stared at him razumov made an effort to remember some french words  je suis sourd he had time to utter feebly before he fainted  he is deaf they exclaimed to each other thats why he did not hear the car  they carried him off in that same car before it started on its journey a woman in a shabby black dress who had run out of the iron gate of some private grounds up the road clambered on to the rear platform and would not be put off  i am a relation she insisted in bad french this young man is a russian and i am his relation on this plea they let her have her way she sat down calmly and took his head on her lap her scared faded eyes avoided looking at his deathlike face at the corner of a street on the other side of the town a stretcher met the car she followed it to the door of the hospital where they let her come in and see him laid on a bed razumovs newfound relation never shed a tear but the officials had some difficulty in inducing her to go away the porter observed her lingering on the opposite pavement for a long time suddenly as though she had remembered something she ran off  the ardent hater of all finance ministers the slave of madame de s had made up her mind to offer her resignation as lady companion to the egeria of peter ivanovitch she had found work to do after her own heart  but hours before while the thunderstorm still raged in the night there had been in the rooms of julius laspara a great sensation the terrible nikita coming in from the landing uplifted his squeaky voice in horrible glee before all the company  razumov mr razumov the wonderful razumov he shall never be any use as a spy on any one he wont talk because he will never hear anything in his lifenot a thing i have burst the drums of his ears for him oh you may trust me i know the trick ha ha ha i know the trick   v   it was nearly a fortnight after her mothers funeral that i saw natalia haldin for the last time  in those silent sombre days the doors of the appartement on the boulevard des philosophes were closed to every one but myself i believe i was of some use if only in this that i alone was aware of the incredible part of the situation miss haldin nursed her mother alone to the last moment if razumovs visit had anything to do with mrs haldins end and i cannot help thinking that it hastened it considerably it is because the man trusted impulsively by the illfated victor haldin had failed to gain the confidence of victor haldins mother what tale precisely he told her cannot be knownat any rate i do not know itbut to me she seemed to die from the shock of an ultimate disappointment borne in silence she had not believed him perhaps she could not longer believe any one and consequently had nothing to say to any onenot even to her daughter i suspect that miss haldin lived the heaviest hours of her life by that silent deathbed i confess i was angry with the brokenhearted old woman passing away in the obstinacy of her mute distrust of her daughter  when it was all over i stood aside miss haldin had her compatriots round her then a great number of them attended the funeral i was there too but afterwards managed to keep away from miss haldin till i received a short note rewarding my selfdenial it is as you would have it i am going back to russia at once my mind is made up come and see me  verily it was a reward of discretion i went without delay to receive it the appartement of the boulevard des philosophes presented the dreary signs of impending abandonment it looked desolate and as if already empty to my eyes  standing we exchanged a few words about her health mine remarks as to some people of the russian colony and then natalia haldin establishing me on the sofa began to talk openly of her future work of her plans it was all to be as i had wished it and it was to be for life we should never see each other again never  i gathered this success to my breast natalia haldin looked matured by her open and secret experiences with her arms folded she walked up and down the whole length of the room talking slowly smoothbrowed with a resolute profile she gave me a new view of herself and i marvelled at that something grave and measured in her voice in her movements in her manner it was the perfection of collected independence the strength of her nature had come to surface because the obscure depths had been stirred  we two can talk of it now she observed after a silence and stopping short before me have you been to inquire at the hospital lately  yes i have and as she looked at me fixedly he will live the doctors say but i thought that tekla  tekla has not been near me for several days explained miss haldin quickly as i never offered to go to the hospital with her she thinks that i have no heart she is disillusioned about me  and miss haldin smiled faintly  yes she sits with him as long and as often as they will let her i said she says she must never abandon himnever as long as she lives hell need somebodya hopeless cripple and stone deaf with that  stone deaf i didnt know murmured natalia haldin  he is it seems strange i am told there were no apparent injuries to the head they say too that it is not very likely that he will live so very long for tekla to take care of him  miss haldin shook her head  while there are travellers ready to fall by the way our tekla shall never be idle she is a good samaritan by an irresistible vocation the revolutionists didnt understand her fancy a devoted creature like that being employed to carry about documents sewn in her dress or made to write from dictation  there is not much perspicacity in the world  no sooner uttered i regretted that observation natalia haldin looking me straight in the face assented by a slight movement of her head she was not offended but turning away began to pace the room again to my western eyes she seemed to be getting farther and farther from me quite beyond my reach now but undiminished in the increasing distance i remained silent as though it were hopeless to raise my voice the sound of hers so close to me made me start a little  tekla saw him picked up after the accident the good soul never explained to me really how it came about she affirms that there was some understanding between themsome sort of compactthat in any sore need in misfortune or difficulty or pain he was to come to her  was there i said it is lucky for him that there was then hell need all the devotion of the good samaritan  it was a fact that tekla looking out of her window at five in the morning for some reason or other had beheld razumov in the grounds of the chateau borel standing stockstill bareheaded in the rain at the foot of the terrace she had screamed out to him by name to know what was the matter he never even raised his head by the time she had dressed herself sufficiently to run downstairs he was gone she started in pursuit and rushing out into the road came almost directly upon the arrested tramcar and the small knot of people picking up razumov that much tekla had told me herself one afternoon we happened to meet at the door of the hospital and without any kind of comment but i did not want to meditate very long on the inwardness of this peculiar episode  yes natalia victorovna he shall need somebody when they dismiss him on crutches and stone deaf from the hospital but i do not think that when he rushed like an escaped madman into the grounds of the chateau borel it was to seek the help of that good tekla  no said natalia stopping short before me perhaps not she sat down and leaned her head on her hand thoughtfully the silence lasted for several minutes during that time i remembered the evening of his atrocious confessionthe plaint she seemed to have hardly enough life left in her to utter it is impossible to be more unhappy the recollection would have given me a shudder if i had not been lost in wonder at her force and her tranquillity there was no longer any natalia haldin because she had completely ceased to think of herself it was a great victory a characteristically russian exploit in selfsuppression  she recalled me to myself by getting up suddenly like a person who has come to a decision she walked to the writingtable now stripped of all the small objects associated with her by daily usea mere piece of dead furniture but it contained something living still since she took from a recess a flat parcel which she brought to me  its a book she said rather abruptly it was sent to me wrapped up in my veil i told you nothing at the time but now ive decided to leave it with you i have the right to do that it was sent to me it is mine you may preserve it or destroy it after you have read it and while you read it please remember that i was defenceless and that he  defenceless i repeated surprised looking hard at her  youll find the very word written there she whispered well its true i was defencelessbut perhaps you were able to see that for yourself her face coloured then went deadly pale in justice to the man i want you to remember that i was oh i was i was  i rose a little shakily  i am not likely to forget anything you say at this our last parting  her hand fell into mine  its difficult to believe that it must be goodbye with us  she returned my pressure and our hands separated  yes i am leaving here tomorrow my eyes are open at last and my hands are free now as for the restwhich of us can fail to hear the stifled cry of our great distress it may be nothing to the world  the world is more conscious of your discordant voices i said it is the way of the world  yes she bowed her head in assent and hesitated for a moment i must own to you that i shall never give up looking forward to the day when all discord shall be silenced try to imagine its dawn the tempest of blows and of execrations is over all is still the new sun is rising and the weary men united at last taking count in their conscience of the ended contest feel saddened by their victory because so many ideas have perished for the triumph of one so many beliefs have abandoned them without support they feel alone on the earth and gather close together yes there must be many bitter hours but at last the anguish of hearts shall be extinguished in love  and on this last word of her wisdom a word so sweet so bitter so cruel sometimes i said goodbye to natalia haldin it is hard to think i shall never look any more into the trustful eyes of that girlwedded to an invincible belief in the advent of loving concord springing like a heavenly flower from the soil of mens earth soaked in blood torn by struggles watered with tears    it must be understood that at that time i didnt know anything of mr razumovs confession to the assembled revolutionists natalia haldin might have guessed what was the one thing more which remained for him to do but this my western eyes had failed to see  tekla the exlady companion of madame de s haunted his bedside at the hospital we met once or twice at the door of that establishment but on these occasions she was not communicative she gave me news of mr razumov as concisely as possible he was making a slow recovery but would remain a hopeless cripple all his life personally i never went near him i never saw him again after the awful evening when i stood by a watchful but ignored spectator of his scene with miss haldin he was in due course discharged from the hospital and his relativeso i was toldhad carried him off somewhere  my information was completed nearly two years later the opportunity certainly was not of my seeking it was quite accidentally that i met a muchtrusted woman revolutionist at the house of a distinguished russian gentleman of liberal convictions who came to live in geneva for a time  he was a quite different sort of celebrity from peter ivanovitcha darkhaired man with kind eyes highshouldered courteous and with something hushed and circumspect in his manner he approached me choosing the moment when there was no one near followed by a greyhaired alert lady in a crimson blouse  our sophia antonovna wishes to be made known to you he addressed me in his guarded voice and so i leave you two to have a talk together  i would never have intruded myself upon your notice the greyhaired lady began at once if i had not been charged with a message for you  it was a message of a few friendly words from natalia haldin sophia antonovna had just returned from a secret excursion into russia and had seen miss haldin she lived in a town in the centre sharing her compassionate labours between the horrors of overcrowded jails and the heartrending misery of bereaved homes she did not spare herself in good service sophia antonovna assured me  she has a faithful soul an undaunted spirit and an indefatigable body the woman revolutionist summed it all up with a touch of enthusiasm  a conversation thus engaged was not likely to drop from want of interest on my side we went to sit apart in a corner where no one interrupted us in the course of our talk about miss haldin sophia antonovna remarked suddenly  i suppose you remember seeing me before that evening when natalia came to ask peter ivanovitch for the address of a certain razumov that young man who  i remember perfectly i said when sophia antonovna learned that i had in my possession that young mans journal given me by miss haldin she became intensely interested she did not conceal her curiosity to see the document  i offered to show it to her and she at once volunteered to call on me next day for that purpose  she turned over the pages greedily for an hour or more and then handed me the book with a faint sigh while moving about russia she had seen razumov too he lived not in the centre but in the south she described to me a little tworoomed wooden house in the suburb of some very small town hiding within the high plankfence of a yard overgrown with nettles he was crippled ill getting weaker every day and tekla the samaritan tended him unweariedly with the pure joy of unselfish devotion there was nothing in that task to become disillusioned about  i did not hide from sophia antonovna my surprise that she should have visited mr razumov i did not even understand the motive but she informed me that she was not the only one  some of us always go to see him when passing through he is intelligent we has ideas he talks well too  presently i heard for the first time of razumovs public confession in lasparas house sophia antonovna gave me a detailed relation of what had occurred there razumov himself had told her all about it most minutely  then looking hard at me with her brilliant black eyes  there are evil moments in every life a false suggestion enters ones brain and then fear is bornfear of oneself fear for oneself or else a false couragewho knows well call it what you like but tell me how many of them would deliver themselves up deliberately to perdition as he himself says in that book rather than go on living secretly debased in their own eyes how many and please mark thishe was safe when he did it it was just when he believed himself safe and moreinfinitely morewhen the possibility of being loved by that admirable girl first dawned upon him that he discovered that his bitterest railings the worst wickedness the devil work of his hate and pride could never cover up the ignominy of the existence before him theres character in such a discovery  i accepted her conclusion in silence who would care to question the grounds of forgiveness or compassion however it appeared later on that there was some compunction too in the charity extended by the revolutionary world to razumov the betrayer sophia antonovna continued uneasily  and then you know he was the victim of an outrage it was not authorized nothing was decided as to what was to be done with him he had confessed voluntarily and that nikita who burst the drums of his ears purposely out on the landing you know as if carried away by indignationwell he has turned out to be a scoundrel of the worst kinda traitor himself a betrayera spy razumov told me he had charged him with it by a sort of inspiration  i had a glimpse of that brute i said how any of you could have been deceived for half a day passes my comprehension  she interrupted me  there there dont talk of it the first time i saw him i too was appalled they cried me down we were always telling each other oh you mustnt mind his appearance and then he was always ready to kill there was no doubt of it he killedyes in both camps the fiend  then sophia antonovna after mastering the angry trembling of her lips told me a very queer tale it went that councillor mikulin travelling in germany shortly after razumovs disappearance from geneva happened to meet peter ivanovitch in a railway carriage being alone in the compartment these two talked together half the night and it was then that mikulin the police chief gave a hint to the archrevolutionist as to the true character of the archslayer of gendarmes it looks as though mikulin had wanted to get rid of that particular agent of his own he might have grown tired of him or frightened of him it must also be said that mikulin had inherited the sinister nikita from his predecessor in office  and this story too i received without comment in my character of a mute witness of things russian unrolling their eastern logic under my western eyes but i permitted myself a question  tell me please sophia antonovna did madame de s leave all her fortune to peter ivanovitch  not a bit of it the woman revolutionist shrugged her shoulders in disgust she died without making a will a lot of nephews and nieces came down from st petersburg like a flock of vultures and fought for her money amongst themselves all beastly kammerherrs and maids of honourabominable court flunkeys tfui  one does not hear much of peter ivanovitch now i remarked after a pause  peter ivanovitch said sophia antonovna gravely has united himself to a peasant girl  i was truly astonished  what on the riviera  what nonsense of course not  sophia antonovnas tone was slightly tart  is he then living actually in russia its a tremendous riskisnt it i cried and all for the sake of a peasant girl dont you think its very wrong of him  sophia antonovna preserved a mysterious silence for a while then made a statement he just simply adores her  does he well then i hope that she wont hesitate to beat him  sophia antonovna got up and wished me goodbye as though she had not heard a word of my impious hope but in the very doorway where i attended her she turned round for an instant and declared in a firm voice  peter ivanovitch is an inspired man
