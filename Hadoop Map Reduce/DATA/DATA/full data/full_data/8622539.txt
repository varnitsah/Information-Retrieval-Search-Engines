the piper come    rainbow valley    chapter i home again  it was a clear applegreen evening in may and four winds harbour was mirroring back the clouds of the golden west between its softly dark shores  the sea moaned eerily on the sandbar sorrowful even in spring but a sly jovial wind came piping down the red harbour road along which miss cornelias comfortable matronly figure was making its way towards the village of glen st mary  miss cornelia was rightfully mrs marshall elliott and had been mrs marshall elliott for thirteen years but even yet more people referred to her as miss cornelia than as mrs elliott  the old name was dear to her old friends only one of them contemptuously dropped it  susan baker the gray and grim and faithful handmaiden of the blythe family at ingleside never lost an opportunity of calling her mrs marshall elliott with the most killing and pointed emphasis as if to say you wanted to be mrs and mrs you shall be with a vengeance as far as i am concerned  miss cornelia was going up to ingleside to see dr and mrs blythe who were just home from europe  they had been away for three months having left in february to attend a famous medical congress in london and certain things which miss cornelia was anxious to discuss had taken place in the glen during their absence  for one thing there was a new family in the manse and such a family  miss cornelia shook her head over them several times as she walked briskly along  susan baker and the anne shirley of other days saw her coming as they sat on the big veranda at ingleside enjoying the charm of the cats light the sweetness of sleepy robins whistling among the twilit maples and the dance of a gusty group of daffodils blowing against the old mellow red brick wall of the lawn  anne was sitting on the steps her hands clasped over her knee looking in the kind dusk as girlish as a mother of many has any right to be and the beautiful graygreen eyes gazing down the harbour road were as full of unquenchable sparkle and dream as ever  behind her in the hammock rilla blythe was curled up a fat rolypoly little creature of six years the youngest of the ingleside children  she had curly red hair and hazel eyes that were now buttoned up after the funny wrinkled fashion in which rilla always went to sleep  shirley the little brown boy as he was known in the family whos who was asleep in susans arms  he was brownhaired browneyed and brownskinned with very rosy cheeks and he was susans especial love  after his birth anne had been very ill for a long time and susan mothered the baby with a passionate tenderness which none of the other children dear as they were to her had ever called out  dr blythe had said that but for her he would never have lived  i gave him life just as much as you did mrs dr dear susan was wont to say  he is just as much my baby as he is yours and indeed it was always to susan that shirley ran to be kissed for bumps and rocked to sleep and protected from welldeserved spankings  susan had conscientiously spanked all the other blythe children when she thought they needed it for their souls good but she would not spank shirley nor allow his mother to do it  once dr blythe had spanked him and susan had been stormily indignant  that man would spank an angel mrs dr dear that he would she had declared bitterly and she would not make the poor doctor a pie for weeks  she had taken shirley with her to her brothers home during his parents absence while all the other children had gone to avonlea and she had three blessed months of him all to herself nevertheless susan was very glad to find herself back at ingleside with all her darlings around her again  ingleside was her world and in it she reigned supreme  even anne seldom questioned her decisions much to the disgust of mrs rachel lynde of green gables who gloomily told anne whenever she visited four winds that she was letting susan get to be entirely too much of a boss and would live to rue it  here is cornelia bryant coming up the harbour road mrs dr dear said susan  she will be coming up to unload three months gossip on us  i hope so said anne hugging her knees  im starving for glen st mary gossip susan  i hope miss cornelia can tell me everything that has happened while weve been awayeverything who has got born or married or drunk who has died or gone away or come or fought or lost a cow or found a beau  its so delightful to be home again with all the dear glen folks and i want to know all about them  why i remember wondering as i walked through westminster abbey which of her two especial beaux millicent drew would finally marry  do you know susan i have a dreadful suspicion that i love gossip  well of course mrs dr dear admitted susan every proper woman likes to hear the news  i am rather interested in millicent drews case myself  i never had a beau much less two and i do not mind now for being an old maid does not hurt when you get used to it  millicents hair always looks to me as if she had swept it up with a broom  but the men do not seem to mind that  they see only her pretty piquant mocking little face susan  that may very well be mrs dr dear  the good book says that favour is deceitful and beauty is vain but i should not have minded finding that out for myself if it had been so ordained i have no doubt we will all be beautiful when we are angels but what good will it do us then  speaking of gossip however they do say that poor mrs harrison miller over harbour tried to hang herself last week  oh susan  calm yourself mrs dr dear  she did not succeed  but i really do not blame her for trying for her husband is a terrible man  but she was very foolish to think of hanging herself and leaving the way clear for him to marry some other woman  if i had been in her shoes mrs dr dear i would have gone to work to worry him so that he would try to hang himself instead of me not that i hold with people hanging themselves under any circumstances mrs dr dear  what is the matter with harrison miller anyway said anne impatiently  he is always driving some one to extremes  well some people call it religion and some call it cussedness begging your pardon mrs dr dear for using such a word  it seems they cannot make out which it is in harrisons case  there are days when he growls at everybody because he thinks he is foreordained to eternal punishment  and then there are days when he says he does not care and goes and gets drunk  my own opinion is that he is not sound in his intellect for none of that branch of the millers were  his grandfather went out of his mind  he thought he was surrounded by big black spiders  they crawled over him and floated in the air about him  i hope i shall never go insane mrs dr dear and i do not think i will because it is not a habit of the bakers  but if an allwise providence should decree it i hope it will not take the form of big black spiders for i loathe the animals  as for mrs miller i do not know whether she really deserves pity or not  there are some who say she just married harrison to spite richard taylor which seems to me a very peculiar reason for getting married but then of course i am no judge of things matrimonial mrs dr dear  and there is cornelia bryant at the gate so i will put this blessed brown baby on his bed and get my knitting    chapter ii sheer gossip  where are the other children asked miss cornelia when the first greetingscordial on her side rapturous on annes and dignified on susanswere over  shirley is in bed and jem and walter and the twins are down in their beloved rainbow valley said anne  they just came home this afternoon you know and they could hardly wait until supper was over before rushing down to the valley  they love it above every spot on earth  even the maple grove doesnt rival it in their affections  i am afraid they love it too well said susan gloomily little jem said once he would rather go to rainbow valley than to heaven when he died and that was not a proper remark  i suppose they had a great time in avonlea said miss cornelia  enormous  marilla does spoil them terribly  jem in particular can do no wrong in her eyes  miss cuthbert must be an old lady now said miss cornelia getting out her knitting so that she could hold her own with susan  miss cornelia held that the woman whose hands were employed always had the advantage over the woman whose hands were not  marilla is eightyfive said anne with a sigh  her hair is snowwhite  but strange to say her eyesight is better than it was when she was sixty  well dearie im real glad youre all back  ive been dreadful lonesome  but we havent been dull in the glen believe me there hasnt been such an exciting spring in my time as far as church matters go  weve got settled with a minister at last anne dearie  the reverend john knox meredith mrs dr dear said susan resolved not to let miss cornelia tell all the news  is he nice asked anne interestedly  miss cornelia sighed and susan groaned  yes hes nice enough if that were all said the former  he is very niceand very learnedand very spiritual  but oh anne dearie he has no common sense  how was it you called him then  well theres no doubt he is by far the best preacher we ever had in glen st mary church said miss cornelia veering a tack or two  i suppose it is because he is so moony and absentminded that he never got a town call  his trial sermon was simply wonderful believe me  every one went mad about it and his looks  he is very comely mrs dr dear and when all is said and done i do like to see a welllooking man in the pulpit broke in susan thinking it was time she asserted herself again  besides said miss cornelia we were anxious to get settled and mr meredith was the first candidate we were all agreed on somebody had some objection to all the others  there was some talk of calling mr folsom  he was a good preacher too but somehow people didnt care for his appearance  he was too dark and sleek  he looked exactly like a great black tomcat that he did mrs dr dear said susan  i never could abide such a man in the pulpit every sunday  then mr rogers came and he was like a chip in porridgeneither harm nor good resumed miss cornelia  but if he had preached like peter and paul it would have profited him nothing for that was the day old caleb ramsays sheep strayed into church and gave a loud baaa just as he announced his text  everybody laughed and poor rogers had no chance after that  some thought we ought to call mr stewart because he was so well educated he could read the new testament in five languages  but i do not think he was any surer than other men of getting to heaven because of that interjected susan  most of us didnt like his delivery said miss cornelia ignoring susan  he talked in grunts so to speak  and mr arnett couldnt preach at all  and he picked about the worst candidating text there is in the biblecurse ye meroz  whenever he got stuck for an idea he would bang the bible and shout very bitterly curse ye meroz  poor meroz got thoroughly cursed that day whoever he was mrs dr dear said susan  the minister who is candidating cant be too careful what text he chooses said miss cornelia solemnly  i believe mr pierson would have got the call if he had picked a different text  but when he announced i will lift my eyes to the hills he was done for  every one grinned for every one knew that those two hill girls from the harbour head have been setting their caps for every single minister who came to the glen for the last fifteen years  and mr newman had too large a family  he stayed with my brotherinlaw james clow said susan  how many children have you got i asked him  nine boys and a sister for each of them he said  eighteen said i  dear me what a family  and then he laughed and laughed  but i do not know why mrs dr dear and i am certain that eighteen children would be too many for any manse  he had only ten children susan explained miss cornelia with contemptuous patience  and ten good children would not be much worse for the manse and congregation than the four who are there now  though i wouldnt say anne dearie that they are so bad either  i like themeverybody likes them  its impossible to help liking them  they would be real nice little souls if there was anyone to look after their manners and teach them what is right and proper  for instance at school the teacher says they are model children  but at home they simply run wild  what about mrs meredith asked anne  theres no mrs meredith  that is just the trouble  mr meredith is a widower  his wife died four years ago  if we had known that i dont suppose we would have called him for a widower is even worse in a congregation than a single man  but he was heard to speak of his children and we all supposed there was a mother too  and when they came there was nobody but old aunt martha as they call her  shes a cousin of mr merediths mother i believe and he took her in to save her from the poorhouse  she is seventyfive years old half blind and very deaf and very cranky  and a very poor cook mrs dr dear  the worst possible manager for a manse said miss cornelia bitterly  mr meredith wont get any other housekeeper because he says it would hurt aunt marthas feelings  anne dearie believe me the state of that manse is something terrible everything is thick with dust and nothing is ever in its place and we had painted and papered it all so nice before they came  there are four children you say asked anne beginning to mother them already in her heart  yes  they run up just like the steps of a stair  geralds the oldest  hes twelve and they call him jerry  hes a clever boy faith is eleven  she is a regular tomboy but pretty as a picture i must say  she looks like an angel but she is a holy terror for mischief mrs dr dear said susan solemnly  i was at the manse one night last week and mrs james millison was there too  she had brought them up a dozen eggs and a little pail of milka very little pail mrs dr dear  faith took them and whisked down the cellar with them  near the bottom of the stairs she caught her toe and fell the rest of the way milk and eggs and all  you can imagine the result mrs dr dear  but that child came up laughing  i dont know whether im myself or a custard pie she said  and mrs james millison was very angry  she said she would never take another thing to the manse if it was to be wasted and destroyed in that fashion  maria millison never hurt herself taking things to the manse sniffed miss cornelia  she just took them that night as an excuse for curiosity  but poor faith is always getting into scrapes  she is so heedless and impulsive  just like me  im going to like your faith said anne decidedly  she is full of spunkand i do like spunk mrs dr dear admitted susan  theres something taking about her conceded miss cornelia you never see her but shes laughing and somehow it always makes you want to laugh too  she cant even keep a straight face in church  una is tenshes a sweet little thingnot pretty but sweet  and thomas carlyle is nine  they call him carl and he has a regular mania for collecting toads and bugs and frogs and bringing them into the house  i suppose he was responsible for the dead rat that was lying on a chair in the parlour the afternoon mrs grant called  it gave her a turn said susan and i do not wonder for manse parlours are no places for dead rats  to be sure it may have been the cat who left it there  he is as full of the old nick as he can be stuffed mrs dr dear  a manse cat should at least look respectable in my opinion whatever he really is  but i never saw such a rakishlooking beast  and he walks along the ridgepole of the manse almost every evening at sunset mrs dr dear and waves his tail and that is not becoming  the worst of it is they are never decently dressed sighed miss cornelia  and since the snow went they go to school barefooted  now you know anne dearie that isnt the right thing for manse childrenespecially when the methodist ministers little girl always wears such nice buttoned boots and i do wish they wouldnt play in the old methodist graveyard  its very tempting when its right beside the manse said anne  ive always thought graveyards must be delightful places to play in  oh no you did not mrs dr dear said loyal susan determined to protect anne from herself  you have too much good sense and decorum  why did they ever build that manse beside the graveyard in the first place asked anne  their lawn is so small there is no place for them to play except in the graveyard  it was a mistake admitted miss cornelia  but they got the lot cheap  and no other manse children ever thought of playing there  mr meredith shouldnt allow it  but he has always got his nose buried in a book when he is home  he reads and reads or walks about in his study in a daydream  so far he hasnt forgotten to be in church on sundays but twice he has forgotten about the prayermeeting and one of the elders had to go over to the manse and remind him  and he forgot about fanny coopers wedding  they rang him up on the phone and then he rushed right over just as he was carpet slippers and all  one wouldnt mind if the methodists didnt laugh so about it  but theres one comfortthey cant criticize his sermons  he wakes up when hes in the pulpit believe me  and the methodist minister cant preach at allso they tell me  i have never heard him thank goodness  miss cornelias scorn of men had abated somewhat since her marriage but her scorn of methodists remained untinged of charity  susan smiled slyly  they do say mrs marshall elliott that the methodists and presbyterians are talking of uniting she said  well all i hope is that ill be under the sod if that ever comes to pass retorted miss cornelia  i shall never have truck or trade with methodists and mr meredith will find that hed better steer clear of them too  he is entirely too sociable with them believe me  why he went to the jacob drews silverwedding supper and got into a nice scrape as a result  what was it  mrs drew asked him to carve the roast goosefor jacob drew never did or could carve  well mr meredith tackled it and in the process he knocked it clean off the platter into mrs reeses lap who was sitting next him  and he just said dreamily  mrs reese will you kindly return me that goose  mrs reese returned it as meek as moses but she must have been furious for she had on her new silk dress  the worst of it is she was a methodist  but i think that is better than if she was a presbyterian interjected susan  if she had been a presbyterian she would mostly likely have left the church and we cannot afford to lose our members  and mrs reese is not liked in her own church because she gives herself such great airs so that the methodists would be rather pleased that mr meredith spoiled her dress  the point is he made himself ridiculous and i for one do not like to see my minister made ridiculous in the eyes of the methodists said miss cornelia stiffly  if he had had a wife it would not have happened  i do not see if he had a dozen wives how they could have prevented mrs drew from using up her tough old gander for the weddingfeast said susan stubbornly  they say that was her husbands doing said miss cornelia jacob drew is a conceited stingy domineering creature  and they do say he and his wife detest each otherwhich does not seem to me the proper way for married folks to get along but then of course i have had no experience along that line said susan tossing her head  and i am not one to blame everything on the men  mrs drew is mean enough herself  they say that the only thing she was ever known to give away was a crock of butter made out of cream a rat had fell into  she contributed it to a church social nobody found out about the rat until afterwards  fortunately all the people the merediths have offended so far are methodists said miss cornelia  that jerry went to the methodist prayermeeting one night about a fortnight ago and sat beside old william marsh who got up as usual and testified with fearful groans  do you feel any better now whispered jerry when william sat down  poor jerry meant to be sympathetic but mr marsh thought he was impertinent and is furious at him  of course jerry had no business to be in a methodist prayermeeting at all  but they go where they like  i hope they will not offend mrs alec davis of the harbour head said susan  she is a very touchy woman i understand but she is very well off and pays the most of any one to the salary  i have heard that she says the merediths are the worst brought up children she ever saw  every word you say convinces me more and more that the merediths belong to the race that knows joseph said mistress anne decidedly  when all is said and done they do admitted miss cornelia and that balances everything  anyway weve got them now and we must just do the best we can by them and stick up for them to the methodists  well i suppose i must be getting down harbour marshall will soon be homehe went overharbour todayand wanting his super manlike  im sorry i havent seen the other children  and wheres the doctor  up at the harbour head  weve only been home three days and in that time he has spent three hours in his own bed and eaten two meals in his own house  well everybody who has been sick for the last six weeks has been waiting for him to come homeand i dont blame them  when that overharbour doctor married the undertakers daughter at lowbridge people felt suspicious of him  it didnt look well you and the doctor must come down soon and tell us all about your trip  i suppose youve had a splendid time  we had agreed anne  it was the fulfilment of years of dreams  the old world is very lovely and very wonderful  but we have come back very well satisfied with our own land  canada is the finest country in the world miss cornelia  nobody ever doubted that said miss cornelia complacently  and old pei is the loveliest province in it and four winds the loveliest spot in pei laughed anne looking adoringly out over the sunset splendour of glen and harbour and gulf  she waved her hand at it  i saw nothing more beautiful than that in europe miss cornelia  must you go  the children will be sorry to have missed you  they must come and see me soon  tell them the doughnut jar is always full  oh at supper they were planning a descent on you  theyll go soon but they must settle down to school again now  and the twins are going to take music lessons  not from the methodist ministers wife i hope said miss cornelia anxiously  nofrom rosemary west  i was up last evening to arrange it with her  what a pretty girl she is  rosemary holds her own well  she isnt as young as she once was  i thought her very charming  ive never had any real acquaintance with her you know  their house is so out of the way and ive seldom ever seen her except at church  people always have liked rosemary west though they dont understand her said miss cornelia quite unconscious of the high tribute she was paying to rosemarys charm  ellen has always kept her down so to speak  she has tyrannized over her and yet she has always indulged her in a good many ways rosemary was engaged once you knowto young martin crawford his ship was wrecked on the magdalens and all the crew were drowned  rosemary was just a childonly seventeen  but she was never the same afterwards  she and ellen have stayed very close at home since their mothers death  they dont often get to their own church at lowbridge and i understand ellen doesnt approve of going too often to a presbyterian church  to the methodist she never goes ill say that much for her  that family of wests have always been strong episcopalians  rosemary and ellen are pretty well off  rosemary doesnt really need to give music lessons  she does it because she likes to  they are distantly related to leslie you know  are the fords coming to the harbour this summer  no  they are going on a trip to japan and will probably be away for a year  owens new novel is to have a japanese setting this will be the first summer that the dear old house of dreams will be empty since we left it  i should think owen ford might find enough to write about in canada without dragging his wife and his innocent children off to a heathen country like japan grumbled miss cornelia  the life book was the best book hes ever written and he got the material for that right here in four winds  captain jim gave him the most of that you know  and he collected it all over the world  but owens books are all delightful i think  oh theyre well enough as far as they go  i make it a point to read every one he writes though ive always held anne dearie that reading novels is a sinful waste of time  i shall write and tell him my opinion of this japanese business believe me  does he want kenneth and persis to be converted into pagans  with which unanswerable conundrum miss cornelia took her departure  susan proceeded to put rilla in bed and anne sat on the veranda steps under the early stars and dreamed her incorrigible dreams and learned all over again for the hundredth happy time what a moonrise splendour and sheen could be on four winds harbour    chapter iii the ingleside children  in daytime the blythe children liked very well to play in the rich soft greens and glooms of the big maple grove between ingleside and the glen st mary pond but for evening revels there was no place like the little valley behind the maple grove it was a fairy realm of romance to them  once looking from the attic windows of ingleside through the mist and aftermath of a summer thunderstorm they had seen the beloved spot arched by a glorious rainbow one end of which seemed to dip straight down to where a corner of the pond ran up into the lower end of the valley  let us call it rainbow valley said walter delightedly and rainbow valley thenceforth it was  outside of rainbow valley the wind might be rollicking and boisterous  here it always went gently  little winding fairy paths ran here and there over spruce roots cushioned with moss wild cherry trees that in blossom time would be misty white were scattered all over the valley mingling with the dark spruces  a little brook with amber waters ran through it from the glen village  the houses of the village were comfortably far away only at the upper end of the valley was a little tumbledown deserted cottage referred to as the old bailey house  it had not been occupied for many years but a grassgrown dyke surrounded it and inside was an ancient garden where the ingleside children could find violets and daisies and june lilies still blooming in season  for the rest the garden was overgrown with caraway that swayed and foamed in the moonshine of summer eves like seas of silver  to the sought lay the pond and beyond it the ripened distance lost itself in purple woods save where on a high hill a solitary old gray homestead looked down on glen and harbour there was a certain wild woodsiness and solitude about rainbow valley in spite of its nearness to the village which endeared it to the children of ingleside  the valley was full of dear friendly hollows and the largest of these was their favourite stamping ground  here they were assembled on this particular evening  there was a grove of young spruces in this hollow with a tiny grassy glade in its heart opening on the bank of the brook  by the brook grew a silver birchtree a young incredibly straight thing which walter had named the white lady  in this glade too were the tree lovers as walter called a spruce and maple which grew so closely together that their boughs were inextricably intertwined jem had hung an old string of sleighbells given him by the glen blacksmith on the tree lovers and every visitant breeze called out sudden fairy tinkles from it  how nice it is to be back said nan  after all none of the avonlea places are quite as nice as rainbow valley  but they were very fond of the avonlea places for all that  a visit to green gables was always considered a great treat  aunt marilla was very good to them and so was mrs rachel lynde who was spending the leisure of her old age in knitting cottonwarp quilts against the day when annes daughters should need a settingout  there were jolly playmates there toouncle davys children and aunt dianas children  they knew all the spots their mother had loved so well in her girlhood at old green gablesthe long lovers lane that was pinkhedged in wildrose time the always neat yard with its willows and poplars the dryads bubble lucent and lovely as of yore the lake of shining waters and willowmere  the twins had their mothers old porchgable room and aunt marilla used to come in at night when she thought they were asleep to gloat over them  but they all knew she loved jem the best  jem was at present busily occupied in frying a mess of small trout which he had just caught in the pond  his stove consisted of a circle of red stones with a fire kindled in it and his culinary utensils were an old tin can hammered out flat and a fork with only one tine left  nevertheless ripping good meals had before now been thus prepared  jem was the child of the house of dreams  all the others had been born at ingleside  he had curly red hair like his mothers and frank hazel eyes like his fathers he had his mothers fine nose and his fathers steady humorous mouth  and he was the only one of the family who had ears nice enough to please susan  but he had a standing feud with susan because she would not give up calling him little jem  it was outrageous thought thirteenyearold jem  mother had more sense  im not little any more mother he had cried indignantly on his eighth birthday  im awful big  mother had sighed and laughed and sighed again and she never called him little jem againin his hearing at least  he was and always had been a sturdy reliable little chap  he never broke a promise  he was not a great talker  his teachers did not think him brilliant but he was a good allround student  he never took things on faith he always liked to investigate the truth of a statement for himself  once susan had told him that if he touched his tongue to a frosty latch all the skin would tear off it  jem had promptly done it just to see if it was so  he found it was so at the cost of a very sore tongue for several days  but jem did not grudge suffering in the interests of science  by constant experiment and observation he learned a great deal and his brothers and sisters thought his extensive knowledge of their little world quite wonderful  jem always knew where the first and ripest berries grew where the first pale violets shyly wakened from their winters sleep and how many blue eggs were in a given robins nest in the maple grove  he could tell fortunes from daisy petals and suck honey from red clovers and grub up all sorts of edible roots on the banks of the pond while susan went in daily fear that they would all be poisoned  he knew where the finest sprucegum was to be found in pale amber knots on the lichened bark he knew where the nuts grew thickest in the beechwoods around the harbour head and where the best trouting places up the brooks were  he could mimic the call of any wild bird or beast in four winds and he knew the haunt of every wild flower from spring to autumn  walter blythe was sitting under the white lady with a volume of poems lying beside him but he was not reading  he was gazing now at the emeraldmisted willows by the pond and now at a flock of clouds like little silver sheep herded by the wind that were drifting over rainbow valley with rapture in his wide splendid eyes  walters eyes were very wonderful  all the joy and sorrow and laughter and loyalty and aspiration of many generations lying under the sod looked out of their dark gray depths  walter was a hop out of kin as far as looks went  he did not resemble any known relative  he was quite the handsomest of the ingleside children with straight black hair and finely modelled features  but he had all his mothers vivid imagination and passionate love of beauty  frost of winter invitation of spring dream of summer and glamour of autumn all meant much to walter  in school where jem was a chieftain walter was not thought highly of  he was supposed to be girly and milksoppish because he never fought and seldom joined in the school sports preferring to herd by himself in out of the way corners and read booksespecially potry books  walter loved the poets and pored over their pages from the time he could first read  their music was woven into his growing soulthe music of the immortals  walter cherished the ambition to be a poet himself some day  the thing could be done  a certain uncle paulso called out of courtesywho lived now in that mysterious realm called the states was walters model  uncle paul had once been a little school boy in avonlea and now his poetry was read everywhere  but the glen schoolboys did not know of walters dreams and would not have been greatly impressed if they had  in spite of his lack of physical prowess however he commanded a certain unwilling respect because of his power of talking book talk  nobody in glen st mary school could talk like him  he sounded like a preacher one boy said and for this reason he was generally left alone and not persecuted as most boys were who were suspected of disliking or fearing fisticuffs  the ten year old ingleside twins violated twin tradition by not looking in the least alike  anne who was always called nan was very pretty with velvety nutbrown eyes and silky nutbrown hair  she was a very blithe and dainty little maidenblythe by name and blithe by nature one of her teachers had said  her complexion was quite faultless much to her mothers satisfaction  im so glad i have one daughter who can wear pink mrs blythe was wont to say jubilantly  diana blythe known as di was very like her mother with graygreen eyes that always shone with a peculiar lustre and brilliancy in the dusk and red hair  perhaps this was why she was her fathers favourite  she and walter were especial chums di was the only one to whom he would ever read the verses he wrote himselfthe only one who knew that he was secretly hard at work on an epic strikingly resembling marmion in some things if not in others  she kept all his secrets even from nan and told him all hers  wont you soon have those fish ready jem said nan sniffing with her dainty nose  the smell makes me awfully hungry  theyre nearly ready said jem giving one a dexterous turn get out the bread and the plates girls  walter wake up  how the air shines tonight said walter dreamily  not that he despised fried trout either by any means but with walter food for the soul always took first place  the flower angel has been walking over the world today calling to the flowers  i can see his blue wings on that hill by the woods  any angels wings i ever saw were white said nan  the flower angels arent  they are a pale misty blue just like the haze in the valley  oh how i wish i could fly  it must be glorious  one does fly in dreams sometimes said di  i never dream that im flying exactly said walter  but i often dream that i just rise up from the ground and float over the fences and the trees  its delightfuland i always think this isnt a dream like its always been before this is realand then i wake up after all and its heartbreaking  hurry up nan ordered jem  nan had produced the banquetboarda board literally as well as figurativelyfrom which many a feast seasoned as no viands were elsewhere had been eaten in rainbow valley  it was converted into a table by propping it on two large mossy stones newspapers served as tablecloth and broken plates and handleless cups from susans discard furnished the dishes  from a tin box secreted at the root of a spruce tree nan brought forth bread and salt  the brook gave adams ale of unsurpassed crystal  for the rest there was a certain sauce compounded of fresh air and appetite of youth which gave to everything a divine flavour  to sit in rainbow valley steeped in a twilight half gold half amethyst rife with the odours of balsamfir and woodsy growing things in their springtime prime with the pale stars of wild strawberry blossoms all around you and with the sough of the wind and tinkle of bells in the shaking tree tops and eat fried trout and dry bread was something which the mighty of earth might have envied them  sit in invited nan as jem placed his sizzling tin platter of trout on the table  its your turn to say grace jem  ive done my part frying the trout protested jem who hated saying grace  let walter say it  he likes saying grace  and cut it short too walt  im starving  but walter said no grace short or long just then  an interruption occurred  whos coming down from the manse hill said di    chapter iv the manse children  aunt martha might be and was a very poor housekeeper the rev john knox meredith might be and was a very absentminded indulgent man  but it could not be denied that there was something very homelike and lovable about the glen st mary manse in spite of its untidiness  even the critical housewives of the glen felt it and were unconsciously mellowed in judgment because of it  perhaps its charm was in part due to accidental circumstancesthe luxuriant vines clustering over its gray clapboarded walls the friendly acacias and balmofgileads that crowded about it with the freedom of old acquaintance and the beautiful views of harbour and sanddunes from its front windows but these things had been there in the reign of mr merediths predecessor when the manse had been the primmest neatest and dreariest house in the glen  so much of the credit must be given to the personality of its new inmates  there was an atmosphere of laughter and comradeship about it the doors were always open and inner and outer worlds joined hands  love was the only law in glen st mary manse  the people of his congregation said that mr meredith spoiled his children  very likely he did  it is certain that he could not bear to scold them  they have no mother he used to say to himself with a sigh when some unusually glaring peccadillo forced itself upon his notice  but he did not know the half of their goingson  he belonged to the sect of dreamers  the windows of his study looked out on the graveyard but as he paced up and down the room reflecting deeply on the immortality of the soul he was quite unaware that jerry and carl were playing leapfrog hilariously over the flat stones in that abode of dead methodists  mr meredith had occasional acute realizations that his children were not so well looked after physically or morally as they had been before his wife died and he had always a dim subconsciousness that house and meals were very different under aunt marthas management from what they had been under cecilias  for the rest he lived in a world of books and abstractions and therefore although his clothes were seldom brushed and although the glen housewives concluded from the ivorylike pallor of his clearcut features and slender hands that he never got enough to eat he was not an unhappy man  if ever a graveyard could be called a cheerful place the old methodist graveyard at glen st mary might be so called  the new graveyard at the other side of the methodist church was a neat and proper and doleful spot but the old one had been left so long to natures kindly and gracious ministries that it had become very pleasant  it was surrounded on three sides by a dyke of stones and sod topped by a gray and uncertain paling  outside the dyke grew a row of tall fir trees with thick balsamic boughs  the dyke which had been built by the first settlers of the glen was old enough to be beautiful with mosses and green things growing out of its crevices violets purpling at its base in the early spring days and asters and goldenrod making an autumnal glory in its corners  little ferns clustered companionably between its stones and here and there a big bracken grew  on the eastern side there was neither fence nor dyke  the graveyard there straggled off into a young fir plantation ever pushing nearer to the graves and deepening eastward into a thick wood  the air was always full of the harplike voices of the sea and the music of gray old trees and in the spring mornings the choruses of birds in the elms around the two churches sang of life and not of death  the meredith children loved the old graveyard  blueeyed ivy gardenspruce and mint ran riot over the sunken graves  blueberry bushes grew lavishly in the sandy corner next to the fir wood  the varying fashions of tombstones for three generations were to be found there from the flat oblong red sandstone slabs of old settlers down through the days of weeping willows and clasped hands to the latest monstrosities of tall monuments and draped urns  one of the latter the biggest and ugliest in the graveyard was sacred to the memory of a certain alec davis who had been born a methodist but had taken to himself a presbyterian bride of the douglas clan  she had made him turn presbyterian and kept him toeing the presbyterian mark all his life  but when he died she did not dare to doom him to a lonely grave in the presbyterian graveyard overharbour  his people were all buried in the methodist cemetery so alec davis went back to his own in death and his widow consoled herself by erecting a monument which cost more than any of the methodists could afford  the meredith children hated it without just knowing why but they loved the old flat benchlike stones with the tall grasses growing rankly about them  they made jolly seats for one thing  they were all sitting on one now  jerry tired of leap frog was playing on a jewsharp  carl was lovingly poring over a strange beetle he had found una was trying to make a dolls dress and faith leaning back on her slender brown wrists was swinging her bare feet in lively time to the jewsharp  jerry had his fathers black hair and large black eyes but in him the latter were flashing instead of dreamy  faith who came next to him wore her beauty like a rose careless and glowing she had goldenbrown eyes goldenbrown curls and crimson cheeks she laughed too much to please her fathers congregation and had shocked old mrs taylor the disconsolate spouse of several departed husbands by saucily declaringin the churchporch at thatthe world isnt a vale of tears mrs taylor  its a world of laughter  little dreamy una was not given to laughter  her braids of straight deadblack hair betrayed no lawless kinks and her almondshaped darkblue eyes had something wistful and sorrowful in them  her mouth had a trick of falling open over her tiny white teeth and a shy meditative smile occasionally crept over her small face  she was much more sensitive to public opinion than faith and had an uneasy consciousness that there was something askew in their way of living  she longed to put it right but did not know how  now and then she dusted the furniturebut it was so seldom she could find the duster because it was never in the same place twice  and when the clothesbrush was to be found she tried to brush her fathers best suit on saturdays and once sewed on a missing button with coarse white thread  when mr meredith went to church next day every female eye saw that button and the peace of the ladies aid was upset for weeks  carl had the clear bright darkblue eyes fearless and direct of his dead mother and her brown hair with its glints of gold he knew the secrets of bugs and had a sort of freemasonry with bees and beetles  una never liked to sit near him because she never knew what uncanny creature might be secreted about him jerry refused to sleep with him because carl had once taken a young garter snake to bed with him so carl slept in his old cot which was so short that he could never stretch out and had strange bedfellows  perhaps it was just as well that aunt martha was half blind when she made that bed  altogether they were a jolly lovable little crew and cecilia merediths heart must have ached bitterly when she faced the knowledge that she must leave them  where would you like to be buried if you were a methodist asked faith cheerfully  this opened up an interesting field of speculation  there isnt much choice  the place is full said jerry  id like that corner near the road i guess  i could hear the teams going past and the people talking  id like that little hollow under the weeping birch said una that birch is such a place for birds and they sing like mad in the mornings  id take the porter lot where theres so many children buried i like lots of company said faith  carl whered you  id rather not be buried at all said carl but if i had to be id like the antbed  ants are awfly intresting  how very good all the people who are buried here must have been said una who had been reading the laudatory old epitaphs there doesnt seem to be a single bad person in the whole graveyard  methodists must be better than presbyterians after all  maybe the methodists bury their bad people just like they do cats suggested carl  maybe they dont bother bringing them to the graveyard at all  nonsense said faith  the people that are buried here werent any better than other folks una  but when anyone is dead you mustnt say anything of him but good or hell come back and hant you  aunt martha told me that  i asked father if it was true and he just looked through me and muttered true  true  what is truth  what is truth o jesting pilate  i concluded from that it must be true  i wonder if mr alec davis would come back and hant me if i threw a stone at the urn on top of his tombstone said jerry  mrs davis would giggled faith  she just watches us in church like a cat watching mice  last sunday i made a face at her nephew and he made one back at me and you should have seen her glare  ill bet she boxed his ears when they got out  mrs marshall elliott told me we mustnt offend her on any account or id have made a face at her too  they say jem blythe stuck out his tongue at her once and she would never have his father again even when her husband was dying said jerry  i wonder what the blythe gang will be like  i liked their looks said faith  the manse children had been at the station that afternoon when the blythe small fry had arrived  i liked jems looks especially  they say in school that walters a sissy said jerry  i dont believe it said una who had thought walter very handsome  well he writes poetry anyhow  he won the prize the teacher offered last year for writing a poem bertie shakespeare drew told me  berties mother thought he should have got the prize because of his name but bertie said he couldnt write poetry to save his soul name or no name  i suppose well get acquainted with them as soon as they begin going to school mused faith  i hope the girls are nice  i dont like most of the girls round here  even the nice ones are poky  but the blythe twins look jolly  i thought twins always looked alike but they dont  i think the redhaired one is the nicest  i liked their mothers looks said una with a little sigh  una envied all children their mothers  she had been only six when her mother died but she had some very precious memories treasured in her soul like jewels of twilight cuddlings and morning frolics of loving eyes a tender voice and the sweetest gayest laugh  they say she isnt like other people said jerry  mrs elliot says that is because she never really grew up said faith  shes taller than mrs elliott  yes yes but it is insidemrs elliot says mrs blythe just stayed a little girl inside  what do i smell interrupted carl sniffing  they all smelled it now  a most delectable odour came floating up on the still evening air from the direction of the little woodsy dell below the manse hill  that makes me hungry said jerry  we had only bread and molasses for supper and cold ditto for dinner said una plaintively  aunt marthas habit was to boil a large slab of mutton early in the week and serve it up every day cold and greasy as long as it lasted  to this faith in a moment of inspiration had give the name of ditto and by this it was invariably known at the manse  lets go and see where that smell is coming from said jerry  they all sprang up frolicked over the lawn with the abandon of young puppies climbed a fence and tore down the mossy slope guided by the savory lure that ever grew stronger  a few minutes later they arrived breathlessly in the sanctum sanctorum of rainbow valley where the blythe children were just about to give thanks and eat  they halted shyly  una wished they had not been so precipitate but di blythe was equal to that and any occasion  she stepped forward with a comrades smile  i guess i know who you are she said  you belong to the manse dont you  faith nodded her face creased by dimples  we smelled your trout cooking and wondered what it was  you must sit down and help us eat them said di  maybe you havent more than you want yourselves said jerry looking hungrily at the tin platter  weve heapsthree apiece said jem  sit down  no more ceremony was necessary  down they all sat on mossy stones  merry was that feast and long  nan and di would probably have died of horror had they known what faith and una knew perfectly wellthat carl had two young mice in his jacket pocket  but they never knew it so it never hurt them where can folks get better acquainted than over a meal table  when the last trout had vanished the manse children and the ingleside children were sworn friends and allies  they had always known each other and always would  the race of joseph recognized its own  they poured out the history of their little pasts  the manse children heard of avonlea and green gables of rainbow valley traditions and of the little house by the harbour shore where jem had been born  the ingleside children heard of maywater where the merediths had lived before coming to the glen of unas beloved oneeyed doll and faiths pet rooster  faith was inclined to resent the fact that people laughed at her for petting a rooster  she liked the blythes because they accepted it without question  a handsome rooster like adam is just as nice a pet as a dog or cat i think she said  if he was a canary nobody would wonder  and i brought him up from a little wee yellow chicken mrs johnson at maywater gave him to me  a weasel had killed all his brothers and sisters  i called him after her husband  i never liked dolls or cats  cats are too sneaky and dolls are dead  who lives in that house away up there asked jerry  the miss westsrosemary and ellen answered nan  di and i are going to take music lessons from miss rosemary this summer  una gazed at the lucky twins with eyes whose longing was too gentle for envy  oh if she could only have music lessons  it was one of the dreams of her little hidden life  but nobody ever thought of such a thing  miss rosemary is so sweet and she always dresses so pretty said di  her hair is just the colour of new molasses taffy she added wistfullyfor di like her mother before her was not resigned to her own ruddy tresses  i like miss ellen too said nan  she always used to give me candies when she came to church  but di is afraid of her  her brows are so black and she has such a great deep voice said di  oh how scared of her kenneth ford used to be when he was little  mother says the first sunday mrs ford brought him to church miss ellen happened to be there sitting right behind them  and the minute kenneth saw her he just screamed and screamed until mrs ford had to carry him out  who is mrs ford asked una wonderingly  oh the fords dont live here  they only come here in the summer  and theyre not coming this summer  they live in that little house way way down on the harbour shore where father and mother used to lie  i wish you could see persis ford  she is just like a picture  ive heard of mrs ford broke in faith  bertie shakespeare drew told me about her  she was married fourteen years to a dead man and then he came to life  nonsense said nan  that isnt the way it goes at all bertie shakespeare can never get anything straight  i know the whole story and ill tell it to you some time but not now for its too long and its time for us to go home  mother doesnt like us to be out late these damp evenings  nobody cared whether the manse children were out in the damp or not  aunt martha was already in bed and the minister was still too deeply lost in speculations concerning the immortality of the soul to remember the mortality of the body  but they went home too with visions of good times coming in their heads  i think rainbow valley is even nicer than the graveyard said una  and i just love those dear blythes  its so nice when you can love people because so often you cant  father said in his sermon last sunday that we should love everybody  but how can we  how could we love mrs alec davis  oh father only said that in the pulpit said faith airily he has more sense than to really think it outside  the blythe children went up to ingleside except jem who slipped away for a few moments on a solitary expedition to a remote corner of rainbow valley  mayflowers grew there and jem never forgot to take his mother a bouquet as long as they lasted    chapter v the advent of mary vance  this is just the sort of day you feel as if things might happen said faith responsive to the lure of crystal air and blue hills  she hugged herself with delight and danced a hornpipe on old hezekiah pollocks bench tombstone much to the horror of two ancient maidens who happened to be driving past just as faith hopped on one foot around the stone waving the other and her arms in the air  and that groaned one ancient maiden is our ministers daughter  what else could you expect of a widowers family groaned the other ancient maiden  and then they both shook their heads  it was early on saturday morning and the merediths were out in the dewdrenched world with a delightful consciousness of the holiday  they had never had anything to do on a holiday  even nan and di blythe had certain household tasks for saturday mornings but the daughters of the manse were free to roam from blushing morn to dewy eve if so it pleased them  it did please faith but una felt a secret bitter humiliation because they never learned to do anything  the other girls in her class at school could cook and sew and knit she only was a little ignoramus  jerry suggested that they go exploring so they went lingeringly through the fir grove picking up carl on the way who was on his knees in the dripping grass studying his darling ants  beyond the grove they came out in mr taylors pasture field sprinkled over with the white ghosts of dandelions in a remote corner was an old tumbledown barn where mr taylor sometimes stored his surplus hay crop but which was never used for any other purpose thither the meredith children trooped and prowled about the ground floor for several minutes  what was that whispered una suddenly  they all listened  there was a faint but distinct rustle in the hayloft above  the merediths looked at each other  theres something up there breathed faith  im going up to see what it is said jerry resolutely  oh dont begged una catching his arm  im going  well all go too then said faith  the whole four climbed the shaky ladder jerry and faith quite dauntless una pale from fright and carl rather absentmindedly speculating on the possibility of finding a bat up in the loft he longed to see a bat in daylight  when they stepped off the ladder they saw what had made the rustle and the sight struck them dumb for a few moments  in a little nest in the hay a girl was curled up looking as if she had just wakened from sleep  when she saw them she stood up rather shakily as it seemed and in the bright sunlight that streamed through the cobwebbed window behind her they saw that her thin sunburned face was very pale under its tan  she had two braids of lank thick towcoloured hair and very odd eyeswhite eyes the manse children thought as she stared at them half defiantly half piteously  they were really of so pale a blue that they did seem almost white especially when contrasted with the narrow black ring that circled the iris  she was barefooted and bareheaded and was clad in a faded ragged old plaid dress much too short and tight for her  as for years she might have been almost any age judging from her wizened little face but her height seemed to be somewhere in the neighbourhood of twelve  who are you asked jerry  the girl looked about her as if seeking a way of escape  then she seemed to give in with a little shiver of despair  im mary vance she said  whered you come from pursued jerry  mary instead of replying suddenly sat or fell down on the hay and began to cry  instantly faith had flung herself down beside her and put her arm around the thin shaking shoulders  you stop bothering her she commanded jerry  then she hugged the waif  dont cry dear  just tell us whats the matter were friends  im sosohungry wailed mary  ii haint had a thing to eat since thursday morning cept a little water from the brook out there  the manse children gazed at each other in horror  faith sprang up  you come right up to the manse and get something to eat before you say another word  mary shrank  ohi cant  what will your pa and ma say  besides theyd send me back  weve no mother and father wont bother about you  neither will aunt martha  come i say  faith stamped her foot impatiently  was this queer girl going to insist on starving to death almost at their very door  mary yielded  she was so weak that she could hardly climb down the ladder but somehow they got her down and over the field and into the manse kitchen  aunt martha muddling through her saturday cooking took no notice of her  faith and una flew to the pantry and ransacked it for such eatables as it containedsome ditto bread butter milk and a doubtful pie mary vance attacked the food ravenously and uncritically while the manse children stood around and watched her  jerry noticed that she had a pretty mouth and very nice even white teeth faith decided with secret horror that mary had not one stitch on her except that ragged faded dress  una was full of pure pity carl of amused wonder and all of them of curiosity  now come out to the graveyard and tell us about yourself ordered faith when marys appetite showed signs of failing her mary was now nothing loath  food had restored her natural vivacity and unloosed her by no means reluctant tongue  you wont tell your pa or anybody if i tell you she stipulated when she was enthroned on mr pollocks tombstone opposite her the manse children lined up on another  here was spice and mystery and adventure  something had happened  no we wont  cross your hearts  cross our hearts  well ive run away  i was living with mrs wiley overharbour do you know mrs wiley  no  well you dont want to know her  shes an awful woman  my how i hate her  she worked me to death and wouldnt give me half enough to eat and she used to larrup me most every day  look ahere  mary rolled up her ragged sleeves and held up her scrawny arms and thin hands chapped almost to rawness  they were black with bruises  the manse children shivered  faith flushed crimson with indignation  unas blue eyes filled with tears  she licked me wednesday night with a stick said mary indifferently  it was cause i let the cow kick over a pail of milk  howd i know the darn old cow was going to kick  a not unpleasant thrill ran over her listeners  they would never dream of using such dubious words but it was rather titivating to hear someone else use themand a girl at that  certainly this mary vance was an interesting creature  i dont blame you for running away said faith  oh i didnt run away cause she licked me  a licking was all in the days work with me  i was darn well used to it  nope id meant to run away for a week cause id found out that mrs wiley was going to rent her farm and go to lowbridge to live and give me to a cousin of hers up charlottetown way  i wasnt going to stand for that  she was a worse sort than mrs wiley even mrs wiley lent me to her for a month last summer and id rather live with the devil himself  sensation number two  but una looked doubtful  so i made up my mind id beat it  i had seventy cents saved up that mrs john crawford give me in the spring for planting potatoes for her  mrs wiley didnt know about it  she was away visiting her cousin when i planted them  i thought id sneak up here to the glen and buy a ticket to charlottetown and try to get work there  im a hustler let me tell you  there aint a lazy bone in my body  so i lit out thursday morning fore mrs wiley was up and walked to the glensix miles  and when i got to the station i found id lost my money  dunno howdunno where  anyhow it was gone  i didnt know what to do  if i went back to old lady wiley shed take the hide off me so i went and hid in that old barn  and what will you do now asked jerry  dunno  i spose ill have to go back and take my medicine  now that ive got some grub in my stomach i guess i can stand it  but there was fear behind the bravado in marys eyes  una suddenly slipped from the one tombstone to the other and put her arm about mary  dont go back  just stay here with us  oh mrs wileyll hunt me up said mary  its likely shes on my trail before this  i might stay here till she finds me i spose if your folks dont mind  i was a darn fool ever to think of skipping out  shed run a weasel to earth  but i was so misrebul  marys voice quivered but she was ashamed of showing her weakness  i haint had the life of a dog for these four years she explained defiantly  youve been four years with mrs wiley  yip  she took me out of the asylum over in hopetown when i was eight  thats the same place mrs blythe came from exclaimed faith  i was two years in the asylum  i was put there when i was six my ma had hung herself and my pa had cut his throat  holy cats  why said jerry  booze said mary laconically  and youve no relations  not a darn one that i know of  must have had some once though i was called after half a dozen of them  my full name is mary martha lucilla moore ball vance  can you beat that  my grandfather was a rich man  ill bet he was richer than your grandfather  but pa drunk it all up and ma she did her part they used to beat me too  laws ive been licked so much i kind of like it  mary tossed her head  she divined that the manse children were pitying her for her many stripes and she did not want pity  she wanted to be envied  she looked gaily about her  her strange eyes now that the dullness of famine was removed from them were brilliant  she would show these youngsters what a personage she was  ive been sick an awful lot she said proudly  theres not many kids could have come through what i have  ive had scarlet fever and measles and ersipelas and mumps and whooping cough and pewmonia  were you ever fatally sick asked una  i dont know said mary doubtfully  of course she wasnt scoffed jerry  if youre fatally sick you die  oh well i never died exactly said mary but i come blamed near it once  they thought i was dead and they were getting ready to lay me out when i up and come to  what is it like to be half dead asked jerry curiously  like nothing  i didnt know it for days afterwards  it was when i had the pewmonia  mrs wiley wouldnt have the doctorsaid she wasnt going to no such expense for a home girl old aunt christina macallister nursed me with poultices  she brung me round  but sometimes i wish id just died the other half and done with it  id been better off  if you went to heaven i spose you would said faith rather doubtfully  well what other place is there to go to demanded mary in a puzzled voice  theres hell you know said una dropping her voice and hugging mary to lessen the awfulness of the suggestion  hell  whats that  why its where the devil lives said jerry  youve heard of himyou spoke about him  oh yes but i didnt know he lived anywhere  i thought he just roamed round  mr wiley used to mention hell when he was alive he was always telling folks to go there  i thought it was some place over in new brunswick where he come from  hell is an awful place said faith with the dramatic enjoyment that is born of telling dreadful things  bad people go there when they die and burn in fire for ever and ever and ever  who told you that demanded mary incredulously  its in the bible  and mr isaac crothers at maywater told us too in sunday school  he was an elder and a pillar in the church and knew all about it  but you neednt worry  if youre good youll go to heaven and if youre bad i guess youd rather go to hell  i wouldnt said mary positively  no matter how bad i was i wouldnt want to be burned and burned  i know what its like i picked up a red hot poker once by accident  what must you do to be good  you must go to church and sunday school and read your bible and pray every night and give to missions said una  it sounds like a large order said mary  anything else  you must ask god to forgive the sins youve committed  but ive never comcommitted any said mary  whats a sin any way  oh mary you must have  everybody does  did you never tell a lie  heaps of em said mary  thats a dreadful sin said una solemnly  do you mean to tell me demanded mary that id be sent to hell for telling a lie now and then  why i had to  mr wiley would have broken every bone in my body one time if i hadnt told him a lie  lies have saved me many a whack i can tell you  una sighed  here were too many difficulties for her to solve she shuddered as she thought of being cruelly whipped  very likely she would have lied too  she squeezed marys little calloused hand  is that the only dress youve got asked faith whose joyous nature refused to dwell on disagreeable subjects  i just put on this dress because it was no good cried mary flushing  mrs wileyd bought my clothes and i wasnt going to be beholden to her for anything  and im honest  if i was going to run away i wasnt going to take what belong to her that was worth anything  when i grow up im going to have a blue sating dress  your own clothes dont look so stylish  i thought ministers children were always dressed up  it was plain that mary had a temper and was sensitive on some points  but there was a queer wild charm about her which captivated them all  she was taken to rainbow valley that afternoon and introduced to the blythes as a friend of ours from overharbour who is visiting us  the blythes accepted her unquestioningly perhaps because she was fairly respectable now after dinnerthrough which aunt martha had mumbled and mr meredith had been in a state of semiunconsciousness while brooding his sunday sermonfaith had prevailed on mary to put on one of her dresses as well as certain other articles of clothing  with her hair neatly braided mary passed muster tolerably well  she was an acceptable playmate for she knew several new and exciting games and her conversation lacked not spice  in fact some of her expressions made nan and di look at her rather askance  they were not quite sure what their mother would have thought of her but they knew quite well what susan would  however she was a visitor at the manse so she must be all right  when bedtime came there was the problem of where mary should sleep  we cant put her in the spare room you know said faith perplexedly to una  i havent got anything in my head cried mary in an injured tone  oh i didnt mean that protested faith  the spare room is all torn up  the mice have gnawed a big hole in the feather tick and made a nest in it  we never found it out till aunt martha put the rev mr fisher from charlottetown there to sleep last week  he soon found it out  then father had to give him his bed and sleep on the study lounge  aunt martha hasnt had time to fix the spare room bed up yet so she says so nobody can sleep there no matter how clean their heads are  and our room is so small and the bed so small you cant sleep with us  i can go back to the hay in the old barn for the night if youll lend me a quilt said mary philosophically  it was kind of chilly last night but cept for that ive had worse beds  oh no no you mustnt do that said una  ive thought of a plan faith  you know that little trestle bed in the garret room with the old mattress on it that the last minister left there  lets take up the spare room bedclothes and make mary a bed there  you wont mind sleeping in the garret will you mary  its just above our room  any placell do me  laws i never had a decent place to sleep in my life  i slept in the loft over the kitchen at mrs wileys  the roof leaked rain in the summer and the snow druv in in winter  my bed was a straw tick on the floor  you wont find me a mite huffy about where i sleep  the manse garret was a long low shadowy place with one gable end partitioned off  here a bed was made up for mary of the dainty hemstitched sheets and embroidered spread which cecilia meredith had once so proudly made for her spareroom and which still survived aunt marthas uncertain washings  the good nights were said and silence fell over the manse  una was just falling asleep when she heard a sound in the room just above that made her sit up suddenly  listen faithmarys crying she whispered  faith replied not being already asleep  una slipped out of bed and made her way in her little white gown down the hall and up the garret stairs  the creaking floor gave ample notice of her coming and when she reached the corner room all was moonlit silence and the trestle bed showed only a hump in the middle  mary whispered una  there was no response  una crept close to the bed and pulled at the spread  mary i know you are crying  i heard you  are you lonesome  mary suddenly appeared to view but said nothing  let me in beside you  im cold said una shivering in the chilly air for the little garret window was open and the keen breath of the north shore at night blew in  mary moved over and una snuggled down beside her  now you wont be lonesome  we shouldnt have left you here alone the first night  i wasnt lonesome sniffed mary  what were you crying for then  oh i just got to thinking of things when i was here alone  i thought of having to go back to mrs wileyand of being licked for running awayandandand of going to hell for telling lies  it all worried me something scandalous  oh mary said poor una in distress  i dont believe god will send you to hell for telling lies when you didnt know it was wrong  he couldnt  why hes kind and good  of course you mustnt tell any more now that you know its wrong  if i cant tell lies whats to become of me said mary with a sob  you dont understand  you dont know anything about it youve got a home and a kind fatherthough it does seem to me that he isnt moren about half there  but anyway he doesnt lick you and you get enough to eat such as it isthough that old aunt of yours doesnt know anything about cooking  why this is the first day i ever remember of feeling sif id enough to eat  ive been knocked about all of my life cept for the two years i was at the asylum  they didnt lick me there and it wasnt too bad though the matron was cross  she always looked ready to bite my head off a nail  but mrs wiley is a holy terror thats what she is and im just scared stiff when i think of going back to her  perhaps you wont have to  perhaps well be able to think of a way out  lets both ask god to keep you from having to go back to mrs wiley  you say your prayers dont you mary  oh yes i always go over an old rhyme fore i get into bed said mary indifferently  i never thought of asking for anything in particular though  nobody in this world ever bothered themselves about me so i didnt spose god would  he might take more trouble for you seeing youre a ministers daughter  hed take every bit as much trouble for you mary im sure said una  it doesnt matter whose child you are  you just ask himand i will too  all right agreed mary  it wont do any harm if it doesnt do much good  if you knew mrs wiley as well as i do you wouldnt think god would want to meddle with her  anyhow i wont cry any more about it  this is a big sight bettern last night down in that old barn with the mice running about  look at the four winds light  aint it pretty  this is the only window we can see it from said una  i love to watch it  do you  so do i  i could see it from the wiley loft and it was the only comfort i had  when i was all sore from being licked id watch it and forget about the places that hurt  id think of the ships sailing away and away from it and wish i was on one of them sailing far away tooaway from everything  on winter nights when it didnt shine i just felt real lonesome  say una what makes all you folks so kind to me when im just a stranger  because its right to be  the bible tells us to be kind to everybody  does it  well i guess most folks dont mind it much then  i never remember of any one being kind to me beforetrues you live i dont  say una aint them shadows on the walls pretty they look just like a flock of little dancing birds  and say una i like all you folks and them blythe boys and di but i dont like that nan  shes a proud one  oh no mary she isnt a bit proud said una eagerly  not a single bit  dont tell me  any one that holds her head like that is proud i dont like her  we all like her very much  oh i spose you like her bettern me said mary jealously do you  why maryweve known her for weeks and weve only known you a few hours stammered una  so you do like her better then said mary in a rage  all right  like her all you want to  i dont care  i can get along without you  she flung herself over against the wall of the garret with a slam  oh mary said una pushing a tender arm over marys uncompromising back dont talk like that  i do like you ever so much  and you make me feel so bad  no answer  presently una gave a sob  instantly mary squirmed around again and engulfed una in a bears hug  hush up she ordered  dont go crying over what i said  i was as mean as the devil to talk that way  i orter to be skinned aliveand you all so good to me  i should think you would like any one bettern me  i deserve every licking i ever got  hush now  if you cry any more ill go and walk right down to the harbour in this nightdress and drown myself  this terrible threat made una choke back her sobs  her tears were wiped away by mary with the lace frill of the spareroom pillow and forgiver and forgiven cuddled down together again harmony restored to watch the shadows of the vine leaves on the moonlit wall until they fell asleep  and in the study below rev john meredith walked the floor with rapt face and shining eyes thinking out his message of the morrow and knew not that under his own roof there was a little forlorn soul stumbling in darkness and ignorance beset by terror and compassed about with difficulties too great for it to grapple in its unequal struggle with a big indifferent world    chapter vi mary stays at the manse  the manse children took mary vance to church with them the next day  at first mary objected to the idea  didnt you go to church overharbour asked una  you bet  mrs wiley never troubled church much but i went every sunday i could get off  i was mighty thankful to go to some place where i could sit down for a spell  but i cant go to church in this old ragged dress  this difficulty was removed by faith offering the loan of her second best dress  its faded a little and two of the buttons are off but i guess itll do  ill sew the buttons on in a jiffy said mary  not on sunday said una shocked  sure  the better the day the better the deed  you just gimme a needle and thread and look the other way if youre squeamish  faiths school boots and an old black velvet cap that had once been cecilia merediths completed marys costume and to church she went  her behaviour was quite conventional and though some wondered who the shabby little girl with the manse children was she did not attract much attention  she listened to the sermon with outward decorum and joined lustily in the singing  she had it appeared a clear strong voice and a good ear  his blood can make the violets clean carolled mary blithely mrs jimmy milgrave whose pew was just in front of the manse pew turned suddenly and looked the child over from top to toe mary in a mere superfluity of naughtiness stuck out her tongue at mrs milgrave much to unas horror  i couldnt help it she declared after church  whatd she want to stare at me like that for  such manners  im glad stuck my tongue out at her  i wish id stuck it farther out  say i saw rob macallister from overharbour there  wonder if hell tell mrs wiley on me  no mrs wiley appeared however and in a few day the children forgot to look for her  mary was apparently a fixture at the manse  but she refused to go to school with the others  nope  ive finished my education she said when faith urged her to go  i went to school four winters since i come to mrs wileys and ive had all i want of that  im sick and tired of being everlastingly jawed at cause i didnt get my homelessons done  id no time to do homelessons  our teacher wont jaw you  he is awfully nice said faith  well i aint going  i can read and write and cipher up to fractions  thats all i want  you fellows go and ill stay home  you neednt be scared ill steal anything  i swear im honest  mary employed herself while the others were at school in cleaning up the manse  in a few days it was a different place  floors were swept furniture dusted everything straightened out  she mended the spareroom bedtick she sewed on missing buttons she patched clothes neatly she even invaded the study with broom and dustpan and ordered mr meredith out while she put it to rights but there was one department with which aunt martha refused to let her interfere  aunt martha might be deaf and half blind and very childish but she was resolved to keep the commissariat in her own hands in spite of all marys wiles and stratagems  i can tell you if old marthad let me cook youd have some decent meals she told the manse children indignantly  thered be no more dittoand no more lumpy porridge and blue milk either  what does she do with all the cream  she gives it to the cat  hes hers you know said faith  id like to cat her exclaimed mary bitterly  ive no use for cats anyhow  they belong to the old nick  you can tell that by their eyes  well if old martha wont she wont i spose  but it gits on my nerves to see good vittles spoiled  when school came out they always went to rainbow valley  mary refused to play in the graveyard  she declared she was afraid of ghosts  theres no such thing as ghosts declared jem blythe  oh aint there  did you ever see any  hundreds of em said mary promptly  what are they like said carl  awfullooking  dressed all in white with skellington hands and heads said mary  what did you do asked una  run like the devil said mary  then she caught walters eyes and blushed  mary was a good deal in awe of walter  she declared to the manse girls that his eyes made her nervous  i think of all the lies ive ever told when i look into them she said and i wish i hadnt  jem was marys favourite  when he took her to the attic at ingleside and showed her the museum of curios that captain jim boyd had bequeathed to him she was immensely pleased and flattered  she also won carls heart entirely by her interest in his beetles and ants  it could not be denied that mary got on rather better with the boys than with the girls  she quarrelled bitterly with nan blythe the second day  your mother is a witch she told nan scornfully  redhaired women are always witches  then she and faith fell out about the rooster  mary said its tail was too short  faith angrily retorted that she guessed god know what length to make a roosters tail  they did not speak for a day over this  mary treated unas hairless oneeyed doll with consideration but when una showed her other prized treasurea picture of an angel carrying a baby presumably to heaven mary declared that it looked too much like a ghost for her  una crept away to her room and cried over this but mary hunted her out hugged her repentantly and implored forgiveness  no one could keep up a quarrel long with marynot even nan who was rather prone to hold grudges and never quite forgave the insult to her mother mary was jolly  she could and did tell the most thrilling ghost stories  rainbow valley seances were undeniably more exciting after mary came  she learned to play on the jewsharp and soon eclipsed jerry  never struck anything yet i couldnt do if i put my mind to it she declared  mary seldom lost a chance of tooting her own horn she taught them how to make blowbags out of the thick leaves of the liveforever that flourished in the old bailey garden she initiated them into the toothsome qualities of the sours that grew in the niches of the graveyard dyke and she could make the most wonderful shadow pictures on the walls with her long flexible fingers  and when they all went picking gum in rainbow valley mary always got the biggest chew and bragged about it there were times when they hated her and times when they loved her  but at all times they found her interesting  so they submitted quite meekly to her bossing and by the end of a fortnight had come to feel that she must always have been with them  its the queerest thing that mrs wiley haint been after me said mary  i cant understand it  maybe she isnt going to bother about you at all said una then you can just go on staying here  this house aint hardly big enough for me and old martha said mary darkly  its a very fine thing to have enough to eative often wondered what it would be likebut im pticler about my cooking  and mrs wileyll be here yet  shes got a rod in pickle for me all right  i dont think about it so much in daytime but say girls up there in that garret at night i git to thinking and thinking of it till i just almost wish shed come and have it over with  i dunnos one real good whipping would be much worsen all the dozen ive lived through in my mind ever since i run away  were any of you ever licked  no of course not said faith indignantly  father would never do such a thing  you dont know youre alive said mary with a sigh half of envy half of superiority  you dont know what ive come through  and i spose the blythes were never licked either  nooo i guess not  but i think they were sometimes spanked when they were small  a spanking doesnt amount to anything said mary contemptuously  if my folks had just spanked me id have thought they were petting me  well it aint a fair world  i wouldnt mind taking my share of wallopings but ive had a darn sight too many  it isnt right to say that word mary said una reproachfully you promised me you wouldnt say it  gway responded mary  if you knew some of the words i could say if i liked you wouldnt make such a fuss over darn  and you know very well i haint ever told any lies since i come here  what about all those ghosts you said you saw asked faith  mary blushed  that was diffrunt she said defiantly  i knew you wouldnt believe them yarns and i didnt intend you to  and i really did see something queer one night when i was passing the overharbour graveyard trues you live  i dunno whether twas a ghost or sandy crawfords old white nag but it looked blamed queer and i tell you i scooted at the rate of no mans business    chapter vii a fishy episode  rilla blythe walked proudly and perhaps a little primly through the main street of the glen and up the manse hill carefully carrying a small basketful of early strawberries which susan had coaxed into lusciousness in one of the sunny nooks of ingleside susan had charged rilla to give the basket to nobody except aunt martha or mr meredith and rilla very proud of being entrusted with such an errand was resolved to carry out her instructions to the letter  susan had dressed her daintily in a white starched and embroidered dress with sash of blue and beaded slippers  her long ruddy curls were sleek and round and susan had let her put on her best hat out of compliment to the manse  it was a somewhat elaborate affair wherein susans taste had had more to say than annes and rillas small soul gloried in its splendours of silk and lace and flowers  she was very conscious of her hat and i am afraid she strutted up the manse hill  the strut or the hat or both got on the nerves of mary vance who was swinging on the lawn gate  marys temper was somewhat ruffled just then into the bargain  aunt martha had refused to let her peel the potatoes and had ordered her out of the kitchen  yah  youll bring the potatoes to the table with strips of skin hanging to them and half boiled as usual  my but itll be nice to go to your funeral shrieked mary  she went out of the kitchen giving the door such a bang that even aunt martha heard it and mr meredith in his study felt the vibration and thought absently that there must have been a slight earthquake shock then he went on with his sermon  mary slipped from the gate and confronted the spickandspan damsel of ingleside  what you got there she demanded trying to take the basket  rilla resisted  itth for mithter meredith she lisped  give it to me  ill give it to him said mary  no  thuthan thaid that i wathnt to give it to anybody but mithter merdith or aunt martha insisted rilla  mary eyed her sourly  you think youre something dont you all dressed up like a doll  look at me  my dress is all rags and i dont care  id rather be ragged than a doll baby  go home and tell them to put you in a glass case  look at melook at melook at me  mary executed a wild dance around the dismayed and bewildered rilla flirting her ragged skirt and vociferating look at melook at me until poor rilla was dizzy  but as the latter tried to edge away towards the gate mary pounced on her again  you give me that basket she ordered with a grimace  mary was past mistress in the art of making faces  she could give her countenance a most grotesque and unearthly appearance out of which her strange brilliant white eyes gleamed with weird effect  i wont gasped rilla frightened but staunch  you let me go mary vanth  mary let go for a minute and looked around here  just inside the gate was a small flake on which a half a dozen large codfish were drying  one of mr merediths parishioners had presented him with them one day perhaps in lieu of the subscription he was supposed to pay to the stipend and never did  mr meredith had thanked him and then forgotten all about the fish which would have promptly spoiled had not the indefatigable mary prepared them for drying and rigged up the flake herself on which to dry them  mary had a diabolical inspiration  she flew to the flake and seized the largest fish therea huge flat thing nearly as big as herself  with a whoop she swooped down on the terrified rilla brandishing her weird missile  rillas courage gave way to be lambasted with a dried codfish was such an unheardof thing that rilla could not face it  with a shriek she dropped her basket and fled  the beautiful berries which susan had so tenderly selected for the minister rolled in a rosy torrent over the dusty road and were trodden on by the flying feet of pursuer and pursued  the basket and contents were no longer in marys mind  she thought only of the delight of giving rilla blythe the scare of her life  she would teach her to come giving herself airs because of her fine clothes  rilla flew down the hill and along the street  terror lent wings to her feet and she just managed to keep ahead of mary who was somewhat hampered by her own laughter but who had breath enough to give occasional bloodcurdling whoops as she ran flourishing her codfish in the air  through the glen street they swept while everybody ran to the windows and gates to see them  mary felt she was making a tremendous sensation and enjoyed it rilla blind with terror and spent of breath felt that she could run no longer  in another instant that terrible girl would be on her with the codfish  at this point the poor mite stumbled and fell into the mudpuddle at the end of the street just as miss cornelia came out of carter flaggs store  miss cornelia took the whole situation in at a glance  so did mary  the latter stopped short in her mad career and before miss cornelia could speak she had whirled around and was running up as fast as she had run down  miss cornelias lips tightened ominously but she knew it was no use to think of chasing her so she picked up poor sobbing dishevelled rilla instead and took her home  rilla was heartbroken  her dress and slippers and hat were ruined and her six year old pride had received terrible bruises  susan white with indignation heard miss cornelias story of mary vances exploit  oh the hussyoh the littly hussy she said as she carried rilla away for purification and comfort  this thing has gone far enough anne dearie said miss cornelia resolutely  something must be done  who is this creature who is staying at the manse and where does she come from  i understood she was a little girl from overharbour who was visiting at the manse answered anne who saw the comical side of the codfish chase and secretly thought rilla was rather vain and needed a lesson or two  i know all the overharbour families who come to our church and that imp doesnt belong to any of them retorted miss cornelia she is almost in rags and when she goes to church she wears faith merediths old clothes  theres some mystery here and im going to investigate it since it seems nobody else will  i believe she was at the bottom of their goingson in warren meads spruce bush the other day  did you hear of their frightening his mother into a fit  no  i knew gilbert had been called to see her but i did not hear what the trouble was  well you know she has a weak heart  and one day last week when she was all alone on the veranda she heard the most awful shrieks of murder and help coming from the bushpositively frightful sounds anne dearie  her heart gave out at once warren heard them himself at the barn and went straight to the bush to investigate and there he found all the manse children sitting on a fallen tree and screaming murder at the top of their lungs  they told him they were only in fun and didnt think anyone would hear them  they were just playing indian ambush  warren went back to the house and found his poor mother unconscious on the veranda  susan who had returned sniffed contemptuously  i think she was very far from being unconscious mrs marshall elliott and that you may tie to  i have been hearing of amelia warrens weak heart for forty years  she had it when she was twenty  she enjoys making a fuss and having the doctor and any excuse will do  i dont think gilbert thought her attack very serious said anne  oh that may very well be said miss cornelia  but the matter has made an awful lot of talk and the meads being methodists makes it that much worse  what is going to become of those children  sometimes i cant sleep at nights for thinking about them anne dearie  i really do question if they get enough to eat even for their father is so lost in dreams that he doesnt often remember he has a stomach and that lazy old woman doesnt bother cooking what she ought  they are just running wild and now that school is closing theyll be worse than ever  they do have jolly times said anne laughing over the recollections of some rainbow valley happenings that had come to her ears  and they are all brave and frank and loyal and truthful  thats a true word anne dearie and when you come to think of all the trouble in the church those two tattling deceitful youngsters of the last ministers made im inclined to overlook a good deal in the merediths  when all is said and done mrs dr dear they are very nice children said susan  they have got plenty of original sin in them and that i will admit but maybe it is just as well for if they had not they might spoil from oversweetness  only i do think it is not proper for them to play in a graveyard and that i will maintain  but they really play quite quietly there excused anne  they dont run and yell as they do elsewhere such howls as drift up here from rainbow valley sometimes  though i fancy my own small fry bear a valiant part in them  they had a sham battle there last night and had to roar themselves because they had no artillery to do it so jem says  jem is passing through the stage where all boys hanker to be soldiers  well thank goodness hell never be a soldier said miss cornelia  i never approved of our boys going to that south african fracas  but its over and not likely anything of the kind will ever happen again  i think the world is getting more sensible  as for the merediths ive said many a time and i say it again if mr meredith had a wife all would be well  he called twice at the kirks last week so i am told said susan  well said miss cornelia thoughtfully as a rule i dont approve of a minister marrying in his congregation  it generally spoils him  but in this case it would do no harm for every one likes elizabeth kirk and nobody else is hankering for the job of stepmothering those youngsters  even the hill girls balk at that  they havent been found laying traps for mr meredith elizabeth would make him a good wife if he only thought so  but the trouble is she really is homely and anne dearie mr meredith abstracted as he is has an eye for a goodlooking woman manlike  he isnt so otherworldly when it comes to that believe me  elizabeth kirk is a very nice person but they do say that people have nearly frozen to death in her mothers spareroom bed before now mrs dr dear said susan darkly  if i felt i had any right to express an opinion concerning such a solemn matter as a ministers marriage i would say that i think elizabeths cousin sarah overharbour would make mr meredith a better wife  why sarah kirk is a methodist said miss cornelia much as if susan had suggested a hottentot as a manse bride  she would likely turn presbyterian if she married mr meredith retorted susan  miss cornelia shook her head  evidently with her it was once a methodist always a methodist  sarah kirk is entirely out of the question she said positively  and so is emmeline drewthough the drews are all trying to make the match  they are literally throwing poor emmeline at his head and he hasnt the least idea of it  emmeline drew has no gumption i must allow said susan  she is the kind of woman mrs dr dear who would put a hotwater bottle in your bed on a dognight and then have her feelings hurt because you were not grateful  and her mother was a very poor housekeeper  did you ever hear the story of her dishcloth  she lost her dishcloth one day  but the next day she found it  oh yes mrs dr dear she found it in the goose at the dinnertable mixed up with the stuffing  do you think a woman like that would do for a ministers motherinlaw  i do not but no doubt i would be better employed in mending little jems trousers than in talking gossip about my neighbours  he tore them something scandalous last night in rainbow valley  where is walter asked anne  he is up to no good i fear mrs dr dear  he is in the attic writing something in an exercise book  and he has not done as well in arithmetic this term as he should so the teacher tells me  too well i know the reason why  he has been writing silly rhymes when he should have been doing his sums  i am afraid that boy is going to be a poet mrs dr dear  he is a poet now susan  well you take it real calm mrs dr dear  i suppose it is the best way when a person has the strength  i had an uncle who began by being a poet and ended up by being a tramp  our family were dreadfully ashamed of him  you dont seem to think very highly of poets susan said anne laughing  who does mrs dr dear asked susan in genuine astonishment  what about milton and shakespeare  and the poets of the bible  they tell me milton could not get along with his wife and shakespeare was no more than respectable by times  as for the bible of course things were different in those sacred days although i never had a high opinion of king david say what you will  i never knew any good to come of writing poetry and i hope and pray that blessed boy will outgrow the tendency  if he does notwe must see what emulsion of codliver oil will do    chapter viii miss cornelia intervenes  miss cornelia descended upon the manse the next day and crossquestioned mary who being a young person of considerable discernment and astuteness told her story simple and truthfully with an entire absence of complaint or bravado  miss cornelia was more favourably impressed than she had expected to be but deemed it her duty to be severe  do you think she said sternly that you showed your gratitude to this family who have been far too kind to you by insulting and chasing one of their little friends as you did yesterday  say it was rotten mean of me admitted mary easily  i dunno what possessed me  that old codfish seemed to come in so blamed handy  but i was awful sorryi cried last night after i went to bed about it honest i did  you ask una if i didnt  i wouldnt tell her what for cause i was ashamed of it and then she cried too because she was afraid someone had hurt my feelings  laws i aint got any feelings to hurt worth speaking of  what worries me is why mrs wiley haint been hunting for me  it aint like her  miss cornelia herself thought it rather peculiar but she merely admonished mary sharply not to take any further liberties with the ministers codfish and went to report progress at ingleside  if the childs story is true the matter ought to be looked into she said  i know something about that wiley woman believe me  marshall used to be well acquainted with her when he lived overharbour  i heard him say something last summer about her and a home child she hadlikely this very marycreature  he said some one told him she was working the child to death and not half feeding and clothing it  you know anne dearie it has always been my habit neither to make nor meddle with those overharbour folks  but i shall send marshall over tomorrow to find out the rights of this if he can  and then ill speak to the minister  mind you anne dearie the merediths found this girl literally starving in james taylors old hay barn  she had been there all night cold and hungry and alone  and us sleeping warm in our beds after good suppers  the poor little thing said anne picturing one of her own dear babies cold and hungry and alone in such circumstances  if she has been illused miss cornelia she mustnt be taken back to such a place  i was an orphan once in a very similar situation  well have to consult the hopetown asylum folks said miss cornelia  anyway she cant be left at the manse  dear knows what those poor children might learn from her  i understand that she has been known to swear  but just think of her being there two whole weeks and mr meredith never waking up to it  what business has a man like that to have a family  why anne dearie he ought to be a monk  two evenings later miss cornelia was back at ingleside  its the most amazing thing  she said  mrs wiley was found dead in her bed the very morning after this marycreature ran away  she has had a bad heart for years and the doctor had warned her it might happen at any time  she had sent away her hired man and there was nobody in the house  some neighbours found her the next day  they missed the child it seems but supposed mrs wiley had sent her to her cousin near charlottetown as she had said she was going to do  the cousin didnt come to the funeral and so nobody ever knew that mary wasnt with her the people marshall talked to told him some things about the way mrs wiley used this mary that made his blood boil so he declares  you know it puts marshall in a regular fury to hear of a child being illused  they said she whipped her mercilessly for every little fault or mistake  some folks talked of writing to the asylum authorities but everybodys business is nobodys business and it was never done  i am sorry that wiley person is dead said susan fiercely  i should like to go overharbour and give her a piece of my mind starving and beating a child mrs dr dear  as you know i hold with lawful spanking but i go no further  and what is to become of this poor child now mrs marshall elliott  i suppose she must be sent back to hopetown said miss cornelia  i think every one hereabouts who wants a home child has one  ill see mr meredith tomorrow and tell him my opinion of the whole affair  and no doubt she will mrs dr dear said susan after miss cornelia had gone  she would stick at nothing not even at shingling the church spire if she took it into her head  but i cannot understand how even cornelia bryant can talk to a minister as she does  you would think he was just any common person  when miss cornelia had gone nan blythe uncurled herself from the hammock where she had been studying her lessons and slipped away to rainbow valley  the others were already there  jem and jerry were playing quoits with old horseshoes borrowed from the glen blacksmith  carl was stalking ants on a sunny hillock  walter lying on his stomach among the fern was reading aloud to mary and di and faith and una from a wonderful book of myths wherein were fascinating accounts of prester john and the wandering jew divining rods and tailed men of schamir the worm that split rocks and opened the way to golden treasure of fortunate isles and swanmaidens  it was a great shock to walter to learn that william tell and gelert were myths also and the story of bishop hatto was to keep him awake all that night but best of all he loved the stories of the pied piper and the san greal  he read them thrillingly while the bells on the tree lovers tinkled in the summer wind and the coolness of the evening shadows crept across the valley  say aint them inresting lies  said mary admiringly when walter had closed the book  they arent lies said di indignantly  you dont mean theyre true asked mary incredulously  nonot exactly  theyre like those ghoststories of yours they werent truebut you didnt expect us to believe them so they werent lies  that yarn about the divining rod is no lie anyhow said mary old jake crawford overharbour can work it  they send for him from everywhere when they want to dig a well  and i believe i know the wandering jew  oh mary said una awestruck  i dotrues youre alive  there was an old man at mrs wileys one day last fall  he looked old enough to be anything  she was asking him about cedar posts if he thought theyd last well and he said last well  theyll last a thousand years  i know for ive tried them twice  now if he was two thousand years old who was he but your wandering jew  i dont believe the wandering jew would associate with a person like mrs wiley said faith decidedly  i love the pied piper story said di and so does mother  i always feel so sorry for the poor little lame boy who couldnt keep up with the others and got shut out of the mountain  he must have been so disappointed  i think all the rest of his life hed be wondering what wonderful thing he had missed and wishing he could have got in with the others  but how glad his mother must have been said una softly  i think she had been sorry all her life that he was lame perhaps she even used to cry about it  but she would never be sorry againnever  she would be glad he was lame because that was why she hadnt lost him  some day said walter dreamily looking afar into the sky the pied piper will come over the hill up there and down rainbow valley piping merrily and sweetly  and i will follow himfollow him down to the shoredown to the seaaway from you all  i dont think ill want to gojem will want to goit will be such an adventurebut i wont  only ill have tothe music will call and call and call me until i must follow  well all go cried di catching fire at the flame of walters fancy and halfbelieving she could see the mocking retreating figure of the mystic piper in the far dim end of the valley  no  youll sit here and wait said walter his great splendid eyes full of strange glamour  youll wait for us to come back and we may not comefor we cannot come as long as the piper plays  he may pipe us round the world  and still youll sit here and waitand wait  oh dry up said mary shivering  dont look like that walter blythe  you give me the creeps  do you want to set me bawling  i could just see that horrid old piper going away on and you boys following him and us girls sitting here waiting all alone  i dunno why it isi never was one of the blubbering kindbut as soon as you start your spieling i always want to cry  walter smiled in triumph he liked to exercise this power of his over his companionsto play on their feelings waken their fears thrill their souls  it satisfied some dramatic instinct in him  but under his triumph was a queer little chill of some mysterious dread  the pied piper had seemed very real to himas if the fluttering veil that hid the future had for a moment been blown aside in the starlit dusk of rainbow valley and some dim glimpse of coming years granted to him  carl coming up to their group with a report of the doings in antland brought them all back to the realm of facts  ants are darned inresting exclaimed mary glad to escape the shadowy pipers thrall  carl and me watched that bed in the graveyard all saturday afternoon  i never thought there was so much in bugs  say but theyre quarrelsome little cussessome of em like to start a fight thout any reason fars we could see  and some of em are cowards  they got so scared they just doubled theirselves up into a ball and let the other fellows bang em  they wouldnt put up a fight at all  some of em are lazy and wont work  we watched em shirking  and there was one ant died of grief cause another ant got killedwouldnt work wouldnt eatjust diedit did honest to gooodness  a shocked silence prevailed  every one knew that mary had not started out to say goodness  faith and di exchanged glances that would have done credit to miss cornelia herself  walter and carl looked uncomfortable and unas lip trembled  mary squirmed uncomfortably  that slipped out fore i thoughtit did honest toi mean trues you live and i swallowed half of it  you folks over here are mighty squeamish seems to me  wish you could have heard the wileys when they had a fight  ladies dont say such things said faith very primly for her  it isnt right whispered una  i aint a lady said mary  what chanceve i ever had of being a lady  but i wont say that again if i can help it  i promise you  besides said una you cant expect god to answer your prayers if you take his name in vain mary  i dont expect him to answer em anyhow said mary of little faith  ive been asking him for a week to clear up this wiley affair and he hasnt done a thing  im going to give up  at this juncture nan arrived breathless  oh mary ive news for you  mrs elliott has been overharbour and what do you think she found out  mrs wiley is deadshe was found dead in bed the morning after you ran away  so youll never have to go back to her  dead said mary stupefied  then she shivered  do you spose my praying had anything to do with that  she cried imploringly to una  if it had ill never pray again as long as i live  why she may come back and hant me  no no mary said una comfortingly it hadnt  why mrs wiley died long before you ever began to pray about it at all  thats so said mary recovering from her panic  but i tell you it gave me a start  i wouldnt like to think id prayed anybody to death  i never thought of such a thing as her dying when i was praying  she didnt seem much like the dying kind did mrs elliott say anything about me  she said you would likely have to go back to the asylum  i thought as much said mary drearily  and then theyll give me out againlikely to some one just like mrs wiley  well i spose i can stand it  im tough  im going to pray that you wont have to go back whispered una as she and mary walked home to the manse  you can do as you like said mary decidedly but i vow i wont  im good and scared of this praying business  see whats come of it  if mrs wiley had died after i started praying it would have been my doings  oh no it wouldnt said una  i wish i could explain things betterfather could i know if youd talk to him mary  catch me  i dont know what to make of your father thats the long and short of it  he goes by me and never sees me in broad daylight  i aint proudbut i aint a doormat neither  oh mary its just fathers way  most of the time he never sees us either  he is thinking deeply that is all  and i am going to pray that god will keep you in four windsbecause i like you mary  all right  only dont let me hear of any more people dying on account of it said mary  id like to stay in four winds fine i like it and i like the harbour and the light houseand you and the blythes  youre the only friends i ever had and id hate to leave you    chapter ix una intervenes  miss cornelia had an interview with mr meredith which proved something of a shock to that abstracted gentleman  she pointed out to him none too respectfully his dereliction of duty in allowing a waif like mary vance to come into his family and associate with his children without knowing or learning anything about her  i dont say there is much harm done of course she concluded this marycreature isnt what you might call bad when all is said and done  ive been questioning your children and the blythes and from what i can make out theres nothing much to be said against the child except that shes slangy and doesnt use very refined language  but think what might have happened if shed been like some of those home children we know of  you know yourself what that poor little creature the jim flaggs had taught and told the flagg children  mr meredith did know and was honestly shocked over his own carelessness in the matter  but what is to be done mrs elliott he asked helplessly  we cant turn the poor child out  she must be cared for  of course  wed better write to the hopetown authorities at once  meanwhile i suppose she might as well stay here for a few more days till we hear from them  but keep your eyes and ears open mr meredith  susan would have died of horror on the spot if she had heard miss cornelia so admonishing a minister  but miss cornelia departed in a warm glow of satisfaction over duty done and that night mr meredith asked mary to come into his study with him  mary obeyed looking literally ghastly with fright  but she got the surprise of her poor battered little life  this man of whom she had stood so terribly in awe was the kindest gentlest soul she had ever met  before she knew what happened mary found herself pouring all her troubles into his ear and receiving in return such sympathy and tender understanding as it had never occurred to her to imagine  mary left the study with her face and eyes so softened that una hardly knew her  your fathers all right when he does wake up she said with a sniff that just escaped being a sob  its a pity he doesnt wake up oftener  he said i wasnt to blame for mrs wiley dying but that i must try to think of her good points and not of her bad ones  i dunno what good points she had unless it was keeping her house clean and making firstclass butter  i know i most wore my arms out scrubbing her old kitchen floor with the knots in it  but anything your father says goes with me after this  mary proved a rather dull companion in the following days however  she confided to una that the more she thought of going back to the asylum the more she hated it  una racked her small brains for some way of averting it but it was nan blythe who came to the rescue with a somewhat startling suggestion  mrs elliott might take mary herself  she has a great big house and mr elliott is always wanting her to have help  it would be just a splendid place for mary  only shed have to behave herself  oh nan do you think mrs elliott would take her  it wouldnt do any harm if you asked her said nan  at first una did not think she could  she was so shy that to ask a favour of anybody was agony to her  and she was very much in awe of the bustling energetic mrs elliott  she liked her very much and always enjoyed a visit to her house but to go and ask her to adopt mary vance seemed such a height of presumption that unas timid spirit quailed  when the hopetown authorities wrote to mr meredith to send mary to them without delay mary cried herself to sleep in the manse attic that night and una found a desperate courage  the next evening she slipped away from the manse to the harbour road  far down in rainbow valley she heard joyous laughter but her way lay not there  she was terribly pale and terribly in earnestso much so that she took no notice of the people she metand old mrs stanley flagg was quite huffed and said una meredith would be as absentminded as her father when she grew up  miss cornelia lived half way between the glen and four winds point in a house whose original glaring green hue had mellowed down to an agreeable greenish gray  marshall elliott had planted trees about it and set out a rose garden and a spruce hedge  it was quite a different place from what it had been in years agone the manse children and the ingleside children liked to go there it was a beautiful walk down the old harbour road and there was always a wellfilled cooky jar at the end  the misty sea was lapping softly far down on the sands  three big boats were skimming down the harbour like great white seabirds  a schooner was coming up the channel  the world of four winds was steeped in glowing colour and subtle music and strange glamour and everybody should have been happy in it  but when una turned in at miss cornelias gate her very legs had almost refused to carry her  miss cornelia was alone on the veranda  una had hoped mr elliott would be there  he was so big and hearty and twinkly that there would be encouragement in his presence  she sat on the little stool miss cornelia brought out and tried to eat the doughnut miss cornelia gave her  it stuck in her throat but she swallowed desperately lest miss cornelia be offended  she could not talk she was still pale and her big darkblue eyes looked so piteous that miss cornelia concluded the child was in some trouble  whats on your mind dearie she asked  theres something thats plain to be seen  una swallowed the last twist of doughnut with a desperate gulp  mrs elliott wont you take mary vance  she said beseechingly  miss cornelia stared blankly  me  take mary vance  do you mean keep her  yeskeep heradopt her said una eagerly gaining courage now that the ice was broken  oh mrs elliott please do  she doesnt want to go back to the asylumshe cries every night about it  shes so afraid of being sent to another hard place and shes so smartthere isnt anything she cant do  i know you wouldnt be sorry if you took her  i never thought of such a thing said miss cornelia rather helplessly  wont you think of it implored una  but dearie i dont want help  im quite able to do all the work here  and i never thought id like to have a home girl if i did need help  the light went out of unas eyes  her lips trembled  she sat down on her stool again a pathetic little figure of disappointment and began to cry  dontdeariedont exclaimed miss cornelia in distress  she could never bear to hurt a child  i dont say i wont take herbut the idea is so new it has just kerflummuxed me  i must think it over  mary is so smart said una again  humph  so ive heard  ive heard she swears too  is that true  ive never heard her swear exactly faltered una uncomfortably but im afraid she could  i believe you  does she always tell the truth  i think she does except when shes afraid of a whipping  and yet you want me to take her  some one has to take her sobbed una  some one has to look after her mrs elliott  thats true  perhaps it is my duty to do it said miss cornelia with a sigh  well ill have to talk it over with mr elliott  so dont say anything about it just yet  take another doughnut dearie  una took it and ate it with a better appetite  im very fond of doughnuts she confessed aunt martha never makes any  but miss susan at ingleside does and sometimes she lets us have a plateful in rainbow valley  do you know what i do when im hungry for doughnuts and cant get any mrs elliott  no dearie  what  i get out mothers old cook book and read the doughnut recipeand the other recipes  they sound so nice  i always do that when im hungryespecially after weve had ditto for dinner  then i read the fried chicken and the roast goose recipes  mother could make all those nice things  those manse children will starve to death yet if mr meredith doesnt get married miss cornelia told her husband indignantly after una had gone  and he wontand whats to be done  and shall we take this marycreature marshall  yes take her said marshall laconically  just like a man said his wife despairingly  take heras if that was all  there are a hundred things to be considered believe me  take herand well consider them afterwards cornelia said her husband  in the end miss cornelia did take her and went up to announce her decision to the ingleside people first  splendid said anne delightedly  ive been hoping you would do that very thing miss cornelia  i want that poor child to get a good home  i was a homeless little orphan just like her once  i dont think this marycreature is or ever will be much like you retorted miss cornelia gloomily  shes a cat of another colour  but shes also a human being with an immortal soul to save  ive got a shorter catechism and a small tooth comb and im going to do my duty by her now that ive set my hand to the plough believe me  mary received the news with chastened satisfaction  its better luck than i expected she said  youll have to mind your ps and qs with mrs elliott said nan  well i can do that flashed mary  i know how to behave when i want to just as well as you nan blythe  you mustnt use bad words you know mary said una anxiously  i spose shed die of horror if i did grinned mary her white eyes shining with unholy glee over the idea  but you neednt worry una  butter wont melt in my mouth after this  ill be all prunes and prisms  nor tell lies added faith  not even to get off from a whipping pleaded mary  mrs elliott will never whip younever exclaimed di  wont she said mary skeptically  if i ever find myself in a place where i aint licked ill think its heaven all right  no fear of me telling lies then  i aint fond of telling emid ruther not if it comes to that  the day before marys departure from the manse they had a picnic in her honour in rainbow valley and that evening all the manse children gave her something from their scanty store of treasured things for a keepsake  carl gave her his noahs ark and jerry his second best jewsharp  faith gave her a little hairbrush with a mirror in the back of it which mary had always considered very wonderful  una hesitated between an old beaded purse and a gay picture of daniel in the lions den and finally offered mary her choice  mary really hankered after the beaded purse but she knew una loved it so she said  give me daniel  id rusher have it cause im partial to lions only i wish theyd et daniel up  it would have been more exciting  at bedtime mary coaxed una to sleep with her  its for the last time she said and its raining tonight and i hate sleeping up there alone when its raining on account of that graveyard  i dont mind it on fine nights but a night like this i cant see anything but the rain pouring down on them old white stones and the wind round the window sounds as if them dead people were trying to get in and crying cause they couldnt  i like rainy nights said una when they were cuddled down together in the little attic room and so do the blythe girls  i dont mind em when im not handy to graveyards said mary if i was alone here id cry my eyes out id be so lonesome  i feel awful bad to be leaving you all  mrs elliott will let you come up and play in rainbow valley quite often im sure said una  and you will be a good girl wont you mary  oh ill try sighed mary  but it wont be as easy for me to be goodinside i mean as well as outsideas it is for you you hadnt such scalawags of relations as i had  but your people must have had some good qualities as well as bad ones argued una  you must live up to them and never mind their bad ones  i dont believe they had any good qualities said mary gloomily  i never heard of any  my grandfather had money but they say he was a rascal  no ill just have to start out on my own hook and do the best i can  and god will help you you know mary if you ask him  i dont know about that  oh mary  you know we asked god to get a home for you and he did  i dont see what he had to do with it retorted mary  it was you put it into mrs elliotts head  but god put it into her heart to take you  all my putting it into her head wouldnt have done any good if he hadnt  well there may be something in that admitted mary  mind you i havent got anything against god una  im willing to give him a chance  but honest i think hes an awful lot like your fatherjust absentminded and never taking any notice of a body most of the time but sometimes waking up all of a suddent and being awful good and kind and sensible  oh mary no exclaimed horrified una  god isnt a bit like fatheri mean hes a thousand times better and kinder  if hes as good as your father hell do for me said mary when your father was talking to me i felt as if i never could be bad any more  i wish youd talk to father about him sighed una  he can explain it all so much better than i can  why so i will next time he wakes up promised mary  that night he talked to me in the study he showed me real clear that my praying didnt kill mrs wiley  my minds been easy since but im real cautious about praying  i guess the old rhyme is the safest  say una it seems to me if one has to pray to anybody itd be better to pray to the devil than to god  gods good anyhow so you say so he wont do you any harm but from all i can make out the devil needs to be pacified  i think the sensible way would be to say to him good devil please dont tempt me  just leave me alone please  now dont you  oh no no mary  im sure it couldnt be right to pray to the devil  and it wouldnt do any good because hes bad  it might aggravate him and hed be worse than ever  well as to this godmatter said mary stubbornly since you and i cant settle it there aint no use in talking more about it until weve a chanct to find out the rights of it  ill do the best i can alone till then  if mother was alive she could tell us everything said una with a sigh  i wisht she was alive said mary  i dont know whats going to become of you youngsters when im gone  anyhow do try and keep the house a little tidy  the way people talks about it is scandalous  and the first thing you know your father will be getting married again and then your noses will be out of joint  una was startled  the idea of her father marrying again had never presented itself to her before  she did not like it and she lay silent under the chill of it  stepmothers are awful creatures mary went on  i could make your blood run cold if i was to tell you all i know about em the wilson kids across the road from wileys had a stepmother she was just as bad to em as mrs wiley was to me  itll be awful if you get a stepmother  im sure we wont said una tremulously  father wont marry anybody else  hell be hounded into it i expect said mary darkly  all the old maids in the settlement are after him  theres no being up to them  and the worst of stepmothers is they always set your father against you  hed never care anything about you again hed always take her part and her childrens part  you see shed make him believe you were all bad  i wish you hadnt told me this mary cried una  it makes me feel so unhappy  i only wanted to warn you said mary rather repentantly  of course your fathers so absentminded he mightnt happen to think of getting married again  but its better to be prepared  long after mary slept serenely little una lay awake her eyes smarting with tears  on how dreadful it would be if her father should marry somebody who would make him hate her and jerry and faith and carl  she couldnt bear itshe couldnt  mary had not instilled any poison of the kind miss cornelia had feared into the manse childrens minds  yet she had certainly contrived to do a little mischief with the best of intentions but she slept dreamlessly while una lay awake and the rain fell and the wind wailed around the old gray manse  and the rev john meredith forgot to go to bed at all because he was absorbed in reading a life of st augustine  it was gray dawn when he finished it and went upstairs wrestling with the problems of two thousand years ago  the door of the girls room was open and he saw faith lying asleep rosy and beautiful  he wondered where una was  perhaps she had gone over to stay all night with the blythe girls  she did this occasionally deeming it a great treat  john meredith sighed  he felt that unas whereabouts ought not to be a mystery to him  cecelia would have looked after her better than that  if only cecelia were still with him  how pretty and gay she had been  how the old manse up at maywater had echoed to her songs and she had gone away so suddenly taking her laughter and music and leaving silenceso suddenly that he had never quite got over his feeling of amazement  how could she the beautiful and vivid have died  the idea of a second marriage had never presented itself seriously to john meredith  he had loved his wife so deeply that he believed he could never care for any woman again  he had a vague idea that before very long faith would be old enough to take her mothers place  until then he must do the best he could alone  he sighed and went to his room where the bed was still unmade  aunt martha had forgotten it and mary had not dared to make it because aunt martha had forbidden her to meddle with anything in the ministers room  but mr meredith did not notice that it was unmade  his last thoughts were of st augustine    chapter x the manse girls clean house  ugh said faith sitting up in bed with a shiver  its raining  i do hate a rainy sunday  sunday is dull enough even when its fine  we oughtnt to find sunday dull said una sleepily trying to pull her drowsy wits together with an uneasy conviction that they had overslept  but we do you know said faith candidly  mary vance says most sundays are so dull she could hang herself  we ought to like sunday better than mary vance said una remorsefully  were the ministers children  i wish we were a blacksmiths children protested faith angrily hunting for her stockings  then people wouldnt expect us to be better than other children  just look at the holes in my heels  mary darned them all up before she went away but theyre as bad as ever now  una get up  i cant get the breakfast alone  oh dear  i wish father and jerry were home you wouldnt think wed miss father muchwe dont see much of him when he is home  and yet everything seems gone  i must run in and see how aunt martha is  is she any better asked una when faith returned  no she isnt  shes groaning with the misery still  maybe we ought to tell dr blythe  but she says notshe never had a doctor in her life and she isnt going to begin now  she says doctors just live by poisoning people  do you suppose they do  no of course not said una indignantly  im sure dr blythe wouldnt poison anybody  well well have to rub aunt marthas back again after breakfast  wed better not make the flannels as hot as we did yesterday  faith giggled over the remembrance  they had nearly scalded the skin off poor aunt marthas back  una sighed  mary vance would have known just what the precise temperature of flannels for a misery back should be  mary knew everything  they knew nothing and how could they learn save by bitter experience for which in this instance unfortunate aunt martha had paid  the preceding monday mr meredith had left for nova scotia to spend his short vacation taking jerry with him  on wednesday aunt martha was suddenly seized with a recurring and mysterious ailment which she always called the misery and which was tolerably certain to attack her at the most inconvenient times she could not rise from her bed any movement causing agony  a doctor she flatly refused to have  faith and una cooked the meals and waited on her  the less said about the meals the betteryet they were not much worse than aunt marthas had been there were many women in the village who would have been glad to come and help but aunt martha refused to let her plight be known  you must worry on till i kin git around she groaned  thank goodness john isnt here  theres a plenty o cold biled meat and bread and you kin try your hand at making porridge  the girls had tried their hand but so far without much success the first day it had been too thin  the next day so thick that you could cut it in slices  and both days it had been burned  i hate porridge said faith viciously  when i have a house of my own im never going to have a single bit of porridge in it  whatll your children do then asked una  children have to have porridge or they wont grow  everybody says so  theyll have to get along without it or stay runts retorted faith stubbornly  here una you stir it while i set the table if i leave it for a minute the horrid stuff will burn  its half past nine  well be late for sunday school  i havent seen anyone going past yet said una  there wont likely be many out  just see how its pouring  and when theres no preaching the folks wont come from a distance to bring the children  go and call carl said faith  carl it appeared had a sore throat induced by getting wet in the rainbow valley marsh the previous evening while pursuing dragonflies  he had come home with dripping stockings and boots and had sat out the evening in them  he could not eat any breakfast and faith made him go back to bed again  she and una left the table as it was and went to sunday school  there was no one in the school room when they got there and no one came  they waited until eleven and then went home  there doesnt seem to be anybody at the methodist sunday school either said una  im glad said faith  id hate to think the methodists were better at going to sunday school on rainy sundays than the presbyterians  but theres no preaching in their church today either so likely their sunday school is in the afternoon  una washed the dishes doing them quite nicely for so much had she learned from mary vance  faith swept the floor after a fashion and peeled the potatoes for dinner cutting her finger in the process  i wish we had something for dinner besides ditto sighed una im so tired of it  the blythe children dont know what ditto is  and we never have any pudding  nan says susan would faint if they had no pudding on sundays  why arent we like other people faith  i dont want to be like other people laughed faith tying up her bleeding finger  i like being myself  its more interesting  jessie drew is as good a housekeeper as her mother but would you want to be as stupid as she is  but our house isnt right  mary vance says so  she says people talk about it being so untidy  faith had an inspiration  well clean it all up she cried  well go right to work tomorrow  its a real good chance when aunt martha is laid up and cant interfere with us  well have it all lovely and clean when father comes home just like it was when mary went away any one can sweep and dust and wash windows  people wont be able to talk about us any more  jem blythe says its only old cats that talk but their talk hurts just as much as anybodys  i hope it will be fine tomorrow said una fired with enthusiasm  oh faith it will be splendid to be all cleaned up and like other people  i hope aunt marthas misery will last over tomorrow said faith  if it doesnt we wont get a single thing done  faiths amiable wish was fulfilled  the next day found aunt martha still unable to rise  carl too was still sick and easily prevailed on to stay in bed  neither faith nor una had any idea how sick the boy really was a watchful mother would have had a doctor without delay but there was no mother and poor little carl with his sore throat and aching head and crimson cheeks rolled himself up in his twisted bedclothes and suffered alone somewhat comforted by the companionship of a small green lizard in the pocket of his ragged nighty  the world was full of summer sunshine after the rain  it was a peerless day for housecleaning and faith and una went gaily to work  well clean the diningroom and the parlour said faith  it wouldnt do to meddle with the study and it doesnt matter much about the upstairs  the first thing is to take everything out  accordingly everything was taken out  the furniture was piled on the veranda and lawn and the methodist graveyard fence was gaily draped with rugs  an orgy of sweeping followed with an attempt at dusting on unas part while faith washed the windows of the diningroom breaking one pane and cracking two in the process  una surveyed the streaked result dubiously  they dont look right somehow she said  mrs elliotts and susans windows just shine and sparkle  never mind  they let the sunshine through just as well said faith cheerfully  they must be clean after all the soap and water ive used and thats the main thing  now its past eleven so ill wipe up this mess on the floor and well go outside  you dust the furniture and ill shake the rugs  im going to do it in the graveyard  i dont want to send dust flying all over the lawn  faith enjoyed the rug shaking  to stand on hezekiah pollocks tombstone flapping and shaking rugs was real fun  to be sure elder abraham clow and his wife driving past in their capacious doubleseated buggy seemed to gaze at her in grim disapproval  isnt that a terrible sight said elder abraham solemnly  i would never have believed it if i hadnt seen it with my own eyes said mrs elder abraham more solemnly still  faith waved a door mat cheerily at the clow party  it did not worry her that the elder and his wife did not return her greeting  everybody knew that elder abraham had never been known to smile since he had been appointed superintendent of the sunday school fourteen years previously  but it hurt her that minnie and adella clow did not wave back  faith liked minnie and adella  next to the blythes they were her best friends in school and she always helped adella with her sums  this was gratitude for you  her friends cut her because she was shaking rugs in an old graveyard where as mary vance said not a living soul had been buried for years  faith flounced around to the veranda where she found una grieved in spirit because the clow girls had not waved to her either  i suppose theyre mad over something said faith  perhaps theyre jealous because we play so much in rainbow valley with the blythes  well just wait till school opens and adella wants me to show her how to do her sums  well get square then  come on lets put the things back in  im tired to death and i dont believe the rooms will look much better than before we started though i shook out pecks of dust in the graveyard  i hate housecleaning  it was two oclock before the tired girls finished the two rooms they got a dreary bite in the kitchen and intended to wash the dishes at once  but faith happened to pick up a new storybook di blythe had lent her and was lost to the world until sunset una took a cup of rank tea up to carl but found him asleep so she curled herself up on jerrys bed and went to sleep too meanwhile a weird story flew through glen st mary and folks asked each other seriously what was to be done with those manse youngsters  that is past laughing at believe me said miss cornelia to her husband with a heavy sigh  i couldnt believe it at first miranda drew brought the story home from the methodist sunday school this afternoon and i simply scoffed at it  but mrs elder abraham says she and the elder saw it with their own eyes  saw what asked marshall  faith and una meredith stayed home from sunday school this morning and cleaned house said miss cornelia in accents of despair  when elder abraham went home from the churchhe had stayed behind to straighten out the library bookshe saw them shaking rugs in the methodist graveyard  i can never look a methodist in the face again  just think what a scandal it will make  a scandal it assuredly did make growing more scandalous as it spread until the overharbour people heard that the manse children had not only cleaned house and put out a washing on sunday but had wound up with an afternoon picnic in the graveyard while the methodist sunday school was going on  the only household which remained in blissful ignorance of the terrible thing was the manse itself on what faith and una fondly believed to be tuesday it rained again for the next three days it rained nobody came near the manse the manse folk went nowhere they might have waded through the misty rainbow valley up to ingleside but all the blythe family save susan and the doctor were away on a visit to avonlea  this is the last of our bread said faith and the ditto is done  if aunt martha doesnt get better soon what will we do  we can buy some bread in the village and theres the codfish mary dried said una  but we dont know how to cook it  oh thats easy laughed faith  you just boil it  boil it they did but as it did not occur to them to soak it beforehand it was too salty to eat  that night they were very hungry but by the following day their troubles were over sunshine returned to the world carl was well and aunt marthas misery left her as suddenly as it had come the butcher called at the manse and chased famine away  to crown all the blythes returned home and that evening they and the manse children and mary vance kept sunset tryst once more in rainbow valley where the daisies were floating upon the grass like spirits of the dew and the bells on the tree lovers rang like fairy chimes in the scented twilight    chapter xi a dreadful discovery  well you kids have gone and done it now was marys greeting as she joined them in the valley  miss cornelia was up at ingleside holding agonized conclave with anne and susan and mary hoped that the session might be a long one for it was all of two weeks since she had been allowed to revel with her chums in the dear valley of rainbows  done what demanded everybody but walter who was daydreaming as usual  its you manse young ones i mean said mary  it was just awful of you  i wouldnt have done such a thing for the world and i werent brought up in a mansewerent brought up anywherejust come up  what have we done asked faith blankly  done  youd better ask  the talk is something terrible  i expect its ruined your father in this congregation  hell never be able to live it down poor man  everybody blames him for it and that isnt fair  but nothing is fair in this world  you ought to be ashamed of yourselves  what have we done asked una again despairingly  faith said nothing but her eyes flashed goldenbrown scorn at mary  oh dont pretend innocence said mary witheringly everybody knows what you have done  i dont interjected jem blythe indignantly  dont let me catch you making una cry mary vance  what are you talking about  i spose you dont know since youre just back from up west said mary somewhat subdued  jem could always manage her  but everybody else knows youd better believe  knows what  that faith and una stayed home from sunday school last sunday and cleaned house  we didnt cried faith and una in passionate denial  mary looked haughtily at them  i didnt suppose youd deny it after the way youve combed me down for lying she said  whats the good of saying you didnt  everybody knows you did  elder clow and his wife saw you  some people say it will break up the church but i dont go that far  you are nice ones  nan blythe stood up and put her arms around the dazed faith and una  they were nice enough to take you in and feed you and clothe you when you were starving in mr taylors barn mary vance she said  you are very grateful i must say  i am grateful retorted mary  youd know it if youd heard me standing up for mr meredith through thick and thin  ive blistered my tongue talking for him this week  ive said again and again that he isnt to blame if his young ones did clean house on sunday  he was awayand they knew better  but we didnt protested una  it was monday we cleaned house wasnt it faith  of course it was said faith with flashing eyes  we went to sunday school in spite of the rainand no one camenot even elder abraham for all his talk about fairweather christians  it was saturday it rained said mary  sunday was as fine as silk  i wasnt at sunday school because i had toothache but every one else was and they saw all your stuff out on the lawn and elder abraham and mrs elder abraham saw you shaking rugs in the graveyard  una sat down among the daisies and began to cry  look here said jem resolutely this thing must be cleared up somebody has made a mistake  sunday was fine faith  how could you have thought saturday was sunday  prayermeeting was thursday night cried faith and adam flew into the souppot on friday when aunt marthas cat chased him and spoiled our dinner and saturday there was a snake in the cellar and carl caught it with a forked stick and carried it out and sunday it rained  so there  prayermeeting was wednesday night said mary  elder baxter was to lead and he couldnt go thursday night and it was changed to wednesday  you were just a day out faith meredith and you did work on sunday  suddenly faith burst into a peal of laughter  i suppose we did  what a joke  it isnt much of a joke for your father said mary sourly  itll be all right when people find out it was just a mistake said faith carelessly  well explain  you can explain till youre black in the face said mary but a lie like thatll travel fastern further than you ever will ive seen more of the world than you and i know  besides there are plenty of folks wont believe it was a mistake  they will if i tell them said faith  you cant tell everybody said mary  no i tell you youve disgraced your father  unas evening was spoiled by this dire reflection but faith refused to be made uncomfortable  besides she had a plan that would put everything right  so she put the past with its mistake behind her and gave herself over to enjoyment of the present jem went away to fish and walter came out of his reverie and proceeded to describe the woods of heaven  mary pricked up her ears and listened respectfully  despite her awe of walter she revelled in his book talk  it always gave her a delightful sensation  walter had been reading his coleridge that day and he pictured a heaven where      there were gardens bright with sinuous rills         where blossomed many an incense bearing tree     and there were forests ancient as the hills         enfolding sunny spots of greenery  i didnt know there was any woods in heaven said mary with a long breath  i thought it was all streetsand streetsand streets  of course there are woods said nan  mother cant live without trees and i cant so what would be the use of going to heaven if there werent any trees  there are cities too said the young dreamer splendid citiescoloured just like the sunset with sapphire towers and rainbow domes  they are built of gold and diamondswhole streets of diamonds flashing like the sun  in the squares there are crystal fountains kissed by the light and everywhere the asphodel bloomsthe flower of heaven  fancy said mary  i saw the main street in charlottetown once and i thought it was real grand but i spose its nothing to heaven  well it all sounds gorgeous the way you tell it but wont it be kind of dull too  oh i guess we can have some fun when the angels backs are turned said faith comfortably  heaven is all fun declared di  the bible doesnt say so cried mary who had read so much of the bible on sunday afternoons under miss cornelias eye that she now considered herself quite an authority on it  mother says the bible language is figurative said nan  does that mean that it isnt true asked mary hopefully  nonot exactlybut i think it means that heaven will be just like what youd like it to be  id like it to be just like rainbow valley said mary with all you kids to gas and play with  thats good enough for me anyhow we cant go to heaven till were dead and maybe not then so whats the use of worrying  heres jem with a string of trout and its my turn to fry them  we ought to know more about heaven than walter does when were the ministers family said una as they walked home that night  we know just as much but walter can imagine said faith mrs elliott says he gets it from his mother  i do wish we hadnt made that mistake about sunday sighed una  dont worry over that  ive thought of a great plan to explain so that everybody will know said faith  just wait till tomorrow night    chapter xii an explanation and a dare  the rev dr cooper preached in glen st mary the next evening and the presbyterian church was crowded with people from near and far  the reverend doctor was reputed to be a very eloquent speaker and bearing in mind the old dictum that a minister should take his best clothes to the city and his best sermons to the country he delivered a very scholarly and impressive discourse  but when the folks went home that night it was not of dr coopers sermon they talked  they had completely forgotten all about it  dr cooper had concluded with a fervent appeal had wiped the perspiration from his massive brow had said let us pray as he was famed for saying it and had duly prayed  there was a slight pause  in glen st mary church the old fashion of taking the collection after the sermon instead of before still heldmainly because the methodists had adopted the new fashion first and miss cornelia and elder clow would not hear of following where methodists had led  charles baxter and thomas douglas whose duty it was to pass the plates were on the point of rising to their feet  the organist had got out the music of her anthem and the choir had cleared its throat  suddenly faith meredith rose in the manse pew walked up to the pulpit platform and faced the amazed audience  miss cornelia half rose in her seat and then sat down again  her pew was far back and it occurred to her that whatever faith meant to do or say would be half done or said before she could reach her  there was no use making the exhibition worse than it had to be  with an anguished glance at mrs dr blythe and another at deacon warren of the methodist church miss cornelia resigned herself to another scandal  if the child was only dressed decently itself she groaned in spirit  faith having spilled ink on her good dress had serenely put on an old one of faded pink print  a caticornered rent in the skirt had been darned with scarlet tracing cotton and the hem had been let down showing a bright strip of unfaded pink around the skirt  but faith was not thinking of her clothes at all  she was feeling suddenly nervous  what had seemed easy in imagination was rather hard in reality  confronted by all those staring questioning eyes faiths courage almost failed her  the lights were so bright the silence so awesome  she thought she could not speak after all  but she musther father must be cleared of suspicion onlythe words would not come  unas little pearlpure face gleamed up at her beseechingly from the manse pew  the blythe children were lost in amazement  back under the gallery faith saw the sweet graciousness of miss rosemary wests smile and the amusement of miss ellens  but none of these helped her  it was bertie shakespeare drew who saved the situation  bertie shakespeare sat in the front seat of the gallery and he made a derisive face at faith  faith promptly made a dreadful one back at him and in her anger over being grimaced at by bertie shakespeare forgot her stage fright  she found her voice and spoke out clearly and bravely  i want to explain something she said and i want to do it now because everybody will hear it that heard the other  people are saying that una and i stayed home last sunday and cleaned house instead of going to sunday school  well we didbut we didnt mean to  we got mixed up in the days of the week  it was all elder baxters faultsensation in baxters pewbecause he went and changed the prayermeeting to wednesday night and then we thought thursday was friday and so on till we thought saturday was sunday  carl was laid up sick and so was aunt martha so they couldnt put us right  we went to sunday school in all that rain on saturday and nobody came  and then we thought wed clean house on monday and stop old cats from talking about how dirty the manse wasgeneral sensation all over the churchand we did  i shook the rugs in the methodist graveyard because it was such a convenient place and not because i meant to be disrespectful of the dead  it isnt the dead folks who have made the fuss over thisits the living folks  and it isnt right for any of you to blame my father for this because he was away and didnt know and anyhow we thought it was monday  hes just the best father that ever lived in the world and we love him with all our hearts  faiths bravado ebbed out in a sob  she ran down the steps and flashed out of the side door of the church  there the friendly starlit summer night comforted her and the ache went out of her eyes and throat  she felt very happy  the dreadful explanation was over and everybody knew now that her father wasnt to blame and that she and una were not so wicked as to have cleaned house knowingly on sunday  inside the church people gazed blankly at each other but thomas douglas rose and walked up the aisle with a set face  his duty was clear the collection must be taken if the skies fell  taken it was the choir sang the anthem with a dismal conviction that it fell terribly flat and dr cooper gave out the concluding hymn and pronounced the benediction with considerably less unction than usual  the reverend doctor had a sense of humour and faiths performance tickled him  besides john meredith was well known in presbyterian circles  mr meredith returned home the next afternoon but before his coming faith contrived to scandalize glen st mary again  in the reaction from sunday evenings intensity and strain she was especially full of what miss cornelia would have called devilment on monday  this led her to dare walter blythe to ride through main street on a pig while she rode another one  the pigs in question were two tall lank animals supposed to belong to bertie shakespeare drews father which had been haunting the roadside by the manse for a couple of weeks  walter did not want to ride a pig through glen st mary but whatever faith meredith dared him to do must be done  they tore down the hill and through the village faith bent double with laughter over her terrified courser walter crimson with shame  they tore past the minister himself just coming home from the station he being a little less dreamy and abstracted than usualowing to having had a talk on the train with miss cornelia who always wakened him up temporarilynoticed them and thought he really must speak to faith about it and tell her that such conduct was not seemly  but he had forgotten the trifling incident by the time he reached home  they passed mrs alec davis who shrieked in horror and they passed miss rosemary west who laughed and sighed  finally just before the pigs swooped into bertie shakespeare drews back yard never to emerge therefrom again so great had been the shock to their nervesfaith and walter jumped off as dr and mrs blythe drove swiftly by  so that is how you bring up your boys said gilbert with mock severity  perhaps i do spoil them a little said anne contritely but oh gilbert when i think of my own childhood before i came to green gables i havent the heart to be very strict  how hungry for love and fun i wasan unloved little drudge with never a chance to play  they do have such good times with the manse children  what about the poor pigs asked gilbert  anne tried to look sober and failed  do you really think it hurt them she said  i dont think anything could hurt those animals  theyve been the plague of the neighbourhood this summer and the drews wont shut them up but ill talk to walterif i can keep from laughing when i do it  miss cornelia came up to ingleside that evening to relieve her feelings over sunday night  to her surprise she found that anne did not view faiths performance in quite the same light as she did  i thought there was something brave and pathetic in her getting up there before that churchful of people to confess she said you could see she was frightened to deathyet she was bound to clear her father  i loved her for it  oh of course the poor child meant well sighed miss cornelia but just the same it was a terrible thing to do and is making more talk than the housecleaning on sunday  that had begun to die away and this has started it all up again  rosemary west is like youshe said last night as she left the church that it was a plucky thing for faith to do but it made her feel sorry for the child too  miss ellen thought it all a good joke and said she hadnt had as much fun in church for years  of course they dont carethey are episcopalians  but we presbyterians feel it  and there were so many hotel people there that night and scores of methodists mrs leander crawford cried she felt so bad  and mrs alec davis said the little hussy ought to be spanked  mrs leander crawford is always crying in church said susan contemptuously  she cries over every affecting thing the minister says  but you do not often see her name on a subscription list mrs dr dear  tears come cheaper  she tried to talk to me one day about aunt martha being such a dirty housekeeper and i wanted to say every one knows that you have been seen mixing up cakes in the kitchen washpan mrs leander crawford  but i did not say it mrs dr dear because i have too much respect for myself to condescend to argue with the likes of her  but i could tell worse things than that of mrs leander crawford if i was disposed to gossip  and as for mrs alec davis if she had said that to me mrs dr dear do you know what i would have said  i would have said i have no doubt you would like to spank faith mrs davis but you will never have the chance to spank a ministers daughter either in this world or in that which is to come  if poor faith had only been decently dressed lamented miss cornelia again it wouldnt have been quite that bad  but that dress looked dreadful as she stood there upon the platform  it was clean though mrs dr dear said susan  they are clean children  they may be very heedless and reckless mrs dr dear and i am not saying they are not but they never forget to wash behind their ears  the idea of faith forgetting what day was sunday persisted miss cornelia  she will grow up just as careless and impractical as her father believe me  i suppose carl would have known better if he hadnt been sick  i dont know what was wrong with him but i think it very likely he had been eating those blueberries that grew in the graveyard  no wonder they made him sick  if i was a methodist id try to keep my graveyard cleaned up at least  i am of the opinion that carl only ate the sours that grow on the dyke said susan hopefully  i do not think any ministers son would eat blueberries that grew on the graves of dead people you know it would not be so bad mrs dr dear to eat things that grew on the dyke  the worst of last nights performance was the face faith made made at somebody in the congregation before she started in said miss cornelia  elder clow declares she made it at him  and did you hear that she was seen riding on a pig today  i saw her  walter was with her  i gave him a littlea very littlescolding about it  he did not say much but he gave me the impression that it had been his idea and that faith was not to blame  i do not not believe that mrs dr dear cried susan up in arms  that is just walters wayto take the blame on himself but you know as well as i do mrs dr dear that that blessed child would never have thought of riding on a pig even if he does write poetry  oh theres no doubt the notion was hatched in faith merediths brain said miss cornelia  and i dont say that im sorry that amos drews old pigs did get their comeuppance for once  but the ministers daughter  and the doctors son said anne mimicking miss cornelias tone  then she laughed  dear miss cornelia theyre only little children  and you know theyve never yet done anything badtheyre just heedless and impulsiveas i was myself once theyll grow sedate and soberas ive done  miss cornelia laughed too  there are times anne dearie when i know by your eyes that your soberness is put on like a garment and youre really aching to do something wild and young again  well i feel encouraged somehow a talk with you always does have that effect on me now when i go to see barbara samson its just the opposite she makes me feel that everythings wrong and always will be but of course living all your life with a man like joe samson wouldnt be exactly cheering  it is a very strange thing to think that she married joe samson after all her chances remarked susan  she was much sought after when she was a girl  she used to boast to me that she had twentyone beaus and mr pethick  what was mr pethick  well he was a sort of hangeron mrs dr dear but you could not exactly call him a beau  he did not really have any intentions  twentyone beausand me that never had one  but barbara went through the woods and picked up the crooked stick after all  and yet they say her husband can make better baking powder biscuits than she can and she always gets him to make them when company comes to tea  which reminds me that i have company coming to tea tomorrow and i must go home and set my bread said miss cornelia  mary said she could set it and no doubt she could  but while i live and move and have my being i set my own bread believe me  how is mary getting on asked anne  ive no fault to find with mary said miss cornelia rather gloomily  shes getting some flesh on her bones and shes clean and respectfulthough theres more in her than i can fathom shes a sly puss  if you dug for a thousand years you couldnt get to the bottom of that childs mind believe me  as for work i never saw anything like her  she eats it up  mrs wiley may have been cruel to her but folks neednt say she made mary work marys a born worker  sometimes i wonder which will wear out firsther legs or her tongue  i dont have enough to do to keep me out of mischief these days  ill be real glad when school opens for then ill have something to do again  mary doesnt want to go to school but i put my foot down and said that go she must  i shall not have the methodists saying that i kept her out of school while i lolled in idleness    chapter xiii the house on the hill  there was a little unfailing spring always icy cold and crystal pure in a certain birchscreened hollow of rainbow valley in the lower corner near the marsh  not a great many people knew of its existence  the manse and ingleside children knew of course as they knew everything else about the magic valley  occasionally they went there to get a drink and it figured in many of their plays as a fountain of old romance  anne knew of it and loved it because it somehow reminded her of the beloved dryads bubble at green gables  rosemary west knew of it it was her fountain of romance too  eighteen years ago she had sat behind it one spring twilight and heard young martin crawford stammer out a confession of fervent boyish love  she had whispered her own secret in return and they had kissed and promised by the wild wood spring  they had never stood together by it againmartin had sailed on his fatal voyage soon after but to rosemary west it was always a sacred spot hallowed by that immortal hour of youth and love  whenever she passed near it she turned aside to hold a secret tryst with an old dreama dream from which the pain had long gone leaving only its unforgettable sweetness  the spring was a hidden thing  you might have passed within ten feet of it and never have suspected its existence  two generations past a huge old pine had fallen almost across it nothing was left of the tree but its crumbling trunk out of which the ferns grew thickly making a green roof and a lacy screen for the water  a mapletree grew beside it with a curiously gnarled and twisted trunk creeping along the ground for a little way before shooting up into the air and so forming a quaint seat and september had flung a scarf of pale smokeblue asters around the hollow  john meredith taking the crosslots road through rainbow valley on his way home from some pastoral visitations around the harbour head one evening turned aside to drink of the little spring walter blythe had shown it to him one afternoon only a few days before and they had had a long talk together on the maple seat john meredith under all his shyness and aloofness had the heart of a boy  he had been called jack in his youth though nobody in glen st mary would ever have believed it  walter and he had taken to each other and had talked unreservedly  mr meredith found his way into some sealed and sacred chambers of the lads soul wherein not even di had ever looked  they were to be chums from that friendly hour and walter knew that he would never be frightened of the minister again  i never believed before that it was possible to get really acquainted with a minister he told his mother that night  john meredith drank from his slender white hand whose grip of steel always surprised people who were unacquainted with it and then sat down on the maple seat  he was in no hurry to go home this was a beautiful spot and he was mentally weary after a round of rather uninspiring conversations with many good and stupid people  the moon was rising  rainbow valley was windhaunted and starsentinelled only where he was but afar from the upper end came the gay notes of childrens laughter and voices  the ethereal beauty of the asters in the moonlight the glimmer of the little spring the soft croon of the brook the wavering grace of the brackens all wove a white magic round john meredith he forgot congregational worries and spiritual problems the years slipped away from him he was a young divinity student again and the roses of june were blooming red and fragrant on the dark queenly head of his cecilia  he sat there and dreamed like any boy  and it was at this propitious moment that rosemary west stepped aside from the bypath and stood beside him in that dangerous spellweaving place  john meredith stood up as she came in and saw herreally saw herfor the first time  he had met her in his church once or twice and shaken hands with her abstractedly as he did with anyone he happened to encounter on his way down the aisle  he had never met her elsewhere for the wests were episcopalians with church affinities in lowbridge and no occasion for calling upon them had ever arisen before tonight if anyone had asked john meredith what rosemary west looked like he would not have had the slightest notion  but he was never to forget her as she appeared to him in the glamour of kind moonlight by the spring  she was certainly not in the least like cecilia who had always been his ideal of womanly beauty  cecilia had been small and dark and vivaciousrosemary west was tall and fair and placid yet john meredith thought he had never seen so beautiful a woman  she was bareheaded and her golden hairhair of a warm gold molasses taffy colour as di blythe had saidwas pinned in sleek close coils over her head she had large tranquil blue eyes that always seemed full of friendliness a high white forehead and a finely shaped face  rosemary west was always called a sweet woman  she was so sweet that even her highbred stately air had never gained for her the reputation of being stuckup which it would inevitably have done in the case of anyone else in glen st mary  life had taught her to be brave to be patient to love to forgive  she had watched the ship on which her lover went sailing out of four winds harbour into the sunset  but though she watched long she had never seen it coming sailing back  that vigil had taken girlhood from her eyes yet she kept her youth to a marvellous degree  perhaps this was because she always seemed to preserve that attitude of delighted surprise towards life which most of us leave behind in childhoodan attitude which not only made rosemary herself seem young but flung a pleasing illusion of youth over the consciousness of every one who talked to her  john meredith was startled by her loveliness and rosemary was startled by his presence  she had never thought she would find anyone by that remote spring least of all the recluse of glen st mary manse  she almost dropped the heavy armful of books she was carrying home from the glen lending library and then to cover her confusion she told one of those small fibs which even the best of women do tell at times  ii came for a drink she said stammering a little in answer to mr merediths grave good evening miss west  she felt that she was an unpardonable goose and she longed to shake herself but john meredith was not a vain man and he knew she would likely have been as much startled had she met old elder clow in that unexpected fashion  her confusion put him at ease and he forgot to be shy besides even the shyest of men can sometimes be quite audacious in moonlight  let me get you a cup he said smiling  there was a cup near by if he had only known it a cracked handleless blue cup secreted under the maple by the rainbow valley children but he did not know it so he stepped out to one of the birchtrees and stripped a bit of its white skin away  deftly he fashioned this into a threecornered cup filled it from the spring and handed it to rosemary  rosemary took it and drank every drop to punish herself for her fib for she was not in the least thirsty and to drink a fairly large cupful of water when you are not thirsty is somewhat of an ordeal  yet the memory of that draught was to be very pleasant to rosemary  in after years it seemed to her that there was something sacramental about it  perhaps this was because of what the minister did when she handed him back the cup  he stooped again and filled it and drank of it himself  it was only by accident that he put his lips just where rosemary had put hers and rosemary knew it  nevertheless it had a curious significance for her  they two had drunk of the same cup  she remembered idly that an old aunt of hers used to say that when two people did this their afterlives would be linked in some fashion whether for good or ill  john meredith held the cup uncertainly  he did not know what to do with it  the logical thing would have been to toss it away but somehow he was disinclined to do this  rosemary held out her hand for it  will you let me have it she said  you made it so knackily i never saw anyone make a birch cup so since my little brother used to make them long agobefore he died  i learned how to make them when i was a boy camping out one summer  an old hunter taught me said mr meredith  let me carry your books miss west  rosemary was startled into another fib and said oh they were not heavy  but the minister took them from her with quite a masterful air and they walked away together  it was the first time rosemary had stood by the valley spring without thinking of martin crawford  the mystic tryst had been broken  the little bypath wound around the marsh and then struck up the long wooded hill on the top of which rosemary lived  beyond through the trees they could see the moonlight shining across the level summer fields  but the little path was shadowy and narrow  trees crowded over it and trees are never quite as friendly to human beings after nightfall as they are in daylight they wrap themselves away from us  they whisper and plot furtively  if they reach out a hand to us it has a hostile tentative touch  people walking amid trees after night always draw closer together instinctively and involuntarily making an alliance physical and mental against certain alien powers around them  rosemarys dress brushed against john meredith as they walked  not even an absentminded minister who was after all a young man still though he firmly believed he had outlived romance could be insensible to the charm of the night and the path and the companion  it is never quite safe to think we have done with life  when we imagine we have finished our story fate has a trick of turning the page and showing us yet another chapter  these two people each thought their hearts belonged irrevocably to the past but they both found their walk up that hill very pleasant  rosemary thought the glen minister was by no means as shy and tonguetied as he had been represented  he seemed to find no difficulty in talking easily and freely  glen housewives would have been amazed had they heard him  but then so many glen housewives talked only gossip and the price of eggs and john meredith was not interested in either  he talked to rosemary of books and music and wideworld doings and something of his own history and found that she could understand and respond  rosemary it appeared possessed a book which mr meredith had not read and wished to read  she offered to lend it to him and when they reached the old homestead on the hill he went in to get it  the house itself was an oldfashioned gray one hung with vines through which the light in the sittingroom winked in friendly fashion  it looked down the glen over the harbour silvered in the moonlight to the sanddunes and the moaning ocean  they walked in through a garden that always seemed to smell of roses even when no roses were in bloom  there was a sisterhood of lilies at the gate and a ribbon of asters on either side of the broad walk and a lacery of fir trees on the hills edge beyond the house  you have the whole world at your doorstep here said john meredith with a long breath  what a viewwhat an outlook  at times i feel stifled down there in the glen  you can breathe up here  it is calm tonight said rosemary laughing  if there were a wind it would blow your breath away  we get a the airts the wind can blow up here  this place should be called four winds instead of the harbour  i like wind he said  a day when there is no wind seems to me dead  a windy day wakes me up  he gave a conscious laugh  on a calm day i fall into day dreams  no doubt you know my reputation miss west  if i cut you dead the next time we meet dont put it down to bad manners  please understand that it is only abstraction and forgive meand speak to me  they found ellen west in the sitting room when they went in  she laid her glasses down on the book she had been reading and looked at them in amazement tinctured with something else  but she shook hands amiably with mr meredith and he sat down and talked to her while rosemary hunted out his book  ellen west was ten years older than rosemary and so different from her that it was hard to believe they were sisters  she was dark and massive with black hair thick black eyebrows and eyes of the clear slaty blue of the gulf water in a north wind  she had a rather stern forbidding look but she was in reality very jolly with a hearty gurgling laugh and a deep mellow pleasant voice with a suggestion of masculinity about it  she had once remarked to rosemary that she would really like to have a talk with that presbyterian minister at the glen to see if he could find a word to say to a woman when he was cornered  she had her chance now and she tackled him on world politics  miss ellen who was a great reader had been devouring a book on the kaiser of germany and she demanded mr merediths opinion of him  a dangerous man was his answer  i believe you miss ellen nodded  mark my words mr meredith that man is going to fight somebody yet  hes aching to  he is going to set the world on fire  if you mean that he will wantonly precipitate a great war i hardly think so said mr meredith  the day has gone by for that sort of thing  bless you it hasnt rumbled ellen  the day never goes by for men and nations to make asses of themselves and take to the fists  the millenniun isnt that near mr meredith and you dont think it is any more than i do  as for this kaiser mark my words he is going to make a heap of troubleand miss ellen prodded her book emphatically with her long finger  yes if he isnt nipped in the bud hes going to make trouble  well live to see ityou and i will live to see it mr meredith  and who is going to nip him  england should but she wont  who is going to nip him  tell me that mr meredith  mr meredith couldnt tell her but they plunged into a discussion of german militarism that lasted long after rosemary had found the book  rosemary said nothing but sat in a little rocker behind ellen and stroked an important black cat meditatively  john meredith hunted big game in europe with ellen but he looked oftener at rosemary than at ellen and ellen noticed it  after rosemary had gone to the door with him and come back ellen rose and looked at her accusingly  rosemary west that man has a notion of courting you  rosemary quivered  ellens speech was like a blow to her  it rubbed all the bloom off the pleasant evening  but she would not let ellen see how it hurt her  nonsense she said and laughed a little too carelessly  you see a beau for me in every bush ellen  why he told me all about his wife tonighthow much she was to himhow empty her death had left the world  well that may be his way of courting retorted ellen  men have all kinds of ways i understand  but dont forget your promise rosemary  there is no need of my either forgetting or remembering it said rosemary a little wearily  you forget that im an old maid ellen  it is only your sisterly delusion that i am still young and blooming and dangerous  mr meredith merely wants to be a friendif he wants that much itself  hell forget us both long before he gets back to the manse  ive no objection to your being friends with him conceded ellen but it musnt go beyond friendship remember  im always suspicious of widowers  they are not given to romantic ideas about friendship  theyre apt to mean business  as for this presbyterian man what do they call him shy for  hes not a bit shy though he may be absentmindedso absentminded that he forgot to say goodnight to me when you started to go to the door with him  hes got brains too  theres so few men round here that can talk sense to a body  ive enjoyed the evening  i wouldnt mind seeing more of him  but no philandering rosemary mind youno philandering  rosemary was quite used to being warned by ellen from philandering if she so much as talked five minutes to any marriageable man under eighty or over eighteen  she had always laughed at the warning with unfeigned amusement  this time it did not amuse herit irritated her a little  who wanted to philander  dont be such a goose ellen she said with unaccustomed shortness as she took her lamp  she went upstairs without saying goodnight  ellen shook her head dubiously and looked at the black cat  what is she so cross about st george she asked  when you howl youre hit ive always heard george  but she promised saintshe promised and we wests always keep our word  so it wont matter if he does want to philander george  she promised i wont worry  upstairs in her room rosemary sat for a long while looking out of the window across the moonlit garden to the distant shining harbour  she felt vaguely upset and unsettled  she was suddenly tired of outworn dreams  and in the garden the petals of the last red rose were scattered by a sudden little wind  summer was overit was autumn    chapter xiv mrs alec davis makes a call  john meredith walked slowly home  at first he thought a little about rosemary but by the time he reached rainbow valley he had forgotten all about her and was meditating on a point regarding german theology which ellen had raised  he passed through rainbow valley and knew it not  the charm of rainbow valley had no potency against german theology  when he reached the manse he went to his study and took down a bulky volume in order to see which had been right he or ellen  he remained immersed in its mazes until dawn struck a new trail of speculation and pursued it like a sleuth hound for the next week utterly lost to the world his parish and his family  he read day and night he forgot to go to his meals when una was not there to drag him to them he never thought about rosemary or ellen again  old mrs marshall overharbour was very ill and sent for him but the message lay unheeded on his desk and gathered dust  mrs marshall recovered but never forgave him  a young couple came to the manse to be married and mr meredith with unbrushed hair in carpet slippers and faded dressing gown married them  to be sure he began by reading the funeral service to them and got along as far as ashes to ashes and dust to dust before he vaguely suspected that something was wrong  dear me he said absently that is strangevery strange  the bride who was very nervous began to cry  the bridegroom who was not in the least nervous giggled  please sir i think youre burying us instead of marrying us he said  excuse me said mr meredith as it it did not matter much  he turned up the marriage service and got through with it but the bride never felt quite properly married for the rest of her life  he forgot his prayermeeting againbut that did not matter for it was a wet night and nobody came  he might even have forgotten his sunday service if it had not been for mrs alec davis  aunt martha came in on saturday afternoon and told him that mrs davis was in the parlour and wanted to see him  mr meredith sighed mrs davis was the only woman in glen st mary church whom he positively detested  unfortunately she was also the richest and his board of managers had warned mr meredith against offending her mr meredith seldom thought of such a worldly matter as his stipend but the managers were more practical also they were astute  without mentioning money they contrived to instil into mr merediths mind a conviction that he should not offend mrs davis  otherwise he would likely have forgotten all about her as soon as aunt martha had gone out  as it was he turned down his ewald with a feeling of annoyance and went across the hall to the parlour  mrs davis was sitting on the sofa looking about her with an air of scornful disapproval  what a scandalous room  there were no curtains on the window mrs davis did not know that faith and una had taken them down the day before to use as court trains in one of their plays and had forgotten to put them up again but she could not have accused those windows more fiercely if she had known  the blinds were cracked and torn  the pictures on the walls were crooked the rugs were awry the vases were full of faded flowers the dust lay in heapsliterally in heaps  what are we coming to mrs davis asked herself and then primmed up her unbeautiful mouth  jerry and carl had been whooping and sliding down the banisters as she came through the hall  they did not see her and continued whooping and sliding and mrs davis was convinced they did it on purpose  faiths pet rooster ambled through the hall stood in the parlour doorway and looked at her  not liking her looks he did not venture in  mrs davis gave a scornful sniff  a pretty manse indeed where roosters paraded the halls and stared people out of countenance  shoo there commanded mrs davis poking her flounced changeablesilk parasol at him  adam shooed  he was a wise rooster and mrs davis had wrung the necks of so many roosters with her own fair hands in the course of her fifty years that an air of the executioner seemed to hang around her  adam scuttled through the hall as the minister came in  mr meredith still wore slippers and dressing gown and his dark hair still fell in uncaredfor locks over his high brow  but he looked the gentleman he was and mrs alec davis in her silk dress and beplumed bonnet and kid gloves and gold chain looked the vulgar coarsesouled woman she was  each felt the antagonisn of the others personality  mr meredith shrank but mrs davis girded up her loins for the fray  she had come to the manse to propose a certain thing to the minister and she meant to lose no time in proposing it  she was going to do him a favour a great favourand the sooner he was made aware of it the better  she had been thinking about it all summer and had come to a decision at last  this was all that mattered mrs davis thought  when she decided a thing it was decided  nobody else had any say in the matter  that had always been her attitude when she had made her mind up to marry alec davis she had married him and that was the end to it  alec had never known how it happened but what odds  so in this casemrs davis had arranged everything to her own satisfaction  now it only remained to inform mr meredith  will you please shut that door said mrs davis unprimming her mouth slightly to say it but speaking with asperity  i have something important to say and i cant say it with that racket in the hall  mr meredith shut the door meekly  then he sat down before mrs davis  he was not wholly aware of her yet  his mind was still wrestling with ewalds arguments  mrs davis sensed this detachment and it annoyed her  i have come to tell you mr meredith she said aggressively that i have decided to adopt una  toadoptuna  mr meredith gazed at her blankly not understanding in the least  yes ive been thinking it over for some time  i have often thought of adopting a child since my husbands death  but it seemed so hard to get a suitable one  it is very few children i would want to take into my home  i wouldnt think of taking a home childsome outcast of the slums in all probability  and there is hardly ever any other child to be got  one of the fishermen down at the harbour died last fall and left six youngsters  they tried to get me to take one but i soon gave them to understand that i had no idea of adopting trash like that  their grandfather stole a horse  besides they were all boys and i wanted a girla quiet obedient girl that i could train up to be a lady  una will suit me exactly  she would be a nice little thing if she was properly looked afterso different from faith  i would never dream of adopting faith  but ill take una and ill give her a good home and upbringing mr meredith and if she behaves herself ill leave her all my money when i die  not one of my own relatives shall have a cent of it in any case im determined on that  it was the idea of aggravating them that set me to thinking of adopting a child as much as anything in the first place  una shall be well dressed and educated and trained mr meredith and i shall give her music and painting lessons and treat her as if she was my own  mr meredith was wide enough awake by this time  there was a faint flush in his pale cheek and a dangerous light in his fine dark eyes  was this woman whose vulgarity and consciousness of money oozed out of her at every pore actually asking him to give her unahis dear little wistful una with cecilias own darkblue eyesthe child whom the dying mother had clasped to her heart after the other children had been led weeping from the room cecilia had clung to her baby until the gates of death had shut between them  she had looked over the little dark head to her husband  take good care of her john she had entreated  she is so smalland sensitive  the others can fight their waybut the world will hurt her  oh john i dont know what you and she are going to do  you both need me so much  but keep her close to youkeep her close to you  these had been almost her last words except a few unforgettable ones for him alone  and it was this child whom mrs davis had coolly announced her intention of taking from him  he sat up straight and looked at mrs davis  in spite of the worn dressing gown and the frayed slippers there was something about him that made mrs davis feel a little of the old reverence for the cloth in which she had been brought up  after all there was a certain divinity hedging a minister even a poor unworldly abstracted one  i thank you for your kind intentions mrs davis said mr meredith with a gentle final quite awful courtesy but i cannot give you my child  mrs davis looked blank  she had never dreamed of his refusing  why mr meredith she said in astonishment  you must be cryou cant mean it  you must think it overthink of all the advantages i can give her  there is no need to think it over mrs davis  it is entirely out of the question  all the worldly advantages it is in your power to bestow on her could not compensate for the loss of a fathers love and care  i thank you againbut it is not to be thought of  disappointment angered mrs davis beyond the power of old habit to control  her broad red face turned purple and her voice trembled  i thought youd be only too glad to let me have her she sneered  why did you think that asked mr meredith quietly  because nobody ever supposed you cared anything about any of your children retorted mrs davis contemptuously  you neglect them scandalously  it is the talk of the place  they arent fed and dressed properly and theyre not trained at all  they have no more manners than a pack of wild indians  you never think of doing your duty as a father  you let a stray child come here among them for a fortnight and never took any notice of hera child that swore like a trooper im told  you wouldnt have cared if theyd caught smallpox from her  and faith made an exhibition of herself getting up in preaching and making that speech  and she rid a pig down the streetunder your very eyes i understand  the way they act is past belief and you never lift a finger to stop them or try to teach them anything  and now when i offer one of them a good home and good prospects you refuse it and insult me  a pretty father you to talk of loving and caring for your children  that will do woman said mr meredith  he stood up and looked at mrs davis with eyes that made her quail  that will do he repeated  i desire to hear no more mrs davis  you have said too much  it may be that i have been remiss in some respects in my duty as a parent but it is not for you to remind me of it in such terms as you have used  let us say good afternoon  mrs davis did not say anything half so amiable as good afternoon but she took her departure  as she swept past the minister a large plump toad which carl had secreted under the lounge hopped out almost under her feet  mrs davis gave a shriek and in trying to avoid treading on the awful thing lost her balance and her parasol  she did not exactly fall but she staggered and reeled across the room in a very undignified fashion and brought up against the door with a thud that jarred her from head to foot  mr meredith who had not seen the toad wondered if she had been attacked with some kind of apoplectic or paralytic seizure and ran in alarm to her assistance  but mrs davis recovering her feet waved him back furiously  dont you dare to touch me she almost shouted  this is some more of your childrens doings i suppose  this is no fit place for a decent woman  give me my umbrella and let me go  ill never darken the doors of your manse or your church again  mr meredith picked up the gorgeous parasol meekly enough and gave it to her  mrs davis seized it and marched out  jerry and carl had given up banister sliding and were sitting on the edge of the veranda with faith  unfortunately all three were singing at the tops of their healthy young voices therell be a hot time in the old town tonight  mrs davis believed the song was meant for her and her only  she stopped and shook her parasol at them  your father is a fool she said and you are three young varmints that ought to be whipped within an inch of your lives  he isnt cried faith  were not cried the boys  but mrs davis was gone  goodness isnt she mad said jerry  and what is a varmint anyhow  john meredith paced up and down the parlour for a few minutes then he went back to his study and sat down  but he did not return to his german theology  he was too grievously disturbed for that  mrs davis had wakened him up with a vengeance  was he such a remiss careless father as she had accused him of being  had he so scandalously neglected the bodily and spiritual welfare of the four little motherless creatures dependent on him were his people talking of it as harshly as mrs davis had declared  it must be so since mrs davis had come to ask for una in the full and confident belief that he would hand the child over to her as unconcernedly and gladly as one might hand over a strayed unwelcome kitten  and if so what then  john meredith groaned and resumed his pacing up and down the dusty disordered room  what could he do  he loved his children as deeply as any father could and he knew past the power of mrs davis or any of her ilk to disturb his conviction that they loved him devotedly  but was he fit to have charge of them  he knewnone betterhis weaknesses and limitations  what was needed was a good womans presence and influence and common sense  but how could that be arranged  even were he able to get such a housekeeper it would cut aunt martha to the quick  she believed she could still do all that was meet and necessary  he could not so hurt and insult the poor old woman who had been so kind to him and his  how devoted she had been to cecilia  and cecilia had asked him to be very considerate of aunt martha  to be sure he suddenly remembered that aunt martha had once hinted that he ought to marry again  he felt she would not resent a wife as she would a housekeeper  but that was out of the question  he did not wish to marryhe did not and could not care for anyone  then what could he do  it suddenly occurred to him that he would go over to ingleside and talk over his difficulties with mrs blythe  mrs blythe was one of the few women he never felt shy or tonguetied with  she was always so sympathetic and refreshing  it might be that she could suggest some solution of his problems  and even if she could not mr meredith felt that he needed a little decent human companionship after his dose of mrs davissomething to take the taste of her out of his soul  he dressed hurriedly and ate his supper less abstractedly than usual  it occurred to him that it was a poor meal  he looked at his children they were rosy and healthy looking enoughexcept una and she had never been very strong even when her mother was alive  they were all laughing and talkingcertainly they seemed happy  carl was especially happy because he had two most beautiful spiders crawling around his supper plate  their voices were pleasant their manners did not seem bad they were considerate of and gentle to one another  yet mrs davis had said their behaviour was the talk of the congregation  as mr meredith went through his gate dr blythe and mrs blythe drove past on the road that led to lowbridge  the ministers face fell  mrs blythe was going awaythere was no use in going to ingleside  and he craved a little companionship more than ever  as he gazed rather hopelessly over the landscape the sunset light struck on a window of the old west homestead on the hill  it flared out rosily like a beacon of good hope  he suddenly remembered rosemary and ellen west  he thought that he would relish some of ellens pungent conversation  he thought it would be pleasant to see rosemarys slow sweet smile and calm heavenly blue eyes again  what did that old poem of sir philip sidneys saycontinual comfort in a facethat just suited her  and he needed comfort  why not go and call  he remembered that ellen had asked him to drop in sometimes and there was rosemarys book to take backhe ought to take it back before he forgot  he had an uneasy suspicion that there were a great many books in his library which he had borrowed at sundry times and in divers places and had forgotten to take back  it was surely his duty to guard against that in this case  he went back into his study got the book and plunged downward into rainbow valley    chapter xv more gossip  on the evening after mrs myra murray of the overharbour section had been buried miss cornelia and mary vance came up to ingleside  there were several things concerning which miss cornelia wished to unburden her soul  the funeral had to be all talked over of course  susan and miss cornelia thrashed this out between them anne took no part or delight in such goulish conversations  she sat a little apart and watched the autumnal flame of dahlias in the garden and the dreaming glamorous harbour of the september sunset  mary vance sat beside her knitting meekly  marys heart was down in the rainbow valley whence came sweet distancesoftened sounds of childrens laughter but her fingers were under miss cornelias eye  she had to knit so many rounds of her stocking before she might go to the valley  mary knit and held her tongue but used her ears  i never saw a nicer looking corpse said miss cornelia judicially  myra murray was always a pretty womanshe was a corey from lowbridge and the coreys were noted for their good looks  i said to the corpse as i passed it poor woman  i hope you are as happy as you look sighed susan  she had not changed much  that dress she wore was the black satin she got for her daughters wedding fourteen years ago  her aunt told her then to keep it for her funeral but myra laughed and said i may wear it to my funeral aunty but i will have a good time out of it first  and i may say she did  myra murray was not a woman to attend her own funeral before she died  many a time afterwards when i saw her enjoying herself out in company i thought to myself you are a handsome woman myra murray and that dress becomes you but it will likely be your shroud at last  and you see my words have come true mrs marshall elliott  susan sighed again heavily  she was enjoying herself hugely  a funeral was really a delightful subject of conversation  i always liked to meet myra said miss cornelia  she was always so gay and cheerfulshe made you feel better just by her handshake  myra always made the best of things  that is true asserted susan  her sisterinlaw told me that when the doctor told her at last that he could do nothing for her and she would never rise from that bed again myra said quite cheerfully well if that is so im thankful the preserving is all done and i will not have to face the fall housecleaning  i always liked housecleaning in spring she says but i always hated it in the fall  i will get clear of it this year thank goodness  there are people who would call that levity mrs marshall elliott and i think her sisterinlaw was a little ashamed of it  she said perhaps her sickness had made myra a little lightheaded  but i said no mrs murray do not worry over it  it was just myras way of looking at the bright side  her sister luella was just the opposite said miss cornelia there was no bright side for luellathere was just black and shades of gray  for years she used always to be declaring she was going to die in a week or so  i wont be here to burden you long she would tell her family with a groan  and if any of them ventured to talk about their little future plans shed groan also and say ah i wont be here then  when i went to see her i always agreed with her and it made her so mad that she was always quite a lot better for several days afterwards  she has better health now but no more cheerfulness  myra was so different  she was always doing or saying something to make some one feel good  perhaps the men they married had something to do with it  luellas man was a tartar believe me while jim murray was decent as men go  he looked heartbroken today  it isnt often i feel sorry for a man at his wifes funeral but i did feel for jim murray  no wonder he looked sad  he will not get a wife like myra again in a hurry said susan  maybe he will not try since his children are all grown up and mirabel is able to keep house  but there is no predicting what a widower may or may not do and i for one will not try  well miss myra terrible in church said miss cornelia  she was such a worker  nothing ever stumped her  if she couldnt get over a difficulty shed get around it and if she couldnt get around it shed pretend it wasnt thereand generally it wasnt  ill keep a stiff upper lip to my journeys end said she to me once  well she has ended her journey  do you think so asked anne suddenly coming back from dreamland  i cant picture her journey as being ended  can you think of her sitting down and folding her handsthat eager asking spirit of hers with its fine adventurous outlook  no i think in death she just opened a gate and went throughonon to new shining adventures  maybemaybe assented miss cornelia  do you know anne dearie i never was much taken with this everlasting rest doctrine myselfthough i hope it isnt heresy to say so  i want to bustle round in heaven the same as here  and i hope therell be a celestial substitute for pies and doughnutssomething that has to be made  of course one does get awful tired at timesand the older you are the tireder you get  but the very tiredest could get rested in something short of eternity youd thinkexcept perhaps a lazy man  when i meet myra murray again said anne i want to see her coming towards me brisk and laughing just as she always did here  oh mrs dr dear said susan in a shocked tone you surely do not think that myra will be laughing in the world to come  why not susan  do you think we will be crying there  no no mrs dr dear do not misunderstand me  i do not think we shall be either crying or laughing  what then  well said susan driven to it  it is my opinion mrs dr dear that we shall just look solemn and holy  and do you really think susan said anne looking solemn enough that either myra murray or i could look solemn and holy all the timeall the time susan  well admitted susan reluctantly i might go so far as to say that you both would have to smile now and again but i can never admit that there will be laughing in heaven  the idea seems really irreverent mrs dr dear  well to come back to earth said miss cornelia who can we get to take myras class in sunday school  julia clow has been teaching it since myra took ill but shes going to town for the winter and well have to get somebody else  i heard that mrs laurie jamieson wanted it said anne  the jamiesons have come to church very regularly since they moved to the glen from lowbridge  new brooms said miss cornelia dubiously  wait till theyve gone regularly for a year  you cannot depend on mrs jamieson a bit mrs dr dear said susan solemnly  she died once and when they were measuring her for her coffin after laying her out just beautiful did she not go and come back to life  now mrs dr dear you know you cannot depend on a woman like that  she might turn methodist at any moment said miss cornelia they tell me they went to the methodist church at lowbridge quite as often as to the presbyterian  i havent caught them at it here yet but i would not approve of taking mrs jamieson into the sunday school  yet we must not offend them  we are losing too many people by death or bad temper  mrs alec davis has left the church no one knows why  she told the managers that she would never pay another cent to mr merediths salary  of course most people say that the children offended her but somehow i dont think so  i tried to pump faith but all i could get out of her was that mrs davis had come seemingly in high good humour to see her father and had left in an awful rage calling them all varmints  varmints indeed said susan furiously  does mrs alec davis forget that her uncle on her mothers side was suspected of poisoning his wife  not that it was ever proved mrs dr dear and it does not do to believe all you hear  but if i had an uncle whose wife died without any satisfactory reason i would not go about the country calling innocent children varmints  the point is said miss cornelia that mrs davis paid a large subscription and how its loss is going to be made up is a problem  and if she turns the other douglases against mr meredith as she will certainly try to do he will just have to go  i do not think mrs alec davis is very well liked by the rest of the clan said susan  it is not likely she will be able to influence them  but those douglases all hang together so  if you touch one you touch all  we cant do without them so much is certain  they pay half the salary  they are not mean whatever else may be said of them  norman douglas used to give a hundred a year long ago before he left  what did he leave for asked anne  he declared a member of the session cheated him in a cow deal he hasnt come to church for twenty years  his wife used to come regular while she was alive poor thing but he never would let her pay anything except one red cent every sunday  she felt dreadfully humiliated  i dont know that he was any too good a husband to her though she was never heard to complain  but she always had a cowed look  norman douglas didnt get the woman he wanted thirty years ago and the douglases never liked to put up with second best  who was the woman he did want  ellen west  they werent engaged exactly i believe but they went about together for two years  and then they just broke offnobody ever know why  just some silly quarrel i suppose and norman went and married hester reese before his temper had time to coolmarried her just to spite ellen i havent a doubt so like a man  hester was a nice little thing but she never had much spirit and he broke what little she had  she was too meek for norman  he needed a woman who could stand up to him  ellen would have kept him in fine order and he would have liked her all the better for it  he despised hester that is the truth just because she always gave in to him  i used to hear him say many a time long ago when he was a young fellow give me a spunky womanspunk for me every time  and then he went and married a girl who couldnt say boo to a goosemanlike  that family of reeses were just vegetables  they went through the motions of living but they didnt live  russell reese used his first wifes weddingring to marry his second said susan reminiscently  that was too economical in my opinion mrs dr dear  and his brother john has his own tombstone put up in the overharbour graveyard with everything on it but the date of death and he goes and looks at it every sunday  most folks would not consider that much fun but it is plain he does  people do have such different ideas of enjoyment as for norman douglas he is a perfect heathen  when the last minister asked him why he never went to church he said too many ugly women there parsontoo many ugly women  i should like to go to such a man mrs dr dear and say to him solemnly there is a hell  oh norman doesnt believe there is such a place said miss cornelia  i hope hell find out his mistake when he comes to die  there mary youve knit your three inches and you can go and play with the children for half an hour  mary needed no second bidding  she flew to rainbow valley with a heart as light as her heels and in the course of conversation told faith meredith all about mrs alec davis  and mrs elliott says that shell turn all the douglases against your father and then hell have to leave the glen because his salary wont be paid concluded mary  i dont know what is to be done honest to goodness  if only old norman douglas would come back to church and pay it wouldnt be so bad  but he wontand the douglases will leaveand you all will have to go  faith carried a heavy heart to bed with her that night  the thought of leaving the glen was unbearable  nowhere else in the world were there such chums as the blythes  her little heart had been wrung when they had left maywatershe had shed many bitter tears when she parted with maywater chums and the old manse there where her mother had lived and died  she could not contemplate calmly the thought of such another and harder wrench  she couldnt leave glen st mary and dear rainbow valley and that delicious graveyard  its awful to be ministers family groaned faith into her pillow  just as soon as you get fond of a place you are torn up by the roots  ill never never never marry a minister no matter how nice he is  faith sat up in bed and looked out of the little vinehung window  the night was very still the silence broken only by unas soft breathing  faith felt terribly alone in the world she could see glen st mary lying under the starry blue meadows of the autumn night  over the valley a light shone from the girls room at ingleside and another from walters room  faith wondered if poor walter had toothache again  then she sighed with a little passing sigh of envy of nan and di  they had a mother and a settled homethey were not at the mercy of people who got angry without any reason and called you a varmint  away beyond the glen amid fields that were very quiet with sleep another light was burning  faith knew it shone in the house where norman douglas lived  he was reputed to sit up all hours of the night reading  mary had said if he could only be induced to return to the church all would be well  and why not  faith looked at a big low star hanging over the tall pointed spruce at the gate of the methodist church and had an inspiration  she knew what ought to be done and she faith meredith would do it she would make everything right  with a sigh of satisfaction she turned from the lonely dark world and cuddled down beside una    chapter xvi tit for tat  with faith to decide was to act  she lost no time in carrying out the idea  as soon as she came home from school the next day she left the manse and made her way down the glen  walter blythe joined her as she passed the post office  im going to mrs elliotts on an errand for mother he said where are you going faith  i am going somewhere on church business said faith loftily she did not volunteer any further information and walter felt rather snubbed  they walked on in silence for a little while it was a warm windy evening with a sweet resinous air  beyond the sand dunes were gray seas soft and beautiful  the glen brook bore down a freight of gold and crimson leaves like fairy shallops  in mr james reeses buckwheat stubbleland with its beautiful tones of red and brown a crow parliament was being held whereat solemn deliberations regarding the welfare of crowland were in progress  faith cruelly broke up the august assembly by climbing up on the fence and hurling a broken rail at it  instantly the air was filled with flapping black wings and indignant caws  why did you do that said walter reproachfully  they were having such a good time  oh i hate crows said faith airily  the are so black and sly i feel sure theyre hypocrites  they steal little birds eggs out of their nests you know  i saw one do it on our lawn last spring  walter what makes you so pale today  did you have the toothache again last night  walter shivered  yesa raging one  i couldnt sleep a winkso i just paced up and down the floor and imagined i was an early christian martyr being tortured at the command of nero  that helped ever so much for a whileand then i got so bad i couldnt imagine anything  did you cry asked faith anxiously  nobut i lay down on the floor and groaned admitted walter then the girls came in and nan put cayenne pepper in itand that made it worsedi made me hold a swallow of cold water in my mouthand i couldnt stand it so they called susan  susan said it served me right for sitting up in the cold garret yesterday writing poetry trash  but she started up the kitchen fire and got me a hotwater bottle and it stopped the toothache  as soon as i felt better i told susan my poetry wasnt trash and she wasnt any judge  and she said no thank goodness she was not and she did not know anything about poetry except that it was mostly a lot of lies  now you know faith that isnt so  that is one reason why i like writing poetryyou can say so many things in it that are true in poetry but wouldnt be true in prose  i told susan so but she said to stop my jawing and go to sleep before the water got cold or shed leave me to see if rhyming would cure toothache and she hoped it would be a lesson to me  why dont you go to the dentist at lowbridge and get the tooth out  walter shivered again  they want me tobut i cant  it would hurt so  are you afraid of a little pain asked faith contemptuously  walter flushed  it would be a big pain  i hate being hurt  father said he wouldnt insist on my goinghed wait until id made up my own mind to go  it wouldnt hurt as long as the toothache argued faith youve had five spells of toothache  if youd just go and have it out thered be no more bad nights  i had a tooth out once i yelled for a moment but it was all over thenonly the bleeding  the bleeding is worst of allits so ugly cried walter  it just made me sick when jem cut his foot last summer  susan said i looked more like fainting than jem did  but i couldnt hear to see jem hurt either  somebody is always getting hurt faith and its awful  i just cant bear to see things hurt  it makes me just want to runand runand runtill i cant hear or see them  theres no use making a fuss over anyone getting hurt said faith tossing her curls  of course if youve hurt yourself very bad you have to yelland blood is messyand i dont like seeing other people hurt either  but i dont want to runi want to go to work and help them  your father has to hurt people lots of times to cure them  what would they do if he ran away  i didnt say i would run  i said i wanted to run  thats a different thing  i want to help people too  but oh i wish there werent any ugly dreadful things in the world  i wish everything was glad and beautiful  well dont lets think of what isnt said faith  after all theres lots of fun in being alive  you wouldnt have toothache if you were dead but still wouldnt you lots rather be alive than dead  i would a hundred times  oh heres dan reese hes been down to the harbour for fish  i hate dan reese said walter  so do i  all us girls do  im just going to walk past and never take the least notice of him  you watch me  faith accordingly stalked past dan with her chin out and an expression of scorn that bit into his soul  he turned and shouted after her  piggirl  piggirl  piggirl in a crescendo of insult  faith walked on seemingly oblivious  but her lip trembled slightly with a sense of outrage  she knew she was no match for dan reese when it came to an exchange of epithets  she wished jem blythe had been with her instead of walter  if dan reese had dared to call her a piggirl in jems hearing jem would have wiped up the dust with him  but it never occurred to faith to expect walter to do it or blame him for not doing it  walter she knew never fought other boys  neither did charlie clow of the north road  the strange part was that while she despised charlie for a coward it never occurred to her to disdain walter it was simply that he seemed to her an inhabitant of a world of his own where different traditions prevailed  faith would as soon have expected a starryeyed young angel to pummel dirty freckled dan reese for her as walter blythe  she would not have blamed the angel and she did not blame walter blythe  but she wished that sturdy jem or jerry had been there and dans insult continued to rankle in her soul  walter was pale no longer  he had flushed crimson and his beautiful eyes were clouded with shame and anger  he knew that he ought to have avenged faith  jem would have sailed right in and made dan eat his words with bitter sauce  ritchie warren would have overwhelmed dan with worse names than dan had called faith  but walter could notsimply could notcall names  he knew he would get the worst of it he could never conceive or utter the vulgar ribald insults of which dan reese had unlimited command  and as for the trial by fist walter couldnt fight he hated the idea  it was rough and painfuland worst of all it was ugly  he never could understand jems exultation in an occasional conflict  but he wished he could fight dan reese  he was horribly ashamed because faith meredith had been insulted in his presence and he had not tried to punish her insulter   he felt sure she must despise him  she had not even spoken to him since dan had called her piggirl  he was glad when they came to the parting of the ways  faith too was relieved though for a different reason  she wanted to be alone because she suddenly felt rather nervous about her errand  impulse had cooled especially since dan had bruised her selfrespect  she must go through with it but she no longer had enthusiasm to sustain her  she was going to see norman douglas and ask him to come back to church and she began to be afraid of him  what had seemed so easy and simple up at the glen seemed very different down here  she had heard a good deal about norman douglas and she knew that even the biggest boys in school were afraid of him  suppose he called her something nastyshe had heard he was given to that  faith could not endure being called namesthey subdued her far more quickly than a physical blow  but she would go onfaith meredith always went on  if she did not her father might have to leave the glen  at the end of the long lane faith came to the housea big oldfashioned one with a row of soldierly lombardies marching past it  on the back veranda norman douglas himself was sitting reading a newspaper  his big dog was beside him  behind in the kitchen where his housekeeper mrs wilson was getting supper there was a clatter of dishesan angry clatter for norman douglas had just had a quarrel with mrs wilson and both were in a very bad temper over it  consequently when faith stepped on the veranda and norman douglas lowered his newspaper she found herself looking into the choleric eyes of an irritated man  norman douglas was rather a finelooking personage in his way he had a sweep of long red beard over his broad chest and a mane of red hair ungrizzled by the years on his massive head  his high white forehead was unwrinkled and his blue eyes could flash still with all the fire of his tempestuous youth  he could be very amiable when he liked and he could be very terrible  poor faith so anxiously bent on retrieving the situation in regard to the church had caught him in one of his terrible moods  he did not know who she was and he gazed at her with disfavour norman douglas liked girls of spirit and flame and laughter  at this moment faith was very pale  she was of the type to which colour means everything  lacking her crimson cheeks she seemed meek and even insignificant  she looked apologetic and afraid and the bully in norman douglass heart stirred  who the dickens are you  and what do you want here he demanded in his great resounding voice with a fierce scowl  for once in her life faith had nothing to say  she had never supposed norman douglas was like this  she was paralyzed with terror of him  he saw it and it made him worse  whats the matter with you he boomed  you look as if you wanted to say something and was scared to say it  whats troubling you  confound it speak up cant you  no  faith could not speak up  no words would come  but her lips began to tremble  for heavens sake dont cry shouted norman  i cant stand snivelling  if youve anything to say say it and have done great kitty is the girl possessed of a dumb spirit  dont look at me like thatim humani havent got a tail  who are youwho are you i say  normans voice could have been heard at the harbour  operations in the kitchen were suspended  mrs wilson was listening openeared and eyed  norman put his huge brown hands on his knees and leaned forward staring into faiths pallid shrinking face  he seemed to loom over her like some evil giant out of a fairy tale  she felt as if he would eat her up next thing body and bones  iamfaithmeredith she said in little more than a whisper  meredith hey  one of the parsons youngsters hey  ive heard of youive heard of you  riding on pigs and breaking the sabbath  a nice lot  what do you want here hey  what do you want of the old pagan hey  i dont ask favours of parsonsand i dont give any  what do you want i say  faith wished herself a thousand miles away  she stammered out her thought in its naked simplicity  i cameto ask youto go to churchand payto the salary  norman glared at her  then he burst forth again  you impudent hussyyou  who put you up to it jade  who put you up to it  nobody said poor faith  thats a lie  dont lie to me  who sent you here  it wasnt your fatherhe hasnt the smeddum of a fleabut he wouldnt send you to do what he dassnt do himself  i suppose it was some of them confounded old maids at the glen was itwas it hey  noii just came myself  do you take me for a fool shouted norman  noi thought you were a gentleman said faith faintly and certainly without any thought of being sarcastic  norman bounced up  mind your own business  i dont want to hear another word from you  if you wasnt such a kid id teach you to interfere in what doesnt concern you  when i want parsons or pilldosers ill send for them  till i do ill have no truck with them  do you understand  now get out cheeseface  faith got out  she stumbled blindly down the steps out of the yard gate and into the lane  half way up the lane her daze of fear passed away and a reaction of tingling anger possessed her by the time she reached the end of the lane she was in such a furious temper as she had never experienced before  norman douglas insults burned in her soul kindling a scorching flame go home  not she  she would go straight back and tell that old ogre just what she thought of himshe would show himoh wouldnt she  cheeseface indeed  unhesitatingly she turned and walked back  the veranda was deserted and the kitchen door shut  faith opened the door without knocking and went in  norman douglas had just sat down at the supper table but he still held his newspaper  faith walked inflexibly across the room caught the paper from his hand flung it on the floor and stamped on it  then she faced him with her flashing eyes and scarlet cheeks  she was such a handsome young fury that norman douglas hardly recognized her  whats brought you back he growled but more in bewilderment than rage  unquailingly she glared back into the angry eyes against which so few people could hold their own  i have come back to tell you exactly what i think of you said faith in clear ringing tones  i am not afraid of you  you are a rude unjust tyrannical disagreeable old man  susan says you are sure to go to hell and i was sorry for you but i am not now  your wife never had a new hat for ten yearsno wonder she died  i am going to make faces at you whenever i see you after this  every time i am behind you you will know what is happening  father has a picture of the devil in a book in his study and i mean to go home and write your name under it  you are an old vampire and i hope youll have the scotch fiddle  faith did not know what a vampire meant any more than she knew what the scotch fiddle was  she had heard susan use the expressions and gathered from her tone that both were dire things  but norman douglas knew what the latter meant at least he had listened in absolute silence to faiths tirade  when she paused for breath with a stamp of her foot he suddenly burst into loud laughter  with a mighty slap of hand on knee he exclaimed  i vow youve got spunk after alli like spunk  come sit downsit down  i will not  faiths eyes flashed more passionately  she thought she was being made fun oftreated contemptuously  she would have enjoyed another explosion of rage but this cut deep i will not sit down in your house  i am going home  but i am glad i came back here and told you exactly what my opinion of you is  so am iso am i chuckled norman  i like youyoure fineyoure great  such rosessuch vim  did i call her

faith haughtily  oh yes you will  come come now i apologize girli apologize  i made a fool of myself and im sorry  man cant say fairer  forget and forgive  shake hands girlshake hands she wontno she

her jaw  im the only one in the clan can do it  is it a bargain girl  it seemed a bargain  faith found herself shaking hands with the ogre and then sitting at his board  her temper was overfaiths tempers never lasted very longbut its excitement still sparkled in her eyes and crimsoned her cheeks  norman douglas looked at her admiringly  go get some of your best preserves wilson he ordered and stop sulking woman stop sulking  what if we did have a quarrel woman  a good squall clears the air and briskens things up  but no drizzling and fogging afterwardsno drizzling and fogging woman  i cant stand that  temper in a woman but no tears for me  here girl is some messed up meat and potatoes for you  begin on that  wilson has some fancy name for it but i call lit macanaccady  anything i cant analyze in the eating line i call macanaccady and anything wet that puzzles me i call shallamagouslem  wilsons tea is shallamagouslem  i swear she makes it out of burdocks  dont take any of the ungodly black liquidheres some milk for you  what did you say your name was  faith  no name thatno name that  i cant stomach such a name  got any other  no sir  dont like the name dont like it  theres no smeddum to it besides it makes me think of my aunt jinny  she called her three girls faith hope and charity  faith didnt believe in anythinghope was a born pessimistand charity was a miser you ought to be called red roseyou look like one when youre mad  ill call you red rose  and youve roped me into promising to go to church  but only once a month rememberonly once a month  come now girl will you let me off  i used to pay a hundred to the salary every year and go to church  if i promise to pay two hundred a year will you let me off going to church come now  no no sir said faith dimpling roguishly  i want you to go to church too  well a bargain is a bargain  i reckon i can stand it twelve times a year  what a sensation itll make the first sunday i go and old susan baker says im going to hell hey  do you believe ill go therecome now do you  i hope not sir stammered faith in some confusion  why do you hope not  come now why do you hope not  give us a reason girlgive us a reason  itit must be a veryuncomfortable place sir  uncomfortable  all depends on your taste in comfortable girl id soon get tired of angels  fancy old susan in a halo now  faith did fancy it and it tickled her so much that she had to laugh  norman eyed her approvingly  see the fun of it hey  oh i like youyoure great  about this church business nowcan your father preach  he is a splendid preacher said loyal faith  he is hey  ill seeill watch out for flaws  hed better be careful what he says before me  ill catch himill trip him upill keep tabs on his arguments  im bound to have some fun out of this church going business  does he ever preach hell  noooi dont think so  too bad  i like sermons on that subject  you tell him that if he wants to keep me in good humour to preach a good riproaring sermon on hell once every six monthsand the more brimstone the better  i like em smoking  and think of all the pleasure hed give the old maids too  theyd all keep looking at old norman douglas and thinking thats for you you old reprobate  thats whats in store for you  ill give an extra ten dollars every time you get your father to preach on hell  heres wilson and the jam  like that hey  it isnt macanaccady  taste  faith obediently swallowed the big spoonful norman held out to her  luckily it was good  best plum jam in the world said norman filling a large saucer and plumping it down before her  glad you like it  ill give you a couple of jars to take home with you  theres nothing mean about menever was  the devil cant catch me at that corner anyhow  it wasnt my fault that hester didnt have a new hat for ten years  it was her ownshe pinched on hats to save money to give yellow fellows over in china  i never gave a cent to missions in my lifenever will  never you try to bamboozle me into that  a hundred a year to the salary and church once a monthbut no spoiling good heathens to make poor christians why girl they wouldnt be fit for heaven or hellclean spoiled for either placeclean spoiled  hey wilson havent you got a smile on yet  beats all how you women can sulk  i never sulked in my lifeits just one big flash and crash with me and thenpoufthe squalls over and the sun is out and you could eat out of my hand  norman insisted on driving faith home after supper and he filled the buggy up with apples cabbages potatoes and pumpkins and jars of jam  theres a nice little tompussy out in the barn  ill give you that too if youd like it  say the word he said  no thank you said faith decidedly  i dont like cats and besides i have a rooster  listen to her  you cant cuddle a rooster as you can a kitten who ever heard of petting a rooster  better take little tom  i want to find a good home for him  no  aunt martha has a cat and he would kill a strange kitten  norman yielded the point rather reluctantly  he gave faith an exciting drive home behind his wild twoyear old and when he had let her out at the kitchen door of the manse and dumped his cargo on the back veranda he drove away shouting  its only once a monthonly once a month mind  faith went up to bed feeling a little dizzy and breathless as if she had just escaped from the grasp of a genial whirlwind she was happy and thankful  no fear now that they would have to leave the glen and the graveyard and rainbow valley  but she fell asleep troubled by a disagreeable subconsciousness that dan reese had called her piggirl and that having stumbled on such a congenial epithet he would continue to call her so whenever opportunity offered    chapter xvii a double victory  norman douglas came to church the first sunday in november and made all the sensation he desired  mr meredith shook hands with him absently on the church steps and hoped dreamily that mrs douglas was well  she wasnt very well just before i buried her ten years ago but i reckon she has better health now boomed norman to the horror and amusement of every one except mr meredith who was absorbed in wondering if he had made the last head of his sermon as clear as he might have and hadnt the least idea what norman had said to him or he to norman  norman intercepted faith at the gate  kept my word you seekept my word red rose  im free now till the first sunday in december  fine sermon girlfine sermon  your father has more in his head than he carries on his face  but he contradicted himself oncetell him he contradicted himself  and tell him i want that brimstone sermon in december great way to wind up the old yearwith a taste of hell you know  and whats the matter with a nice tasty discourse on heaven for new years  though it wouldnt be half as interesting as hell girlnot half  only id like to know what your father thinks about heavenhe can thinkrarest thing in the worlda person who can think  but he did contradict himself  ha ha heres a question you might ask him sometime when hes awake girl  can god make a stone so big he couldnt lift it himself dont forget now  i want to hear his opinion on it  ive stumped many a minister with that girl  faith was glad to escape him and run home dan reese standing among the crowd of boys at the gate  looked at her and shaped his mouth into piggirl but dared not utter it aloud just there  next day in school was a different matter  at noon recess faith encountered dan in the little spruce plantation behind the school and dan shouted once more  piggirl  piggirl  roostergirl  walter blythe suddenly rose from a mossy cushion behind a little clump of firs where he had been reading  he was very pale but his eyes blazed  you hold your tongue dan reese he said  oh hello miss walter retorted dan not at all abashed  he vaulted airily to the top of the rail fence and chanted insultingly      cowardy cowardycustard     stole a pot of mustard     cowardy cowardycustard  you are a coincidence said walter scornfully turning still whiter  he had only a very hazy idea what a coincidence was but dan had none at all and thought it must be something peculiarly opprobrious  yah cowardy he yelled gain  your mother writes lieslies lies  and faith meredith is a piggirlapiggirla piggirl and shes a roostergirla roostergirla roostergirl  yah cowardycowardycust  dan got no further  walter had hurled himself across the intervening space and knocked dan off the fence backward with one welldirected blow  dans sudden inglorious sprawl was greeted with a burst of laughter and a clapping of hands from faith  dan sprang up purple with rage and began to climb the fence  but just then the schoolbell rang and dan knew what happened to boys who were late during mr hazards regime  well fight this out he howled  cowardy  any time you like said walter  oh no no walter protested faith  dont fight him  i dont mind what he saysi wouldnt condescend to mind the like of him  he insulted you and he insulted my mother said walter with the same deadly calm  tonight after school dan  ive got to go right home from school to pick taters after the harrows dad says answered dan sulkily  but tomorrow nightll do  all righthere tomorrow night agreed walter  and ill smash your sissyface for you promised dan  walter shudderednot so much from fear of the threat as from repulsion over the ugliness and vulgarity of it  but he held his head high and marched into school  faith followed in a conflict of emotions  she hated to think of walter fighting that little sneak but oh he had been splendid  and he was going to fight for herfaith meredithto punish her insulter  of course he would winsuch eyes spelled victory  faiths confidence in her champion had dimmed a little by evening however  walter had seemed so very quiet and dull the rest of the day in school  if it were only jem she sighed to una as they sat on hezekiah pollocks tombstone in the graveyard  he is such a fighterhe could finish dan off in no time  but walter doesnt know much about fighting  im so afraid hell be hurt sighed una who hated fighting and couldnt understand the subtle secret exultation she divined in faith  he oughtnt to be said faith uncomfortably  hes every bit as big as dan  but dans so much older said una  why hes nearly a year older  dan hasnt done much fighting when you come to count up said faith  i believe hes really a coward  he didnt think walter would fight or he wouldnt have called names before him  oh if you could just have seen walters face when he looked at him una  it made me shiverwith a nice shiver  he looked just like sir galahad in that poem father read us on saturday  i hate the thought of them fighting and i wish it could be stopped said una  oh its got to go on now cried faith  its a matter of honour  dont you dare tell anyone una  if you do ill never tell you secrets again  i wont tell agreed una  but i wont stay tomorrow to watch the fight  im coming right home  oh all right  i have to be thereit would be mean not to when walter is fighting for me  im going to tie my colours on his armthats the thing to do when hes my knight  how lucky mrs blythe gave me that pretty blue hairribbon for my birthday ive only worn it twice so it will be almost new  but i wish i was sure walter would win  it will be soso humiliating if he doesnt  faith would have been yet more dubious if she could have seen her champion just then  walter had gone home from school with all his righteous anger at a low ebb and a very nasty feeling in its place he had to fight dan reese the next nightand he didnt want tohe hated the thought of it  and he kept thinking of it all the time  not for a minute could he get away from the thought  would it hurt much  he was terribly afraid that it would hurt  and would he be defeated and shamed  he could not eat any supper worth speaking of  susan had made a big batch of his favourite monkeyfaces but he could choke only one down  jem ate four  walter wondered how he could  how could anybody eat  and how could they all talk gaily as they were doing  there was mother with her shining eyes and pink cheeks  she didnt know her son had to fight next day  would she be so gay if she knew walter wondered darkly  jem had taken susans picture with his new camera and the result was passed around the table and susan was terribly indignant over it  i am no beauty mrs dr dear and well i know it and have always known it she said in an aggrieved tone but that i am as ugly as that picture makes me out i will never no never believe  jem laughed over this and anne laughed again with him  walter couldnt endure it  he got up and fled to his room  that child has got something on his mind mrs dr dear said susan  he has et next to nothing  do you suppose he is plotting another poem  poor walter was very far removed in spirit from the starry realms of poesy just then  he propped his elbow on his open windowsill and leaned his head drearily on his hands  come on down to the shore walter cried jem busting in  the boys are going to burn the sandhill grass tonight  father says we can go  come on  at any other time walter would have been delighted  he gloried in the burning of the sandhill grass  but now he flatly refused to go and no arguments or entreaties could move him disappointed jem who did not care for the long dark walk to four winds point alone retreated to his museum in the garret and buried himself in a book  he soon forgot his disappointment revelling with the heroes of old romance and pausing occasionally to picture himself a famous general leading his troops to victory on some great battlefield  walter sat at his window until bedtime  di crept in hoping to be told what was wrong but walter could not talk of it even to di  talking of it seemed to give it a reality from which he shrank  it was torture enough to think of it  the crisp withered leaves rustled on the maple trees outside his window the glow of rose and flame had died out of the hollow silvery sky and the full moon was rising gloriously over rainbow valley afar off a ruddy woodfire was painting a page of glory on the horizon beyond the hills  it was a sharp clear evening when faraway sounds were heard distinctly  a fox was barking across the pond an engine was puffing down at the glen station a bluejay was screaming madly in the maple grove there was laughter over on the manse lawn  how could people laugh  how could foxes and bluejays and engines behave as if nothing were going to happen on the morrow  oh i wish it was over groaned walter  he slept very little that night and had hard work choking down his porridge in the morning  susan was rather lavish in her platefuls  mr hazard found him an unsatisfactory pupil that day  faith merediths wits seemed to be woolgathering too dan reese kept drawing surreptitious pictures of girls with pig or rooster heads on his slate and holding them up for all to see  the news of the coming battle had leaked out and most of the boys and many of the girls were in the spruce plantation when dan and walter sought it after school  una had gone home but faith was there having tied her blue ribbon around walters arm walter was thankful that neither jem nor di nor nan were among the crowd of spectators  somehow they had not heard of what was in the wind and had gone home too  walter faced dan quite undauntedly now  at the last moment all his fear had vanished but he still felt disgust at the idea of fighting  dan it was noted was really paler under his freckles than walter was  one of the older boys gave the word and dan struck walter in the face  walter reeled a little  the pain of the blow tingled through all his sensitive frame for a moment  then he felt pain no longer something such as he had never experienced before seemed to roll over him like a flood  his face flushed crimson his eyes burned like flame  the scholars of glen st mary school had never dreamed that miss walter could look like that  he hurled himself forward and closed with dan like a young wildcat  there were no particular rules in the fights of the glen school boys  it was catchascatch can and get your blows in anyhow walter fought with a savage fury and a joy in the struggle against which dan could not hold his ground  it was all over very speedily  walter had no clear consciousness of what he was doing until suddenly the red mist cleared from his sight and he found himself kneeling on the body of the prostrate dan whose noseoh horrorwas spouting blood  have you had enough demanded walter through his clenched teeth  dan sulkily admitted that he had  my mother doesnt write lies  no  faith meredith isnt a piggirl  no  nor a roostergirl  no  and im not a coward  no  walter had intended to ask and you are a liar but pity intervened and he did not humiliate dan further  besides that blood was so horrible  you can go then he said contemptuously  there was a loud clapping from the boys who were perched on the rail fence but some of the girls were crying  they were frightened  they had seen schoolboy fights before but nothing like walter as he had grappled with dan  there had been something terrifying about him  they thought he would kill dan now that all was over they sobbed hystericallyexcept faith who still stood tense and crimson cheeked  walter did not stay for any conquerors meed  he sprang over the fence and rushed down the spruce hill to rainbow valley  he felt none of the victors joy but he felt a certain calm satisfaction in duty done and honour avengedmingled with a sickish qualm when he thought of dans gory nose  it had been so ugly and walter hated ugliness  also he began to realize that he himself was somewhat sore and battered up  his lip was cut and swollen and one eye felt very strange  in rainbow valley he encountered mr meredith who was coming home from an afternoon call on the miss wests  that reverend gentleman looked gravely at him  it seems to me that you have been fighting walter  yes sir said walter expecting a scolding  what was it about  dan reese said my mother wrote lies and that that faith was a piggirl answered walter bluntly  ohh  then you were certainly justified walter  do you think its right to fight sir asked walter curiously  not alwaysand not oftenbut sometimesyes sometimes said john meredith  when womenkind are insulted for instanceas in your case  my motto walter is dont fight till youre sure you ought to and then put every ounce of you into it  in spite of sundry discolorations i infer that you came off best  yes  i made him take it all back  very goodvery good indeed  i didnt think you were such a fighter walter  i never fought beforeand i didnt want to right up to the lastand then said walter determined to make a clean breast of it i liked it while i was at it  the rev johns eyes twinkled  you werea little frightenedat first  i was a whole lot frightened said honest walter  but im not going to be frightened any more sir  being frightened of things is worse than the things themselves  im going to ask father to take me over to lowbridge tomorrow to get my tooth out  right again  fear is more pain than is the pain it fears  do you know who wrote that walter  it was shakespeare  was there any feeling or emotion or experience of the human heart that that wonderful man did not know  when you go home tell your mother i am proud of you  walter did not tell her that however but he told her all the rest and she sympathized with him and told him she was glad he had stood up for her and faith and she anointed his sore spots and rubbed cologne on his aching head  are all mothers as nice as you asked walter hugging her youre worth standing up for  miss cornelia and susan were in the living room when anne came downstairs and listened to the story with much enjoyment  susan in particular was highly gratified  i am real glad to hear he has had a good fight mrs dr dear perhaps it may knock that poetry nonsense out of him  and i never no never could bear that little viper of a dan reese will you not sit nearer to the fire mrs marshall elliott these november evenings are very chilly  thank you susan im not cold  i called at the manse before i came here and got quite warmthough i had to go to the kitchen to do it for there was no fire anywhere else  the kitchen looked as if it had been stirred up with a stick believe me mr meredith wasnt home  i couldnt find out where he was but i have an idea that he was up at the wests  do you know anne dearie they say he has been going there frequently all the fall and people are beginning to think he is going to see rosemary  he would get a very charming wife if he married rosemary said anne piling driftwood on the fire  she is one of the most delightful girls ive ever knowntruly one of the race of joseph  yesonly she is an episcopalian said miss cornelia doubtfully  of course that is better than if she was a methodistbut i do think mr meredith could find a good enough wife in his own denomination  however very likely there is nothing in it  its only a month ago that i said to him you ought to marry again mr meredith  he looked as shocked as if i had suggested something improper  my wife is in her grave mrs elliott he said in that gentle saintly way of his  i suppose so i said or i wouldnt be advising you to marry again  then he looked more shocked than ever  so i doubt if there is much in this rosemary story  if a single minister calls twice at a house where there is a single woman all the gossips have it he is courting her  it seems to meif i may presume to say sothat mr meredith is too shy to go courting a second wife said susan solemnly  he isnt shy believe me retorted miss cornelia absentmindedyesbut shy no  and for all he is so abstracted and dreamy he has a very good opinion of himself manlike and when he is really awake he wouldnt think it much of a chore to ask any woman to have him  no the trouble is hes deluding himself into believing that his heart is buried while all the time its beating away inside of him just like anybody elses  he may have a notion of rosemary west and he may not  if he has we must make the best of it  she is a sweet girl and a fine housekeeper and would make a good mother for those poor neglected children  and concluded miss cornelia resignedly my own grandmother was an episcopalian    chapter xviii mary brings evil tidings  mary vance whom mrs elliott had sent up to the manse on an errand came tripping down rainbow valley on her way to ingleside where she was to spend the afternoon with nan and di as a saturday treat  nan and di had been picking spruce gum with faith and una in the manse woods and the four of them were now sitting on a fallen pine by the brook all it must be admitted chewing rather vigorously  the ingleside twins were not allowed to chew spruce gum anywhere but in the seclusion of rainbow valley but faith and una were unrestricted by such rules of etiquette and cheerfully chewed it everywhere at home and abroad to the very proper horror of the glen  faith had been chewing it in church one day but jerry had realized the enormity of that and had given her such an olderbrotherly scolding that she never did it again  i was so hungry i just felt as if i had to chew something she protested  you know well enough what breakfast was like jerry meredith  i couldnt eat scorched porridge and my stomach just felt so queer and empty  the gum helped a lotand i didnt chew very hard  i didnt make any noise and i never cracked the gum once  you mustnt chew gum in church anyhow insisted jerry  dont let me catch you at it again  you chewed yourself in prayermeeting last week cried faith  thats different said jerry loftily  prayermeeting isnt on sunday  besides i sat away at the back in a dark seat and nobody saw me  you were sitting right up front where every one saw you  and i took the gum out of my mouth for the last hymn and stuck it on the back of the pew right up in front where every one saw you  and i took the gum out of my mouth for the last hymn and stuck it on the back of the pew in front of me  then i came away and forgot it  i went back to get it next morning but it was gone  i suppose rod warren swiped it  and it was a dandy chew  mary vance walked down the valley with her head held high  she had on a new blue velvet cap with a scarlet rosette in it a coat of navy blue cloth and a little squirrelfur muff  she was very conscious of her new clothes and very well pleased with herself her hair was elaborately crimped her face was quite plump her cheeks rosy her white eyes shining  she did not look much like the forlorn and ragged waif the merediths had found in the old taylor barn  una tried not to feel envious  here was mary with a new velvet cap but she and faith had to wear their shabby old gray tams again this winter  nobody ever thought of getting them new ones and they were afraid to ask their father for them for fear that he might be short of money and then he would feel badly  mary had told them once that ministers were always short of money and found it awful hard to make ends meet  since then faith and una would have gone in rags rather than ask their father for anything if they could help it  they did not worry a great deal over their shabbiness but it was rather trying to see mary vance coming out in such style and putting on such airs about it too  the new squirrel muff was really the last straw neither faith nor una had ever had a muff counting themselves lucky if they could compass mittens without holes in them aunt martha could not see to darn holes and though una tried to she made sad cobbling  somehow they could not make their greeting of mary very cordial  but mary did not mind or notice that she was not overly sensitive  she vaulted lightly to a seat on the pine tree and laid the offending muff on a bough  una saw that it was lined with shirred red satin and had red tassels  she looked down at her own rather purple chapped little hands and wondered if she would ever ever be able to put them into a muff like that  give us a chew said mary companionably  nan di and faith all produced an amberhued knot or two from their pockets and passed them to mary  una sat very still  she had four lovely big knots in the pocket of her tight threadbare little jacket but she wasnt going to give one of them to mary vancenot one let mary pick her own gum  people with squirrel muffs neednt expect to get everything in the world  great day isnt it said mary swinging her legs the better perhaps to display new boots with very smart cloth tops  una tucked her feet under her  there was a hole in the toe of one of her boots and both laces were much knotted  but they were the best she had  oh this mary vance  why hadnt they left her in the old barn  una never felt badly because the ingleside twins were better dressed than she and faith were  they wore their pretty clothes with careless grace and never seemed to think about them at all somehow they did not make other people feel shabby  but when mary vance was dressed up she seemed fairly to exude clothesto walk in an atmosphere of clothesto make everybody else feel and think clothes  una as she sat there in the honeytinted sunshine of the gracious december afternoon was acutely and miserably conscious of everything she had onthe faded tam which was yet her best the skimpy jacket she had worn for three winters the holes in her skirt and her boots the shivering insufficiency of her poor little undergarments  of course mary was going out for a visit and she was not  but even if she had been she had nothing better to put on and in this lay the sting  say this is great gum  listen to me cracking it  there aint any gum spruces down at four winds said mary  sometimes i just hanker after a chew  mrs elliott wont let me chew gum if she sees me  she says it aint ladylike  this ladybusiness puzzles me  i cant get on to all its kinks  say una whats the matter with you  cat got your tongue  no said una who could not drag her fascinated eyes from that squirrel muff  mary leaned past her picked it up and thrust it into unas hands  stick your paws in that for a while she ordered  they look sorter pinched  aint that a dandy muff  mrs elliott give it to me last week for a birthday present  im to get the collar at christmas  i heard her telling mr elliott that  mrs elliott is very good to you said faith  you bet she is  and im good to her too retorted mary  i work like a nigger to make it easy for her and have everything just as she likes it  we was made for each other  tisnt every one could get along with her as well as i do  shes pizen neat but so am i and so we agree fine  i told you she would never whip you  so you did  shes never tried to lay a finger on me and i aint never told a lie to hernot one trues you live  she combs me down with her tongue sometimes though but that just slips off me like water off a ducks back  say una why didnt you hang on to the muff  una had put it back on the bough  my hands arent cold thank you she said stiffly  well if youre satisfied i am  say old kitty alec has come back to church as meek as moses and nobody knows why  but everybody is saying it was faith brought norman douglas out  his housekeeper says you went there and gave him an awful tonguelashing  did you  i went and asked him to come to church said faith uncomfortably  fancy your spunk said mary admiringly  i wouldnt have dared do that and im not so slow  mrs wilson says the two of you jawed something scandalous but you come off best and then he just turned round and like to eat you up  say is your father going to preach here tomorrow  no  hes going to exchange with mr perry from charlottetown father went to town this morning and mr perry is coming out tonight  i thought there was something in the wind though old martha wouldnt give me any satisfaction  but i felt sure she wouldnt have been killing that rooster for nothing  what rooster  what do you mean cried faith turning pale  i dont know what rooster  i didnt see it  when she took the butter mrs elliott sent up she said shed been out to the barn killing a rooster for dinner tomorrow  faith sprang down from the pine  its adamwe have no other roostershe has killed adam  now dont fly off the handle  martha said the butcher at the glen had no meat this week and she had to have something and the hens were all laying and too poor  if she has killed adam faith began to run up the hill  mary shrugged her shoulders  shell go crazy now  she was so fond of that adam  he ought to have been in the pot long agohell be as tough as sole leather but i wouldnt like to be in marthas shoes  faiths just white with rage una youd better go after her and try to peacify her  mary had gone a few steps with the blythe girls when una suddenly turned and ran after her  heres some gum for you mary she said with a little repentant catch in her voice thrusting all her four knots into marys hands and im glad you have such a pretty muff  why thanks said mary rather taken by surprise  to the blythe girls after una had gone she said aint she a queer little mite  but ive always said she had a good heart    chapter xix poor adam  when una got home faith was lying face downwards on her bed utterly refusing to be comforted  aunt martha had killed adam he was reposing on a platter in the pantry that very minute trussed and dressed encircled by his liver and heart and gizzard  aunt martha heeded faiths passion of grief and anger not a whit  we had to have something for the strange ministers dinner she said  youre too big a girl to make such a fuss over an old rooster  you knew hed have to be killed sometime  ill tell father when he comes home what youve done sobbed faith  dont you go bothering your poor father  he has troubles enough  and im housekeeper here  adam was minemrs johnson gave him to me  you had no business to touch him stormed faith  dont you get sassy now  the roosters killed and theres an end of it  i aint going to set no strange minister down to a dinner of cold biled mutton  i was brought up to know better than that if i have come down in the world  faith would not go down to supper that night and she would not go to church the next morning  but at dinner time she went to the table her eyes swollen with crying her face sullen  the rev james perry was a sleek rubicund man with a bristling white moustache bushy white eyebrows and a shining bald head he was certainly not handsome and he was a very tiresome pompous sort of person  but if he had looked like the archangel michael and talked with the tongues of men and angels faith would still have utterly detested him  he carved adam up dexterously showing off his plump white hands and very handsome diamond ring also he made jovial remarks all through the performance  jerry and carl giggled and even una smiled wanly because she thought politeness demanded it  but faith only scowled darkly  the rev james thought her manners shockingly bad  once when he was delivering himself of an unctuous remark to jerry faith broke in rudely with a flat contradiction  the rev james drew his bushy eyebrows together at her  little girls should not interrupt he said and they should not contradict people who know far more than they do  this put faith in a worse temper than ever  to be called little girl as if she were no bigger than chubby rilla blythe over at ingleside  it was insufferable  and how that abominable mr perry did eat  he even picked poor adams bones  neither faith nor una would touch a mouthful and looked upon the boys as little better than cannibals  faith felt that if that awful repast did not soon come to an end she would wind it up by throwing something at mr perrys gleaming head  fortunately mr perry found aunt marthas leathery apple pie too much even for his powers of mastication and the meal came to an end after a long grace in which mr perry offered up devout thanks for the food which a kind and beneficent providence had provided for sustenance and temperate pleasure  god hadnt a single thing to do with providing adam for you muttered faith rebelliously under her breath  the boys gladly made their escape to outdoors una went to help aunt martha with the dishesthough that rather grumpy old dame never welcomed her timid assistanceand faith betook herself to the study where a cheerful wood fire was burning in the grate she thought she would thereby escape from the hated mr perry who had announced his intention of taking a nap in his room during the afternoon  but scarcely had faith settled herself in a corner with a book when he walked in and standing before the fire proceeded to survey the disorderly study with an air of disapproval  you fathers books seem to be in somewhat deplorable confusion my little girl he said severely  faith darkled in her corner and said not a word  she would not talk to thisthis creature  you should try to put them in order mr perry went on playing with his handsome watch chain and smiling patronizingly on faith you are quite old enough to attend to such duties  my little daughter at home is only ten and she is already an excellent little housekeeper and the greatest help and comfort to her mother  she is a very sweet child  i wish you had the privilege of her acquaintance  she could help you in many ways  of course you have not had the inestimable privilege of a good mothers care and training  a sad lacka very sad lack  i have spoken more than once to your father in this connection and pointed out his duty to him faithfully but so far with no effect  i trust he may awaken to a realization of his responsibility before it is too late  in the meantime it is your duty and privilege to endeavour to take your sainted mothers place  you might exercise a great influence over your brothers and your little sisteryou might be a true mother to them  i fear that you do not think of these things as you should  my dear child allow me to open your eyes in regard to them  mr perrys oily complacent voice trickled on  he was in his element  nothing suited him better than to lay down the law patronize and exhort  he had no idea of stopping and he did not stop  he stood before the fire his feet planted firmly on the rug and poured out a flood of pompous platitudes  faith heard not a word  she was really not listening to him at all  but she was watching his long black coattails with impish delight growing in her brown eyes  mr perry was standing very near the fire  his coattails began to scorchhis coattails began to smoke  he still prosed on wrapped up in his own eloquence  the coattails smoked worse  a tiny spark flew up from the burning wood and alighted in the middle of one  it clung and caught and spread into a smouldering flame  faith could restrain herself no longer and broke into a stifled giggle  mr perry stopped short angered over this impertinence suddenly he became conscious that a reek of burning cloth filled the room  he whirled round and saw nothing  then he clapped his hands to his coattails and brought them around in front of him there was already quite a hole in one of themand this was his new suit  faith shook with helpless laughter over his pose and expression  did you see my coattails burning he demanded angrily  yes sir said faith demurely  why didnt you tell me he demanded glaring at her  you said it wasnt good manners to interrupt sir said faith more demurely still  ifif i was your father i would give you a spanking that you would remember all your life miss said a very angry reverend gentleman as he stalked out of the study  the coat of mr merediths second best suit would not fit mr perry so he had to go to the evening service with his singed coattail  but he did not walk up the aisle with his usual consciousness of the honour he was conferring on the building  he never would agree to an exchange of pulpits with mr meredith again and he was barely civil to the latter when they met for a few minutes at the station the next morning  but faith felt a certain gloomy satisfaction  adam was partially avenged    chapter xx faith makes a friend  next day in school was a hard one for faith  mary vance had told the tale of adam and all the scholars except the blythes thought it quite a joke  the girls told faith between giggles that it was too bad and the boys wrote sardonic notes of condolence to her  poor faith went home from school feeling her very soul raw and smarting within her  im going over to ingleside to have a talk with mrs blythe she sobbed  she wont laugh at me as everybody else does ive just got to talk to somebody who understands how bad i feel  she ran down through rainbow valley  enchantment had been at work the night before  a light snow had fallen and the powdered firs were dreaming of a spring to come and a joy to be  the long hill beyond was richly purple with leafless beeches  the rosy light of sunset lay over the world like a pink kiss  of all the airy fairy places full of weird elfin grace rainbow valley that winter evening was the most beautiful  but all its dreamlike loveliness was lost on poor sorehearted little faith  by the brook she came suddenly upon rosemary west who was sitting on the old pine tree  she was on her way home from ingleside where she had been giving the girls their music lesson  she had been lingering in rainbow valley quite a little time looking across its white beauty and roaming some byways of dream  judging from the expression of her face her thoughts were pleasant ones  perhaps the faint occasional tinkle from the bells on the tree lovers brought the little lurking smile to her lips  or perhaps it was occasioned by the consciousness that john meredith seldom failed to spend monday evening in the gray house on the white windswept hill  into rosemarys dreams burst faith meredith full of rebellious bitterness  faith stopped abruptly when she saw miss west  she did not know her very welljust well enough to speak to when they met  and she did not want to see any one just thenexcept mrs blythe  she knew her eyes and nose were red and swollen and she hated to have a stranger know she had been crying  good evening miss west she said uncomfortably  what is the matter faith asked rosemary gently  nothing said faith rather shortly  oh rosemary smiled  you mean nothing that you can tell to outsiders dont you  faith looked at miss west with sudden interest  here was a person who understood things  and how pretty she was  how golden her hair was under her plumy hat  how pink her cheeks were over her velvet coat  how blue and companionable her eyes were  faith felt that miss west could be a lovely friendif only she were a friend instead of a stranger  iim going up to tell mrs blythe said faith  she always understandsshe never laughs at us  i always talk things over with her  it helps  dear girlie im sorry to have to tell you that mrs blythe isnt home said miss west sympathetically  she went to avonlea today and isnt coming back till the last of the week  faiths lip quivered  then i might as well go home again she said miserably  i suppose sounless you think you could bring yourself to talk it over with me instead said miss rosemary gently  it is such a help to talk things over  i know  i dont suppose i can be as good at understanding as mrs blythebut i promise you that i wont laugh  you wouldnt laugh outside hesitated faith  but you mightinside  no i wouldnt laugh inside either  why should i  something has hurt youit never amuses me to see anybody hurt no matter what hurts them  if you feel that youd like to tell me what has hurt you ill be glad to listen  but if you think youd rather notthats all right too dear  faith took another long earnest look into miss wests eyes they were very seriousthere was no laughter in them not even far far back  with a little sigh she sat down on the old pine beside her new friend and told her all about adam and his cruel fate  rosemary did not laugh or feel like laughing  she understood and sympathizedreally she was almost as good as mrs blytheyes quite as good  mr perry is a minister but he should have been a butcher said faith bitterly  he is so fond of carving things up  he enjoyed cutting poor adam to pieces  he just sliced into him as if he were any common rooster  between you and me faith i dont like mr perry very well myself said rosemary laughing a littlebut at mr perry not at adam as faith clearly understood  i never did like him  i went to school with himhe was a glen boy you knowand he was a most detestable little prig even then  oh how we girls used to hate holding his fat clammy hands in the ringaround games but we must remember dear that he didnt know that adam had been a pet of yours  he thought he was just a common rooster we must be just even when we are terribly hurt  i suppose so admitted faith  but why does everybody seem to think it funny that i should have loved adam so much miss west if it had been a horrid old cat nobody would have thought it queer  when lottie warrens kitten had its legs cut off by the binder everybody was sorry for her  she cried two days in school and nobody laughed at her not even dan reese  and all her chums went to the kittens funeral and helped her bury itonly they couldnt bury its poor little paws with it because they couldnt find them  it was a horrid thing to have happen of course but i dont think it was as dreadful as seeing your pet eaten up yet everybody laughs at me  i think it is because the name rooster seems rather a funny one said rosemary gravely  there is something in it that is comical  now chicken is different  it doesnt sound so funny to talk of loving a chicken  adam was the dearest little chicken miss west  he was just a little golden ball  he would run up to me and peck out of my hand  and he was handsome when he grew up toowhite as snow with such a beautiful curving white tail though mary vance said it was too short  he knew his name and always came when i called himhe was a very intelligent rooster  and aunt martha had no right to kill him  he was mine  it wasnt fair was it miss west  no it wasnt said rosemary decidedly  not a bit fair  i remember i had a pet hen when i was a little girl  she was such a pretty little thingall golden brown and speckly  i loved her as much as i ever loved any pet  she was never killedshe died of old age  mother wouldnt have her killed because she was my pet  if my mother had been living she wouldnt have let adam be killed said faith  for that matter father wouldnt have either if hed been home and known of it  im sure he wouldnt miss west  im sure too said rosemary  there was a little added flush on her face  she looked rather conscious but faith noticed nothing  was it very wicked of me not to tell mr perry his coattails were scorching she asked anxiously  oh terribly wicked answered rosemary with dancing eyes but i would have been just as naughty faithi wouldnt have told him they were scorchingand i dont believe i would ever have been a bit sorry for my wickedness either  una thought i should have told him because he was a minister  dearest if a minister doesnt behave as a gentleman we are not bound to respect his coattails  i know i would just have loved to see jimmy perrys coattails burning up  it must have been fun  both laughed but faith ended with a bitter little sigh  well anyway adam is dead and i am never going to love anything again  dont say that dear  we miss so much out of life if we dont love  the more we love the richer life iseven if it is only some little furry or feathery pet  would you like a canary faitha little golden bit of a canary  if you would ill give you one  we have two up home  oh i would like that cried faith  i love birds onlywould aunt marthas cat eat it  its so tragic to have your pets eaten  i dont think i could endure it a second time  if you hang the cage far enough from the wall i dont think the cat could harm it  ill tell you just how to take care of it and ill bring it to ingleside for you the next time i come down  to herself rosemary was thinking  it will give every gossip in the glen something to talk of but i will not care  i want to comfort this poor little heart  faith was comforted  sympathy and understanding were very sweet she and miss rosemary sat on the old pine until the twilight crept softly down over the white valley and the evening star shone over the gray maple grove  faith told rosemary all her small history and hopes her likes and dislikes the ins and outs of life at the manse the ups and downs of school society finally they parted firm friends  mr meredith was as usual lost in dreams when supper began that evening but presently a name pierced his abstraction and brought him back to reality  faith was telling una of her meeting with rosemary  she is just lovely i think said faith  just as nice as mrs blythebut different  i felt as if i wanted to hug her  she did hug mesuch a nice velvety hug  and she called me dearest it thrilled me  i could tell her anything  so you liked miss west faith mr meredith asked with a rather odd intonation  i love her cried faith  ah said mr meredith  ah    chapter xxi the impossible word  john meredith walked meditatively through the clear crispness of a winter night in rainbow valley  the hills beyond glistened with the chill splendid lustre of moonlight on snow  every little fir tree in the long valley sang its own wild song to the harp of wind and frost  his children and the blythe lads and lasses were coasting down the eastern slope and whizzing over the glassy pond  they were having a glorious time and their gay voices and gayer laughter echoed up and down the valley dying away in elfin cadences among the trees  on the right the lights of ingleside gleamed through the maple grove with the genial lure and invitation which seems always to glow in the beacons of a home where we know there is love and goodcheer and a welcome for all kin whether of flesh or spirit  mr meredith liked very well on occasion to spend an evening arguing with the doctor by the drift wood fire where the famous china dogs of ingleside kept ceaseless watch and ward as became deities of the hearth but tonight he did not look that way  far on the western hill gleamed a paler but more alluring star  mr meredith was on his way to see rosemary west and he meant to tell her something which had been slowly blossoming in his heart since their first meeting and had sprung into full flower on the evening when faith had so warmly voiced her admiration for rosemary  he had come to realize that he had learned to care for rosemary not as he had cared for cecilia of course  that was entirely different  that love of romance and dream and glamour could never he thought return  but rosemary was beautiful and sweet and dearvery dear  she was the best of companions  he was happier in her company than he had ever expected to be again she would be an ideal mistress for his home a good mother to his children  during the years of his widowhood mr meredith had received innumerable hints from brother members of presbytery and from many parishioners who could not be suspected of any ulterior motive as well as from some who could that he ought to marry again but these hints never made any impression on him  it was commonly thought he was never aware of them  but he was quite acutely aware of them  and in his own occasional visitations of common sense he knew that the common sensible thing for him to do was to marry  but common sense was not the strong point of john meredith and to choose out deliberately and coldbloodedly some suitable woman as one might choose a housekeeper or a business partner was something he was quite incapable of doing how he hated that word suitable  it reminded him so strongly of james perry  a suit able woman of suit able age that unctuous brother of the cloth had said in his far from subtle hint  for the moment john meredith had had a perfectly unbelievable desire to rush madly away and propose marriage to the youngest most unsuitable woman it was possible to discover  mrs marshall elliott was his good friend and he liked her  but when she had bluntly told him he should marry again he felt as if she had torn away the veil that hung before some sacred shrine of his innermost life and he had been more or less afraid of her ever since  he knew there were women in his congregation of suitable age who would marry him quite readily  that fact had seeped through all his abstraction very early in his ministry in glen st mary  they were good substantial uninteresting women one or two fairly comely the others not exactly so and john meredith would as soon have thought of marrying any one of them as of hanging himself  he had some ideals to which no seeming necessity could make him false  he could ask no woman to fill cecilias place in his home unless he could offer her at least some of the affection and homage he had given to his girlish bride  and where in his limited feminine acquaintance was such a woman to be found  rosemary west had come into his life on that autumn evening bringing with her an atmosphere in which his spirit recognized native air  across the gulf of strangerhood they clasped hands of friendship  he knew her better in that ten minutes by the hidden spring than he knew emmeline drew or elizabeth kirk or amy annetta douglas in a year or could know them in a century  he had fled to her for comfort when mrs alec davis had outraged his mind and soul and had found it  since then he had gone often to the house on the hill slipping through the shadowy paths of night in rainbow valley so astutely that glen gossip could never be absolutely certain that he did go to see rosemary west  once or twice he had been caught in the west living room by other visitors that was all the ladies aid had to go by  but when elizabeth kirk heard it she put away a secret hope she had allowed herself to cherish without a change of expression on her kind plain face and emmeline drew resolved that the next time she saw a certain old bachelor of lowbridge she would not snub him as she had done at a previous meeting  of course if rosemary west was out to catch the minister she would catch him she looked younger than she was and men thought her pretty besides the west girls had money  it is to be hoped that he wont be so absentminded as to propose to ellen by mistake was the only malicious thing she allowed herself to say to a sympathetic sister drew  emmeline bore no further grudge towards rosemary  when all was said and done an unencumbered bachelor was far better than a widower with four children  it had been only the glamour of the manse that had temporarily blinded emmelines eyes to the better part  a sled with three shrieking occupants sped past mr meredith to the pond  faiths long curls streamed in the wind and her laughter rang above that of the others  john meredith looked after them kindly and longingly  he was glad that his children had such chums as the blythesglad that they had so wise and gay and tender a friend as mrs blythe  but they needed something more and that something would be supplied when he brought rosemary west as a bride to the old manse  there was in her a quality essentially maternal  it was saturday night and he did not often go calling on saturday night which was supposed to be dedicated to a thoughtful revision of sundays sermon  but he had chosen this night because he had learned that ellen west was going to be away and rosemary would be alone  often as he had spent pleasant evenings in the house on the hill he had never since that first meeting at the spring seen rosemary alone  ellen had always been there  he did not precisely object to ellen being there  he liked ellen west very much and they were the best of friends  ellen had an almost masculine understanding and a sense of humour which his own shy hidden appreciation of fun found very agreeable  he liked her interest in politics and world events  there was no man in the glen not even excepting dr blythe who had a better grasp of such things  i think it is just as well to be interested in things as long as you live she had said  if youre not it doesnt seem to me that theres much difference between the quick and the dead  he liked her pleasant deep rumbly voice he liked the hearty laugh with which she always ended up some jolly and welltold story  she never gave him digs about his children as other glen women did she never bored him with local gossip she had no malice and no pettiness  she was always splendidly sincere  mr meredith who had picked up miss cornelias way of classifying people considered that ellen belonged to the race of joseph altogether an admirable woman for a sisterinlaw nevertheless a man did not want even the most admirable of women around when he was proposing to another woman  and ellen was always around  she did not insist on talking to mr meredith herself all the time  she let rosemary have a fair share of him many evenings indeed ellen effaced herself almost totally sitting back in the corner with st george in her lap and letting mr meredith and rosemary talk and sing and read books together  sometimes they quite forgot her presence  but if their conversation or choice of duets ever betrayed the least tendency to what ellen considered philandering ellen promptly nipped that tendency in the bud and blotted rosemary out for the rest of the evening  but not even the grimmest of amiable dragons can altogether prevent a certain subtle language of eye and smile and eloquent silence and so the ministers courtship progressed after a fashion  but if it was ever to reach a climax that climax must come when ellen was away  and ellen was so seldom away especially in winter  she found her own fireside the pleasantest place in the world she vowed  gadding had no attraction for her  she was fond of company but she wanted it at home  mr meredith had almost been driven to the conclusion that he must write to rosemary what he wanted to say when ellen casually announced one evening that she was going to a silver wedding next saturday night  she had been bridesmaid when the principals were married only old guests were invited so rosemary was not included  mr meredith pricked up his ears a trifle and a gleam flashed into his dreamy dark eyes  both ellen and rosemary saw it and both ellen and rosemary felt with a tingling shock that mr meredith would certainly come up the hill next saturday night  might as well have it over with st george ellen sternly told the black cat after mr meredith had gone home and rosemary had silently gone upstairs  he means to ask her st georgeim perfectly sure of that  so he might as well have his chance to do it and find out he cant get her george  shed rather like to take him saint  i know thatbut she promised and shes got to keep her promise  im rather sorry in some ways st george i dont know of a man id sooner have for a brotherinlaw if a brotherinlaw was convenient  i havent a thing against him saintnot a thing except that he wont see and cant be made to see that the kaiser is a menace to the peace of europe  thats his blind spot  but hes good company and i like him  a woman can say anything she likes to a man with a mouth like john merediths and be sure of not being misunderstood  such a man is more precious than rubies saintand much rarer george  but he cant have rosemaryand i suppose when he finds out he cant have her hell drop us both  and well miss him saintwell miss him something scandalous george  but she promised and ill see that she keeps her promise  ellens face looked almost ugly in its lowering resolution upstairs rosemary was crying into her pillow  so mr meredith found his lady alone and looking very beautiful rosemary had not made any special toilet for the occasion she wanted to but she thought it would be absurd to dress up for a man you meant to refuse  so she wore her plain dark afternoon dress and looked like a queen in it  her suppressed excitement coloured her face to brilliancy her great blue eyes were pools of light less placid than usual  she wished the interview were over  she had looked forward to it all day with dread  she felt quite sure that john meredith cared a great deal for her after a fashionand she felt just as sure that he did not care for her as he had cared for his first love she felt that her refusal would disappoint him considerably but she did not think it would altogether overwhelm him  yet she hated to make it hated for his sake androsemary was quite honest with herselffor her own  she knew she could have loved john meredith ifif it had been permissible  she knew that life would be a blank thing if rejected as lover he refused longer to be a friend  she knew that she could be very happy with him and that she could make him happy  but between her and happiness stood the prison gate of the promise she had made to ellen years ago  rosemary could not remember her father  he had died when she was only three years old  ellen who had been thirteen remembered him but with no special tenderness  he had been a stern reserved man many years older than his fair pretty wife  five years later their brother of twelve died also since his death the two girls had always lived alone with their mother they had never mingled very freely in the social life of the glen or lowbridge though where they went the wit and spirit of ellen and the sweetness and beauty of rosemary made them welcome guests  both had what was called a disappointment in their girlhood  the sea had not given up rosemarys lover and norman douglas then a handsome redhaired young giant noted for wild driving and noisy though harmless escapades had quarrelled with ellen and left her in a fit of pique  there were not lacking candidates for both martins and normans places but none seemed to find favour in the eyes of the west girls who drifted slowly out of youth and bellehood without any seeming regret  they were devoted to their mother who was a chronic invalid  the three had a little circle of home interestsbooks and pets and flowerswhich made them happy and contented  mrs wests death which occurred on rosemarys twentyfifth birthday was a bitter grief to them  at first they were intolerably lonely  ellen especially continued to grieve and brood her long moody musings broken only by fits of stormy passionate weeping  the old lowbridge doctor told rosemary that he feared permanent melancholy or worse  once when ellen had sat all day refusing either to speak or eat rosemary had flung herself on her knees by her sisters side  oh ellen you have me yet she said imploringly  am i nothing to you  we have always loved each other so  i wont have you always ellen had said breaking her silence with harsh intensity  you will marry and leave me  i shall be left all alone  i cannot bear the thoughti cannot  i would rather die  i will never marry said rosemary never ellen  ellen bent forward and looked searchingly into rosemarys eyes  will you promise me that solemnly she said  promise it on mothers bible  rosemary assented at once quite willing to humour ellen  what did it matter  she knew quite well she would never want to marry any one  her love had gone down with martin crawford to the deeps of the sea and without love she could not marry any one so she promised readily though ellen made rather a fearsome rite of it  they clasped hands over the bible in their mothers vacant room and both vowed to each other that they would never marry and would always live together  ellens condition improved from that hour  she soon regained her normal cheery poise  for ten years she and rosemary lived in the old house happily undisturbed by any thought of marrying or giving in marriage  their promise sat very lightly on them ellen never failed to remind her sister of it whenever any eligible male creature crossed their paths but she had never been really alarmed until john meredith came home that night with rosemary  as for rosemary ellens obsession regarding that promise had always been a little matter of mirth to heruntil lately  now it was a merciless fetter selfimposed but never to be shaken off  because of it tonight she must turn her face from happiness  it was true that the shy sweet rosebud love she had given to her boylover she could never give to another  but she knew now that she could give to john meredith a love richer and more womanly  she knew that he touched deeps in her nature that martin had never touchedthat had not perhaps been in the girl of seventeen to touch  and she must send him away tonightsend him back to his lonely hearth and his empty life and his heartbreaking problems because she had promised ellen ten years before on their mothers bible that she would never marry  john meredith did not immediately grasp his opportunity  on the contrary he talked for two good hours on the least loverlike of subjects  he even tried politics though politics always bored rosemary  the later began to think that she had been altogether mistaken and her fears and expectations suddenly seemed to her grotesque  she felt flat and foolish  the glow went out of her face and the lustre out of her eyes  john meredith had not the slightest intention of asking her to marry him  and then quite suddenly he rose came across the room and standing by her chair he asked it  the room had grown terribly still  even st george ceased to purr  rosemary heard her own heart beating and was sure john meredith must hear it too  now was the time for her to say no gently but firmly  she had been ready for days with her stilted regretful little formula and now the words of it had completely vanished from her mind she had to say noand she suddenly found she could not say it it was the impossible word  she knew now that it was not that she could have loved john meredith but that she did love him the thought of putting him from her life was agony  she must say something she lifted her bowed golden head and asked him stammeringly to give her a few days forfor consideration  john meredith was a little surprised  he was not vainer than any man has a right to be but he had expected that rosemary west would say yes  he had been tolerably sure she cared for him then why this doubtthis hesitation  she was not a school girl to be uncertain as to her own mind  he felt an ugly shock of disappointment and dismay  but he assented to her request with his unfailing gentle courtesy and went away at once  i will tell you in a few days said rosemary with downcast eyes and burning face  when the door shut behind him she went back into the room and wrung her hands    chapter xxii st george knows all about it  at midnight ellen west was walking home from the pollock silver wedding  she had stayed a little while after the other guests had gone to help the grayhaired bride wash the dishes  the distance between the two houses was not far and the road good so that ellen was enjoying the walk back home in the moonlight  the evening had been a pleasant one  ellen who had not been to a party for years found it very pleasant  all the guests had been members of her old set and there was no intrusive youth to spoil the flavour for the only son of the bride and groom was far away at college and could not be present  norman douglas had been there and they had met socially for the first time in years though she had seen him once or twice in church that winter  not the least sentiment was awakened in ellens heart by their meeting  she was accustomed to wonder when she thought about it at all how she could ever have fancied him or felt so badly over his sudden marriage  but she had rather liked meeting him again she had forgotten how bracing and stimulating he could be  no gathering was ever stagnant when norman douglas was present everybody had been surprised when norman came  it was well known he never went anywhere  the pollocks had invited him because he had been one of the original guests but they never thought he would come  he had taken his second cousin amy annetta douglas out to supper and seemed rather attentive to her  but ellen sat across the table from him and had a spirited argument with himan argument during which all his shouting and banter could not fluster her and in which she came off best flooring norman so composedly and so completely that he was silent for ten minutes  at the end of which time he had muttered in his ruddy beardspunky as everspunky as everand began to hector amy annetta who giggled foolishly over his sallies where ellen would have retorted bitingly  ellen thought these things over as she walked home tasting them with reminiscent relish  the moonlit air sparkled with frost the snow crisped under her feet  below her lay the glen with the white harbour beyond  there was a light in the manse study  so john meredith had gone home  had he asked rosemary to marry him and after what fashion had she made her refusal known  ellen felt that she would never know this though she was quite curious  she was sure rosemary would never tell her anything about it and she would not dare to ask  she must just be content with the fact of the refusal  after all that was the only thing that really mattered  i hope hell have sense enough to come back once in a while and be friendly she said to herself  she disliked so much to be alone that thinking aloud was one of her devices for circumventing unwelcome solitude  its awful never to have a manbody with some brains to talk to once in a while  and like as not hell never come near the house again  theres norman douglas tooi like that man and id like to have a good rousing argument with him now and then  but hed never dare come up for fear people would think he was courting me againfor fear id think it too most likelythough hes more a stranger to me now than john meredith  it seems like a dream that we could ever have been beaus  but there it istheres only two men in the glen id ever want to talk toand what with gossip and this wretched lovemaking business its not likely ill ever see either of them again  i could said ellen addressing the unmoved stars with a spiteful emphasis i could have made a better world myself  she paused at her gate with a sudden vague feeling of alarm there was still a light in the livingroom and to and fro across the windowshades went the shadow of a woman walking restlessly up and down  what was rosemary doing up at this hour of the night  and why was she striding about like a lunatic  ellen went softly in  as she opened the hall door rosemary came out of the room  she was flushed and breathless  an atmosphere of stress and passion hung about her like a garment  why arent you in bed rosemary demanded ellen  come in here said rosemary intensely  i want to tell you something  ellen composedly removed her wraps and overshoes and followed her sister into the warm firelighted room  she stood with her hand on the table and waited  she was looking very handsome herself in her own grim blackbrowed style  the new black velvet dress with its train and vneck which she had made purposely for the party became her stately massive figure  she wore coiled around her neck the rich heavy necklace of amber beads which was a family heirloom  her walk in the frosty air had stung her cheeks into a glowing scarlet  but her steelblue eyes were as icy and unyielding as the sky of the winter night she stood waiting in a silence which rosemary could break only by a convulsive effort  ellen mr meredith was here this evening  yes  andandhe asked me to marry him  so i expected  of course you refused him  no  rosemary  ellen clenched her hands and took an involuntary step forward  do you mean to tell me that you accepted him  nono  ellen recovered her selfcommand  what did you do then  ii asked him to give me a few days to think it over  i hardly see why that was necessary said ellen coldly contemptuous when there is only the one answer you can make him  rosemary held out her hands beseechingly  ellen she said desperately i love john meredithi want to be his wife  will you set me free from that promise  no said ellen merciless because she was sick from fear  ellenellen  listen interrupted ellen  i did not ask you for that promise  you offered it  i knowi know  but i did not think then that i could ever care for anyone again  you offered it went on ellen unmovably  you promised it over our mothers bible  it was more than a promiseit was an oath now you want to break it  i only asked you to set me free from it ellen  i will not do it  a promise is a promise in my eyes  i will not do it  break your promisebe forsworn if you willbut it shall not be with any assent of mine  you are very hard on me ellen  hard on you  and what of me  have you ever given a thought to what my loneliness would be here if you left me  i could not bear iti would go crazy  i cannot live alone  havent i been a good sister to you  have i ever opposed any wish of yours havent i indulged you in everything  yesyes  then why do you want to leave me for this man whom you hadnt seen a year ago  i love him ellen  love  you talk like a school miss instead of a middleaged woman  he doesnt love you  he wants a housekeeper and a governess  you dont love him  you want to be mrsyou are one of those weakminded women who think its a disgrace to be ranked as an old maid  thats all there is to it  rosemary quivered  ellen could not or would not understand there was no use arguing with her  so you wont release me ellen  no i wont  and i wont talk of it again  you promised and youve got to keep your word  thats all  go to bed  look at the time  youre all romantic and worked up  tomorrow youll be more sensible  at any rate dont let me hear any more of this nonsense  go  rosemary went without another word pale and spiritless  ellen walked stormily about the room for a few minutes then paused before the chair where st george had been calmly sleeping through the whole evening  a reluctant smile overspread her dark face  there had been only one time in her lifethe time of her mothers deathwhen ellen had not been able to temper tragedy with comedy  even in that long ago bitterness when norman douglas had after a fashion jilted her she had laughed at herself quite as often as she had cried  i expect therell be some sulking st george  yes saint i expect we are in for a few unpleasant foggy days  well well weather them through george  weve dealt with foolish children before saint  rosemaryll sulk a whileand then shell get over itand all will be as before george  she promisedand shes got to keep her promise  and thats the last word on the subject ill say to you or her or anyone saint  but ellen lay savagely awake till morning  there was no sulking however  rosemary was pale and quiet the next day but beyond that ellen could detect no difference in her  certainly she seemed to bear ellen no grudge  it was stormy so no mention was made of going to church  in the afternoon rosemary shut herself in her room and wrote a note to john meredith  she could not trust herself to say no in person  she felt quite sure that if he suspected she was saying no reluctantly he would not take it for an answer and she could not face pleading or entreaty  she must make him think she cared nothing at all for him and she could do that only by letter  she wrote him the stiffest coolest little refusal imaginable  it was barely courteous it certainly left no loophole of hope for the boldest loverand john meredith was anything but that  he shrank into himself hurt and mortified when he read rosemarys letter next day in his dusty study  but under his mortification a dreadful realization presently made itself felt  he had thought he did not love rosemary as deeply as he had loved cecilia  now when he had lost her he knew that he did  she was everything to himeverything  and he must put her out of his life completely  even friendship was impossible now  life stretched before him in intolerable dreariness  he must go onthere was his workhis childrenbut the heart had gone out of him  he sat alone all that evening in his dark cold comfortless study with his head bowed on his hands  up on the hill rosemary had a headache and went early to bed while ellen remarked to st george purring his disdain of foolish humankind who did not know that a soft cushion was the only thing that really mattered  what would women do if headaches had never been invented st george  but never mind saint  well just wink the other eye for a few weeks  i admit i dont feel comfortable myself george   i feel as if i had drowned a kitten  but she promised saintand she was the one to offer it george  bismillah    chapter xxiii the goodconduct club  a light rain had been falling all daya little delicate beautiful spring rain that somehow seemed to hint and whisper of mayflowers and wakening violets  the harbour and the gulf and the lowlying shore fields had been dim with pearlgray mists but now in the evening the rain had ceased and the mists had blown out to sea  clouds sprinkled the sky over the harbour like little fiery roses  beyond it the hills were dark against a spendthrift splendour of daffodil and crimson  a great silvery evening star was watching over the bar  a brisk dancing newsprung wind was blowing up from rainbow valley resinous with the odours of fir and damp mosses  it crooned in the old spruces around the graveyard and ruffled faiths splendid curls as she sat on hezekiah pollocks tombstone with her arms round mary vance and una  carl and jerry were sitting opposite them on another tombstone and all were rather full of mischief after being cooped up all day  the air just shines tonight doesnt it  its been washed so clean you see said faith happily  mary vance eyed her gloomily  knowing what she knew or fancied she knew mary considered that faith was far too lighthearted mary had something on her mind to say and she meant to say it before she went home  mrs elliott had sent her up to the manse with some newlaid eggs and had told her not to stay longer than half an hour  the half hour was nearly up so mary uncurled her cramped legs from under her and said abruptly  never mind about the air  just you listen to me  you manse young ones have just got to behave yourselves better than youve been doing this springthats all there is to it  i just come up tonight apurpose to tell you so  the way people are talking about you is awful  what have we been doing now cried faith in amazement pulling her arm away from mary  unas lips trembled and her sensitive little soul shrank within her  mary was always so brutally frank  jerry began to whistle out of bravado  he meant to let mary see he didnt care for her tirades  their behaviour was no business of hers anyway  what right had she to lecture them on their conduct  doing now  youre doing all the time retorted mary  just as soon as the talk about one of your didos fades away you do something else to start it up again  it seems to me you havent any idea of how manse children ought to behave  maybe you can tell us said jerry killingly sarcastic  sarcasm was quite thrown away on mary  i can tell you what will happen if you dont learn to behave yourselves  the session will ask your father to resign  there now master jerryknowitall  mrs alec davis said so to mrs elliott  i heard her  i always have my ears pricked up when mrs alec davis comes to tea  she said you were all going from bad to worse and that though it was only what was to be expected when you had nobody to bring you up still the congregation couldnt be expected to put up with it much longer and something would have to be done  the methodists just laugh and laugh at you and that hurts the presbyterian feelings  she says you all need a good dose of birch tonic  lor if that would make folks good i oughter be a young saint  im not telling you this because i want to hurt your feelings  im sorry for youmary was past mistress of the gentle art of condescension  i understand that you havent much chance the way things are  but other people dont make as much allowance as i do  miss drew says carl had a frog in his pocket in sunday school last sunday and it hopped out while she was hearing the lesson  she says shes going to give up the class  why dont you keep your insecks home  i popped it right back in again said carl  it didnt hurt anybodya poor little frog  and i wish old jane drew would give up our class  i hate her  her own nephew had a dirty plug of tobacco in his pocket and offered us fellows a chew when elder clow was praying  i guess thats worse than a frog  no cause frogs are more unexpectedlike  they make more of a sensation  sides he wasnt caught at it  and then that praying competition you had last week has made a fearful scandal everybody is talking about it  why the blythes were in that as well as us cried faith indignantly  it was nan blythe who suggested it in the first place  and walter took the prize  well you get the credit of it any way  it wouldnt have been so bad if you hadnt had it in the graveyard  i should think a graveyard was a very good place to pray in retorted jerry  deacon hazard drove past when you were praying said mary and he saw and heard you with your hands folded over your stomach and groaning after every sentence  he thought you were making fun of him  so i was declared unabashed jerry  only i didnt know he was going by of course  that was just a mean accident  i wasnt praying in real earnesti knew i had no chance of winning the prize  so i was just getting what fun i could out of it  walter blythe can pray bully  why he can pray as well as dad  una is the only one of us who really likes praying said faith pensively  well if praying scandalizes people so much we mustnt do it any more sighed una  shucks you can pray all you want to only not in the graveyardand dont make a game of it  that was what made it so badthat and having a teaparty on the tombstones  we hadnt  well a soapbubble party then  you had something  the overharbour people swear you had a teaparty but im willing to take your word  and you used this tombstone as a table  well martha wouldnt let us blow bubbles in the house  she was awful cross that day explained jerry  and this old slab made such a jolly table  werent they pretty cried faith her eyes sparkling over the remembrance  they reflected the trees and the hills and the harbour like little fairy worlds and when we shook them loose they floated away down to rainbow valley  all but one and it went over and bust up on the methodist spire said carl  im glad we did it once anyhow before we found out it was wrong said faith  it wouldnt have been wrong to blow them on the lawn said mary impatiently  seems like i cant knock any sense into your heads  youve been told often enough you shouldnt play in the graveyard  the methodists are sensitive about it  we forget said faith dolefully  and the lawn is so smalland so caterpillaryand so full of shrubs and things  we cant be in rainbow valley all the timeand where are we to go  its the things you do in the graveyard  it wouldnt matter if you just sat here and talked quiet same as were doing now well i dont know what is going to come of it all but i do know that elder warren is going to speak to your pa about it  deacon hazard is his cousin  i wish they wouldnt bother father about us said una  well people think he ought to bother himself about you a little more  i donti understand him  hes a child in some ways himselfthats what he is and needs some one to look after him as bad as you do  well perhaps hell have some one before long if all tales is true  what do you mean asked faith  havent you got any ideahonest demanded mary  no no  what do you mean  well you are a lot of innocents upon my word  why everybody is talking of it  your pa goes to see rosemary west  she is going to be your stepma  i dont believe it cried una flushing crimson  well i dunno  i just go by what folks say  i dont give it for a fact  but it would be a good thing  rosemary westd make you toe the mark if she came here ill bet a cent for all shes so sweet and smiley on the face of her  theyre always that way till theyve caught them  but you need some one to bring you up  youre disgracing your pa and i feel for him ive always thought an awful lot of your pa ever since that night he talked to me so nice  ive never said a single swear word since or told a lie  and id like to see him happy and comfortable with his buttons on and his meals decent and you young ones licked into shape and that old cat of a martha put in her proper place  the way she looked at the eggs i brought her tonight  i hope theyre fresh says she  i just wished they was rotten  but you just mind that she gives you all one for breakfast including your pa  make a fuss if she doesnt  that was what they was sent up forbut i dont trust old martha shes quite capable of feeding em to her cat  marys tongue being temporarily tired a brief silence fell over the graveyard  the manse children did not feel like talking they were digesting the new and not altogether palatable ideas mary had suggested to them  jerry and carl were somewhat startled  but after all what did it matter  and it wasnt likely there was a word of truth in it  faith on the whole was pleased  only una was seriously upset  she felt that she would like to get away and cry  will there be any stars in my crown sang the methodist choir beginning to practise in the methodist church  i want just three said mary whose theological knowledge had increased notably since her residence with mrs elliott  just threesetting up on my head like a corownet a big one in the middle and a small one each side  are there different sizes in souls asked carl  of course  why little babies must have smaller ones than big men  well its getting dark and i must scoot home  mrs elliott doesnt like me to be out after dark  laws when i lived with mrs wiley the dark was just the same as the daylight to me i didnt mind it no moren a gray cat  them days seem a hundred years ago  now you mind what ive said and try to behave yourselves for you pas sake  ill always back you up and defend youyou can be dead sure of that  mrs elliott says she never saw the like of me for sticking up for my friends  i was real sassy to mrs alec davis about you and mrs elliott combed me down for it afterwards  the fair cornelia has a tongue of her own and no mistake  but she was pleased underneath for all cause she hates old kitty alec and shes real fond of you  i can see through folks  mary sailed off excellently well pleased with herself leaving a rather depressed little group behind her  mary vance always says something that makes us feel bad when she comes up said una resentfully  i wish wed left her to starve in the old barn said jerry vindictively  oh thats wicked jerry rebuked una  may as well have the game as the name retorted unrepentant jerry  if people say were so bad lets be bad  but not if it hurts father pleaded faith  jerry squirmed uncomfortably  he adored his father  through the unshaded study window they could see mr meredith at his desk he did not seem to be either reading or writing  his head was in his hands and there was something in his whole attitude that spoke of weariness and dejection  the children suddenly felt it  i dare say somebodys been worrying him about us today said faith  i wish we could get along without making people talk ohjem blythe  how you scared me  jem blythe had slipped into the graveyard and sat down beside the girls he had been prowling about rainbow valley and had succeeded in finding the first little starwhite cluster of arbutus for his mother  the manse children were rather silent after his coming  jem was beginning to grow away from them somewhat this spring  he was studying for the entrance examination of queens academy and stayed after school with the older pupils for extra lessons  also his evenings were so full of work that he seldom joined the others in rainbow valley now he seemed to be drifting away into grownup land  what is the matter with you all tonight he asked  theres no fun in you  not much agreed faith dolefully  there wouldnt be much fun in you either if you knew you were disgracing your father and making people talk about you  whos been talking about you now  everybodyso mary vance says  and faith poured out her troubles to sympathetic jem  you see she concluded dolefully weve nobody to bring us up  and so we get into scrapes and people think were bad  why dont you bring yourselves up suggested jem  ill tell you what to do  form a goodconduct club and punish yourselves every time you do anything thats not right  thats a good idea said faith struck by it  but she added doubtfully things that dont seem a bit of harm to us seem simply dreadful to other people  how can we tell  we cant be bothering father all the timeand he has to be away a lot anyhow  you could mostly tell if you stopped to think a thing over before doing it and ask yourselves what the congregation would say about it said jem  the trouble is you just rush into things and dont think them over at all  mother says youre all too impulsive just as she used to be  the goodconduct club would help you to think if you were fair and honest about punishing yourselves when you broke the rules  youd have to punish in some way that really hurt or it wouldnt do any good  whip each other  not exactly  youd have to think up different ways of punishment to suit the person  you wouldnt punish each otheryoud punish yourselves  i read all about such a club in a storybook  you try it and see how it works  lets said faith and when jem was gone they agreed they would  if things arent right weve just got to make them right said faith resolutely  weve got to be fair and square as jem says said jerry this is a club to bring ourselves up seeing theres nobody else to do it  theres no use in having many rules  lets just have one and any of us that breaks it has got to be punished hard  but how  well think that up as we go along  well hold a session of the club here in the graveyard every night and talk over what weve done through the day and if we think weve done anything that isnt right or that would disgrace dad the one that does it or is responsible for it must be punished  thats the rule  well all decide on the kind of punishmentit must be made to fit the crime as mr flagg says  and the one thats guilty will be bound to carry it out and no shirking  theres going to be fun in this concluded jerry with a relish  you suggested the soapbubble party said faith  but that was before wed formed the club said jerry hastily everything starts from tonight  but what if we cant agree on whats right or what the punishment ought to be  spose two of us thought of one thing and two another  there ought to be five in a club like this  we can ask jem blythe to be umpire  he is the squarest boy in glen st mary  but i guess we can settle our own affairs mostly  we want to keep this as much of a secret as we can dont breathe a word to mary vance  shed want to join and do the bringing up  i think said faith that theres no use in spoiling every day by dragging punishments in  lets have a punishment day  wed better choose saturday because there is no school to interfere suggested una  and spoil the one holiday in the week cried faith  not much no lets take friday  thats fish day anyhow and we all hate fish  we may as well have all the disagreeable things in one day  then other days we can go ahead and have a good time  nonsense said jerry authoritatively  such a scheme wouldnt work at all  well just punish ourselves as we go along and keep a clear slate  now we all understand dont we  this is a goodconduct club for the purpose of bringing ourselves up  we agree to punish ourselves for bad conduct and always to stop before we do anything no matter what and ask ourselves if it is likely to hurt dad in any way and any one who shirks is to be cast out of the club and never allowed to play with the rest of us in rainbow valley again  jem blythe to be umpire in case of disputes  no more taking bugs to sunday school carl and no more chewing gum in public if you please miss faith  no more making fun of elders praying or going to the methodist prayer meeting retorted faith  why it isnt any harm to go to the methodist prayer meeting protested jerry in amazement  mrs elliott says it is she says manse children have no business to go anywhere but to presbyterian things  darn it i wont give up going to the methodist prayer meeting cried jerry  its ten times more fun than ours is  you said a naughty word cried faith  now youve got to punish yourself  not till its all down in black and white  were only talking the club over  it isnt really formed until weve written it out and signed it  theres got to be a constitution and bylaws and you know theres nothing wrong in going to a prayer meeting  but its not only the wrong things were to punish ourselves for but anything that might hurt father  it wont hurt anybody  you know mrs elliott is cracked on the subject of methodists  nobody else makes any fuss about my going  i always behave myself  you ask jem or mrs blythe and see what they say  ill abide by their opinion  im going for the paper now and ill bring out the lantern and well all sign  fifteen minutes later the document was solemnly signed on hezekiah pollocks tombstone on the centre of which stood the smoky manse lantern while the children knelt around it  mrs elder clow was going past at the moment and next day all the glen heard that the manse children had been having another praying competition and had wound it up by chasing each other all over the graves with a lantern  this piece of embroidery was probably suggested by the fact that after the signing and sealing was completed carl had taken the lantern and had walked circumspectly to the little hollow to examine his anthill  the others had gone quietly into the manse and to bed  do you think it is true that father is going to marry miss west  una had tremulously asked of faith after their prayers had been said  i dont know but id like it said faith  oh i wouldnt said una chokingly  she is nice the way she is  but mary vance says it changes people altogether to be made stepmothers  they get horrid cross and mean and hateful then and turn your father against you  she says theyre sure to do that  she never knew it to fail in a single case  i dont believe miss west would ever try to do that cried faith  mary says anybody would  she knows all about stepmothers faithshe says shes seen hundreds of themand youve never seen one  oh mary has told me bloodcurdling things about them she says she knew of one who whipped her husbands little girls on their bare shoulders till they bled and then shut them up in a cold dark coal cellar all night  she says theyre all aching to do things like that  i dont believe miss west would  you dont know her as well as i do una  just think of that sweet little bird she sent me  i love it far more even than adam  its just being a stepmother changes them  mary says they cant help it  i wouldnt mind the whippings so much as having father hate us  you know nothing could make father hate us  dont be silly una  i dare say theres nothing to worry over  likely if we run our club right and bring ourselves up properly father wont think of marrying any one  and if he does i know miss west will be lovely to us  but una had no such conviction and she cried herself to sleep    chapter xxiv a charitable impulse  for a fortnight things ran smoothly in the goodconduct club  it seemed to work admirably  not once was jem blythe called in as umpire  not once did any of the manse children set the glen gossips by the ears  as for their minor peccadilloes at home they kept sharp tabs on each other and gamely underwent their selfimposed punishmentgenerally a voluntary absence from some gay friday night frolic in rainbow valley or a sojourn in bed on some spring evening when all young bones ached to be out and away  faith for whispering in sunday school condemned herself to pass a whole day without speaking a single word unless it was absolutely necessary and accomplished it  it was rather unfortunate that mr baker from overharbour should have chosen that evening for calling at the manse and that faith should have happened to go to the door  not one word did she reply to his genial greeting but went silently away to call her father briefly  mr baker was slightly offended and told his wife when he went home that that the biggest meredith girl seemed a very shy sulky little thing without manners enough to speak when she was spoken to  but nothing worse came of it and generally their penances did no harm to themselves or anybody else  all of them were beginning to feel quite cocksure that after all it was a very easy matter to bring yourself up  i guess people will soon see that we can behave ourselves properly as well as anybody said faith jubilantly  it isnt hard when we put our minds to it  she and una were sitting on the pollock tombstone  it had been a cold raw wet day of spring storm and rainbow valley was out of the question for girls though the manse and the ingleside boys were down there fishing  the rain had held up but the east wind blew mercilessly in from the sea cutting to bone and marrow spring was late in spite of its early promise and there was even yet a hard drift of old snow and ice in the northern corner of the graveyard  lida marsh who had come up to bring the manse a mess of herring slipped in through the gate shivering  she belonged to the fishing village at the harbour mouth and her father had for thirty years made a practice of sending a mess from his first spring catch to the manse  he never darkened a church door he was a hard drinker and a reckless man but as long as he sent those herring up to the manse every spring as his father had done before him he felt comfortably sure that his account with the powers that govern was squared for the year  he would not have expected a good mackerel catch if he had not so sent the first fruits of the season  lida was a mite of ten and looked younger because she was such a small wizened little creature  tonight as she sidled boldly enough up to the manse girls she looked as if she had never been warm since she was born  her face was purple and her paleblue bold little eyes were red and watery  she wore a tattered print dress and a ragged woollen comforter tied across her thin shoulders and under her arms  she had walked the three miles from the harbour mouth barefooted over a road where there was still snow and slush and mud  her feet and legs were as purple as her face  but lida did not mind this much  she was used to being cold and she had been going barefooted for a month already like all the other swarming young fry of the fishing village  there was no selfpity in her heart as she sat down on the tombstone and grinned cheerfully at faith and una  faith and una grinned cheerfully back  they knew lida slightly having met her once or twice the preceding summer when they had gone down the harbour with the blythes  hello said lida aint this a fierce kind of a night taint fit for a dog to be out is it  then why are you out asked faith  pa made me bring you up some herring returned lida  she shivered coughed and stuck out her bare feet  lida was not thinking about herself or her feet and was making no bid for sympathy  she held her feet out instinctively to keep them from the wet grass around the tombstone  but faith and una were instantly swamped with a wave of pity for her  she looked so coldso miserable  oh why are you barefooted on such a cold night cried faith your feet must be almost frozen  pretty near said lida proudly  i tell you it was fierce walking up that harbour road  why didnt you put on your shoes and stockings asked una  haint none to put on  all i had was wore out by the time winter was over said lida indifferently  for a moment faith stated in horror  this was terrible  here was a little girl almost a neighbour half frozen because she had no shoes or stockings in this cruel spring weather impulsive faith thought of nothing but the dreadfulness of it in a moment she was pulling off her own shoes and stockings  here take these and put them right on she said forcing them into the hands of the astonished lida  quick now  youll catch your death of cold  ive got others  put them right on  lida recovering her wits snatched at the offered gift with a sparkle in her dull eyes  sure she would put them on and that mighty quick before any one appeared with authority to recall them  in a minute she had pulled the stockings over her scrawny little legs and slipped faiths shoes over her thick little ankles  im obliged to you she said but wont your folks be cross  noand i dont care if they are said faith  do you think i could see any one freezing to death without helping them if i could  it wouldnt be right especially when my fathers a minister  will you want them back  its awful cold down at the harbour mouthlong after its warm up here said lida slyly  no youre to keep them of course  that is what i meant when i gave them  i have another pair of shoes and plenty of stockings  lida had meant to stay awhile and talk to the girls about many things  but now she thought she had better get away before somebody came and made her yield up her booty  so she shuffled off through the bitter twilight in the noiseless shadowy way she had slipped in  as soon as she was out of sight of the manse she sat down took off the shoes and stockings and put them in her herring basket  she had no intention of keeping them on down that dirty harbour road  they were to be kept good for gala occasions  not another little girl down at the harbour mouth had such fine black cashmere stockings and such smart almost new shoes  lida was furnished forth for the summer  she had no qualms in the matter  in her eyes the manse people were quite fabulously rich and no doubt those girls had slathers of shoes and stockings  then lida ran down to the glen village and played for an hour with the boys before mr flaggs store splashing about in a pool of slush with the maddest of them until mrs elliott came along and bade her begone home  i dont think faith that you should have done that said una a little reproachfully after lida had gone  youll have to wear your good boots every day now and theyll soon scuff out  i dont care cried faith still in the fine glow of having done a kindness to a fellow creature  it isnt fair that i should have two pairs of shoes and poor little lida marsh not have any  now we both have a pair  you know perfectly well una that father said in his sermon last sunday that there was no real happiness in getting or havingonly in giving  and its true  i feel far happier now than i ever did in my whole life before  just think of lida walking home this very minute with her poor little feet all nice and warm and comfy  you know you havent another pair of black cashmere stockings said una  your other pair were so full of holes that aunt martha said she couldnt darn them any more and she cut the legs up for stove dusters  youve nothing but those two pairs of striped stockings you hate so  all the glow and uplift went out of faith  her gladness collapsed like a pricked balloon  she sat for a few dismal minutes in silence facing the consequences of her rash act  oh una i never thought of that she said dolefully  i didnt stop to think at all  the striped stockings were thick heavy coarse ribbed stockings of blue and red which aunt martha had knit for faith in the winter  they were undoubtedly hideous  faith loathed them as she had never loathed anything before  wear them she certainly would not  they were still unworn in her bureau drawer  youll have to wear the striped stockings after this said una just think how the boys in school will laugh at you  you know how they laugh at mamie warren for her striped stockings and call her barber pole and yours are far worse  i wont wear them said faith  ill go barefooted first cold as it is  you cant go barefooted to church tomorrow  think what people would say  then ill stay home  you cant  you know very well aunt martha will make you go  faith did know this  the one thing on which aunt martha troubled herself to insist was that they must all go to church rain or shine  how they were dressed or if they were dressed at all never concerned her  but go they must  that was how aunt martha had been brought up seventy years ago and that was how she meant to bring them up  havent you got a pair you can lend me una said poor faith piteously  una shook her head  no you know i only have the one black pair  and theyre so tight i can hardly get them on  they wouldnt go on you  neither would my gray ones  besides the legs of them are all darned and darned  i wont wear those striped stockings said faith stubbornly the feel of them is even worse than the looks  they make me feel as if my legs were as big as barrels and theyre so scratchy  well i dont know what youre going to do  if father was home id go and ask him to get me a new pair before the store closes  but he wont be home till too late ill ask him mondayand i wont go to church tomorrow  ill pretend im sick and aunt marthall have to let me stay home  that would be acting a lie faith cried una  you cant do that  you know it would be dreadful  what would father say if he knew  dont you remember how he talked to us after mother died and told us we must always be true no matter what else we failed in  he said we must never tell or act a liehe said hed trust us not to  you cant do it faith  just wear the striped stockings  itll only be for once  nobody will notice them in church  it isnt like school  and your new brown dress is so long they wont show much  wasnt it lucky aunt martha made it big so youd have room to grow in it for all you hated it so when she finished it  i wont wear those stockings repeated faith  she uncoiled her bare white legs from the tombstone and deliberately walked through the wet cold grass to the bank of snow  setting her teeth she stepped upon it and stood there  what are you doing cried una aghast  youll catch your death of cold faith meredith  im trying to answered faith  i hope ill catch a fearful cold and be awful sick tomorrow  then i wont be acting a lie im going to stand here as long as i can bear it  but faith you might really die  you might get pneumonia please faith dont  lets go into the house and get something for your feet  oh heres jerry  im so thankful  jerry make faith get off that snow  look at her feet  holy cats faith what are you doing demanded jerry  are you crazy  no  go away snapped faith  then are you punishing yourself for something  it isnt right if you are  youll be sick  i want to be sick  im not punishing myself  go away  wheres her shoes and stockings asked jerry of una  she gave them to lida marsh  lida marsh  what for  because lida had noneand her feet were so cold  and now she wants to be sick so that she wont have to go to church tomorrow and wear her striped stockings  but jerry she may die  faith said jerry get off that icebank or ill pull you off  pull away dared faith  jerry sprang at her and caught her arms  he pulled one way and faith pulled another  una ran behind faith and pushed  faith stormed at jerry to leave her alone  jerry stormed back at her not to be a dizzy idiot and una cried  they made no end of noise and they were close to the road fence of the graveyard henry warren and his wife drove by and heard and saw them  very soon the glen heard that the manse children had been having an awful fight in the graveyard and using most improper language meanwhile faith had allowed herself to be pulled off the ice because her feet were aching so sharply that she was ready to get off any way  they all went in amiably and went to bed  faith slept like a cherub and woke in the morning without a trace of a cold  she felt that she couldnt feign sickness and act a lie after remembering that longago talk with her father  but she was still as fully determined as ever that she would not wear those abominable stockings to church    chapter xxv another scandal and another explanation  faith went early to sunday school and was seated in the corner of her class pew before any one came  therefore the dreadful truth did not burst upon any one until faith left the class pew near the door to walk up to the manse pew after sunday school  the church was already half filled and all who were sitting near the aisle saw that the ministers daughter had boots on but no stockings  faiths new brown dress which aunt martha had made from an ancient pattern was absurdly long for her but even so it did not meet her boottops  two good inches of bare white leg showed plainly  faith and carl sat alone in the manse pew  jerry had gone into the gallery to sit with a chum and the blythe girls had taken una with them  the meredith children were given to sitting all over the church in this fashion and a great many people thought it very improper  the gallery especially where irresponsible lads congregated and were known to whisper and suspected of chewing tobacco during service was no place for a son of the manse but jerry hated the manse pew at the very top of the church under the eyes of elder clow and his family  he escaped from it whenever he could  carl absorbed in watching a spider spinning its web at the window did not notice faiths legs  she walked home with her father after church and he never noticed them  she got on the hated striped stockings before jerry and una arrived so that for the time being none of the occupants of the manse knew what she had done  but nobody else in glen st mary was ignorant of it the few who had not seen soon heard  nothing else was talked of on the way home from church  mrs alec davis said it was only what she expected and the next thing you would see some of those young ones coming to church with no clothes on at all  the president of the ladies aid decided that she would bring the matter up at the next aid meeting and suggest that they wait in a body on the minister and protest  miss cornelia said that she for her part gave up  there was no use worrying over the manse fry any longer  even mrs dr blythe felt a little shocked though she attributed the occurrence solely to faiths forgetfulness  susan could not immediately begin knitting stockings for faith because it was sunday but she had one set up before any one else was out of bed at ingleside the next morning  you need not tell me anything but that it was old marthas fault mrs dr dear she told anne  i suppose that poor little child had no decent stockings to wear  i suppose every stocking she had was in holes as you know very well they generally are  and i think mrs dr dear that the ladies aid would be better employed in knitting some for them than in fighting over the new carpet for the pulpit platform  i am not a ladies aider but i shall knit faith two pairs of stockings out of this nice black yarn as fast as my fingers can move and that you may tie to  never shall i forget my sensations mrs dr dear when i saw a ministers child walking up the aisle of our church with no stockings on  i really did not know what way to look  and the church was just full of methodists yesterday too groaned miss cornelia who had come up to the glen to do some shopping and run into ingleside to talk the affair over  i dont know how it is but just as sure as those manse children do something especially awful the church is sure to be crowded with methodists  i thought mrs deacon hazards eyes would drop out of her head  when she came out of church she said well that exhibition was no more than decent  i do pity the presbyterians  and we just had to take it  there was nothing one could say  there was something i could have said mrs dr dear if i had heard her said susan grimly  i would have said for one thing that in my opinion clean bare legs were quite as decent as holes  and i would have said for another that the presbyterians did not feel greatly in need of pity seeing that they had a minister who could preach and the methodists had not i could have squelched mrs deacon hazard mrs dr dear and that you may tie to  i wish mr meredith didnt preach quite so well and looked after his family a little better retorted miss cornelia  he could at least glance over his children before they went to church and see that they were quite properly clothed  im tired making excuses for him believe me  meanwhile faiths soul was being harrowed up in rainbow valley mary vance was there and as usual in a lecturing mood  she gave faith to understand that she had disgraced herself and her father beyond redemption and that she mary vance was done with her  everybody was talking and everybody said the same thing  i simply feel that i cant associate with you any longer she concluded  we are going to associate with her then cried nan blythe  nan secretly thought faith had done a awful thing but she wasnt going to let mary vance run matters in this highhanded fashion and if you are not you neednt come any more to rainbow valley miss vance  nan and di both put their arms around faith and glared defiance at mary  the latter suddenly crumpled up sat down on a stump and began to cry  it aint that i dont want to she wailed  but if i keep in with faith peoplell be saying i put her up to doing things some are saying it now trues you live  i cant afford to have such things said of me now that im in a respectable place and trying to be a lady  and i never went barelegged in church in my toughest days  id never have thought of doing such a thing but that hateful old kitty alec says faith has never been the same girl since that time i stayed in the manse  she says cornelia elliott will live to rue the day she took me in  it hurts my feelings i tell you  but its mr meredith im really worried over  i think you neednt worry about him said di scornfully  it isnt likely necessary  now faith darling stop crying and tell us why you did it  faith explained tearfully  the blythe girls sympathized with her and even mary vance agreed that it was a hard position to be in  but jerry on whom the thing came like a thunderbolt refused to be placated  so this was what some mysterious hints he had got in school that day meant  he marched faith and una home without ceremony and the goodconduct club held an immediate session in the graveyard to sit in judgment on faiths case  i dont see that it was any harm said faith defiantly  not much of my legs showed  it wasnt wrong and it didnt hurt anybody  it will hurt dad  you know it will  you know people blame him whenever we do anything queer  i didnt think of that muttered faith  thats just the trouble  you didnt think and you should have thought  thats what our club is forto bring us up and make us think  we promised wed always stop and think before doing things  you didnt and youve got to be punished faithand real hard too  youll wear those striped stockings to school for a week for punishment  oh jerry wont a day dotwo days  not a whole week  yes a whole week said inexorable jerry  it is fairask jem blythe if it isnt  faith felt she would rather submit then ask jem blythe about such a matter  she was beginning to realize that her offence was a quite shameful one  ill do it then she muttered a little sulkily  youre getting off easy said jerry severely  and no matter how we punish you it wont help father people will always think you just did it for mischief and theyll blame father for not stopping it  we can never explain it to everybody  this aspect of the case weighed on faiths mind  her own condemnation she could bear but it tortured her that her father should be blamed if people knew the true facts of the case they would not blame him  but how could she make them known to all the world  getting up in church as she had once done and explaining the matter was out of the question  faith had heard from mary vance how the congregation had looked upon that performance and realized that she must not repeat it  faith worried over the problem for half a week  then she had an inspiration and promptly acted upon it  she spent that evening in the garret with a lamp and an exercise book writing busily with flushed cheeks and shining eyes  it was the very thing how clever she was to have thought of it  it would put everything right and explain everything and yet cause no scandal it was eleven oclock when she had finished to her satisfaction and crept down to bed dreadfully tired but perfectly happy  in a few days the little weekly published in the glen under the name of the journal came out as usual and the glen had another sensation  a letter signed faith meredith occupied a prominent place on the front page and ran as follows  to whom it may concern  i want to explain to everybody how it was i came to go to church without stockings on so that everybody will know that father was not to blame one bit for it and the old gossips need not say he is because it is not true  i gave my only pair of black stockings to lida marsh because she hadnt any and her poor little feet were awful cold and i was so sorry for her  no child ought to have to go without shoes and stockings in a christian community before the snow is all gone and i think the w f m s ought to have given her stockings  of course i know they are sending things to the little heathen children and that is all right and a kind thing to do  but the little heathen children have lots more warm weather than we have and i think the women of our church ought to look after lida and not leave it all to me  when i gave her my stockings i forgot they were the only black pair i had without holes but i am glad i did give them to her because my conscience would have been uncomfortable if i hadnt  when she had gone away looking so proud and happy the poor little thing i remembered that all i had to wear were the horrid red and blue things aunt martha knit last winter for me out of some yarn that mrs joseph burr of upper glen sent us  it was dreadfully coarse yarn and all knots and i never saw any of mrs burrs own children wearing things made of such yarn  but mary vance says mrs burr gives the minister stuff that she cant use or eat herself and thinks it ought to go as part of the salary her husband signed to pay but never does  i just couldnt bear to wear those hateful stockings  they were so ugly and rough and felt so scratchy  everybody would have made fun of me  i thought at first id pretend to be sick and not go to church next day but i decided i couldnt do that because it would be acting a lie and father told us after mother died that was something we must never never do  it is just as bad to act a lie as to tell one though i know some people right here in the glen who act them and never seem to feel a bit bad about it  i will not mention any names but i know who they are and so does father  then i tried my best to catch cold and really be sick by standing on the snowbank in the methodist graveyard with my bare feet until jerry pulled me off  but it didnt hurt me a bit and so i couldnt get out of going to church  so i just decided i would put my boots on and go that way  i cant see why it was so wrong and i was so careful to wash my legs just as clean as my face but anyway father wasnt to blame for it  he was in the study thinking of his sermon and other heavenly things and i kept out of his way before i went to sunday school  father does not look at peoples legs in church so of course he did not notice mine but all the gossips did and talked about it and that is why i am writing this letter to the journal to explain  i suppose i did very wrong since everybody says so and i am sorry and i am wearing those awful stockings to punish myself although father bought me two nice new black pairs as soon as mr flaggs store opened on monday morning  but it was all my fault and if people blame father for it after they read this they are not christians and so i do not mind what they say  there is another thing i want to explain about before i stop mary vance told me that mr evan boyd is blaming the lew baxters for stealing potatoes out of his field last fall  they did not touch his potatoes  they are very poor but they are honest  it was us did itjerry and carl and i  una was not with us at the time  we never thought it was stealing  we just wanted a few potatoes to cook over a fire in rainbow valley one evening to eat with our fried trout  mr boyds field was the nearest just between the valley and the village so we climbed over his fence and pulled up some stalks  the potatoes were awful small because mr boyd did not put enough fertilizer on them and we had to pull up a lot of stalks before we got enough and then they were not much bigger than marbles  walter and di blythe helped us eat them but they did not come along until we had them cooked and did not know where we got them so they were not to blame at all only us  we didnt mean any harm but if it was stealing we are very sorry and we will pay mr boyd for them if he will wait until we grow up  we never have any money now because we are not big enough to earn any and aunt martha says it takes every cent of poor fathers salary even when it is paid up regularlyand it isnt oftento run this house  but mr boyd must not blame the lew baxters any more when they were quite innocent and give them a bad name                       yours respectfully                                           faith meredith    chapter xxvi miss cornelia gets a new point of view  susan after im dead im going to come back to earth every time when the daffodils blow in this garden said anne rapturously nobody may see me but ill be here  if anybody is in the garden at the timei think ill come on an evening just like this but it might be just at dawna lovely palepinky spring dawntheyll just see the daffodils nodding wildly as if an extra gust of wind had blown past them but it will be i  indeed mrs dr dear you will not be thinking of flaunting worldly things like daffies after you are dead said susan and i do not believe in ghosts seen or unseen  oh susan i shall not be a ghost  that has such a horrible sound  i shall just be me  and i shall run around in the twilight whether it is morn or eve and see all the spots i love  do you remember how badly i felt when i left our little house of dreams susan  i thought i could never love ingleside so well  but i do  i love every inch of the ground and every stick and stone on it  i am rather fond of the place myself said susan who would have died if she had been removed from it but we must not set our affections too much on earthly things mrs dr dear  there are such things as fires and earthquakes  we should always be prepared  the tom macallisters overharbour were burned out three nights ago  some say tom macallister set the house on fire himself to get the insurance  that may or may not be  but i advise the doctor to have our chimneys seen to at once  an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure  but i see mrs marshall elliott coming in at the gate looking as if she had been sent for and couldnt go  anne dearie have you seen the journal today  miss cornelias voice was trembling partly from emotion partly from the fact that she had hurried up from the store too fast and lost her breath  anne bent over the daffodils to hide a smile  she and gilbert had laughed heartily and heartlessly over the front page of the journal that day but she knew that to dear miss cornelia it was almost a tragedy and she must not wound her feelings by any display of levity  isnt it dreadful  what is to be done asked miss cornelia despairingly  miss cornelia had vowed that she was done with worrying over the pranks of the manse children but she went on worrying just the same  anne led the way to the veranda where susan was knitting with shirley and rilla conning their primers on either side  susan was already on her second pair of stockings for faith  susan never worried over poor humanity  she did what in her lay for its betterment and serenely left the rest to the higher powers  cornelia elliott thinks she was born to run this world mrs dr dear she had once said to anne and so she is always in a stew over something  i have never thought i was and so i go calmly along  not but what it has sometimes occurred to me that things might be run a little better than they are  but it is not for us poor worms to nourish such thoughts  they only make us uncomfortable and do not get us anywhere  i dont see that anything can be donenow said anne pulling out a nice cushiony chair for miss cornelia  but how in the world did mr vickers allow that letter to be printed  surely he should have known better  why hes away anne deariehes been away to new brunswick for a week  and that young scalawag of a joe vickers is editing the journal in his absence  of course mr vickers would never have put it in even if he is a methodist but joe would just think it a good joke  as you say i dont suppose there is anything to be done now only live it down  but if i ever get joe vickers cornered somewhere ill give him a talking to he wont forget in a hurry  i wanted marshall to stop our subscription to the journal instantly but he only laughed and said that todays issue was the only one that had had anything readable in it for a year  marshall never will take anything seriouslyjust like a man  fortunately evan boyd is like that too  he takes it as a joke and is laughing all over the place about it  and hes another methodist  as for mrs burr of upper glen of course she will be furious and they will leave the church  not that it will be a great loss from any point of view the methodists are quite welcome to them  it serves mrs burr right said susan who had an old feud with the lady in question and had been hugely tickled over the reference to her in faiths letter  she will find that she will not be able to cheat the methodist parson out of his salary with bad yarn  the worst of it is theres not much hope of things getting any better said miss cornelia gloomily  as long as mr meredith was going to see rosemary west i did hope the manse would soon have a proper mistress  but that is all off  i suppose she wouldnt have him on account of the childrenat least everybody seems to think so  i do not believe that he ever asked her said susan who could not conceive of any one refusing a minister  well nobody knows anything about that  but one thing is certain he doesnt go there any longer  and rosemary didnt look well all the spring  i hope her visit to kingsport will do her good  shes been gone for a month and will stay another month i understand  i cant remember when rosemary was away from home before  she and ellen could never bear to be parted but i understand ellen insisted on her going this time  and meanwhile ellen and norman douglas are warming up the old soup  is that really so asked anne laughing  i heard a rumour of it but i hardly believed it  believe it  you may believe it all right anne dearie  nobody is in ignorance of it  norman douglas never left anybody in doubt as to his intentions in regard to anything  he always did his courting before the public  he told marshall that he hadnt thought about ellen for years but the first time he went to church last fall he saw her and fell in love with her all over again  he said hed clean forgot how handsome she was  he hadnt seen her for twenty years if you can believe it  of course he never went to church and ellen never went anywhere else round here  oh we all know what norman means but what ellen means is a different matter  i shant take it upon me to predict whether it will be a match or not  he jilted her oncebut it seems that does not count with some people mrs dr dear susan remarked rather acidly  he jilted her in a fit of temper and repented it all his life said miss cornelia  that is different from a coldblooded jilting  for my part i never detested norman as some folks do he could never overcrow me  i do wonder what started him coming to church  i have never been able to believe mrs wilsonss story that faith meredith went there and bullied him into it ive always intended to ask faith herself but ive never happened to think of it just when i saw her  what influence could she have over norman douglas  he was in the store when i left bellowing with laughter over that scandalous letter  you could have heard him at four winds point  the greatest girl in the world he was shouting  shes that full of spunk shes bursting with it  and all the old grannies want to tame her darn them  but theyll never be able to do itnever  they might as well try to drown a fish  boyd see that you put more fertilizer on your potatoes next year  ho ho ho  and then he laughed till the roof shook  mr douglas pays well to the salary at least remarked susan  oh norman isnt mean in some ways  hed give a thousand without blinking a lash and roar like a bull of bashan if he had to pay five cents too much for anything  besides he likes mr merediths sermons and norman douglas was always willing to shell out if he got his brains tickled up  there is no more christianity about him than there is about a black naked heathen in africa and never will be  but hes clever and well read and he judges sermons as he would lectures  anyhow its well he backs up mr meredith and the children as he does for theyll need friends more than ever after this  i am tired of making excuses for them believe me  do you know dear miss cornelia said anne seriously i think we have all been making too many excuses  it is very foolish and we ought to stop it  i am going to tell you what id like to do i shant do it of courseanne had noted a glint of alarm in susans eyeit would be too unconventional and we must be conventional or die after we reach what is supposed to be a dignified age  but id like to do it  id like to call a meeting of the ladies aid and wms and the girls sewing society and include in the audience all and any methodists who have been criticizing the meredithsalthough i do think if we presbyterians stopped criticizing and excusing we would find that other denominations would trouble themselves very little about our manse folks  i would say to them dear christian friendswith marked emphasis on christiani have something to say to you and i want to say it good and hard that you may take it home and repeat it to your families  you methodists need not pity us and we presbyterians need not pity ourselves  we are not going to do it any more  and we are going to say boldly and truthfully to all critics and sympathizers we are proud of our minister and his family  mr meredith is the best preacher glen st mary church ever had  moreover he is a sincere earnest teacher of truth and christian charity  he is a faithful friend a judicious pastor in all essentials and a refined scholarly wellbred man  his family are worthy of him  gerald meredith is the cleverest pupil in the glen school and mr hazard says that he is destined to a brilliant career  he is a manly honourable truthful little fellow  faith meredith is a beauty and as inspiring and original as she is beautiful  there is nothing commonplace about her  all the other girls in the glen put together havent the vim and wit and joyousness and spunk she has  she has not an enemy in the world  every one who knows her loves her  of how many children or grownups can that be said  una meredith is sweetness personified  she will make a most lovable woman  carl meredith with his love for ants and frogs and spiders will some day be a naturalist whom all canadanay all the world will delight to honour  do you know of any other family in the glen or out of it of whom all these things can be said  away with shamefaced excuses and apologies we rejoice in our minister and his splendid boys and girls  anne stopped partly because she was out of breath after her vehement speech and partly because she could not trust herself to speak further in view of miss cornelias face that good lady was staring helplessly at anne apparently engulfed in billows of new ideas  but she came up with a gasp and struck out for shore gallantly  anne blythe i wish you would call that meeting and say just that  youve made me ashamed of myself for one and far be it from me to refuse to admit it  of course that is how we should have talkedespecially to the methodists  and its every word of it trueevery word  weve just been shutting our eyes to the big worthwhile things and squinting them on the little things that dont really matter a pins worth  oh anne dearie i can see a thing when its hammered into my head  no more apologizing for cornelia marshall  i shall hold my head up after this believe methough i may talk things over with you as usual just to relieve my feelings if the merediths do any more startling stunts  even that letter i felt so bad aboutwhy its only a good joke after all as norman says  not many girls would have been cute enough to think of writing itand all punctuated so nicely and not one word misspelled  just let me hear any methodist say one word about itthough all the same ill never forgive joe vickersbelieve me  where are the rest of your small fry tonight  walter and the twins are in rainbow valley  jem is studying in the garret  they are all crazy about rainbow valley  mary vance thinks its the only place in the world  shed be off up here every evening if id let her  but i dont encourage her in gadding  besides i miss the creature when she isnt around anne dearie  i never thought id get so fond of her  not but what i see her faults and try to correct them  but she has never said one saucy word to me since she came to my house and she is a great helpfor when all is said and done anne dearie i am not so young as i once was and there is no sense denying it  i was fiftynine my last birthday  i dont feel it but there is no gainsaying the family bible    chapter xxvii a sacred concert  in spite of miss cornelias new point of view she could not help feeling a little disturbed over the next performance of the manse children  in public she carried off the situation splendidly saying to all the gossips the substance of what anne had said in daffodil time and saying it so pointedly and forcibly that her hearers found themselves feeling rather foolish and began to think that after all they were making too much of a childish prank but in private miss cornelia allowed herself the relief of bemoaning it to anne  anne dearie they had a concert in the graveyard last thursday evening while the methodist prayer meeting was going on  there they sat on hezekiah pollocks tombstone and sang for a solid hour  of course i understand it was mostly hymns they sang and it wouldnt have been quite so bad if theyd done nothing else but im told they finished up with polly wolly doodle at full lengthand that just when deacon baxter was praying  i was there that night said susan and although i did not say anything about it to you mrs dr dear  i could not help thinking that it was a great pity they picked that particular evening  it was truly bloodcurdling to hear them sitting there in that abode of the dead shouting that frivolous song at the tops of their lungs  i dont know what you were doing in a methodist prayer meeting said miss cornelia acidly  i have never found that methodism was catching retorted susan stiffly  and as i was going to say when i was interrupted badly as i felt i did not give in to the methodists  when mrs deacon baxter said as we came out what a disgraceful exhibition  i said looking her fairly in the eye they are all beautiful singers and none of your choir mrs baxter ever bother themselves coming out to your prayer meeting it seems their voices appear to be in tune only on sundays  she was quite meek and i felt that i had snubbed her properly  but i could have done it much more thoroughly mrs dr dear if only they had left out polly wolly doodle  it is truly terrible to think of that being sung in a graveyard  some of those dead folks sang polly wolly doodle when they were living susan  perhaps they like to hear it yet suggested gilbert  miss cornelia looked at him reproachfully and made up her mind that on some future occasion she would hint to anne that the doctor should be admonished not to say such things  they might injure his practice  people might get it into their heads that he wasnt orthodox  to be sure marshall said even worse things habitually but then he was not a public man  i understand that their father was in his study all the time with his windows open but never noticed them at all  of course he was lost in a book as usual  but i spoke to him about it yesterday when he called  how could you dare mrs marshall elliott asked susan rebukingly  dare  its time somebody dared something  why they say he knows nothing about that letter of faiths to the journal because nobody liked to mention it to him  he never looks at a journal of course  but i thought he ought to know of this to prevent any such performances in future  he said he would discuss it with them  but of course hed never think of it again after he got out of our gate  that man has no sense of humour anne believe me  he preached last sunday on how to bring up children  a beautiful sermon it was tooand everybody in church thinking what a pity you cant practise what you preach  miss cornelia did mr meredith an injustice in thinking he would soon forget what she had told him  he went home much disturbed and when the children came from rainbow valley that night at a much later hour than they should have been prowling in it he called them into his study  they went in somewhat awed  it was such an unusual thing for their father to do  what could he be going to say to them  they racked their memories for any recent transgression of sufficient importance but could not recall any  carl had spilled a saucerful of jam on mrs peter flaggs silk dress two evenings before when at aunt marthas invitation she had stayed to supper  but mr meredith had not noticed it and mrs flagg who was a kindly soul had made no fuss  besides carl had been punished by having to wear unas dress all the rest of the evening  una suddenly thought that perhaps her father meant to tell them that he was going to marry miss west  her heart began to beat violently and her legs trembled  then she saw that mr meredith looked very stern and sorrowful  no it could not be that  children said mr meredith i have heard something that has pained me very much  is it true that you sat out in the graveyard all last thursday evening and sang ribald songs while a prayer meeting was being held in the methodist church  great caesar dad we forgot all about it being their prayer meeting night exclaimed jerry in dismay  then it is trueyou did do this thing  why dad i dont know what you mean by ribald songs  we sang hymnsit was a sacred concert you know  what harm was that  i tell you we never thought about its being methodist prayer meeting night  they used to have their meeting tuesday nights and since theyve changed to thursdays its hard to remember  did you sing nothing but hymns  why said jerry turning red we did sing polly wolly doodle at the last  faith said lets have something cheerful to wind up with  but we didnt mean any harm fathertruly we didnt  the concert was my idea father said faith afraid that mr meredith might blame jerry too much  you know the methodists themselves had a sacred concert in their church three sunday nights ago  i thought it would be good fun to get one up in imitation of it  only they had prayers at theirs and we left that part out because we heard that people thought it awful for us to pray in a graveyard  you were sitting in here all the time she added and never said a word to us  i did not notice what you were doing  that is no excuse for me of course  i am more to blame than youi realize that  but why did you sing that foolish song at the end  we didnt think muttered jerry feeling that it was a very lame excuse seeing that he had lectured faith so strongly in the goodconduct club sessions for her lack of thought  were sorry fathertruly we are  pitch into us hardwe deserve a regular combing down  but mr meredith did no combing down or pitching into  he sat down and gathered his small culprits close to him and talked a little to them tenderly and wisely  they were overcome with remorse and shame and felt that they could never be so silly and thoughtless again  weve just got to punish ourselves good and hard for this whispered jerry as they crept upstairs  well have a session of the club first thing tomorrow and decide how well do it  i never saw father so cut up  but i wish to goodness the methodists would stick to one night for their prayer meeting and not wander all over the week  anyhow im glad it wasnt what i was afraid it was murmured una to herself  behind them in the study mr meredith had sat down at his desk and buried his face in his arms  god help me he said  im a poor sort of father  oh rosemary  if you had only cared    chapter xxviii a fast day  the goodconduct club had a special session the next morning before school  after various suggestions it was decided that a fast day would be an appropriate punishment  we wont eat a single thing for a whole day said jerry  im kind of curious to see what fasting is like anyhow  this will be a good chance to find out  what day will we choose for it asked una who thought it would he quite an easy punishment and rather wondered that jerry and faith had not devised something harder  lets pick monday said faith  we mostly have a pretty filling dinner on sundays and mondays meals never amount to much anyhow  but thats just the point exclaimed jerry  we mustnt take the easiest day to fast but the hardestand thats sunday because as you say we mostly have roast beef that day instead of cold ditto  it wouldnt be much punishment to fast from ditto  lets take next sunday  it will be a good day for father is going to exchange for the morning service with the upper lowbridge minister  father will be away till evening  if aunt martha wonders whats got into us well tell her right up that were fasting for the good of our souls and it is in the bible and she is not to interfere and i guess she wont  aunt martha did not  she merely said in her fretful mumbling way what foolishness are you young rips up to now and thought no more about it  mr meredith had gone away early in the morning before any one was up  he went without his breakfast too but that was of course of common occurrence  half of the time he forgot it and there was no one to remind him of it breakfastaunt marthas breakfastwas not a hard meal to miss even the hungry young rips did not feel it any great deprivation to abstain from the lumpy porridge and blue milk which had aroused the scorn of mary vance  but it was different at dinner time  they were furiously hungry then and the odor of roast beef which pervaded the manse and which was wholly delightful in spite of the fact that the roast beef was badly underdone was almost more than they could stand  in desperation they rushed to the graveyard where they couldnt smell it  but una could not keep her eyes from the dining room window through which the upper lowbridge minister could be seen placidly eating  if i could only have just a weeny teeny piece she sighed  now you stop that commanded jerry  of course its hardbut thats the punishment of it  i could eat a graven image this very minute but am i complaining  lets think of something else weve just got to rise above our stomachs  at supper time they did not feel the pangs of hunger which they had suffered earlier in the day  i suppose were getting used to it said faith  i feel an awfully queer allgone sort of feeling but i cant say im hungry  my head is funny said una  it goes round and round sometimes  but she went gamely to church with the others  if mr meredith had not been so wholly wrapped up in and carried away with his subject he might have noticed the pale little face and hollow eyes in the manse pew beneath  but he noticed nothing and his sermon was something longer than usual  then just before be gave out the final hymn una meredith tumbled off the seat of the manse pew and lay in a dead faint on the floor  mrs elder clow was the first to reach her  she caught the thin little body from the arms of whitefaced terrified faith and carried it into the vestry  mr meredith forgot the hymn and everything else and rushed madly after her  the congregation dismissed itself as best it could  oh mrs clow gasped faith is una dead  have we killed her  what is the matter with my child demanded the pale father  she has just fainted i think said mrs clow  oh heres the doctor thank goodness  gilbert did not find it a very easy thing to bring una back to consciousness  he worked over her for a long time before her eyes opened  then he carried her over to the manse followed by faith sobbing hysterically in her relief  she is just hungry you knowshe didnt eat a thing today none of us didwe were all fasting  fasting said mr meredith and fasting said the doctor  yesto punish ourselves for singing polly wolly in the graveyard said faith  my child i dont want you to punish yourselves for that said mr meredith in distress  i gave you your little scoldingand you were all penitentand i forgave you  yes but we had to be punished explained faith  its our rulein our goodconduct club you knowif we do anything wrong or anything that is likely to hurt father in the congregation we have to punish ourselves  we are bringing ourselves up you know because there is nobody to do it  mr meredith groaned but the doctor got up from unas side with an air of relief  then this child simply fainted from lack of food and all she needs is a good square meal he said  mrs clow will you be kind enough to see she gets it  and i think from faiths story that they all would be the better for something to eat or we shall have more faintings  i suppose we shouldnt have made una fast said faith remorsefully  when i think of it only jerry and i should have been punished  we got up the concert and we were the oldest  i sang polly wolly just the same as the rest of you said unas weak little voice so i had to be punished too  mrs clow came with a glass of milk faith and jerry and carl sneaked off to the pantry and john meredith went into his study where he sat in the darkness for a long time alone with his bitter thoughts  so his children were bringing themselves up because there was nobody to do itstruggling along amid their little perplexities without a hand to guide or a voice to counsel  faiths innocently uttered phrase rankled in her fathers mind like a barbed shaft  there was nobody to look after themto comfort their little souls and care for their little bodies  how frail una had looked lying there on the vestry sofa in that long faint  how thin were her tiny hands how pallid her little face  she looked as if she might slip away from him in a breathsweet little una of whom cecilia had begged him to take such special care  since his wifes death he had not felt such an agony of dread as when he had hung over his little girl in her unconsciousness  he must do somethingbut what  should he ask elizabeth kirk to marry him  she was a good womanshe would be kind to his children  he might bring himself to do it if it were not for his love for rosemary west  but until he had crushed that out he could not seek another woman in marriage  and he could not crush it outhe had tried and he could not  rosemary had been in church that evening for the first time since her return from kingsport  he had caught a glimpse of her face in the back of the crowded church just as he had finished his sermon  his heart had given a fierce throb  he sat while the choir sang the collection piece with his bent head and tingling pulses  he had not seen her since the evening upon which he had asked her to marry him  when he had risen to give out the hymn his hands were trembling and his pale face was flushed  then unas fainting spell had banished everything from his mind for a time  now in the darkness and solitude of the study it rushed back  rosemary was the only woman in the world for him  it was of no use for him to think of marrying any other  he could not commit such a sacrilege even for his childrens sake  he must take up his burden alonehe must try to be a better a more watchful fatherhe must tell his children not to be afraid to come to him with all their little problems then he lighted his lamp and took up a bulky new book which was setting the theological world by the ears  he would read just one chapter to compose his mind  five minutes later he was lost to the world and the troubles of the world    chapter xxix a weird tale  on an early june evening rainbow valley was an entirely delightful place and the children felt it to be so as they sat in the open glade where the bells rang elfishly on the tree lovers and the white lady shook her green tresses  the wind was laughing and whistling about them like a leal gladhearted comrade  the young ferns were spicy in the hollow   the wild cherry trees scattered over the valley among the dark firs were mistily white  the robins were whistling over in the maples behind ingleside  beyond on the slopes of the glen were blossoming orchards sweet and mystic and wonderful veiled in dusk  it was spring and young things must be glad in spring everybody was glad in rainbow valley that eveninguntil mary vance froze their blood with the story of henry warrens ghost  jem was not there  jem spent his evenings now studying for his entrance examination in the ingleside garret  jerry was down near the pond trouting  walter had been reading longfellows sea poems to the others and they were steeped in the beauty and mystery of the ships  then they talked of what they would do when they were grown upwhere they would travelthe far fair shores they would see  nan and di meant to go to europe  walter longed for the nile moaning past its egyptian sands and a glimpse of the sphinx  faith opined rather dismally that she supposed she would have to be a missionaryold mrs taylor told her she ought to beand then she would at least see india or china those mysterious lands of the orient  carls heart was set on african jungles   una said nothing  she thought she would just like to stay at home  it was prettier here than anywhere else  it would be dreadful when they were all grown up and had to scatter over the world  the very idea made una feel lonesome and homesick  but the others dreamed on delightedly until mary vance arrived and vanished poesy and dreams at one fell swoop  laws but im out of puff she exclaimed  ive run down that hill like sixty  i got an awful scare up there at the old bailey place  what frightened you asked di  i dunno  i was poking about under them lilacs in the old garden trying to see if there was any liliesofthevalley out yet  it was dark as a pocket thereand all at once i seen something stirring and rustling round at the other side of the garden in those cherry bushes  it was white  i tell you i didnt stop for a second look  i flew over the dyke quicker than quick  i was sure it was henry warrens ghost  who was henry warren asked di  and why should he have a ghost asked nan  laws did you never hear the story  and you brought up in the glen  well wait a minute till i get by breath all back and ill tell you  walter shivered delightsomely  he loved ghost stories  their mystery their dramatic climaxes their eeriness gave him a fearful exquisite pleasure  longfellow instantly grew tame and commonplace  he threw the book aside and stretched himself out propped upon his elbows to listen wholeheartedly fixing his great luminous eyes on marys face  mary wished he wouldnt look at her so  she felt she could make a better job of the ghost story if walter were not looking at her  she could put on several frills and invent a few artistic details to enhance the horror  as it was she had to stick to the bare truthor what had been told her for the truth  well she began you know old tom bailey and his wife used to live in that house up there thirty years ago  he was an awful old rip they say and his wife wasnt much better  theyd no children of their own but a sister of old toms died and left a little boythis henry warrenand they took him  he was about twelve when he came to them and kind of undersized and delicate they say tom and his wife used him awful from the startwhipped him and starved him  folks said they wanted him to die sos they could get the little bit of money his mother had left for him henry didnt die right off but he begun having fitsepileps they called emand he grew up kind of simple till he was about eighteen  his uncle used to thrash him in that garden up there cause it was back of the house where no one could see him  but folks could hear and they say it was awful sometimes hearing poor henry plead with his uncle not to kill him  but nobody dared interfere cause old tom was such a reprobate hed have been sure to get square with em some way  he burned the barns of a man at harbour head who offended him  at last henry died and his uncle and aunt give out he died in one of his fits and that was all anybody ever knowed but everybody said tom had just up and killed him for keeps at last  and it wasnt long till it got around that henry walked  that old garden was hanted  he was heard there at nights moaning and crying  old tom and his wife got outwent out west and never came back  the place got such a bad name nobodyd buy or rent it  thats why its all gone to ruin  that was thirty years ago but henry warrens ghost hants it yet  do you believe that asked nan scornfully  i dont  well good people have seen himand heard him retorted mary they say he appears and grovels on the ground and holds you by the legs and gibbers and moans like he did when he was alive  i thought of that as soon as i seen that white thing in the bushes and thought if it caught me like that and moaned id drop down dead on the spot  so i cut and run  it mightnt have been his ghost but i wasnt going to take any chances with a hant  it was likely old mrs stimsons white calf laughed di  it pastures in that gardenive seen it  maybe so  but im not going home through the bailey garden any more  heres jerry with a big string of trout and its my turn to cook them  jem and jerry both say im the best cook in the glen  and cornelia told me i could bring up this batch of cookies  i all but dropped them when i saw henrys ghost  jerry hooted when he heard the ghost storywhich mary repeated as she fried the fish touching it up a trifle or so since walter had gone to help faith to set the table  it made no impression on jerry but faith and una and carl had been secretly much frightened though they would never have given in to it  it was all right as long as the others were with them in the valley but when the feast was over and the shadows fell they quaked with remembrance  jerry went up to ingleside with the blythes to see jem about something and mary vance went around that way home so faith and una and carl had to go back to the manse alone they walked very close together and gave the old bailey garden a wide berth  they did not believe that it was haunted of course but they would not go near it for all that    chapter xxx the ghost on the dyke  somehow faith and carl and una could not shake off the hold which the story of henry warrens ghost had taken upon their imaginations  they had never believed in ghosts  ghost tales they had heard aplentymary vance had told some far more bloodcurdling than this but those tales were all of places and people and spooks far away and unknown  after the first halfawful halfpleasant thrill of awe and terror they thought of them no more  but this story came home to them  the old bailey garden was almost at their very dooralmost in their beloved rainbow valley  they had passed and repassed it constantly they had hunted for flowers in it they had made short cuts through it when they wished to go straight from the village to the valley  but never again  after the night when mary vance told them its gruesome tale they would not have gone through or near it on pain of death  death  what was death compared to the unearthly possibility of falling into the clutches of henry warrens grovelling ghost  one warm july evening the three of them were sitting under the tree lovers feeling a little lonely  nobody else had come near the valley that evening  jem blythe was away in charlottetown writing on his entrance examinations  jerry and walter blythe were off for a sail on the harbour with old captain crawford nan and di and rilla and shirley had gone down the harbour road to visit kenneth and persis ford who had come with their parents for a flying visit to the little old house of dreams  nan had asked faith to go with them but faith had declined  she would never have admitted it but she felt a little secret jealousy of persis ford concerning whose wonderful beauty and city glamour she had heard a great deal  no she wasnt going to go down there and play second fiddle to anybody  she and una took their story books to rainbow valley and read while carl investigated bugs along the banks of the brook and all three were happy until they suddenly realized that it was twilight and that the old bailey garden was uncomfortably near by  carl came and sat down close to the girls  they all wished they had gone home a little sooner but nobody said anything  great velvety purple clouds heaped up in the west and spread over the valley  there was no wind and everything was suddenly strangely dreadfully still  the marsh was full of thousands of fireflies  surely some fairy parliament was being convened that night  altogether rainbow valley was not a canny place just then  faith looked fearfully up the valley to the old bailey garden then if anybodys blood ever did freeze faith merediths certainly froze at that moment  the eyes of carl and una followed her entranced gaze and chills began gallopading up and down their spines also  for there under the big tamarack tree on the tumbledown grassgrown dyke of the bailey garden was something whiteshapelessly white in the gathering gloom  the three merediths sat and gazed as if turned to stone  itsits thecalf whispered una at last  itstoobigfor the calf whispered faith  her mouth and lips were so dry she could hardly articulate the words  suddenly carl gasped  its coming here  the girls gave one last agonized glance  yes it was creeping down over the dyke as no calf ever did or could creep  reason fled before sudden overmastering panic  for the moment every one of the trio was firmly convinced that what they saw was henry warrens ghost  carl sprang to his feet and bolted blindly with a simultaneous shriek the girls followed him  like mad creatures they tore up the hill across the road and into the manse  they had left aunt martha sewing in the kitchen  she was not there  they rushed to the study  it was dark and tenantless  as with one impulse they swung around and made for inglesidebut not across rainbow valley  down the hill and through the glen street they flew on the wings of their wild terror carl in the lead una bringing up the rear  nobody tried to stop them though everybody who saw them wondered what fresh devilment those manse youngsters were up to now  but at the gate of ingleside they ran into rosemary west who had just been in for a moment to return some borrowed books  she saw their ghastly faces and staring eyes  she realized that their poor little souls were wrung with some awful and real fear whatever its cause  she caught carl with one arm and faith with the other  una stumbled against her and held on desperately  children dear what has happened she said  what has frightened you  henry warrens ghost answered carl through his chattering teeth  henrywarrensghost said amazed rosemary who had never heard the story  yes sobbed faith hysterically  its thereon the bailey dykewe saw itand it started tochase us  rosemary herded the three distracted creatures to the ingleside veranda  gilbert and anne were both away having also gone to the house of dreams but susan appeared in the doorway gaunt and practical and unghostlike  what is all this rumpus about she inquired  again the children gasped out their awful tale while rosemary held them close to her and soothed them with wordless comfort  likely it was an owl said susan unstirred  an owl  the meredith children never had any opinion of susans intelligence after that  it was bigger than a million owls said carl sobbingoh how ashamed carl was of that sobbing in after daysand itit grovelled just as mary saidand it was crawling down over the dyke to get at us  do owls crawl  rosemary looked at susan  they must have seen something to frighten them so she said  i will go and see said susan coolly  now children calm yourselves  whatever you have seen it was not a ghost  as for poor henry warren i feel sure he would be only too glad to rest quietly in his peaceful grave once he got there  no fear of him venturing back and that you may tie to  if you can make them see reason miss west i will find out the truth of the matter  susan departed for rainbow valley valiantly grasping a pitchfork which she found leaning against the back fence where the doctor had been working in his little hayfield  a pitchfork might not be of much use against hants but it was a comforting sort of weapon  there was nothing to be seen in rainbow valley when susan reached it  no white visitants appeared to be lurking in the shadowy tangled old bailey garden  susan marched boldly through it and beyond it and rapped with her pitchfork on the door of the little cottage on the other side where mrs stimson lived with her two daughters  back at ingleside rosemary had succeeded in calming the children they still sobbed a little from shock but they were beginning to feel a lurking and salutary suspicion that they had made dreadful geese of themselves  this suspicion became a certainty when susan finally returned  i have found out what your ghost was she said with a grim smile sitting down on a rocker and fanning herself  old mrs stimson has had a pair of factory cotton sheets bleaching in the bailey garden for a week  she spread them on the dyke under the tamarack tree because the grass was clean and short there  this evening she went out to take them in  she had her knitting in her hands so she hung the sheets over her shoulders by way of carrying them  and then she must have dropped one of her needles and find it she could not and has not yet  but she went down on her knees and crept about to hunt for it and she was at that when she heard awful yells down in the valley and saw the three children tearing up the hill past her  she thought they had been bit by something and it gave her poor old heart such a turn that she could not move or speak but just crouched there till they disappeared  then she staggered back home and they have been applying stimulants to her ever since and her heart is in a terrible condition and she says she will not get over this fright all summer  the merediths sat crimson with a shame that even rosemarys understanding sympathy could not remove  they sneaked off home met jerry at the manse gate and made remorseful confession  a session of the goodconduct club was arranged for next morning  wasnt miss west sweet to us tonight whispered faith in bed  yes admitted una  it is such a pity it changes people so much to be made stepmothers  i dont believe it does said faith loyally    chapter xxxi carl does penance  i dont see why we should be punished at all said faith rather sulkily  we didnt do anything wrong  we couldnt help being frightened  and it wont do father any harm  it was just an accident  you were cowards said jerry with judicial scorn and you gave way to your cowardice  that is why you should be punished everybody will laugh at you about this and that is a disgrace to the family  if you knew how awful the whole thing was said faith with a shiver you would think we had been punished enough already  i wouldnt go through it again for anything in the whole world  i believe youd have run yourself if youd been there muttered carl  from an old woman in a cotton sheet mocked jerry  ho ho ho  it didnt look a bit like an old woman cried faith  it was just a great big white thing crawling about in the grass just as mary vance said henry warren did  its all very fine for you to laugh jerry meredith but youd have laughed on the other side of your mouth if youd been there  and how are we to be punished  i dont think its fair but lets know what we have to do judge meredith  the way i look at it said jerry frowning is that carl was the most to blame  he bolted first as i understand it besides he was a boy so he should have stood his ground to protect you girls whatever the danger was  you know that carl dont you  i spose so growled carl shamefacedly  very well  this is to be your punishment  tonight youll sit on mr hezekiah pollocks tombstone in the graveyard alone until twelve oclock  carl gave a little shudder  the graveyard was not so very far from the old bailey garden  it would be a trying ordeal but carl was anxious to wipe out his disgrace and prove that he was not a coward after all  all right he said sturdily  but howll i know when it is twelve  the study windows are open and youll hear the clock striking and mind you that you are not to budge out of that graveyard until the last stroke  as for you girls youve got to go without jam at supper for a week  faith and una looked rather blank  they were inclined to think that even carls comparatively short though sharp agony was lighter punishment than this long drawnout ordeal  a whole week of soggy bread without the saving grace of jam  but no shirking was permitted in the club  the girls accepted their lot with such philosophy as they could summon up  that night they all went to bed at nine except carl who was already keeping vigil on the tombstone  una slipped in to bid him good night  her tender heart was wrung with sympathy  oh carl are you much scared she whispered  not a bit said carl airily  i wont sleep a wink till after twelve said una  if you get lonesome just look up at our window and remember that im inside awake and thinking about you  that will be a little company wont it  ill be all right  dont you worry about me said carl  but in spite of his dauntless words carl was a pretty lonely boy when the lights went out in the manse  he had hoped his father would be in the study as he so often was  he would not feel alone then  but that night mr meredith had been summoned to the fishing village at the harbour mouth to see a dying man  he would not likely be back until after midnight  carl must dree his weird alone  a glen man went past carrying a lantern  the mysterious shadows caused by the lanternlight went hurtling madly over the graveyard like a dance of demons or witches  then they passed and darkness fell again  one by one the lights in the glen went out  it was a very dark night with a cloudy sky and a raw east wind that was cold in spite of the calendar  far away on the horizon was the low dim lustre of the charlottetown lights  the wind wailed and sighed in the old firtrees  mr alec davis tall monument gleamed whitely through the gloom  the willow beside it tossed long writhing arms spectrally  at times the gyrations of its boughs made it seem as if the monument were moving too  carl curled himself up on the tombstone with his legs tucked under him  it wasnt precisely pleasant to hang them over the edge of the stone  just supposejust supposebony hands should reach up out of mr pollocks grave under it and clutch him by the ankles  that had been one of mary vances cheerful speculations one time when they had all been sitting there  it returned to haunt carl now  he didnt believe those things he didnt even really believe in henry warrens ghost  as for mr pollock he had been dead sixty years so it wasnt likely he cared who sat on his tombstone now  but there is something very strange and terrible in being awake when all the rest of the world is asleep  you are alone then with nothing but your own feeble personality to pit against the mighty principalities and powers of darkness  carl was only ten and the dead were all around himand he wished oh he wished that the clock would strike twelve  would it never strike twelve  surely aunt martha must have forgotten to wind it  and then it struck elevenonly eleven  he must stay yet another hour in that grim place  if only there were a few friendly stars to be seen  the darkness was so thick it seemed to press against his face  there was a sound as of stealthy passing footsteps all over the graveyard  carl shivered partly with prickling terror partly with real cold  then it began to raina chill penetrating drizzle  carls thin little cotton blouse and shirt were soon wet through  he felt chilled to the bone  he forgot mental terrors in his physical discomfort  but he must stay there till twelvehe was punishing himself and he was on his honour  nothing had been said about rainbut it did not make any difference  when the study clock finally struck twelve a drenched little figure crept stiffly down off mr pollocks tombstone made its way into the manse and upstairs to bed  carls teeth were chattering  he thought he would never get warm again  he was warm enough when morning came  jerry gave one startled look at his crimson face and then rushed to call his father  mr meredith came hurriedly his own face ivory white from the pallor of his long night vigil by a death bed  he had not got home until daylight  he bent over his little lad anxiously  carl are you sick he said  thattombstoneover here said carl itsmovingabout its comingatmekeep itawayplease  mr meredith rushed to the telephone  in ten minutes dr blythe was at the manse  half an hour later a wire was sent to town for a trained nurse and all the glen knew that carl meredith was very ill with pneumonia and that dr blythe had been seen to shake his head  gilbert shook his head more than once in the fortnight that followed  carl developed double pneumonia  there was one night when mr meredith paced his study floor and faith and una huddled in their bedroom and cried and jerry wild with remorse refused to budge from the floor of the hall outside carls door dr blythe and the nurse never left the bedside  they fought death gallantly until the red dawn and they won the victory carl rallied and passed the crisis in safety  the news was phoned about the waiting glen and people found out how much they really loved their minister and his children  i havent had one decent nights sleep since i heard the child was sick miss cornelia told anne and mary vance has cried until those queer eyes of hers looked like burnt holes in a blanket  is it true that carl got pneumonia from straying out in the graveyard that wet night for a dare  no  he was staying there to punish himself for cowardice in that affair of the warren ghost  it seems they have a club for bringing themselves up and they punish themselves when they do wrong  jerry told mr meredith all about it  the poor little souls said miss cornelia  carl got better rapidly for the congregation took enough nourishing things to the manse to furnish forth a hospital norman douglas drove up every evening with a dozen fresh eggs and a jar of jersey cream  sometimes he stayed an hour and bellowed arguments on predestination with mr meredith in the study oftener he drove on up to the hill that overlooked the glen  when carl was able to go again to rainbow valley they had a special feast in his honour and the doctor came down and helped them with the fireworks  mary vance was there too but she did not tell any ghost stories  miss cornelia had given her a talking on that subject which mary would not forget in a hurry    chapter xxxii two stubborn people  rosemary west on her way home from a music lesson at ingleside turned aside to the hidden spring in rainbow valley  she had not been there all summer the beautiful little spot had no longer any allurement for her  the spirit of her young lover never came to the tryst now and the memories connected with john meredith were too painful and poignant  but she had happened to glance backward up the valley and had seen norman douglas vaulting as airily as a stripling over the old stone dyke of the bailey garden and thought he was on his way up the hill  if he overtook her she would have to walk home with him and she was not going to do that  so she slipped at once behind the maples of the spring hoping he had not seen her and would pass on  but norman had seen her and what was more was in pursuit of her  he had been wanting for some time to have talk with rosemary but she had always so it seemed avoided him rosemary had never at any time liked norman douglas very well his bluster his temper his noisy hilarity had always antagonized her  long ago she had often wondered how ellen could possibly be attracted to him  norman douglas was perfectly aware of her dislike and he chuckled over it  it never worried norman if people did not like him  it did not even make him dislike them in return for he took it as a kind of extorted compliment he thought rosemary a fine girl and he meant to be an excellent generous brotherinlaw to her  but before he could be her brotherinlaw he had to have a talk with her so having seen her leaving ingleside as he stood in the doorway of a glen store he had straightway plunged into the valley to overtake her  rosemary was sitting pensively on the maple seat where john meredith had been sitting on that evening nearly a year ago  the tiny spring shimmered and dimpled under its fringe of ferns rubyred gleams of sunset fell through the arching boughs  a tall clump of perfect asters grew at her side  the little spot was as dreamy and witching and evasive as any retreat of fairies and dryads in ancient forests  into it norman douglas bounced scattering and annihilating its charm in a moment  his personality seemed to swallow the place up  there was simply nothing there but norman douglas big redbearded complacent  good evening said rosemary coldly standing up  evening girl  sit down againsit down again  i want to have a talk with you  bless the girl whats she looking at me like that for  i dont want to eat youive had my supper  sit down and be civil  i can hear what you have to say quite as well here said rosemary  so you can girl if you use your ears  i only wanted you to be comfortable  you look so durned uncomfortable standing there well ill sit anyway  norman accordingly sat down in the very place john meredith had once sat  the contrast was so ludicrous that rosemary was afraid she would go off into a peal of hysterical laughter over it norman cast his hat aside placed his huge red hands on his knees and looked up at her with his eyes atwinkle  come girl dont be so stiff he said ingratiatingly  when he liked he could be very ingratiating  lets have a reasonable sensible friendly chat  theres something i want to ask you  ellen says she wont so its up to me to do it  rosemary looked down at the spring which seemed to have shrunk to the size of a dewdrop  norman gazed at her in despair  durn it all you might help a fellow out a bit he burst forth  what is it you want me to help you say asked rosemary scornfully  you know as well as i do girl  dont be putting on your tragedy airs  no wonder ellen was scared to ask you  look here girl ellen and i want to marry each other  thats plain english isnt it  got that  and ellen says she cant unless you give her back some tomfool promise she made  come now will you do it  will you do it  yes said rosemary  norman bounced up and seized her reluctant hand  good  i knew you wouldi told ellen you would  i knew it would only take a minute  now girl you go home and tell ellen and well have a wedding in a fortnight and youll come and live with us  we shant leave you to roost on that hilltop like a lonely crowdont you worry  i know you hate me but lord itll be great fun living with some one that hates me  lifell have some spice in it after this  ellen will roast me and youll freeze me  i wont have a dull moment  rosemary did not condescend to tell him that nothing would ever induce her to live in his house  she let him go striding back to the glen oozing delight and complacency and she walked slowly up the hill home  she had known this was coming ever since she had returned from kingsport and found norman douglas established as a frequent evening caller  his name was never mentioned between her and ellen but the very avoidance of it was significant  it was not in rosemarys nature to feel bitter or she would have felt very bitter  she was coldly civil to norman and she made no difference in any way with ellen  but ellen had not found much comfort in her second courtship  she was in the garden attended by st george when rosemary came home  the two sisters met in the dahlia walk  st george sat down on the gravel walk between them and folded his glossy black tail gracefully around his white paws with all the indifference of a wellfed wellbred wellgroomed cat  did you ever see such dahlias demanded ellen proudly  they are just the finest weve ever had  rosemary had never cared for dahlias  their presence in the garden was her concession to ellens taste  she noticed one huge mottled one of crimson and yellow that lorded it over all the others  that dahlia she said pointing to it is exactly like norman douglas  it might easily be his twin brother  ellens darkbrowed face flushed  she admired the dahlia in question but she knew rosemary did not and that no compliment was intended  but she dared not resent rosemarys speechpoor ellen dared not resent anything just then  and it was the first time rosemary had ever mentioned normans name to her  she felt that this portended something  i met norman douglas in the valley said rosemary looking straight at her sister and he told me you and he wanted to be marriedif i would give you permission  yes  what did you say asked ellen trying to speak naturally and offhandedly and failing completely  she could not meet rosemarys eyes  she looked down at st georges sleek back and felt horribly afraid  rosemary had either said she would or she wouldnt  if she would ellen would feel so ashamed and remorseful that she would be a very uncomfortable brideelect and if she wouldntwell ellen had once learned to live without norman douglas but she had forgotten the lesson and felt that she could never learn it again  i said that as far as i was concerned you were at full liberty to marry each other as soon as you liked said rosemary  thank you said ellen still looking at st george  rosemarys face softened  i hope youll be happy ellen she said gently  oh rosemary ellen looked up in distress im so ashamedi dont deserve itafter all i said to you  we wont speak about that said rosemary hurriedly and decidedly  butbut persisted ellen you are free now tooand its not too latejohn meredith  ellen west  rosemary had a little spark of temper under all her sweetness and it flashed forth now in her blue eyes  have you quite lost your senses in every respect  do you suppose for an instant that i am going to go to john meredith and say meekly please sir ive changed my mind and please sir i hope you havent changed yours  is that what you want me to do  nonobut a littleencouragementhe would come back  never  he despises meand rightly  no more of this ellen  i bear you no grudgemarry whom you like  but no meddling in my affairs  then you must come and live with me said ellen  i shall not leave you here alone  do you really think that i would go and live in norman douglass house  why not cried ellen half angrily despite her humiliation  rosemary began to laugh  ellen i thought you had a sense of humour  can you see me doing it  i dont see why you wouldnt  his house is big enoughyoud have your share of it to yourselfhe wouldnt interfere  ellen the thing is not to be thought of  dont bring this up again  then said ellen coldly and determinedly i shall not marry him  i shall not leave you here alone  that is all there is to be said about it  nonsense ellen  it is not nonsense  it is my firm decision  it would be absurd for you to think of living here by yourselfa mile from any other house  if you wont come with me ill stay with you  now we wont argue the matter so dont try  i shall leave norman to do the arguing said rosemary  ill deal with norman  i can manage him  i would never have asked you to give me back my promiseneverbut i had to tell norman why i couldnt marry him and he said he would ask you  i couldnt prevent him  you need not suppose you are the only person in the world who possesses selfrespect  i never dreamed of marrying and leaving you here alone  and youll find i can be as determined as yourself  rosemary turned away and went into the house with a shrug of her shoulders  ellen looked down at st george who had never blinked an eyelash or stirred a whisker during the whole interview  st george this world would be a dull place without the men ill admit but im almost tempted to wish there wasnt one of em in it  look at the trouble and bother theyve made right here georgetorn our happy old life completely up by the roots saint  john meredith began it and norman douglas has finished it  and now both of them have to go into limbo  norman is the only man i ever met who agrees with me that the kaiser of germany is the most dangerous creature alive on this earthand i cant marry this sensible person because my sister is stubborn and im stubborner  mark my words st george the minister would come back if she raised her little finger  but she wont george shell never do itshe wont even crook itand i dont dare meddle saint  i wont sulk george rosemary didnt sulk so im determined i wont either saint norman will tear up the turf but the long and short of it is st george that all of us old fools must just stop thinking of marrying  well well despair is a free man hope is a slave saint  so now come into the house george and ill solace you with a saucerful of cream  then there will be one happy and contented creature on this hill at least    chapter xxxiii carl isnotwhipped  there is something i think i ought to tell you said mary vance mysteriously  she and faith and una were walking arm in arm through the village having foregathered at mr flaggs store  una and faith exchanged looks which said now something disagreeable is coming  when mary vance thought she ought to tell them things there was seldom much pleasure in the hearing  they often wondered why they kept on liking mary vancefor like her they did in spite of everything  to be sure she was generally a stimulating and agreeable companion  if only she would not have those convictions that it was her duty to tell them things  do you know that rosemary west wont marry your pa because she thinks you are such a wild lot  shes afraid she couldnt bring you up right and so she turned him down  unas heart thrilled with secret exultation  she was very glad to hear that miss west would not marry her father  but faith was rather disappointed  how do you know she asked  oh everybodys saying it  i heard mrs elliott talking it over with mrs doctor  they thought i was too far away to hear but ive got ears like a cats  mrs elliott said she hadnt a doubt that rosemary was afraid to try stepmothering you because youd got such a reputation  your pa never goes up the hill now neither does norman douglas  folks say ellen has jilted him just to get square with him for jilting her ages ago  but norman is going about declaring hell get her yet  and i think you ought to know youve spoiled your pas match and i think its a pity for hes bound to marry somebody before long and rosemary west would have been the best wife i know of for him  you told me all stepmothers were cruel and wicked said una  ohwell said mary rather confusedly theyre mostly awful cranky i know  but rosemary west couldnt be very mean to any one  i tell you if your pa turns round and marries emmeline drew youll wish youd behaved yourselves better and not frightened rosemary out of it  its awful that youve got such a reputation that no decent womanll marry your pa on account of you  of course i know that half the yarns that are told about you aint true  but give a dog a bad name  why some folks are saying that it was jerry and carl that threw the stones through mrs stimsons window the other night when it was really them two boyd boys  but im afraid it was carl that put the eel in old mrs carrs buggy though i said at first i wouldnt believe it until id better proof than old kitty alecs word  i told mrs elliott so right to her face  what did carl do cried faith  well they saynow mind im only telling you what people sayso theres no use in your blaming me for itthat carl and a lot of other boys were fishing eels over the bridge one evening last week  mrs carr drove past in that old rattletrap buggy of hers with the open back  and carl he just up and threw a big eel into the back  when poor old mrs carr was driving up the hill by ingleside that eel came squirming out between her feet  she thought it was a snake and she just give one awful screech and stood up and jumped clean over the wheels  the horse bolted but it went home and no damage was done  but mrs carr jarred her legs most terrible and has had nervous spasms ever since whenever she thinks of the eel  say it was a rotten trick to play on the poor old soul  shes a decent body if she is as queer as dicks hat band  faith and una looked at each other again  this was a matter for the goodconduct club  they would not talk it over with mary  there goes your pa said mary as mr meredith passed them and never seeing us no moren if we werent here  well im getting sos i dont mind it  but there are folks who do  mr meredith had not seen them but he was not walking along in his usual dreamy and abstracted fashion  he strode up the hill in agitation and distress  mrs alec davis had just told him the story of carl and the eel  she had been very indignant about it old mrs carr was her third cousin  mr meredith was more than indignant  he was hurt and shocked  he had not thought carl would do anything like this  he was not inclined to be hard on pranks of heedlessness or forgetfulness but this was different this had a nasty tang in it  when he reached home he found carl on the lawn patiently studying the habits and customs of a colony of wasps  calling him into the study mr meredith confronted him with a sterner face than any of his children had ever seen before and asked him if the story were true  yes said carl flushing but meeting his fathers eyes bravely  mr meredith groaned  he had hoped that there had been at least exaggeration  tell me the whole matter he said  the boys were fishing for eels over the bridge said carl link drew had caught a whopperi mean an awful big onethe biggest eel i ever saw  he caught it right at the start and it had been lying in his basket a long time still as still  i thought it was dead honest i did  then old mrs carr drove over the bridge and she called us all young varmints and told us to go home  and we hadnt said a word to her father truly  so when she drove back again after going to the store the boys dared me to put links eel in her buggy  i thought it was so dead it couldnt hurt her and i threw it in  then the eel came to life on the hill and we heard her scream and saw her jump out  i was awful sorry  thats all father  it was not quite as bad as mr meredith had feared but it was quite bad enough  i must punish you carl he said sorrowfully  yes i know father  ii must whip you  carl winced  he had never been whipped  then seeing how badly his father felt he said cheerfully  all right father  mr meredith misunderstood his cheerfulness and thought him insensible  he told carl to come to the study after supper and when the boy had gone out he flung himself into his chair and groaned again  he dreaded the evening sevenfold more than carl did  the poor minister did not even know what he should whip his boy with  what was used to whip boys  rods  canes  no that would be too brutal  a timber switch then  and he john meredith must hie him to the woods and cut one  it was an abominable thought  then a picture presented itself unbidden to his mind  he saw mrs carrs wizened nutcracker little face at the appearance of that reviving eelhe saw her sailing witchlike over the buggy wheels  before he could prevent himself the minister laughed  then he was angry with himself and angrier still with carl  he would get that switch at onceand it must not be too limber after all  carl was talking the matter over in the graveyard with faith and una who had just come home  they were horrified at the idea of his being whippedand by father who had never done such a thing  but they agreed soberly that it was just  you know it was a dreadful thing to do sighed faith  and you never owned up in the club  i forgot said carl  besides i didnt think any harm came of it  i didnt know she jarred her legs  but im to be whipped and that will make things square  will it hurtvery much said una slipping her hand into carls  oh not so much i guess said carl gamely  anyhow im not going to cry no matter how much it hurts  it would make father feel so bad if i did  hes all cut up now  i wish i could whip myself hard enough and save him doing it  after supper at which carl had eaten little and mr meredith nothing at all both went silently into the study  the switch lay on the table  mr meredith had had a bad time getting a switch to suit him  he cut one then felt it was too slender carl had done a really indefensible thing  then he cut anotherit was far too thick  after all carl had thought the eel was dead  the third one suited him better but as he picked it up from the table it seemed very thick and heavymore like a stick than a switch  hold out your hand he said to carl  carl threw back his head and held out his hand unflinchingly but he was not very old and he could not quite keep a little fear out of his eyes  mr meredith looked down into those eyeswhy they were cecilias eyesher very eyesand in them was the selfsame expression he had once seen in cecilias eyes when she had come to him to tell him something she had been a little afraid to tell him  here were her eyes in carls little white faceand six weeks ago he had thought through one endless terrible night that his little lad was dying  john meredith threw down the switch  go he said i cannot whip you  carl fled to the graveyard feeling that the look on his fathers face was worse than any whipping  is it over so soon asked faith  she and una had been holding hands and setting teeth on the pollock tombstone  hehe didnt whip me at all said carl with a sob andi wish he hadand hes in there feeling just awful  una slipped away  her heart yearned to comfort her father  as noiselessly as a little gray mouse she opened the study door and crept in  the room was dark with twilight  her father was sitting at his desk  his back was towards herhis head was in his hands  he was talking to himselfbroken anguished words but una heardheard and understood with the sudden illumination that comes to sensitive unmothered children  as silently as she had come in she slipped out and closed the door  john meredith went on talking out his pain in what he deemed his undisturbed solitude    chapter xxxiv una visits the hill  una went upstairs  carl and faith were already on their way through the early moonlight to rainbow valley having heard therefrom the elfin lilt of jerrys jewsharp and having guessed that the blythes were there and fun afoot  una had no wish to go  she sought her own room first where she sat down on her bed and had a little cry  she did not want anybody to come in her dear mothers place  she did not want a stepmother who would hate her and make her father hate her  but father was so desperately unhappyand if she could do any anything to make him happier she must do it  there was only one thing she could doand she had known the moment she had left the study that she must do it  but it was a very hard thing to do  after una cried her heart out she wiped her eyes and went to the spare room  it was dark and rather musty for the blind had not been drawn up nor the window opened for a long time  aunt martha was no freshair fiend  but as nobody ever thought of shutting a door in the manse this did not matter so much save when some unfortunate minister came to stay all night and was compelled to breathe the spare room atmosphere  there was a closet in the spare room and far back in the closet a gray silk dress was hanging  una went into the closet and shut the door went down on her knees and pressed her face against the soft silken folds  it had been her mothers weddingdress  it was still full of a sweet faint haunting perfume like lingering love  una always felt very close to her mother thereas if she were kneeling at her feet with head in her lap she went there once in a long while when life was too hard  mother she whispered to the gray silk gown i will never forget you mother and ill always love you best  but i have to do it mother because father is so very unhappy  i know you wouldnt want him to be unhappy  and i will be very good to her mother and try to love her even if she is like mary vance said stepmothers always were  una carried some fine spiritual strength away from her secret shrine  she slept peacefully that night with the tear stains still glistening on her sweet serious little face  the next afternoon she put on her best dress and hat  they were shabby enough  every other little girl in the glen had new clothes that summer except faith and una  mary vance had a lovely dress of white embroidered lawn with scarlet silk sash and shoulder bows  but today una did not mind her shabbiness she only wanted to be very neat  she washed her face carefully she brushed her black hair until it was as smooth as satin  she tied her shoelaces carefully having first sewed up two runs in her one pair of good stockings  she would have liked to black her shoes but she could not find any blacking  finally she slipped away from the manse down through rainbow valley up through the whispering woods and out to the road that ran past the house on the hill  it was quite a long walk and una was tired and warm when she got there  she saw rosemary west sitting under a tree in the garden and stole past the dahlia beds to her  rosemary had a book in her lap but she was gazing afar across the harbour and her thoughts were sorrowful enough  life had not been pleasant lately in the house on the hill  ellen had not sulkedellen had been a brick but things can be felt that are never said and at times the silence between the two women was intolerably eloquent  all the many familiar things that had once made life sweet had a flavour of bitterness now  norman douglas made periodical irruptions also bullying and coaxing ellen by turns  it would end rosemary believed by his dragging ellen off with him some day and rosemary felt that she would be almost glad when it happened existence would be horribly lonely then but it would be no longer charged with dynamite  she was roused from her unpleasant reverie by a timid little touch on her shoulder  turning she saw una meredith  why una dear did you walk up here in all this heat  yes said una i came toi came to  but she found it very hard to say what she had come to do  her voice failedher eyes filled with tears  why una little girl what is the trouble  dont be afraid to tell me  rosemary put her arm around the thin little form and drew the child close to her  her eyes were very beautifulher touch so tender that una found courage  i cameto ask youto marry father she gasped  rosemary was silent for a moment from sheer dumbfounderment  she stared at una blankly  oh dont be angry please dear miss west said una pleadingly  you see everybody is saying that you wouldnt marry father because we are so bad  he is very unhappy about it so i thought i would come and tell you that we are never bad on purpose  and if you will only marry father we will all try to be good and do just what you tell us  im sure you wont have any trouble with us  please miss west  rosemary had been thinking rapidly  gossiping surmise she saw had put this mistaken idea into unas mind  she must be perfectly frank and sincere with the child  una dear she said softly  it isnt because of you poor little souls that i cannot be your fathers wife  i never thought of such a thing  you are not badi never supposed you were  therethere was another reason altogether una  dont you like father asked una lifting reproachful eyes oh miss west you dont know how nice he is  im sure hed make you a good husband  even in the midst of her perplexity and distress rosemary couldnt help a twisted little smile  oh dont laugh miss west una cried passionately  father feels dreadful about it  i think youre mistaken dear said rosemary  im not  im sure im not  oh miss west father was going to whip carl yesterdaycarl had been naughtyand father couldnt do it because you see he had no practice in whipping  so when carl came out and told us father felt so bad i slipped into the study to see if i could help himhe likes me to comfort him miss westand he didnt hear me come in and i heard what he was saying  ill tell you miss west if youll let me whisper it in your ear  una whispered earnestly  rosemarys face turned crimson  so john meredith still cared  he hadnt changed his mind  and he must care intensely if he had said thatcare more than she had ever supposed he did  she sat still for a moment stroking unas hair  then she said  will you take a little letter from me to your father una  oh are you going to marry him miss west asked una eagerly  perhapsif he really wants me to said rosemary blushing again  im gladim glad said una bravely  then she looked up with quivering lips  oh miss west you wont turn father against usyou wont make him hate us will you she said beseechingly  rosemary stared again  una meredith  do you think i would do such a thing  whatever put such an idea into your head  mary vance said stepmothers were all like thatand that they all hated their stepchildren and made their father hate themshe said they just couldnt help itjust being stepmothers made them like that  you poor child  and yet you came up here and asked me to marry your father because you wanted to make him happy  youre a darlinga heroineas ellen would say youre a brick  now listen to me very closely dearest  mary vance is a silly little girl who doesnt know very much and she is dreadfully mistaken about some things  i would never dream of trying to turn your father against you  i would love you all dearly  i dont want to take your own mothers placeshe must always have that in your hearts  but neither have i any intention of being a stepmother  i want to be your friend and helper and chum  dont you think that would be nice unaif you and faith and carl and jerry could just think of me as a good jolly chuma big older sister  oh it would be lovely cried una with a transfigured face she flung her arms impulsively round rosemarys neck  she was so happy that she felt as if she could fly on wings  do the othersdo faith and the boys have the same idea you had about stepmothers  no  faith never believed mary vance  i was dreadfully foolish to believe her either  faith loves you alreadyshe has loved you ever since poor adam was eaten  and jerry and carl will think it is jolly  oh miss west when you come to live with us will youcould youteach me to cooka littleand sewand andand do things  i dont know anything  i wont be much troubleill try to learn fast  darling ill teach you and help you all i can  now you wont say a word to anybody about this will younot even to faith until your father himself tells you you may  and youll stay and have tea with me  oh thank youbutbuti think id rather go right back and take the letter to father faltered una  you see hell be glad that much sooner miss west  i see said rosemary  she went to the house wrote a note and gave it to una  when that small damsel had run off a palpitating bundle of happiness rosemary went to ellen who was shelling peas on the back porch  ellen she said una meredith has just been here to ask me to marry her father  ellen looked up and read her sisters face  and youre going to she said  its quite likely  ellen went on shelling peas for a few minutes  then she suddenly put her hands up to her own face  there were tears in her blackbrowed eyes  ii hope well all be happy she said between a sob and a laugh  down at the manse una meredith warm rosy triumphant marched boldly into her fathers study and laid a letter on the desk before him  his pale face flushed as he saw the clear fine handwriting he knew so well  he opened the letter  it was very shortbut he shed twenty years as he read it  rosemary asked him if he could meet her that evening at sunset by the spring in rainbow valley    chapter xxxv let the piper come  and so said miss cornelia the double wedding is to be sometime about the middle of this month  there was a faint chill in the air of the early september evening so anne had lighted her ever ready fire of driftwood in the big living room and she and miss cornelia basked in its fairy flicker  it is so delightfulespecially in regard to mr meredith and rosemary said anne  im as happy in the thought of it as i was when i was getting married myself  i felt exactly like a bride again last evening when i was up on the hill seeing rosemarys trousseau  they tell me her things are fine enough for a princess said susan from a shadowy corner where she was cuddling her brown boy i have been invited up to see them also and i intend to go some evening  i understand that rosemary is to wear white silk and a veil but ellen is to be married in navy blue  i have no doubt mrs dr dear that that is very sensible of her but for my own part i have always felt that if i were ever married i would prefer the white and the veil as being more bridelike  a vision of susan in white and a veil presented itself before annes inner vision and was almost too much for her  as for mr meredith said miss cornelia even his engagement has made a different man of him  he isnt half so dreamy and absentminded believe me  i was so relieved when i heard that he had decided to close the manse and let the children visit round while he was away on his honeymoon  if he had left them and old aunt martha there alone for a month i should have expected to wake every morning and see the place burned down  aunt martha and jerry are coming here said anne  carl is going to elder clows  i havent heard where the girls are going  oh im going to take them said miss cornelia  of course i was glad to but mary would have given me no peace till i asked them any way  the ladies aid is going to clean the manse from top to bottom before the bride and groom come back and norman douglas has arranged to fill the cellar with vegetables  nobody ever saw or heard anything quite like norman douglas these days believe me  hes so tickled that hes going to marry ellen west after wanting her all his life  if i was ellenbut then im not and if she is satisfied i can very well be  i heard her say years ago when she was a schoolgirl that she didnt want a tame puppy for a husband  theres nothing tame about norman believe me  the sun was setting over rainbow valley  the pond was wearing a wonderful tissue of purple and gold and green and crimson  a faint blue haze rested on the eastern hill over which a great pale round moon was just floating up like a silver bubble  they were all there squatted in the little open gladefaith and una jerry and carl jem and walter nan and di and mary vance they had been having a special celebration for it would be jems last evening in rainbow valley  on the morrow he would leave for charlottetown to attend queens academy  their charmed circle would be broken and in spite of the jollity of their little festival there was a hint of sorrow in every gay young heart  seethere is a great golden palace over there in the sunset said walter pointing  look at the shining towerand the crimson banners streaming from them  perhaps a conqueror is riding home from battleand they are hanging them out to do honour to him  oh i wish we had the old days back again exclaimed jem  id love to be a soldiera great triumphant general  id give everything to see a big battle  well jem was to be a soldier and see a greater battle than had ever been fought in the world but that was as yet far in the future and the mother whose firstborn son he was was wont to look on her boys and thank god that the brave days of old which jem longed for were gone for ever and that never would it be necessary for the sons of canada to ride forth to battle for the ashes of their fathers and the temples of their gods  the shadow of the great conflict had not yet made felt any forerunner of its chill  the lads who were to fight and perhaps fall on the fields of france and flanders gallipoli and palestine were still roguish schoolboys with a fair life in prospect before them the girls whose hearts were to be wrung were yet fair little maidens astar with hopes and dreams  slowly the banners of the sunset city gave up their crimson and gold slowly the conquerors pageant faded out  twilight crept over the valley and the little group grew silent  walter had been reading again that day in his beloved book of myths and he remembered how he had once fancied the pied piper coming down the valley on an evening just like this  he began to speak dreamily partly because he wanted to thrill his companions a little partly because something apart from him seemed to be speaking through his lips  the piper is coming nearer he said he is nearer than he was that evening i saw him before  his long shadowy cloak is blowing around him  he pipeshe pipesand we must followjem and carl and jerry and iround and round the world  listen listencant you hear his wild music  the girls shivered  you know youre only pretending protested mary vance and i wish you wouldnt  you make it too real i hate that old piper of yours  but jem sprang up with a gay laugh  he stood up on a little hillock tall and splendid with his open brow and his fearless eyes  there were thousands like him all over the land of the maple  let the piper come and welcome he cried waving his hand ill follow him gladly round and round the world  the end
