was an exceedingly   simple meal                      frontispiece  richard vont was headkeeper at mandeleys when   i succeeded to the title and estates  i expect we are all as bad though she went   on rather gloomily even if we are not   quite so blatant  youre very hard father she said simply     the wicked marquis    chapter i  reginald philip graham thursford baron travers marquis of mandeleys issued one may morning from the gloomy precincts of the law courts without haste yet with certain evidences of a definite desire to leave the place behind him  he crossed first the pavement and then the street piloted here and there by his somewhat obsequious companion and turned along the strand westwards  then in that democratic thoroughfare for the first time since the calamity had happened his lips were unlocked in somewhat singular fashion  well im damned he exclaimed with slow and significant emphasis  his companion glanced up furtively in his direction  the marquis as marquises should be was very tall and slim with high wellshaped nose very little flesh upon his face a mouth of uncertain shape and eyes of uncertain colour  his companion as solicitors to the aristocracy should be was of a smaller more rotund and insignificant shape  he had the healthy complexion however of the weekend golfer and he affected a certain unlegal rakishness of attire much in vogue amongst members of his profession having connections in high circles in his heart he very much admired the ease and naturalness with which his patron in the heart of professional london strode along by his side in a wellworn tweed suit a collar of somewhat ancient design and a tie which had seen better days  the judges decision was without doubt calamitous he confessed gloomily  the marquis turned in at the savoy courtyard with the air of an habitué  i am in need of a brief rest and some refreshment he said  you will accompany me if you please mr wadham  the lawyer acquiesced and felt somehow that he had become the tail end of a procession the marquiss entrance and progress through the grillroom towards the smokingroom bar was marked by much deference on the part of porters cloakroom attendants and waiters a deference acknowledged in the barest possible fashion yet in a manner which his satellite decided to make a study of  they reached a retired corner of the smoking room where the marquis subsided into the only vacant easy chair ordered for himself a glass of dry sherry and left his companion to select his own refreshment and pay for both  what the former enquired is the next step  there is alas mr wadham replied no next step  exactly what do you mean by that the marquis demanded knitting his brows slightly as he sipped his sherry  we have reached the end the lawyer pronounced  the decision given by the court today is final  the marquis set down his glass  the thing was absurd  surely he suggested the house of lords remains  without a doubt your lordship mr wadham assented but it is of no use to us in the present instance  the judge of the supreme courtthis is bytheby our third appealhas delivered a final decision  the marquis seemed vaguely puzzled  the house of lords he persisted remains surely a court of appeal for members of my order whose claims to consideration are not always fully recognised in the democracy of the common law court  i fear mr wadham replied with a little cough that the house of lords is supposed to have other functions  other functions  in an indirect sort of fashion mr wadham continued it is supposed to assist in the government of the country  god bless my soul the marquis exclaimed  there was a queer intangible silence  the lawyer was quite aware that a storm was brewing but as his distinguished client never lost his temper or showed annoyance in any of the ordinary plebeian ways he was conscious of some curiosity as to what might happen next  you mean to say then the marquis continued that for the rest of my days and in the days of those who may succeed me that edifice that cottage which for generations has sheltered one of the family retainers is to remain the property ofof an alien  i fear that that is the decision of the court the lawyer admitted the deed of gift was exceptionally binding  the marquis shook his head  the thing was incomprehensible  i can stand upon the roof of mandeleys he said and i can look north south east and west and in no direction can i look off my own land  yet you mean to tell me that almost in my garden there is to remain a demesne which can be occupied by any tom dick or harry which its nominal owner chooses to place in possession  the lawyer signed to the waiter for their glasses to be replenished  it is certainly not justice your lordship he admittedit is not even reasonablebut it is the law  the marquis produced a gold cigarette case absently lit a cigarette and returned the case to his pocket without offering it to his companion  he smoked meditatively and sipped his second glass of sherry  a state of things he declared has been revealed to me which i cannot at present grasp  i must discuss the matter with robertwith my soninlaw sir robert lees  he is an intensely modern person and he may be able to suggest something  sir robert is a very clever man the lawyer acknowledged but failing an arrangement with the tenant himself i cannot see that there is anything further to be done  we have in short exhausted the law  a process the marquis observed sympathetically which i fear that you must have found expensive mr wadham  the various suits into which we have entered on behalf of your lordship and the costs which we have had to pay the latter hastened to announce amount i regret to say to something over eighteen thousand pounds  dear me his companion sighed  it seems quite a great deal of money  since we are upon the subject the lawyer proceeded my firm has suggested that i should approach your lordship with regard to some means ofpardon mereducing the liability in question  so far as the face of mr wadhams client was capable of expressing anything it expressed now a certain amount of surprise  it appears to me mr wadham he remarked that you are asking me to attend to your business for you  the lawyer knitted his brows in puzzled fashion  i am not sure that i quite follow your lordship he murmured  do i employ you his patron continued to manage my estates to control my finances to act as agent to all my properties and yet need to keep a perspective myself of my various assets  if eighteen thousand pounds is required it is for your firm to decide from what quarter the money should come  personally as you know i never interfere  mr wadham coughed in somewhat embarrassed fashion  as a matter of fact your lordship he confessed with a most illogical sense that it was his duty to apologise for his clients impecuniosity as a matter of fact neither my partners nor i can at the present moment see where a sum of eighteen thousand pounds can be raised  the marquis rose to his feet and shook the cigarette ash carefully from his coat  our conversation mr wadham he said is reaching a stage which bores me  i have just remembered too he added with a glance at the clock that my daughter is entertaining a few friends to lunch  you must write to merridrew  he is really a most excellent agent  he will tell you what balances are likely to be available during the next few months  mr wadham received the suggestion without enthusiasm  we made an application to mr merridrew some few weeks ago he remarked as we needed some ready money for the purpose of briefing the barristers  mr merridrews reply was not encouraging  ah the marquis murmured  merridrew is a gloomy dog sometimes  try him again  it is astonishing how elastic he can be if he is squeezed  i am afraid your lordship has done all the squeezing the solicitor observed ruefully  a little trill of feminine laughter rang through the room  two smartly attired young ladies were seated upon a divan near the door surrounded by a little group of acquaintances  one of them leaned forward and nodded as the marquis and his companion passed  how do you do marquis she said in distinctly transatlantic accents  the behaviour of his client under such circumstances remained an object lesson to mr wadham for the rest of his life  the marquis gazed with the faintest expression of surprise at or perhaps through the young person who had addressed him  fumbling for a moment in his waistcoat pocket he raised a hornrimmed monocle to his eye dropped it almost at once and passed on without the flicker of an eyelid  on their way to the outside door however he shook his head gravely  what a singular exhibition he murmureddemonstration perhaps i should sayof the crudeness of modern social intercourse  was it my fancy wadham or did the young person up there address me  she certainly did the other assented  she even called you by name  they were standing in the courtyard now waiting for a taxi and the marquis sighed  in a public place too he murmured  wadham i am afraid that we are living in the wrong age  i came to that conclusion only a few days ago when i was invited actually invited to dine at the house of but i forget wadham i forget  your grandfather would appreciate these things  you yourself are somewhat imbued i fear with the modern taint  a handful of silver if you please he added holding out his hand  i am not accustomed to these chance conveyances  the lawyer searched his trousers pockets and produced a couple of pink notes and a few halfcrowns  in some mysterious fashion the whole seemed to pass into the marquiss long aristocratic hand  he turned to the porter who was standing bareheaded and slipped a tenshilling note into his palm  well good morning wadham he said stepping into his taxicab  i have no doubt that you did your best but this mornings unfortunate happening will take me some time to get over  my compliments to your senior partner  you can say that i am disappointedno more  the marquis crossed his legs and leaned back in the vehicle  mr wadham remained upon the pavement gazing for a moment at his empty hand  taxi sir the hall porter asked obsequiously  mr wadham felt in all his pockets  thank you he replied gloomily ill walk     chapter ii  lady letitia thursford the only unmarried daughter of the marquis stood in a corner of the spacious drawingroom at 94 grosvenor square talking to her brotherinlaw  sir robert although he wanted his luncheon very badly and owing to some mistake had come a quarter of an hour too soon retained his customary good nature  he always enjoyed talking to his favourite relationinlaw  i say letty he remarked screwing his eyeglass into his eye and looking around youre getting pretty shabby here eh  lady letitia smiled composedly  that is the worst of you nouveaux riches she declared  you do not appreciate the harmonising influence of the hand of time  this isnt shabbiness its tone  nouveaux riches indeed he repeated  better not let your father hear you call me names  father wouldnt care a bit she replied  as for this drawingroom robert well sixty years ago it must have been hideous  today i rather like it  it is absolutely and entirely victorian even to the smell  sir robert sniffed vigorously  i follow you he agreed  old lavender perfume ottomans highbacked chairs chintzes that look as though they came out of the ark and a few mouldy daguerreotypes  the whole things here all right  perhaps its just as well for us that it is she observed  i have come to the conclusion that furniture people are the least trustful in the world  i dont think even dad could get a vanload of furniture on credit  sir robert nodded sympathetically  he was a pleasantlooking man a little under middle age with bright alert expression black hair and moustache and perhaps a little too perfectly dressed  he just escaped being called dapper  chucking a bit more away in the law courts isnt he  letitia indulged in a little grimace  not even you could make him see reason about that she sighed  he is certain to lose his case and it must be costing him thousands  dashed annoying thing sir robert remarked meditatively to have a cottage within a hundred yards of your hall door which belongs to some one else  it is annoying of course letitia assented but there is no doubt whatever that uncle christopher made it over to the vonts absolutely and i dont see how we could possibly upset the deed of gift  i am now she continued moving towards a stand of geraniums and beginning to snip off some dead leaves about to conclude the picture  you behold the maiden of bygone days who condescended sometimes to make herself useful  the scissors snipped energetically and sir robert watched his sisterinlaw  she was inclined to be tall remarkably graceful in a fashion of her own a little pale with masses of brown hair and eyes which defied any sort of colour analysis  but what sir robert chiefly loved about her were the two little lines of humour at the corners of her firm womanly mouth  yes youre in the setting all right letty he declared and yet you are rather puzzling  just now you look as though you only wanted the crinoline and the little curls to be some ones grandmother in her youth  yet at that picture show the other night you were quite the most modern thing there  its just how im feeling she confided with a little sigh standing back and surveying her handiwork  i have that rare gift you know robert of governing my personality from inside  when i am in this room i feel victorian and i am victorian  when i hear that russian mans music which is driving every one crazy just nowwell i feel and i suppose i look different  heres meg coming  how well she looks  they watched the motorcar draw up outside and the little business of lady margaret leess descent carried out in quite the best fashion  a footman stood at the door a greyhaired butler in plain clothes adventured as far as the bottom step behind there was just the suggestion of something in livery  yes megs all right sir robert replied  jolly good wife she is too  why dont you marry letty  perhaps she laughed leaning a little towards him because i did not go to a certain house party at raynham court three years ago  are you conceited enough he inquired to imagine that i should have chosen you instead of meg if you had been there  perhaps i should have been a little too young she admitted  why havent you a brother robert  i dont believe youd have married him if i had he answered bluntly  im not really your sort you know  lady margaret swept in very voluble but a little discursive  isnt this just like bob she exclaimed  i believe he always comes here early on purpose to find you alone letty  whos coming to lunch please  and wheres dad  father should be on his way home from the law courts by now letitia replied and i am afraid its a very dull luncheon for you meg  aunt caroline is coming and an american man she travelled over on the steamer with  i am not quite sure whether she expects to let bayfield to him or offer him to me as a husband but i am sure she has designs  the duchess is always so helpful robert grunted  so long as it costs her nothing lady margaret declared nothing makes her so happy as to put the whole world to rights  here she comesin a taxicab too sir robert announced looking out of the window  she is getting positively penurious  she is probably showing off before the american lady margaret remarked  she is always talking about living in a semidetached house and making her own clothes  up to the present though she has stuck to worth  the duchess who duly arrived a few moments later brought with her into the room a different and essentially a more cosmopolitan atmosphere  she was a tall fair woman attractive in an odd sort of way with large features a delightful smile and a habit of rapid speech  she exchanged hasty greetings with every one present and then turned back towards the man who had followed her into the room  letty dear this is mr david thainlady letitia thursford  i told you about mr thain dear didnt i  this is almost his first visit to england and i want every one to be nice to him  mr thain this is my other niece lady margaret lees and her husband sir robert lees wheres reginald  father will be here directly letitia replied  if any ones famished we can commence lunch  then let us commence by all means the duchess suggested  i have been giving the whole of the morning to mr thain improving his mind and showing him things  we wound up with the shopsalthough i am sure alfreds tradespeople are no use to any one  letitia moved a few steps towards the bell and on her way back she encountered the somewhat earnest gaze of her aunts protégé  even in those few moments since his entrance she had been conscious of a somewhat different atmosphere in the faded but stately room  he had the air of appraising everything yet belonging nowhere of being wholly out of touch with an environment which he could scarcely be expected to understand or appreciate  he was not noticeably illatease  on the other hand his deportment was too rigid for naturalness and she was conscious of some quality in his rather too steadfast scrutiny of herself which militated strongly against her usual toleration  he seemed to stand for events and in the lives which they mostly lived events were ignored  the butler opened the door and announced luncheon  they crossed the very handsome if somewhat empty hall into the sombre mahoganyfurnished dining room the walls of which were closely hung with oil paintings  letitia motioned the stranger to sit at her right hand and fancied that he seemed a little relieved at this brief escape from his cicerone  having gone so far however she ignored him for several moments whilst she watched the seating of her other guests her brotherinlaw she drew to the vacant place on her left  i dare say father will lunch at the club she whispered  aunt caroline always ruffles him  i am afraid he will have found something down temple bar way to ruffle him a great deal more this morning sir robert replied  the door of the dining room was at that moment thrown open however and the marquis entered  pausing for a moment on the threshold in line with a long row of dingy portraits there was something distinctly striking in the family likeness so mercilessly reproduced in his long face with the somewhat high cheek bones his tall angular figure the easy bearing and gracious smile  one missed the snuffbox from between his fingers and the uniform but there was yet something curiously unmodern in the appearance of this last representative of the mandeleys  let no one disturb themselves pray he begged  i am a little late my dear caroline i am delighted to see you he went on raising his sisters fingers to his lips  margaret i shall make no enquiries about your health  you are looking wonderfully well today  the duchess glanced towards her protégé who had risen to his feet and stood facing his newly arrived host  there was a moments poignant silence  the two men for some reason or other seemed to regard each other with no common interest  this is my friend mr david thain the duchess announcedmy brother the marquis of mandeleys  mr thain is an american reginald  the marquis shook hands with his guest a form of welcome in which he seldom indulged  any friend of yours caroline he said quietly is very welcome to my house  robert he added as he took his seat they tell me that you were talking rubbish about agriculture in the house last night why do you talk about agriculture  you know nothing about it  you are not even so far as i remember a landed proprietor  sir robert smiled  and therefore sir i am unprejudiced  no one can talk about land nowadays without being prejudiced his fatherinlaw rejoined  father letitia begged do tell us about the case  the marquis watched the whiskey and soda with which his glass was being filled  the case my dear he acknowledged has i am sorry to say gone against me  a remarkably illinformed and unattractive looking person whom they tell me will presently be lord chief justice presumed not only to give a decision which was in itself quite absurd but also refused leave to appeal  sorry to hear that sir sir robert remarked  cost you a lot of money too im afraid  i believe that it has been an expensive case the marquis admitted my lawyer seemed very depressed about it  and you mean to say that its really all over and done with now lady margaret enquired  for the present it certainly seems so the marquis replied  i cannot believe personally that the laws of my country afford me no relief under the peculiar circumstances of the case  according to mr wadham however they do not  what is it all about anyway reginald his sister asked  i have heard more than once but i have forgotten  whenever i look in the paper for a divorce case i nearly always see your name against the king or the king against you with a person named vont also interested  surely the vont family have been retainers down at mandeleys for generations  i remember one of them perfectly well  the marquis cleared his throat  the unfortunate circumstances he said are perhaps little known even amongst the members of my own family  perhaps it will suffice if i say that owing to an indiscretion of my uncle and predecessor the eleventh marquis a gamekeepers cottage and small plot of land curiously situated in the shadow of mandeleys became the property of a yeoman of the name of vont  this illadvised and singular action of my late uncle is complicated by the fact that the inheritors of his bounty have become as a family inimical to their patrons  their present representative for instance is obsessed by some real or fancied grievance upon which i scarcely care to dilate  for nearly twenty years the marquis continued ruminatively the cottage has been empty except for the presence of an elderly person who died some years ago since then i have through my lawyers endeavoured both by purchase and by upsetting the deed of gift to regain possession of the property  the legal owner appears to be domiciled in america and as he has been able to resist my lawsuits and has refused all my offers of purchase i gather that in that democratic country he has amassed a certain measure of wealth  we are now confronted with the fact that this person announces his intention of returning to england and taking up his residence within a few yards of my front door  sir robert laughed heartily  upon my word sir he exclaimed its a humorous situation  the marquis was unruffled but bitter  your sense of humour my dear robert he said suffers i fear from your daily associations in the house of commons  the man by letitias side suddenly leaned forward  after the smooth and pleasant voice of the marquis his question with its slight transatlantic accent sounded almost harsh  what did you say that mans name was marquis  richard vont was the courteous reply  the name is a singular one but america is a vast country  i imagine it is scarcely possible that in the course of your travels you have come across a person so named  a man calling himself richard vont crossed in the steamer with me three weeks ago david thain announced  i have not the least doubt that this is the man who is coming to occupy the cottage you speak of  it is indeed a small world the marquis remarked  i will not inflict this family matter upon you all any longer  after lunch perhaps you will spare me a few moments of your time mrmr thain i shall be interested to hear more about this person  letitia rose presently to leave the room  whilst she waited for her aunt to conclude a little anecdote she glanced with some interest at the man by her side  more than ever the sense of his incongruity with that atmosphere seemed borne in upon her yet she was forced to concede to him notwithstanding the delicacy of his appearance a certain unexpected strength a forcefulness of tone and manner which gave him a certain distinction  he had risen waiting for her passing and one lean brown hand gripped the back of the chair in which she had been sitting  she carried away with her into the victorian drawingroom with its odour of faded lavender a queer sense of having been brought into momentary association with stronger and more vital things in life     chapter iii  sir robert preferred to join his wife and sisterinlaw in the drawingroom after luncheon  the marquis with a courteous word of invitation led his remaining guest across the grey stone hall into the library beyonda sparsely furnished and yet imposing looking apartment with its great tiers of books and austere book cases  on his way he drew attention carelessly to one or two paintings by old masters and pointed out a remarkable statue presented by a famous italian sculptor to his greatgrandfather and now counted amongst the worlds treasures  his guest watched and observed in silence  there was nothing of the uncouth sightseer about him still less of the fulsome dilettante  they settled themselves in comfortable chairs in a pleasant corner of the apartment  a footman served them with coffee a second man handed cigars and the butler himself carried a tray of liqueurs  the marquis assumed an attitude of complete satisfaction with the world in general  i am pleased to have this opportunity of a few words with you mr thain he said  you are quite comfortable in that chair i trust  perfectly thank you  and my larangas are not too mild  you will find darkercoloured cigars in the cabinet by your side  thank you david thain replied i smoke only mild tobacco  personally the marquis sighed i can go no further than cigarettes a vice perhaps he added watching the blue smoke curl upwards but a fascinating one  so you came across this man vont on the steamer might i ask under what circumstances  richard vont as i think he called himself was the quiet reply shared a cabin in the second class with my servant  i was over there once or twice and talked with him  that is very interesting the marquis observed  he travelled second class eh  and yet the man has many thousands to throw away in these absurd lawsuits with me  he may have money thain pointed out and yet feel more at home in the second class  i understood that he had been a gamekeeper in england and was returning to his old home  did he speak of his purpose in doing so  on the contrary he was singularly taciturn  all that i could gather from him was that he was returning to fulfill some purpose which he had kept before him for a great many years  the marquis sighed  on his high shapely forehead could be traced the lines of a regretful frown  i was sure of it he groaned  the fellow is returning to make himself a nuisance to me  he did not tell you his story then mr thain  he showed no inclination to do soin fact he avoided so far as possible all discussion of his past  richard vont the marquis continued raising his eyes to the ceiling was one of those sturdy thickheaded unintelligent yeomen who have been spoiled by the trifle of education doled out to their grandfathers their fathers and themselves  a few hundred years ago they formed excellent retainers to the nobles under whose patronage they lived  today in these hideously degenerate days mr thain when half the world has moved forward and half stood still they are an anachronism  they find no seemly place in modern life  david thain sat very still  there was just a little flash in his eyes which came and went as sunlight might have gleamed across naked steel  but i must not forget his host went on tolerantly that i am speaking now to one who must to some extent have lost his sense of social proportion by a prolonged sojourn in a country where life is more or less a jumble  you refer to america  naturally  as a country resembling more than anything a gigantic sausage machine wherein all races and men of all social status are broken up on the wheel puffed up with false ideas and thrown out upon the world a newly fledged cunning but singularly ignorant race of individuals america possesses great interest to thoseto those in short the marquis declared with a little wave of the hand whom such things interest  i am english my forefathers were saxon my instincts are perhaps feudal  that is why i regard the case of richard vont from a point of view which you might possibly fail to appreciate would it bore you if i continue  not in the least david thain assured him  richard vont was headkeeper at mandeleys when i succeeded to the title and estates an advent which occurred a few years after my wifes death  he was already occupying a peculiar position there owing to the generosity of my predecessor whose life he had had the good fortune to save  he had very foolishly married above him in stationthe girl was a school mistress i believe  when i came to mandeleys i found him living there a widower with one daughter and a little boy his nephew  the girl inherited her mothers superiority of station and intellect and was naturally unhappy  i noticed her with interest and she responded  consequences which in the days of our ancestors mr thain would have been esteemed an honour to the persons concerned ensued  richard vont like an ignorant clodhopper viewed the matter from the wrong standpoint  you said something i believe  pardon me  i sometimes fancy that i am a little deaf in my left ear  illustration richard vont was headkeeper at mandeleys when i succeeded to the title and estates  the marquis leaned forward but david thain shook his head  his lips had moved indeed but no word had issued from them  so far his host went on the story contains no novel features  i exercised what my ancestors in whose spirit i may say that i live would have claimed as an undoubted right  richard vont as i have said with his inheritance of illbestowed education and a measure of that extraordinary socialistic poison which seems during the last few generations to have settled like an epidemic in the systems of the agricultural classes resented my action  his behaviour became so intolerable that i was forced to dismiss him from my service and finally to avoid a continuance of melodramatic scenes which were extremely unpleasant to every one concerned i was obliged to leave england for a time and travel upon the continent  and in the meantime what happened at mandeleys david thain asked  richard vont and his nephew appear to have left for the united states very soon after my own departure from england  the cottage he left in the care of an elderly relative who gave little trouble but much annoyance  she attended a primitive methodist chapel in the village and she passed both myself and the ladies of my household at all times without obeisance  dear me david thain murmured under his breath  after her death i instructed my lawyers to examine the legal title to the vont property and to see whether there was any chance of regaining it  its value would be at the outside say six or seven hundred pounds  i advertised and offered two thousand five hundred pounds to regain it  my solicitors came into touch with the man vont through an agent in america  his reply to their propositions on my behalf does not bear repetition  i then instructed my lawyers to take such steps as they could to have the deed of gift set aside sufficient compensation of course being promised  that must have been some eight years ago  my efforts have come to an end today  the cottage remains the property of richard vont  my own law costs have been considerable but by some means or other this man vont has contrived to defend his property at the expenditure of some five or six thousand pounds  one can only conclude that he must have prospered in this strange country of yours mr thain  to a stranger the latter observed it seems curious that this man should have set so high a value upon a property which must be full of painful associations to him  the very arguments i made use of in our earlier correspondence his host assented  i have told you the story mr thain because it occurred to me that this man might have communicated to you his reason for returning after all these years to the neighbourhood  he told me nothing  then i have wasted your time with a long and i fear a very dull story the marquis apologised gracefully  shall we join the others  there was just one question if i might be permitted david thain said which i should like to ask concerning the story which you have told me  the girl to whom you have alludedvonts daughterwhat became of her  the marquis for a moment stood perfectly still  he had just risen to his feet and was standing where a gleam of sunlight fell upon his cold and passionless features  his silence had in its way a curious effect  he seemed neither to be thinking nor hesitating  he was just in a state of suspense  presently he leaned forward and knocked the ash from his cigarette into the grate  the lady in question he replied has found that place in the world to which her gifts and charm entitle her  i fear that my sister will be getting impatient  my daughter too i am sure would like to improve her acquaintance with you mr thain  david thain was in his way an obstinate and selfwilled man but he found himself for those first few moments subject to his hosts calm but effectual closure of the conversation  nevertheless he recovered himself in time to ask that other question as they left the room  the lady is alive then  she is alive the marquis acquiesced in a colourless tone  a servant threw open the door of the drawingroom  the marquis motioned to his guest to precede him  as i imagined he murmured i see that my sister is impatient  you will forgive me caroline he went on turning to the duchess  mr thains conversation was most interesting  letitia my dear do press mr thain to dine with us one evening  this afternoon i fear that i have been unduly loquacious  i should welcome another opportunity of conversing with him concerning his wonderful country  letitia picked up a little moroccobound volume from the table and consulted it  sir robert drew the prospective guest a little on one side  for heavens sake he whispered dont give the marquis any financial tips  he has a fancy that he is destined to restore the fortunes of the mandeleys on the stock exchange  he is a delightfully ornamental person but i can assure you that as a fatherinlaw he is a distinct luxury  david thain smiled grimly  i shall be careful he promised     chapter iv  the marquis devoted the remainder of that afternoon as he did most others to paying a call  very soon indeed after david thains departure he left the house stepped into the motorcar which was waiting for him and with a little nod to the chauffeur which indicated his indulgence in a customary enterprise drove off towards battersea  here he descended before a large block of flats overlooking the gardens stepped into the lift and without any direction to the porter was let out upon the sixth floor  he made his way along the corridor to a little mahogany front door on which was a brass plate inscribed with the name of miss marcia hannaway  he rang the bell and was at once admitted by a very trim parlourmaid who took his hat and cane and ushered him into a remarkably pleasant little sitting room  a woman seated before a typewriter held out two inkstained hands towards him with a little laugh  ive been putting a ribbon in she confessed  did you ever see such a mess  please make yourself comfortable while i go and wash  the marquis glanced with a slight frown at the machine and taking her wrists stooped down and kissed them lightly  my dear marcia he expostulated is this necessary  she shook her head with a droll smile  perhaps if it were she confessed i should hate to do it  theres a nineteenth century on the sofa  you can read my article  she hurried out of the room from which she was absent only a very few moments  the marquis with a finger between the pages of the review which he had been reading looked up as she reentered  she was a woman of nameless gifts of pleasant if not unduly slim figure  her forehead was perhaps a little low her eyes brilliant and intelligent her mouth large and exceedingly mobile  she was not above the allurements of dress for her house gown with its long tunic trimmed with light fur was of fashionable cut and becoming  her fingers cleansed now from the violet stains were shapely almost elegant  she threw herself into an easy chair opposite her visitor and reached out her hand for a cigarette  well she asked and how has the great trial ended  adversely the marquis confessed  you foolish person she sighed lighting the cigarette and throwing the match away  of course you were bound to lose and i suppose its cost you no end of money  i believe he admitted a little stiffly that my lawyers are somewhat depressed at the amount  she smoked in silence for a moment  so he will go back to mandeleys  it is a queer little fragment of life  what on earth does he want to do it for  obstinacy the marquis declaredsheer brutal ignorant obstinacy  and the boy she asked pursuing her own train of thought  have you heard anything of him  nothing  to tell you the truth i have made no enquiries  beyond the fact that it seems as though for the present richard vont will have his way i take no interest in either of them  she nodded thoughtfully  if only we others she sighed could infuse into our lives something of the marvellous persistence of these people whom in other respects we have left so far behind  my dear marcia he protested surely with your remarkable intelligence you can see that such persistence is merely a form of narrowmindedness  your father has shut in his life and driven it along one narrow groove  to you every day brings its fresh sensation its fresh object  hencecoupled of course with your natural giftsyour success  the person who thinks of but one thing in life must be indeed a dull dog  very excellent reasoning she admitted  still to come back to this little tragedyfor it is a tragedy isnt ithave you any idea what he means to do when he gets to mandeleys  none at all  let me see she went on it is nineteen years ago last september isnt itnineteen years out of the middle of his life  will he sit in the garden and brood i wonder or has he brought back with him some scheme of mediaeval revenge  there was a time the marquis reflected when several of my irish tenants used to shoot at me every saturday night from behind a hedge it was not in the least a dangerous operation and i presume it brought them some relief  with vont however things would be different  i remember him distinctly as a most wonderful shot  psychologically marcia hannaway observed his present action is interesting  if he had shot you or me in his first fit of passionate resentment everything would have been in order but to leave the country nurse a sullen feeling of revenge for years and then come back seems curious  what shall you do when you see him sitting in his garden  i shall address him the marquis replied  i fear that his long residence in such a country as america will have altered him considerably but it is of course possible that the instincts of his class remain  how feudal you are she laughed  the marquis frowned slightly  although this was the one person in the world whom he felt was necessary to him who held a distinct place in his very inaccessible heart there were times when he entertained a dim suspicion that she was making fun of him  at such times he was very angry indeed  in any case he said we will not waste our time in speculating upon this mans attitude  i am still hoping that i may be able to devise means to render his occupancy of the cottage impossible  i should like to hear about the boy  if the marquis promised i find vonts attitude respectful i will make enquiries  when are you going to mandeleys she asked  i am in no hurry to leave london he replied  when you go she told him i have made up my mind to take a little holiday  i thought even of going to the south of france  the lines of her companions forehead were slightly elevated  my dear marcia he protested gently is that like you  the class of people who frequent the riviera at this time of the year  she laughed at him delightfully  oh you foolish person she interrupted  if i go i shall go to a tiny little boarding house or take a villa in one of the quiet placessan raphael perhaps or one of those little forgotten spots between hyères and cannes  phillis grant would go with me  she isnt going to act again until the autumn season  her visitors expression was a little blank  in the case of your departure from london he announced in a very even but very forlorn tone i will instruct mr wadham to make a suitable addition to your allowance  at the same time marcia he added i shall miss you  his words were evidently a surprise to her  she threw away her cigarette and came and sat on the sofa by his side  do you know i believe you would she murmured resting her hand upon his  how queer  i have never concealed my affection for you have i he asked  this time the laugh which broke from her lips was scarcely natural  concealed your affection reginald she repeated  how strangely that sounds  but listen  you said something just now about my allowance  if i allude to it in return will you believe that it is entirely for your sake  of course  she rose from her chair and crossing the room rummaged about her desk for a moment produced a letter and brought it to him  the marquis adjusted his hornrimmed eyeglass and read   dear madam  we feel that some explanation is due to you with regard to the nonpayment for the last two quarters of your allowance from our client the marquis of mandeleys  we have to inform you that for some time past we have had no funds in our possession to pay this allowance we informed his lordship of the fact some time back but in our opinion his lordship scarcely took the circumstance seriously  we think it better therefore that you should communicate with him on the subject  faithfully yours   wadham son and dickson   the marquis deliberately folded up the letter placed his eyeglass in his pocket and sat looking into the fire  there was very little change in his face  only marcia to whom he had been the study of a lifetime knew that so far as suffering was possible to him he was suffering at that moment  you mustnt think it matters she said gently  you know my last novel was quite a wonderful success and for that article in the nineteenth you were looking at they gave me twenty guineas  i am really almost opulent  still i thought it was better for you to know this  the same thing might refer to other and more important matters and you know dear you are rather inclined to walk with your head in the air where money matters are concerned  you have been very considerate but foolishly so my dear marcia he declared  this matter must be put right at once  i fear that a younger element has obtruded itself into the firm of wadham an element which scarcely grasps the true position  i will see these people marcia  you are not to worry about it she begged softly  to tell you the truth  marcia was a brave woman and the moment had come up to which she had been leading for so long which for many months even years had been in her mind  and when it came she faltered  there was something in the superb immutable poise of the man who bent a little courteously towards her which checked the words upon her lips  it will be no trouble to me marcia to set this little affair right he assured her  i am only glad that your circumstances have been such that you have not been inconvenienced  at the same time is it entirely necessary for you to manipulate that hideous machine yourself he enquired inclining his head towards the typewriter  there are times she confessed when i find it better  of course i send a great deal of my work out to be typed but my correspondence grows and my friends find my handwriting illegible  i have never found it difficult he remarked  well youve had a good many years to get used to it she reminded him  his hand rested for a moment upon her shoulder  he drew her a little towards him  she suddenly laughed leaned over and kissed him on both cheeks and jumped up  the trim little parlourmaid was at the door with tea  yes she went on you have learned to read my handwriting and i have learned how you like your tea  just one or two more little things like that and life is made between two people isnt it  shall i tell you what i think the most singular thing in the world she went on pausing for a moment in her task  it is fidelity to purposeand to people too perhaps  in a way there is a quaint sort of distinction about it and from another point of view it is most horribly constraining  i interrupted you this afternoon i imagine he observed in the construction of some work of fiction  oh no she replied  what i write isnt fiction  thats why it sells  its truth you see under another garb  but there the fact remainsthat i shouldnt know how to make tea for another man in the world and you wouldnt be able to read the letters of any other woman who wrote as badly as i do  the fact he remarked seems to me to be a cause for mutual congratulation  she stooped down to place a dish of muffins on a heater near the fire graceful yet as a girl and as brisk  i cant imagine she declared why it is that my sex has acquired the reputation for fidelity  i am sure we crave for experience much more than men  the marquis helped himself to a muffin and considered the point  there were many times when marcias conversation troubled him  he was by no means an illread or unintellectual man only his studies of literature had been confined to its polished and classical side the side which deals so much with living and so little with life  are you preparing for a new work of fiction marcia he asked or are you developing a fresh standpoint  dear friend she declared lightly and yet with an undernote of earnestness how can i tell  i never know what i am going to do in the way of work  i wish i could say the same about life  now i am going to ask you a great favour  i have to attend a small meeting at my club at the other end of piccadilly at halfpast five  would you take me there  i shall be delighted he answered a little stiffly  she went presently to put on her outdoor clothes  the marquis was disappointed  he realised how much he had looked forward to that quiet twilight hour when somehow or other his vanity felt soothed and that queer weariness which came over him sometimes was banished  he escorted marcia to the car when she reappeared however without complaint  i see your name in the papers sometimes marcia he observed as he took his place by her side in connection with womens work  of course i do not interfere in any way with your energies  i should not in whatever direction they might chance to lead you  at the same time i must confess that i have noticed with considerable pleasure that you have never been publicly associated with this movement in favour of womans suffrage  she nodded  i should like a vote myself she admitted simply but when i think of the number of other women who would have to have it and who dont yet look at life seriously at all i think we are better as we are  is it my fancy she went on a little abruptly or are you really troubled about the return ofof richard vont  as usual marcia he said you show a somewhat extraordinary perception where i am concerned  i am as you know not subject to presentiments and i have no exact apprehension of what the word fear may mean  at the same time you are right  i do view the return of this man with a feeling which you as a novelist might be able to analyse but which i as a layman unused to fresh sentiments find puzzling  you remember what a famous frenchman wrote in his memoirs suddenly across one blank page of his journaltoday i feel that a great change is coming  she smiled reassuringly  personally she told him i believe that it is just the call of england to a man who lived very near the soilher heart  i think he wants the smell of spring flowers the stillness of an english autumn the winds of february in the woods he was brought up in  it is a form of heartsickness you know  i have felt it myself so often  it is scarcely possible that after all these years he is still nursing that bitter hatred of us both  the car had reached the great building in which marcias club was situated  the marquis handed her out  i trust that you are right he remarked  you will allow me to leave the car for you  she shook her head  there are so many women here with whom i want to talk she said  i may even stay and dine  and would you mind not coming until wednesday tomorrow i must work all day at an article which has to be typed and catch the wednesdays boat for america  exactly as you wish he assented  she waved her hand to him and ran lightly up the steps  the marquis threw himself back in his car and hesitated  the footman was waiting for an address and his august master was suddenly conscious that the skies were very grey that a slight rain was falling and that there was nowhere very much he wanted to go  the man waited with immovable face  tothe club     chapter v  messrs wadham son and dickson were not habited in luxury  theirs was one of those oldfashioned suites of offices in lincolns inn where the passages are of stone the doors of painted deal and a general air of bareness and discomfort prevails  the marquis who was a rare visitor followed the directions of a hand painted upon the wall and found himself in what was termed an enquiry office  a small boy tore himself away with apparent regret from the study of a pile of documents and turned a little wearily towards the caller  i desire the marquis announced to see mr wadham senior or to confer at once with any member of the firm who may be disengaged  the small boy was hugely impressed  he glanced at the long row of black boxes along the wall and a premonition of the truth began to dawn upon him  what name sir he enquired  the marquis of mandeleys  the office boy swung open a wicket gate and pointed to the hard remains of a horsehair stuffed easychair  the marquis eyed it curiouslyand remained standing  his messenger thereupon departed exhibiting a rare and unlegal haste  he returned breathless in fact from his mission closely followed by mr wadham junior  this is quite an honour your lordship the latter said hastily withdrawing his hand as he became aware of a certain rigidity in his visitors demeanour  my father is disengaged  let me show you the way to his room  i should be obliged the marquis assented  mr wadham senior was an excellent replica of his son a little fatter a little rosier and a little more verbose  he rose from behind his desk and bowed twice as his distinguished client entered  the marquis indicated to mr wadham junior the chair upon which he proposed to sit and waited while it was wheeled up to the side of the desk  then he withdrew his gloves in leisurely fashion and extended his hand to the older man who clasped it reverently  your lordship pays us a rare honour mr wadham senior observed  i should have preferred the marquis said with some emphasis that circumstances had not rendered my visit today necessary  the head of the firm nodded sympathetically  you will bear in mind he begged our advice concerning these recent actions  your advice was without doubt legally good his visitor replied but it scarcely took into account circumstances outside the legal point of view  however i am not here to discuss those actions which i understand are now finally disposed of  quite finally i fear your lordship  i find myself the marquis continued sternly in the painful position of having to prefer a complaint against your firm  i am very sorryvery sorry indeed mr wadham murmured  i discovered yesterday afternoon entirely by accident that the allowance which you have my instructions to make to miss hannaway has not been paid for the last two quarters  through no neglect of ours i assure your lordship mr wadham insisted gravely  you will remember that we wrote to you last october pointing out that the yield from the estates was insufficient without the help of the bank to meet the interest on the mortgages and that amongst other claims which we were obliged to leave over we should be unable to forward the usual cheque to the young lady in question  the marquis cleared his throat and tapped with his long forefingers upon the desk  it was a curious circumstance that although both mr wadham senior and junior had done more than their duty towards their distinguished client each had at that moment the feeling of a criminal  you are i believe perfectly well aware mr wadham the marquis declared that i never read your letters  mr wadham senior coughed  his son thrust both hands into his trousers pockets  the statement was unanswerable  i was therefore the marquis continued severely in complete ignorance of your failure to carry out my instructions  mr wadham junior less affected than his father by tradition and priding himself more upon that negligible gift of common sense interposed respectfully but firmly  we can scarcely be responsible he pointed out for your lordships indisposition to read letters containing business information of importance  the marquis changed his position slightly and looked at the speaker mr wadham junior became during the next few seconds profoundly impressed with the irrelevance almost the impertinence of his words  i should have imagined the former said severely that my habits are wellknown to the members of a firm whose connection with my family is almost historical  we should have waited upon your lordship mr wadham senior admitted  but with reference to the case of this young lady not hearing from your lordship we wrote to her very politely indicating the great difficulties which we had to face in the management of the mandeleys estates owing to the abnormal agricultural depression and we promised to send her a cheque as soon as such a step became possible  in reply we heard from hera most ladylike and reasonable letter it wasstating that owing to recent literary successes and to your lordships generosity through so many years she was only too glad of the opportunity to beg us to cease from forwarding the quarterly amount as hitherto  under those circumstances we have devoted such small sums of money as have come into our hands to more vital purposes  i suppose it did not occur to you the marquis observed that i am the person to decide what is or is not vital in the disposition of my own moneys  that is a fact which we should not presume to dispute the lawyer admitted but i should like to point out that on the next occasion when we had a little money in hand your household steward mr harrison was here in urgent need of a thousand pounds for the payment of domestic bills connected with the establishment in grosvenor square  it appears to me the marquis said with a trace of irritability in his tone that the greater part of my income goes in paying bills  the complaint was one which for the moment left mr wadham speechless he was vaguely conscious that an adequate reply existed but it eluded him  his son who had adopted the attitude of being outside the discussion was engaged in an abortive attempt to appear as much at ease in his own office as this client of theirs certainly was  i will discuss the matter of miss hannaways future allowance with that young lady and let you know the result the marquis announced in the meantime how do we stand for ready money  ready money your lordship his interlocutor gasped  precisely the marquis assented  it is i believe a few days after the period when my tenants usually pay their rents  your lordship mr wadham said speaking with every attempt at gravity if every one of your tenants paid their full rent and brought it into this office at the present moment we should still be unable to pay the interest on the mortgages due next month without further advances from the bank  these mortgages the marquis remarked thoughtfully are a nuisance  so selfevident a fact seemed to leave little room for comment or denial  the marquis frowned a little more severely and withdrew his forefingers from the desk  figures i fear only confuse me he confessed but for the sake of curiosity what do my quarterly rents amount to  between seven and eight thousand pounds according to deductions your lordship was the prompt reply  that sum i presume will be coming in from your agent mr merridrew within the course of a few days  the interest upon the mortgages amounts to perhaps a thousand pounds less than that sum  that thousand pounds i may be permitted to point out to your lordship is all that remains for the carrying on of your grosvenor square establishment and for such disbursements as are necessary at mandeleys  it is shameful the marquis declared severely that any one should be allowed to anticipate their income in this way  mortgages are most vicious institutions  mr wadham coughed  your lordships expenditure some ten or fifteen years ago rendered them first necessary  after that there was the unfortunate speculation in the tin mines  that will do mr wadham his client interrupted  all i desire to know from you further is a statement of the approximate sum required to clear off the mortgages upon the mandeleys estates  mr wadham senior looked a little startled  his son stopped whistling under his breath and leaned forward in his chair  clear off the mortgages he repeated  precisely  the exact figures was the somewhat hesitating pronouncement would require a quarter of an hours study but i should say that a sum of two hundred and twenty thousand pounds would be required  i have not a head for figures the marquis acknowledged gravely but the amount seems trifling  i shall wish you goodday now gentlemen two hundred and twenty thousand i think you said mr wadham  that is as near the amount as possible the lawyer admitted  the marquis drew on his gloves a sign that he did not intend to honour his adviser with any familiar form of farewell  he inclined his head slightly to mr wadham and more slightly still to mr wadham junior who was holding open the door  the small boy who was on the alert escorted him to the front steps and received with delight a gracious word of thanks for his attentions  so the marquis took his departure  mr wadham junior closed the door and threw himself into the chair which had been occupied by their distinguished client  there was a faint perfume of lavender water remaining in the atmosphere  his eyes wandered around the further rows of tin boxes which encumbered the wall  i suppose he murmured its a great thing to have a marquis for ones client  i suppose it is mr wadham senior assented gloomily  father do you ever feel at ease with him his son asked curiously do you ever feel as though you were talking to a real human being of the same flesh and blood as yourself  never for a single moment was the vigorous reply  if i felt like that john do you know what i should do  no  well then ill tell you  i should have those tin boxes taken out one by one and stacked in the hall  i should say to him as plainly as i am saying it to youwe lose money every year by your business marquis  weve had our turn  try some one elseand go to the devil  but you couldnt do it mr wadham junior observed disconsolately  i couldnt his father agreed with a note of subdued melancholy in his tone     chapter vi  lady margaret who chanced to be the first arrival on the night of the dinner party in david thains honour contemplated her sister admiringly  letitia was wearing a gown of ivory satin a form of attire which seemed always to bring with it almost startling reminiscences of her italian ancestry  so glad to find you alone letty she remarked as she sank into the most comfortable of the easy chairs  theres something ive been wanting to ask you for weeks  bob put it into my head again this afternoon  what is it dear letitia enquired  why dont you marry charlie grantham her sister demanded abruptly  there are so many reasons  first of all he hasnt really ever asked me  youre simply indolent lady margaret persisted  hed ask you in five minutes if youd let him  do you suppose bob would ever have thought of marrying me if i hadnt put the idea into his head  youre so much cleverer than i letitia sighed  not in the least was the prompt disclaimer  i really doubt whether i have your brains and i certainly havent your taste  the only thing that i have and always had is common sense common sense enough to see that girls in our position in life must marry and the sooner the better  why only our class of life  dont be silly  its perfectly obvious isnt it that the daughters of the middle classes are having the time of their lives  they are all earning money  amongst them it has become quite the vogue to take situations as secretaries or milliners or that sort of thing and it simply doesnt matter whether they marry or not  they get all the fun they want out of life  it sounds quite attractive letitia admitted  i think i shall take a course in typewriting and shorthand  you wont margaret rejoined  you know perfectly well that that is one of the things we can never do  youve got to marry first  then you can branch out in life in any direction you chooseart travel amours or millinery  you can help yourself with both hands  which have you chosen meg  oh i am an exception margaret confessed  you see bob is such fun and ive never got over the joke of marrying him  besides i havent any craving for things at all  i am not temperamental like you  wheres father  just back from the country  hell be here in time though  and whos dining  charlie for one letitia replied aunt caroline of course and uncle mrs honeywell and the american person  the party was got up on his account so i expect father wants to borrow money from him  he doesnt look an easy lender lady margaret remarked  theres no one proof against father letitia declared  he is too exquisitely and transparently dishonest  you know theres a mans story about the clubs that he once borrowed money from lewis at five per cent interest  margaret remained in a serious frame of mind  something will have to be done she sighed  robert went down and looked at the mortgages the other day  he says they are simply appalling there isnt an acre missed out  its quite on the cards you know letty that mandeleys may have to go  letitia made a little grimace  i am getting perfectly callous she confided  if it did this house would probably follow father would realise everything he could lay his hands upon and become the autocrat of some french watering place and i should cease to be the honest but impecunious daughter of a wicked nobleman and enjoy the liberty of the middleclass young women you were telling me about  it wouldnt be so bad  or marry margaret began  mr david thain the butler announced  the juxtaposition of words perhaps incited in letitia a greater interest as she turned away from her sister to welcome the first of her guests  he had to cross a considerable space of the drawingroom with its oldfashioned conglomeration of furniture untouched and unrenovated for the last two generations but he showed not the slightest sign of awkwardness or selfconsciousness in any form  he was slight and none too powerfully built but his body was singularly erect and he moved with the alert dignity of a man in perfect health and used to gymnastic training  his cleanshaven face disclosed nervous lines which his manner contradicted  his mouth was unexpectedly hard his deepset grey eyes steellike almost brilliant  these things made for a strength which had in it however nothing of the uncouth  the only singularity about his face and manner as he took his hostess fingers was the absence of any smile of greeting upon his lips  i am afraid that i am a little early he apologised  we are all the more grateful to you lady margaret assured him letitia and i always bore one another terribly  a married sister you know feels rather like the cuckoo returning to the discarded nest  one hates other peoples liberty so much letitia sighed  i should have thought liberty was a state very easy to acquire david thain observed didactically  that is because you come from a land where all the women are clever and the men tolerant letitia replied  where is that husband of yours margaret  i am ashamed to say her sister confessed that he stayed down in the morning room while gossett fetched him a glass of sherry  look at him now she added as sir robert entered the room unannounced and came smiling towards them  how can i have any faith in a husband like that  doesnt he look as though the only thing that could trouble him in life was that he hadnt been able to get here a few minutes earlier  given away eh the newcomer groaned as he kissed letitias fingers how are you mr thain  your country is entirely to blame for my habits  i got so into the habit of drinking cocktails while i was over there that i really prefer my aperitif to my wine at dinner  sir robert who had discovered within the last few days exactly where mr david thain stood amongst the list of american multimillionaires drew this very distinguished person a little on one side to ask about a railway  then the marquis made his appearance and immediately afterwards the remaining guests  david thain of whom many of the morning papers during the last few days had found something to say found himself almost insinuated into the position of favoured guest he took mrs honeywella dark and rather tiredlooking ladyin to dinner but he sat at letitias left hand and she gave him a good deal of her attention  you know everybody dont you mr thain she asked him soon after they had taken their places  except the gentleman on your right he answered  she leaned towards him confidentially  his name she whispered is lord charles grantham  he is the son of the duke of leicester who is between ourselves almost as wicked a duke as my father is a marquis  fortunately however his mother left him a fortune  do you notice how thoughtful he looks  david thain glanced across the table at the young man in question who was exchanging rather weary monosyllables with his righthand neighbour  he is perhaps overworked  letitia shook her head  not at all  he cannot make up his mind whether or not he wants to marry me  and can you make up your mind whether you wish to marry him  letitia lost for a moment her air of gentle banter  what a downright question she observed  however i cant tell you before i answer him can i and he hasnt asked me yet  i should think david thain said coolly that you would make an excellent match  their eyes met for a moment  there was a challenging light in hers to which he instantly responded  her very beautiful white teeth closed for a moment upon her lower lip  then she smiled upon him once more  it is so reassuring she murmured to be told things like that by people who are likely to know  charles talk to me at once she went on turning towards him  mr thain and i agree far too perfectly upon everything  thain was deep in conversation with his neighbour before lord charles was able to disentangle himself from the conversational artifices of the duchess  letitia took note of his aptness with a little malicious smile  it was towards the close of dinner when she once more turned towards him  have you been telling mrs honeywell how you made all your millions she asked  i have been trying to point out he replied that the first million is all one has to make  the rest comes  what a delightful country letitia observed  if i were to borrow from all my friends and collected a million do you think i could go out there and become a multimillionaire  women are not natural moneymakers he pronounced  what is her real sphere she asked sweetly  i should so much like to know your opinion of us  as yet he replied i have had no time to form one  what a pity she sighed  it would have been so instructive  in the small amenities of daily life he said thoughtfully in what one of our writers calls the insignificant arts women seem inevitably to excel  they always appear to do better in fact in the narrower circles  directly they step outside a certain lack of breadth becomes noticeable  dear me she murmured  its a good thing im not one of these modern ladies who stand on a tub in hyde park and thump the drum for votes  i should be saying quite disagreeable things to you mr thain shouldnt i  you couldnt be one of those if you tried he replied  you see if i may be permitted to say so nature has endowed you with rather a rare gift so far as your sex is concerned  dont be overdiffident she begged  i may know it maynt i  a sense of humour  when a man tells a woman that she has a sense of humour letitia declared it is a sure sign that he  she suddenly realised how intensely observant those steely grey eyes could be  she broke off in her sentence  they still held her however  that he what  such a bad habit of mine she confided frankly  i so often begin a sentence and have no idea how to finish it  ada she went on addressing mrs honeywell has mr thain taught you how to become a millionairess  i havent even tried to learn that lady replied  he has promised me a subscription to my cripples guild though  what extraordinary bad taste letitia remarked to cadge from him at dinner time  if your father werent within hearing mrs honeywell retorted id let you know what i think of you as a hostess  why are we all so frightened of your father letitia  look at him now  he is the most picturesque and kindly object you can imagine yet i find myself always choosing my phrases and slipping into a sort of previctorian english when i fancy that he is listening  i see him more from the family point of view i suppose letitia observed and yet in a way he is rather a wonderful person  for instance i have never seen him hurry i have never seen him angry in the ordinary sense of the word in fact he has the most amazing complacency i ever knew  of course aunt caroline she went on turning to the duchess a few moments later if you want to stay with the men pray do so  if not you might take into account the fact that i have been trying to catch your eye for the last three minutes  thain drew up nearer to his host after the women had withdrawn and found himself next sir robert who talked railways with eloquence and some understanding  lord charles was frankly bored and bestowed his whole attention upon the port  the marquis discussed a recent land bill with his brotherinlaw but in a very few moments gave the signal to rise  he attached himself at once to david thain  you play bridge he asked  never if i can avoid it was the frank reply  then you and i will entertain one another his host suggested  the marquiss idea of entertainment was to install his guest in a comfortable chair in a small den at the back of the house which he kept for his absolutely private use and to broach the subject which had led to davids welcome at grosvenor square  let me ask you he began have you seen anything more of this man vont  nothing  the marquis looked ruminatively at the cedar spill with which he had just lit his cigarette  i am almost certain he said that i saw him on the platform at raynhamthe nearest station to mandeleysyesterday  he seemed marvellously little altered  he has probably taken up his abode down there then david observed  the marquiss face darkened  he brushed the subject aside  there is a matter concerning which i wish to speak to you mr thain he said  you are one of the fortunate ones of the earth who have attained by your own efforts i believe an immense prosperity  david listened in silence watching the ash at the end of his cigar  your money my soninlaw sir robert tells me the marquis continued has been made in brilliant and sagacious speculation there have no doubt been others who have followed in your footsteps and in a humbler way have shared your success  david had developed a rare gift of silence  he smoked steadily and his expression was remarkably stolid  i find myself in need of a sum the marquis proceeded with the air of a man introducing a business proposition of two hundred and twenty thousand poundsthere or thereabouts  there was a momentary gleam of interest in davids eyes gone however almost as soon as it had appeared  for the first time he made a remark  over a million dollars eh  the marquis inclined his head  my position he continued naturally precludes me from making use of any of the ordinary methods by means of which men amass wealth  i have at various times however made small but not entirely unsuccessful speculationsupon the stock exchange  the position in which i now find myself demands something upon a larger scale  what capital david thain enquired can you handle  the marquis stroked his chin thoughtfully  he was aware of a pocketbook a shade fuller than usual of three overdrawn banking accounts and his recent interview with his lawyers  capital he repeated  ah  i suppose capital is necessary  in any gambling transaction you always have to take into account the possibility david reminded him that you might lose  precisely the marquis assented selecting another cigarette but that is not the class of speculation i am looking for  i am anxious to discover an enterprise either by means of my own insight into such matters which is not inconsiderable or the good offices of a friend in which the chances of loss do not exist  david was a little staggered  he contemplated his host curiously  such speculations he said at last are difficult to find  not to a man of your ability i am sure mr thain the marquis asserted  do i gather that you wish for my advice  the marquis inclined his head  that he intimated was my object  david smoked steadily and his host contemplated him with a certain artistic satisfaction  he had been something of a sculptor in his youth and he saw possibilities in the shape and pose of the great financier  the long and short of it is david said at last that you want to make a million dollars without any trouble and without any chance of loss  there are a good many others marquis  but they have not all the privilege was the graceful rejoinder of knowing personally a goliath of finance  you will pardon the allegory i take it from this mornings daily express  in my career david continued after a moments pause you would perhaps be surprised to hear that i have done very little speculating i have made great purchases of railways and land through which railways must run because i knew my job and because i had insight the time for that is past now  to make money rapidly one must as you yourself have already decided speculate  i can tell you of a speculation in which i have myself indulged but i do not for a moment pretend that it is a certainty  it was good enough for me to put in two million dollars and if what i believe happens my two millions will be forty millions  but there is no certainty  the marquis fidgeted in his chair  by what means he asked tentatively could i interest myself in this undertaking  by the purchase of shares was the prompt reply  the marquis considered the point  the matter of purchasing anything presented fundamental difficulties to him  tell me about these shares he invited  what is the nature of the undertaking  oil  the marquis grew a little more sanguine  there was an element of fantasy about oil shares  perhaps they could be bought on paper  large fortunes have been made in oil he said  personally i am a believer in oil  where are the wells  in arizona  an excellent locality the marquis continued approvingly  what is the present price of the shares  they are dollar shares david replied and their present price is par  you may find them quoted in some financial papers but as practically the entire holding is in my possession the market for them is limited  precisely the marquis murmured  to come to business mr thain are you disposed to part with any  david appeared to consider the matter  well i dont know he said ive made something like twenty million dollars out of my railways and i have about reached that point when speculations cease to attract  the marquis held on to the sides of his chair and struggled against the feeling almost of reverence which he feared might be reflected in his countenance  a very desirable sum of money mr thain he conceded  its enough for me david acknowledged  there are two million shares in the pluto oil company practically the whole of which stand in my name  if the calculations which the most experienced oil men in the states have worked out materialise those shares will be worth ten million dollars in four months time  let me see he went on two hundred and thirty thousand pounds is roughly speaking one million one hundred and fifty thousand dollars  you can have two hundred thousand of my shares if you like at a dollar  this is exceedingly kind of you the marquis declared  let me see he reflected two hundred thousand dollars would be  a matter of forty thousand pounds  i see the marquis ruminated  forty thousand pounds  you are not i am sure a business man his guest continued so you will pardon my reminding you that you can easily obtain an advance from your bankers upon the title deeds of property or a short mortgage would produce the amount  a mortgage the marquis repeated as though the idea were a new one to him  ah yes  i must confess though that i have the strongest possible objection to mortgages if they can in any way be dispensed with  i suppose that is how you large english landowners generally feel david remarked tolerantly  if you would prefer it i will take your note of hand for the amount of the shares payable say in three months time  the marquis upset the box of cigarettes which he was handling  he was not as a rule a clumsy person but he felt strongly the need of some extraneous incident  he stood on the hearthrug whilst the servant whom he summoned collected the cigarettes and replaced them in the box  as soon as the door was closed he turned to his guest  your offer mr thain he said is a most kindly one  it simplifies the whole matter exceedingly  you had better make the usual enquiries concerning the property the latter advised  i am afraid you will find it a little difficult over on this side to get exact information but if you have any friends who understand oil prospecting  the marquis held out his hand  it is not an occasion upon which a further opinion is necessary he declared  i approve of the locality of the property and the fact that you yourself are largely interested is sufficient for me  then any time you like to meet me at your lawyers david suggested ill hand over the shares and you can sign a note of hand for the amount  the marquis considered the matter for a moment thoughtfully  there was something about the idea of letting mr wadham see him sign a promissory note for forty thousand pounds which occurred to him as somewhat precarious  perhaps you have legal connections of your own here he ventured to tell you the truth i have been obliged to speak my mind in a very plain manner to my own solicitors  i consider that they mismanaged the vont case most shamefully  i would really prefer to keep away from them for a time  david nodded  i have a letter to some lawyers at my rooms he said  i will send you their address and we can make an appointment to meet at their office  the marquis assented gravely  he considered that the matter was now better dismissed from further discussion  i have no doubt he said that my sister would like to talk to you for a time  shall we join the ladies  david threw away his cigar and professed his readiness  they crossed the hall and entered the drawingroom  there was one table of bridge and letitia was seated with her sister on a divan near the window  the former sighed as she watched the entrance of the two men  do look at father meg she whispered  i am perfectly certain he has been borrowing money  margaret shrugged her shoulders  what if he has my dear she rejoined  these people can afford to pay for their entertainment  i think its rather clever of him  letitia groaned  you have such ignoble ideas meg she said reprovingly  now i know i shall have to make myself agreeable to mr thain and i either like him or dislike him immensely  i havent the least idea which  i shouldnt be surprised her sister whispered as thain approached if he didnt help you presently to make up your mind     chapter vii  marcia hannaway called upon her publisher during the course of the following day  she found the ready entrée of a privileged clientwith scarcely a moments delay she was ushered into the presence of james borden the person who for some years now had occupied the second place in her thoughts and life  anything happened marcia he enquired after their quiet but familiar greeting  you look as though you were bringing fate with you  she made herself comfortable in the easychair which he had drawn up to the fire  outside an unexpectedly cold wind made the sense of warmth doubly pleasant  she unfastened her simple furs and smiled at him a little dolefully  just this she replied handing him a letter  he spread it out adjusted his eyeglasses and read it deliberately   94 grosvenor square thursday  my dear marcia  i have made enquiries with reference to the nonpayment of your allowance for the last two quarters and now enclose cheque for the amount drawn by my agent in norfolk and payable to yourself  i think i can promise you that no further irregularities shall occur  i look forward to seeing you tomorrow afternoon and i must tell you of a financial operation i am now conducting which if successful may enable me to pay off the mortgages which render the norfolk estates so unremunerative  i trust that you are well dear  i have ordered carlton whites to send in a few flowers which i hope will arrive safely  yours   reginald   james borden read the letter carefully glanced at the small coronet at the top of the paper and folded it up  im sorry marcia he said simply  she made a little grimace  my dear man she confessed so am i  after all though i am not sure that the money makes all the difference  you see if he really were too pooror rather if his lawyers couldnt raise the money to send to mei fancy that i should feel just the same  the publisher turned his chair round towards the fire  he was a man of barely middle age although his black hair was besprinkled with grey and growing a little thin at the temples  his features were good but his face was a little thin and his clothes were scarcely as tidy or the appointments of his office so comfortable as his name and position in the publishing world might have warranted  marcia who had been looking at him while he read leaned forward and brushed the cigarette ash from his coat sleeve  such an untidy man she declared straightening his tie  i am not at all sure that you deserve to have lady clients calling upon you were you late last night  a little he confessed  that means about one or two i suppose she went on reprovingly  i dined at the club and stayed on he told her  there was nothing else to do except work and i was a little tired of that  any fresh stuff ininteresting stuff i mean  he shook his head  three more russian novels he replied all in french and want translating of course  the only one i have read is terribly grim and sordid  i dare say it would sell  i am going to read the other two before i decide anything  then perhaps youll help me  of course i will she promised  i do wish though james you wouldnt stay at the club so late  how many whiskies and sodas  i didnt count he confessed  she sighed  i know what that means  james why arent you a little more human you get heaps of invitations to nice houses  much better go out and make some women friends  you ought to marry you know  i am quite ready to when you will marry me he retorted  but my dear man i am bespoke she reminded him  you know that quite well  i couldnt possibly think of marrying anybody  what are you going to do with that money he demanded  i think i shall keep it she decided  not to do so would hurt him terribly  and keeping it hurts me damnably he muttered  she shook her head at him  weve had this over so often havent we  i cannot leave reginald as long as he wants me relies upon me as much as he does now  why not was the almost rough demand  he has had the best of your life  and he has given me a great deal of his she retorted  for nineteen years i have been his very dear friend  during all that time he has never broken a promise to me never told a falsehood never said a single word which could grate or hurt  if he has sometimes seemed a little aloof it is because he really believes himself to be a great person  he believes in himself immensely you know jamesin the privileges and sanctity of his descent  it seems so strange in this world where we others see other things  if i only dared i would write a novel about it  but you dont care for him any more  care for him she repeated  how could i ever stop caring for him he was my first lover and has been my only one  let me ask you a question james borden demanded suddenly  dont you ever feel any grudge against him  he took you away from a very respectable position in life  he ruined all sorts of possibilities he was fifteen or twenty years older than you were and he knew the world  you pleased him and he deliberately entrapped your affections be honest now  dont you sometimes hate him for it  never she answered without hesitation  i was as you say most respectably placeda teacher at a village schooland i might have married a young farmer or bailiffs son or with great luck a struggling young doctor and lived a remarkably rural life but as you have observed in great respectability  my dear james i should have hated it  i was i think nineteen years old when reginald in a most courtly fashion suggested that i should come to london with him and i have exactly the same feelings today about my acceptance of his proposal as i had then  you are a puzzle he declared  you wouldnt be of course only youre such asuch a good woman  of course i am james she laughed  i am good inasmuch as i am faithful to any tie i may make  i am kind or try to be to all my fellow creatures and i should hate to do a mean thing  the only difference between me and other women is that i prefer to choose what tie i should consider sacred  i claimed the liberty to do that and i exercised it  as to my right to do so i have never had the faintest possible shadow of hesitation  oh it all sounds all right when you talk about it he admitted but lets come to the crux of this thing now we are about it marcia  i am eating my heart out for you  i should have thought that one of the great privileges of your manner of life was your freedom to change if you desired to do so  change i meannothing to do with infidelity you may have the nicest feelings in the world towards your marquis but i dont believe you love him any more  i dont believe you care for him as much as you do for me  in one sense you are perfectly right she acknowledged  in another you are altogether wrong  and yet he continued almost roughly you have never allowed me to touch your fingers much more your lips  but my dear man she remonstrated you must know that those things are impossible  i would kiss you willingly if you were my friend and if you were content with that but you know it would only be hypocrisy if you pretended that you were  but listen she went on  i too sometimes think of these things  i will be very frank with you  i know that i have changed lately and i know that the change has something to do with you  reginald is sometimes a little restless about it  a time may come when he will provoke an explanation  when that time comes i want to answer him with a clear conscience  mr james borden brightened up considerably  thats the most encouraging thing ive heard you say for a long time he confessed  she smiled  there are all sorts of possibilities yet she said  now fetch a clothes brush and let me give you a good brushing and you can take me out to lunchthat is to say if you can find something decent to wear on your head she went on pointing to a somewhat disreputable looking hat which hung behind the door  i wont go out with you in that  that he replied cheerfully is easily arranged  i can change my clothes in five minutes if you prefer it  she shook her head  you look quite nice when youre properly brushed she assured him send upstairs for another hat and well go into the grill room at the savoy  i want a sole colbert and a cutlet and some of those little french peas with sugar  arent i greedy  delightfully he assented  if you only realised how much easier it is to take a woman out who knows what she wants  they lunched very well amidst a crowd of cosmopolitans and lingered over their coffee  their conversation had been of books and nothing but books but towards the end marcia once more spoke of herself  you see james she told him i have the feeling that if reginald really does succeed in freeing the estates from their mortgages he will have any quantity of new interests in life  he will probably be lordlieutenant of the county and open up the whole of mandeleys then his town life would of course be quite different  i shall feelcant you appreciate thatas though my task with him had come naturally and gracefully to an end  we have both fulfilled our obligations to one another  if he can give me his hand and let me gowell i should like it  she looked so very desirable as she smiled at him that borden almost groaned  she patted his hand and changed the conversation  very soon she continued i am going to undertake a painful duty  i am going down to mandeleys  not with him  she shook her head  my father is back in england she explained  he has come back from america and is living in the cottage of many lawsuits  i must go down and see him  has the boy returned too he enquired  i have heard nothing about him marcia replied  he was very delicate when he was young and i am not even sure whether he is alive my father probably doesnt want to see me in the least but i feel i ought to go  you wouldnt like me to motor you down i suppose borden suggested diffidently  the country is delightful just now and it would do us both good  i could get away for three days quite easily and i could bring some work with me to peg away at whilst you are being dutiful  i should love it she declared frankly and i dont see the least reason why we shouldnt go  you wont mind she went on after a seconds hesitation if i mention it to reginald  i am sure he wont object  james borden bit through the cigarette which he had just lit threw it away and started another  you must do whatever you think right he said  perhaps you will telephone  as soon as i know for certain she promised him     chapter viii  it was obvious that the marquis was pleased with himself when he was shown into marcias little sitting room later on that same afternoon he was wearing a grey tweed check suit a grey bowler hat and a bunch of hothouse violets in his buttonhole  his demeanour as he drew off his white chamois leather gloves and handed them with his coat and cane to the little parlourmaid was urbane almost benevolent  you look like the springtime marcia declared rising to her feet and here have i been cowering over the fire  the wind is cold her visitor admitted but i had a brisk walk along the embankment  along the embankment  i have been to one of those wonderful cosmopolitan hotels he told her as he bent down and kissed her where they have hundreds of bedrooms and every guest is a potential millionaire  business  business he assented  my lawyersi am very displeased bytheby with mr wadhamhaving been unable for many years to assist me in disposing of the mortgages upon mandeleys i am making efforts myself in that direction efforts which as i believe i told you show much promise of success  i am delighted to hear it she replied  from every point of view it would be so satisfactory for you to have the estates freed once more  you would be able to entertain properly wouldnt you and take up your rightful position in the county  the marquis seated himself in his favourite easychair  it is quite true he confessed that i have been unable for the last ten years to exercise that position in the county to which i am entitled  i must confess moreover that the small economies which have formed a necessary and galling part of my daily life have become almost unendurable  you received my cheque i hope  she nodded and laid it upon the table  it was dear of you reginald she said but do you know its astonishing how well i seemed to be able to get on without those last three payments  i am earning quite a great deal of money of my own you know and i do wish you would let me try and be independent  his grey eyes were fixed almost coldly upon her  independent  why  oh dont be foolish about it please she begged  for nineteen years i think it is now you have allowed me six hundred a year  do you realise what a great deal of money that is  now that i am beginning to earn so much for myself it is absurd for me to go on taking it  do i understand it to be your desire then marcia he asked to effect any change in our relations  she came over and sat on the arm of his chair  not unless you wish it dear she replied only the moneywell in a sense ive got used to having it all these years because it was necessary but now that it isnt necessary i cant help feeling that i should like to do without it  i earned nearly six hundred pounds you know last year by my stories  the marquis had half closed his eyes  he had become momentarily inattentive  somehow or other marcia realised that her words had brought him acute suffering  there were tears in her eyes as she took his hand  dont be silly about this reginald dear she pleaded  if it means so much to you to feeli mean if you look upon this money as really a tie between usgive me a little less thensay three hundred a year instead of six  her visitor was recovering his momentarily disturbed composure  you are still nothing but a child in money matters dear he said we will speak of this again before the end of the year but in the meantime if you have anything to spare invest it  it is always well for a woman to have something to fall back upon  tea was brought in and their conversation for a time became lighter in tone  presently however marcia became once more a little thoughtful  i have made up my mind she declared abruptly to go down to mandeleys to see my father  the marquis was silent for a moment  then he shrugged his shoulders  well why not if you really feel it to be your duty he conceded personally i think you will find that vont is unchanged  you will find him just as hard and narrow as when he disowned you  in that case marcia acknowledged i shall not trouble him very much but when i think of all these years abroadit was through me he left england you know reginaldi feel that i ought to do my best at any rate to make him see things differentlyto beg his forgiveness with my lips even if i feel no remorse in my heart  i have a most uncomfortable conviction she went on reflectively that i have grown completely out of his world but of course in all this time he too may have changed  i wonder what has become of my little cousin  vont came back alone i believe her visitor told her and he came back second class too  i heard of him curiously enough from an american gentleman who crossed on the same steamer and who happened to be a guest at my house the other night  marcia nodded  the boy left england too young she remarked to miss his country i suppose he has settled down in america for ever  i must say that i wish vont had stayed with him the marquis declared  yes go down and see him by all means marcia  i should rather like to hear from you what his state of mind is  i gather that he is obdurate as he resisted all my efforts to repossess myself of his cottage but it would be interesting to hear  should you mind she asked if i motored down there with my publishermr james borden  you have heard me speak of him  not in the least was the ready reply  has your friend connections in the locality  none marcia admitted  he would come simply for the sake of a day or twos holiday and to take me  he is one of your admirers perhaps  he has always been very kind to me  the marquis was momentarily pensive  you are a better judge than i marcia he observed but is such an expedition as you suggestusual  i know that things have changed very much since the days when i myself found adventures possible and interesting but have they really progressed so far as this  marcia considered the matter carefully  on the whole she decided i should say that our proposed expedition was unusual  on the other hand mr borden has no near relatives and i myself enjoy a certain amount of liberty  the marquis smiled at her  as much liberty as you choose  if i hesitated then for a moment it was for your own sake  i do not think that i have ever sought to curtail your pleasures or to interfere in your mode of living  you have been wonderful she admitted gratefully  perhaps for that very reason because my fetters have been of silk i have never realised but always considered them  do you know that you are the only man who has ever sat down in this flat as my guest during the whole sixteen years i have lived here  i should never have asked you he said but i am not in the least surprised to hear it  sometimes he went on drawing her towards him in a slight but affectionate embrace you have perhaps thought me a little cold a little staid and distant from you even in our happiest moments  i was brought up you must remember in the school which considers any exhibition of feeling as a deplorable lapse  the thing grows on one  yet marcia he added drawing her still closer and clasping her hand you have been my refuge in all these years  it is here with you that i have spent my happiest hours  you have been my consolation in many weary disappointments  i often wish that i could give you a different position than the one which you occupy  i should never be so contented in any other she assured him patting his hand  in all these years i have felt my mind grow  i have readheavens how i have read  i have felt so many of the old things fall away felt my feet growing stronger  you have given me just what i wanted reginald  to quote one of your own maxims we have only one life but it is for us to subdivide  we take up a handful of circumstances an emotion perhaps a passion and we live them out and when the flame is burnt we are restless for a little time and then we begin it all over again  that is how we learn learn to be wise by suffering and change  i am afraid the marquis sighed that i do not live up to my own principles  all my life i have detested change  there could be no other home for me but mandeleys no other clubs save those where i spend my spare time no other pursuits save those which i have cultivated from my youth no other dear friend marcia to whom one may turn in ones more human moments than you  marcia shrugged her shoulders  it is queer she admitted to hear such professions of fidelity from you  had i a different reputation he asked  well you see how i have outlived it  marcias silence natural enough at the time puzzled him a little afterwards puzzled him as he leaned back in his car on his way homewards puzzled him through the evening in the few minutes of reflection which he was able to spare from a large dinner party  borden he muttered to himself  i wonder what sort of a man he is  in his library where he lingered for a few moments before retiring to bed he took down a volume of whos who  bordens name rather to his surprise was there  the man it seemed was of decent family had done well at oxford both in scholarship and athletics  he was bornthe marquis counted his years  he was fortyone years oldnineteen years younger  he closed the book and sat down in his chair forgetting for once to mix for himself the whiskey and soda which lay ready to his hand  it seemed to him that there was a tragedy in that nineteen years  borden was of the age now that he himself had been when marcia had first listened to his very courtly and yet uncommonly definite lovemaking  he rose almost like a thief crossed the hall and opening softly the door of the drawingroom turned up the two lights before a great gilt mirror  he stood and regarded himself thoughtfully appraisingly critically  he was tall and very little bowed  his figure was still the figure of a young man and the court clothes which he was wearing became him  that he was handsome so far as regards his finely chiselled features his high forehead and his soft grey hair he granted himself  the world had given him few chances of forgetting it  but there was a little whiteness about his cheeks a slight dropping of the flesh under his eyes just something of that tired look which creeps along with the years a silent persistent ghost  the marquis switched off the lights and turned towards the door  he tiptoed his way across the hall and threw himself once more into his easychair  his eyes were fixed upon the opposite wall  he still saw that presentment of himself  and there was marcia barely in the prime of her life the figure of her girlhood developed yet not even now matronly her bright complexion her broad intellectual forehead with its masses of brown hair her humorous mouth her dark undimmed eyes still hungry for what life might have to give  those nineteen years remained a tragedy     chapter ix  david thain arrived at the end of his journey seated himself on the second stile from the road threw away his cigar and looked facts in the face  he who had run the gamut of the wall street fever who in his earlier days had relied almost upon chance for a meal who had stood the tests of huge successes as well as the anxieties of possible failures without visible emotionin such a fashion even that his closest friends could scarcely tell whether he were winning or losingfound himself now without any crisis before him and engaged in the most ordinary undertaking of a stroll from the station across a few fields suddenly the victim of sensations and weaknesses which defied analysis and mocked at restraint  it was the england of his boyhood this the sudden almost overpowering realisation of those dreams which had grown fainter and fainter during his many years of struggle in a very different atmosphere  birds were singing in the long grove which behind the high greystone wall fringed the road for miles  rooksreal english rookswere cawing above his head  a light evening breeze was bending the meadow grass of the field which his footpath had cloven and from the hedge by his side came the faint perfume of hawthorn blossom  before him was the park with its splendours of giant oaks with deer resting beneath the trees and in the distance the grey irregular outline of mandeleys abbey  he had played cricket when he was a boy in the very field through which he was passing  some time in that dim past he had stood with his uncle whilst he had issued with the beaters from that long strip of plantation watching with all a boys fervid admiration the careless ease with which the lord of mandeleys was bringing the pheasants down from the sky  he had skated on the lake there had watched at a respectful distance the antics of the ladies letitia and margaret anxious to escape from their retinue of servants and attendants  a queer little vision came before him at that moment of lady letitia hobbling towards him upon the ice with one skate unbuckled and a firm but gracious entreaty that the little boyhe was at least a head taller than shewould fasten it for her  strange little flashes of memory had come to him now and then in that new world where he had carved his way to success memories so indistinct that they brought with them no thrills scarcely even any longing  and now all his strength and hardness qualities so necessary to him throughout his strenuous life seemed to have passed away  he was a child again breathing in all these simple sights and perfumes his memory taking him even further back to the days when he sat in the meadow in the hot sun picking daisies and buttercups and watching for the fish that sometimes jumped from the stream  it was an entirely unexpected emotion this  when once more he strode along the footpath he felt a different man  he had lost his slight touch of assurance  he looked about him eagerly almost appealingly  he was ashamed to confess even to himself that he had the feeling of a wanderer who has come home  he crossed the last stile and was now in the park proper  several villagers were strolling about under the trees and they looked at this newcomer with his darkcoloured clothes and strangelyshaped hat with some surprise  nevertheless he held uninterruptedly on his way until he reached the broad drive which led to the abbey  he walked on the turf by the side of it over the bridge which crossed the stream through the inner iron gates beyond which the village people were not allowed to pass and so to the wellremembered spot  on his right was the housea strange uneven building at times ecclesiastical here and there domestic always ancient with its wings of cloisters running almost down to the moat which surrounded it  and just over the moat crossed by that light iron handbridge with its back against what he remembered as a plantation but which had now become a wood the little red brick cottage smothered all over with creepers its tiny garden ablaze with flowers its empty rows of dog kennels its deserted line of coops  david glanced for a moment at the drawn blinds of the abbey then he crossed the footbridge and the few yards of meadow lifted the latch of the gate and walking up the gravel path came to a sudden standstill  a man who was seated almost hidden by a great cluster of foxgloves rose to his feet  its you then lad he exclaimed holding out both his hands youre welcome  theres no one to the housethere wont be for a quarter of an hourso ill wring your hands once more  its a queer world this david  youre back with me here where i brought you up as a stripling and yons the abbey  sit you down boy  i am not the man i was since i came here  david thain dragged an oldfashioned kitchen chair from the porch and sat by his uncles side  richard vont although he was still younger than his sixtyfour years seemed to his nephew curiously changed during the last week  the hard resolute face was disturbed  the mouth kept so tight through the years had weakened a little  there was a vague almost pathetic agitation in the mans face  youll take no notice of me david his uncle went on  im honest with you  these few days have been like a great holy dream like something one reads of in the scriptures but never expects to see theres old mary wellsshes doing for me up there  just a word or two of surprise and a grip of the hand and no more  and theres the abbeycurse itnot a stone gone only the windows are blank  you see the weeds on the lawn david  do you mark the garden behind  they tell me theres but two gardeners there to do the work of twenty  and the drivelook at it as far as you can seemoss and weed  theyre coming down in the world these mandeleys david  even this last little lawsuit the lawyers told me has cost the marquis nineteen thousand pounds  god bless you for your wealth david  its money that counts in these days  david produced a pouch of tobacco from his pocket and handed it over to his uncle who filled a pipe eagerly  thats thoughtful of you david he declared  id forgotten to buy any and thats a fact for i cant stand the village yet  youre looking strangelike david  and i feel it was the quiet answer  uncle hasnt it made any difference to you this coming back  in what way the old man asked  well i dont know  i walked across those fields to the park and i seemed suddenly to feel more like a boy again and i felt that somehow i was letting go of things  do you know what i mean  letting go of things richard vont repeated suspiciously  no  well somehow or other david continued as he filled his own pipe and lit it i found myself looking back through the years and i wondered whether we hadnt both let one thing grow too big in our minds  life doesnt vary much here  things are very much as we left them and its all rather wonderful  i felt a little ashamed as i came up through the park of some of the things weve planned and sworn  didnt you feel a little like that uncle  can you sit here and think of the past and remember all that burden we carried and not feel inclined to let it slip or just a little of it slip from our shoulders  vont laid down his pipe  he rose to his feet  his fingers suddenly gripped his nephews shoulder  he turned him towards the house  listen david he said theres twilight an hour away yet but it will soon be here  the blackbirds are calling for it and the winds dropping  now you see  that was her room he added touching the window and theres the door out just the same  you see that tree there  i was crouching behind that with my gun ready loaded and there was murder in my hearti tell you that boy  i watched the abbey  i was supposed to be safe in fakenham town safe for a good two hours and i lay there and watched because i knew and no one came  and then i heard a whisper  i turned my head although i was most afeared and out of that doorthat door from marcias room davidi saw him come i saw her arms come out and draw him back and then i began to breathe hard but the trees were thick that wayid been looking for him coming from the abbeyand they stole out together arm in arm  i was so near them that they must have heard me groan for marcia started and then before i knew what was happening hethe marquis mindhad struck up my gun caught it by the barrel and sent it flying  my hand was on his throat but he was as strong as i was in those days and a mighty wrestler  its my shame boy after all these years to have to confess it but he got the better of me  i was crazy with anger and he had me down  and then he stood aside and bade me get up and my strength seemed all gone  he stood there looking at me contemptuously dont make a fool of yourself vont he said  your daughter and i understand one another and our concerns have nothing to do with you if you have anything to say to me come up to the abbey tomorrow youll find your gun in the thicket  he turned round and he kissed marcias fingers just like id seen them do in the distance at their fine parties up there and he strolled away  there was the gun in the thicket and he knew it and i knew it and i couldnt move and he went  and all i could hear was marcia crying and those birds singing behind and i just slipped away into the wood  uncle is it worth while bringing this all up again david interrupted  aye its worth while the old man insisted fiercely  its worth while for fear i should forget for the old place has its cling on me that next day i went to the abbey and i saw the marquis  he was quite cool sent the servants outhed no weapon nearand he talked a lot that i dont understand and never shall understand but it was about marcia and that she was his and was leaving with him for london that evening  i just asked him one question  its for shame then i asked  and he looked at me just as though i were some person whom he was trying to make understand who didnt quite speak the language and he saidyour daughter made her choice months ago vont  she will live the life she desires to live  i am sorry to take her away from you  think it over and try and feel sensible about it  it was then i felt a strange joy that ive never been able rightly to understand id just remembered that the cottage was mine and i had a sudden feeling that i wanted to sit at the end of the garden and watch the abbey and curse it curse it with a bible on my knee till its stones fell apart and the grass grew up from the walks and the damp grew out in blotches on the walls  and thats why ive come back after all these years  and youre just the same david asked curiously  you feel just the same about him  dont you my lad his uncle demanded  youre not telling me that youre climbing down  david took the old mans arm  on the contrary uncle he said my promised share of the work is done  i hold his promissory notes for forty thousand pounds due in three months  i have sold him some shares that arent worth forty thousand pence and wont be for many a year  ive cheated him if you like but when the three months comes you can make him a bankrupt if you will  ill give you the notes  richard vont drew himself up  he turned his face towards the abbey growing a little indistinct now in the falling twilight  its grand hearing was all he said  theres mary coming round with the supper boy  ill take the liberty of asking you to have a bite with me and a glass of ale but ill not forget that youre the great david thain the millionaire from america who took kindly notice of me on the steamer  come this way sir he went on throwing open the cottage door  its a queer little place but its a novelty for you american gentlemen  step right in sir  mrs wells he announced this is a gentleman who was kind to me upon the steamer and he promised that if ever he was this way hed drop in  hell take some supper with me  youll do your best for us  the old lady looked very hard at david thain and she dropped a curtsey  from america too she murmured  tis a wonderful country  aye ill do my best richard vont     chapter x  mr wadham junior a morning or so later rang the bell at number 94 grosvenor square and aired himself for a moment upon the broad doorstep filled with a comfortable sense that this time at least in his prospective interview he was destined to disturb the disconcerting equanimity of his distinguished client  he was duly admitted and ushered into the presence of the marquis who laid down the newspaper which he was reading nodded affably to his visitor and pointed to a chair  your request for an interview mr wadham the former said anticipated my own desire to see you  pray be seated  i am entirely at your service  mr wadham paused for a moment and decided to cross his legs  he was already struggling against that enervating sense of insignificance which his clients presence inevitably imposed upon him  we heard yesterday morning from mr merridrew he commenced  he made us a remittance which was four hundred pounds short of what we expected  his explanation was that your lordship had received that sum from him  quite right mr wadham the marquis assented affably  quite right i was in the neighbourhood and finding mr merridrew with a considerable sum of money in hand i took from him precisely the amount you have stated  your lordship has perhaps overlooked the fact mr wadham continued that we are that amount short of the interest on the fakenham mortgagenumber seven mortgage we usually call it  dear me the marquis observed  surely such a trifling sum does not disturb your calculations  you do not run my affairs on so narrow a margin as this i trust mr wadham  it isnt a question of a narrow margin your lordship mr wadham replied  there is as a rule no margin at all  we usually have to make the amount up by overdrawing or by advancing it ourselves  this time the firm wish me to point out that we are unable to do either  dear me  dear me the marquis ejaculated in a tone of some concern i had no idea mr wadham if you will forgive my saying so that your firm was in so impecunious a position  impecunious the lawyer murmured with his eyes fixed upon his client  i scarcely follow your lordship  did i not understand you to say the marquis continued that this trifle of four hundred pounds has upset your arrangements to such an extent that you are unable to make your customary payments on my behalf  will your lordship forgive my pointing out mr wadham explained that these payments are on your account and that it is no part of the business of solicitors to finance their clients without a special arrangement  we have our own more lucrative investments continually open to us and we are at the present moment several thousand pounds out of pocket on account of recent law expenses  the whole thing the marquis pronounced seems to me very trifling state in precise terms if you please mr wadham the object of your visit  to ask for your lordships instructions as to the payment of twelve hundred pounds interest due tomorrow mr wadham replied  we have eight hundred pounds in hand from mr merridrew  so far from having any other funds of your lordships at our disposal we are as i have pointed out your creditor for a somewhat considerable amount  the marquis was leaning back in his chair the tips of his long elegant fingers pressed gently together  it appears to me mr wadham he said quietly that your visit is in a sense an admonitory one  your firm resentsam i not rightthe fact that i have found it convenient to help myself to a portion of the revenue accruing from my estate  we should not presume for a moment to take up such an attitude the lawyer protested  on the other hand the four hundred pounds in question requires replacement by tomorrow  and you find the raising of that sum inconvenient eh mr wadham  the young man was distinctly ill at ease  his instructions were to be firm and dignified but by no means to offend to deliver a formal protest against this tampering with funds already dedicate but to do or say nothing which would give the marquis any excuse for reprisals against the firm  mr wadham began to wonder whether perhaps he was a person of small tact or whether these instructions were more than usually difficult to carry out  there is no sacrifice your lordship he said slowly which my firm would hesitate to make in your interests and the interests of the mandeleys estate  at the same time the unexpected necessity for finding these sums of money is i must confess at times a strain upon us  the marquis nodded sympathetically  he rose to his feet crossed the room towards his desk which he unlocked with a key attached to a gold chain and returned with a bundle of scrip in his hand  i have here mr wadham he announced scrip in a very famous oil company the face value of the shares being i believe a trifle over forty thousand pounds  i in fact paid that price for them at the beginning of the week  the young lawyer uncrossed his legs and swallowed hard  he was prepared for many shocks but this one seemed outside the region of all human probability  did i understand your lordship to say that you had paid forty thousand pounds for them he gasped  the marquis assented with an equable little nod  i was somewhat favoured in the matter he admitted as the value of the shares has i believe already considerably increased  the amount i actually paid for them was in round figures forty thousand and one hundred poundstransfer duty or something of that sort  i have little head for figures as you know mr wadham  you had better take thesenot for sale mind but for deposit at one of my banks  you will probably find that under the circumstances they will permit you to overdraw an additional five hundred pounds on my account without embarrassing your own finances  mr wadham junior took the bundle of scrip into his hand and glanced hastily through it  the pluto oil company of arizona he murmured reflectively  the name of the company is doubtless unknown to you the marquis observed indulgently they are in fact only just commencing operationsbut it is the opinion of my friend and financial adviser mr david thain that the forty thousand pounds worth of shares you have in your hand will be worth at least two hundred thousand before the end of the year  mr david thain the multimillionaire mr wadham faltered  the same  the lawyer gripped the bundle hard in one hand closed his eyes for a moment opened them again and struck out boldly  as your lordships adviser he said may i enquire as to the nature of the payment which you have made  forty thousand pounds is not a sum which either of the banks with whom your lordship has credit  the marquis waved his hand  my dear young friend he explained it was not necessary for me to resort to banks  mr thain suggested voluntarily that i should give him my note of hand for the amount  he quite understood that a man whose chief interest in the country is land does not keep such a sum as forty thousand pounds lying at his bankers  mr wadham groped for his hat  the shares shall be deposited and the interest of course paid he murmured  i am sorry to have troubled your lordship in the matter  not at all not at all the marquis replied genially  very pleased to see you at any time mr wadham on any subject connected with the estates  ah he added glancing at a card which a footman at that moment had brought in here is my friend mr david thain  you must meet him mr wadham  such men are rare in this country  they form most interesting adjuncts to our modern civilisation  show mr thain in thomas  david thain duly arrived  he shook hands with the marquis and was by him presented to mr wadham  mr wadham is my legal advisoror rather a junior representative of the firm who conduct my affairs the marquis explained  i have just handed him over my shares in the pluto oil company for safe keeping  very glad to know you mr thain the young lawyer observed reverently shaking hands  one reads a great deal of your financial exploits in the newspapers just now  i really cant see david replied that your press men are much better over here than in the states  in any case mr wadham you mustnt believe all you read  you will give my regards to your father and the other members of your firm the marquis concluded with the faintest possible indication of his head towards the door  i shall probably have some instructions of an interesting nature to give you before long with regard to the cancellation of at any rate the home estate mortgages  ah here is thomas  very much obliged for your attention mr wadham  the lawyer made his adieux in somewhat confused fashion and left the room with an ignominious sense of dismissal  the marquis glanced at the clock  i am a creature of habit mr thain he said  at twelve oclock i walk for an hour in the park  will you give me the honour of your company  anywhere you say david assented  there was just a little matter i wanted to mentionnothing important  precisely the marquis murmured ringing the bell  you will return to lunch of course  i shall take no denial  my daughter would be distressed to miss you  gossett he added as they moved out into the hall my coat and hat and tell lady letitia that mr thain will lunch with us  have you any idea gossett he added as he accepted his cane and gloves how to make cocktails  i have a book of recipes your lordship was the somewhat doubtful reply  see that cocktails are served before luncheon the marquis instructed  you see we are not altogether ignorant of the habits of your countrymen mr thain even if in some cases we may not ourselves have adopted them  a cocktail is i gather some form of alcoholic nourishment  thain indulged in what was for him a rare luxurya hearty laugh  he threw his head back showing all his white firm teeth and the little lines at the sides of his eyes wrinkled up with enjoyment  suddenly a voice on the stairs interposed  i must know the joke letitia declared  how do you do mr thain a laugh like yours makes one feel positively delirious with the desire to share it  father do tell me what it was  to tell you the truth my dear the marquis replied quite honestly i am a little ignorant as to the humorous application of a remark i have just made  it was your fathers definition of an american institution lady letitia david explained and i am afraid that its humour depended solely upon a certain environment which i was able to conjure up in my minda barroom at the waldorf say  another disappointment letitia sighed  mr thain is lunching with us dear her father announced  so glad letitia remarked nodding to thain  we shall meet again then  she passed out of the front door and david who was very observant noticing several things was silent for the first few moments after her departure  she appeared as she could scarcely fail to appear in his eyes charming even to the point of bewilderment  yet although the wind was cold she had only a small and very inadequate fur collar around her neck  her tailormade suit showed signs of constant brushings  there was a littlea very modest little patch upon her shoes and a very distinct darn upon her gloves  david frowned in puzzled fashion as he turned into the park  some of his boyish antipathies so carefully nursed by his uncle and fostered by the atmosphere in which they lived during his early days in america flashed into his memory only to be instantly discarded  he remembered the drawn blinds the weedy walks of mandeleys the hasty glimpse which he had had of silent empty rooms and uncarpeted ways in the higher storeys of the mansion in grosvenor square  i am not a person the marquis observed as they proceeded upon their promenade who needs a great deal of exercise but i am almost a slave to habit and for many years when in town it has been my custom to walk here for an hour to exchange greetings perhaps with a few acquaintances to call at my club for ten minutes and take a glass of dry sherry before luncheon  in the afternoons he went on i occasionally play a round of golf at ranelagh  are you an expert at the game mr thain  i have made blasphemous efforts david confessed but i certainly cannot call myself an expert  perhaps what is known as the american spirit has rather interfered with my efforts  you see we want to get things done too quickly  golf is a game eminently suited to the british temperament  you are doubtless right the marquis murmured  that loitering backward swing ehthe lazy indisposition to raise ones head  i follow you mr thain  your call this morning bytheby he went on you have some news perhaps of these pluto oils  david shook his head  i came to see you he announced upon a different matter     chapter xi  the marquis was occupied for several minutes in exchanging greetings with passing acquaintances  as soon as they were alone again he reverted to his companions observation  there was a matter i think you said mr thain which you wished to discuss with me  i was going to ask you about broomleys david replied  the marquis was puzzled  broomleys  are you referring by chance to my house of that name  i guess so  but my dear mr thain you surprise me the marquis declared  when did you hear of broomleys  i should have explained david continued that i spent this last weekend at cromer  there i visited an agent and told him that i would like to take a furnished house in the neighbourhood  i motored over at his suggestion to see broomleys and the tenant colonel laycey kindly showed me over  he is leaving within a few days i believe  dear me of course he is the marquis observed genially  i had quite forgotten the factquite forgotten it  the marquis saluted more acquaintances  he was glad of an opportunity for reflection  the fates were indeed smiling upon him  a gleam of anticipatory delight shone in his eyes as he thought of his next interview with mr wadham junior  on his desk at the present moment there lay a letter from the firm announcing colonel layceys departure and adding that they saw little hope of letting the house at all in its present condition  it would be a great pleasure to us mr thain the marquis continued pleasantly to have you for a neighbour  did the agent or colonel laycey bytheby say anything about the rent  nothing whatever david replied  the colonel pointed out to me various repairs which certainly seemed necessary but as i am a single man the rooms affected could very well be closed for a time  it was the garden i must confess which chiefly attracted me  broomleys has i fear been a little neglected the marquis sighed these stringent days with their campaign of taxation upon the landed proprietor have left me i regret to say a poor man  colonel laycey was not always considerate  his last letter i remember spoke of restorations which would have meant a couple of years rent  if i find any little thing wants doing urgently when i get there david promised carelessly i will have it seen to myself  if the rent you ask is not prohibitive it is exactly the place i should like to take for say a year at any rate  you are a man of modest tastes mr thain the marquis observed the fact that you are unmarried however of course renders an establishment an unnecessary burden  you will bear in mind so far as regards the rent of broomleys mr thain that the house is furnished  very uncomfortably but very attractively furnished from what i saw david assented  the marquis collected himself  colonel laycey had been asked three hundred a year and was paying two hundred a sum which somehow or other the marquis had always considered his own pocket money and which had never gone into the estate accounts  a little increase would certainly be pleasant  would five hundred a year seem too much mr thain he asked  i cannot for the moment remember what colonel laycey is paying but i know that it is something ridiculously inadequate  five hundred a year would be quite satisfactory david agreed  i will have the papers drawn up and sent to you at once the marquis promised  you will be able to enter into possession as soon as you like  you would like a yearly tenancy i presume  that would suit me quite well  you will be able also to resume your acquaintance with that singular old man whom you met upon the steamerrichard vont the marquis remarked with a slight grimace  i hear that he is in residence there  i have already done so david announced  the marquis raised his eyebrows  you have probably heard his story then from his own lips he observed carelessly  i am told that he sits out on the lawn of his cottage reading the bible and cursing mandeleys  it is a most annoying thing mr thain as i dare say you can understand to have your exgamekeeper entrenched as it were in front of your premises hurling curses across the moat at you  that class of person is so tenacious of ideas as well as of life  here comes my daughter letitia already well escorted i see  letitia with grantham by her side waved her hand without pausing from the other side of the broad pathway  david for a moment felt the chill of the east wind  grantham the marquis told his companion confidentially is one of lady letitias most constant admirers  my daughter as i dare say you have discovered mr thain is rather an unusual young woman  her predilections are almost antimatrimonial  still i must confess that an alliance with the granthams would give me much pleasure  i should in that case be enabled to give up my town house and be content with bachelor apartmentsa great saving in these hard times  naturally david murmured  often in the course of our very agreeable conversations the marquis went on i am inclined to ignore the fact of your most amazing opulence  my few friends i am sorry to say are in a different position  money in this country is very scarce mr thainvery scarce at least on this side of temple bar  david answered a little vaguely  his eyes were lifted above the heads of the scattered crowd of people through which they were passing  may i askif it is not an impertinence he saidis lady letitia engaged to lord charles grantham  the marquiss manner was perhaps a shade stiffer  mr thain was just given to understand that about the family matters of such a personage as the marquis of mandeleys there must always be a certain reticence  there is no formal engagement mr thain he replied  the fashion nowadays seems to preclude anything of the sort  ones daughter just brings a young man in and in place of the delightful betrothal of our younger days the date for the marriage is fixed upon the spot  luncheon at 94 grosvenor square notwithstanding the cocktails was an exceedingly simple meal a fact which the marquis himself seemed scarcely to notice  he kept his eye on his visitors plate however and passed the cutlets with an unnoticeable sigh of regret  charlie wouldnt come in to lunch father letitia announced  i think he was afraid you were going to ask him his intentions  the marquis glanced at the modicum of curry with which he was consoling himself  upon the whole my dear he said i am glad that he stayed away  he is a most agreeable person but not at his best at luncheon time bytheby do you know who our new neighbour is to be at broomleys  you havent let it she asked eagerly  this morning my dear her father replied bowing slightly towards their guest  mr thain has been spending the weekend at cromer was offered broomleys by the agent there and he and i fixed up the matter only a few minutes ago  how perfectly delightful letitia exclaimed  david glanced up quickly  he looked his hostess in the eyes  that is very kind of you lady letitia he said  she laughed at him  well i meant it she declared and i still mean it but not perhaps exactly in the way it sounded  of course it will be very pleasant to have you for a neighbour but to tell you the truthyou see although were poor we are honestour own sojourn at mandeleys rather depends on whether we let broomleys and colonel laycey although he has the most delightful daughter with whom you are sure to fall in love was a most troublesome tenant  he was always wanting things done wasnt he father  it is certainly a relief the marquis sighed watching with satisfaction the arrival of half a stilton cheese a present from his soninlaw a great relief to find a tenant like mr thain  i asked your agent david remarked a little diffidently about the shooting  the marquis touched his glass  serve port gossett he directedthe light wood port if we have any he added a little hastily to the obvious relief of his domestic the shooting eh mr thain  he sipped his wine and considered  first broomleys and then the shooting  the gods were very kind to him on this pleasant april morning  you havent preserved lately i understand his guest observed  not for some years the marquis acknowledged  i dont mind about that at all david went on  i am just american enough you know to find no pleasure in shooting tame birds  i shall have no parties and i shall not be ambitious about bags  i like to prowl about myself with a gun  his host nodded appreciatively  you shall have the refusal of the shooting he promised  at the moment i am not prepared to quote terms  my people of business can do that  have you no friends in england mr thain letitia asked a little abruptly  very few david replied  i do not make friends easily  i always thought americans were so sociable she remarked  a great many of your compatriots have settled down here you know  david considered the matter for a moment  you would smile i suppose he said if i were to tell you that there are more socalled sets in american society than in your own i am a very selfmade man indeed and i possess no womenkind to entertain for me  i am therefore dependent upon chance acquaintances  such friends as may make your sojourn in norfolk more agreeable mr thain the marquis promised genially you shall most certainly find mandeleys will always be open to you  david made no immediate response  his teeth had come together with a little click  he felt a strange repugnance to lifting the glass which the butler had just filled to his lips  a queer little vision of mandeleys and the cottage was there richard vont seated amongst those drooping rose bushes his face turned towards the abbey his eyes full of that strange expectant light  a sudden wave of selfdisgust almost broke through a composure which had so far resisted all assaults upon it  almost he felt that he must rise from his place tell this strange polished yet curiously childlike being the truththat he was being drawn into the nets of ruinthat he was entertaining an enemy unawares  you must really try that wine mr thain he heard his host say gently  i make no excuse for not offering you vintage port  at mandeleys i have at least the remnants of a cellar  you shall dine with us there mr thain and i will give you what my grandfather used to declare was 1838 vintage  david roused himself with an effort  he brushed aside the uncomfortable twinge of conscience which had suddenly depressed him and turning away from letitia looked his host in the eyes  you are very kind he said  i shall come with much pleasure     chapter xii  the duchess waved her sugar tongs imperiously and david who had hesitated upon the threshold of her drawingroom made his way towards her  there were a dozen people sitting around drinking tea and chatting in little groups  now dont look sulky please she begged as she gave him her left hand  this is not a tea party and it is quite true that i did ask you to come and have a chat with me alone but i couldnt keep these people away  theyll all go directly and if they dont i shall turn them out  letitia has promised me to take care of you and to see that no one bites  letitia here is the shy man she added therethrusting a cup of tea into his hand  take that help yourself to a muffin and go and hide behind the piano  letitia rose from her place by the side of an extremely loquacious politician to whose animated conversation she had paid no attention since davids entrance  you hear my aunts orders she said nodding  dont try to shake hands with that collection of things to carry  i am to pilot you into a corner and keep you quite safe until she is ready to take possession of you herself  david looked longingly at some french windows which led out on to a wide stone terrace  why not outside he suggested  its really quite warm today  why not indeed she assented  come along  they passed out together found two comfortable wicker chairs and a small table on which with a sigh of relief david deposited his burden  below them was a stretch of the park from which they themselves were screened by a row of tall trees  dont sit down she begged him  get me another of those small muffins first and a cup of tea  if any one suggests coming out here bolt the windows after you  david executed his task as speedily as possible  letitia watched him a little curiously as he returned  you arent really a bit shy you know she told him  i watched you through the window there  how clever you were not to see that tiresome mrs raymond  why should i see her he asked  she is a perfect stranger to me she came up to me at a party the other night and asked me as a great favour to dine at her house and to tell her how to invest some money so that she could double it  i know letitia assented with her mouth full of muffin  she does that to all the financiers and expects them to give her tips just because she has dark eyes and asks them to a têteàtête dinner  i expect we are all as bad though she went on rather gloomily even if we are not quite so blatant  what on earth have you been doing to father  he swaggers about as though he were already a millionaire  illustration i expect we are all as bad though she went on rather gloomily even if we are not quite so blatant  david smiled a little sadly as he looked out across the tree tops  your father has rather a sanguine temperament he said  well dont encourage him to speculate please letitia begged  we couldnt afford to lose a single penny  as it is she went on we are only able to come to mandeleys because youve taken that ramshackle old barn close by and paid twice as much as its worth  about the shooting too  i almost laughed aloud when you mentioned it  do you know mr thain that we havent reared a pheasant for years and that we dont even feed the wild ones  what about the partridges though he reminded her and the hares i talked to a farmer when i was down there the other day and he complained bitterly that there was only one verminkiller on the whole estate and that the place was swarming with rabbits  i rather enjoy rabbit shooting  oh well so long as you understand letitia replied with a little shrug of the shoulders take the shoot for goodness sake and pay dad as much as he chooses to ask for it  ive always noticed she went on reflectively one extraordinary thing about people who havent the faintest idea of business  they are always much cleverer than a real business man in asking ever so much more than a thing is worth  a person with a sense of proportion you see couldnt do it  one would imagine he complained that you were trying to keep me away from mandeleys  dont please imagine such a thing she begged earnestly  if there is anything i hate its londonor rather hate the way we have to live here  you are entirely our salvation  if you desert us now i shall be the most miserable person alive  only you see i know what father is and what you do you must do with your eyes open  he was silent for a moment  the echo of her words lingered in his ears  he moved a little uneasily in his place more uneasily still when he found that she was watching him intently  you are really a very mysterious person mr thain she declared with a note of curiosity in her tone  i hear that you decline to be interviewed and you wont even tell the newspapers whether this is your first visit to england or not  i dont see what business it is of the newspapers he rejoined  i am not a person of any possible interest to any one  i have done nothing except make a great deal of money  that too was purely a matter of good fortune and a little foresight  in america he went on one expects to meet with that personal curiosity  over here i must say that it surprises me  i suppose you are right she admitted but you see under the present conditions of living the possession of money does give such enormous power to any one  then you must remember that our press has become americanised lately  however i am not a journalist so will you answer me one question  certainly he replied  have you ever been in england before  once  long ago  a great many years ago  i dont really know why i am curious she went on thoughtfully but there was a time when i saw you firstdoesnt this sound hackneyed but its quite truewhen i fancied that id seen you before  it worried me for days  even now it sometimes perplexes me  he hated the lie which had risen so readily to his lips and choked it back  a dear lady a friend of the duchess made the same remark to me when we were introduced he said  she excused herself gracefully by saying that people were so much alike nowadays  i dont think that you are particularly like other people she observed studying him  would you like to hear what ada honeywell thinks about you  so long as it leaves me still able to hold up my head he murmured mrs honeywell struck me as being rather severe in her strictures  it was only of your appearance she was speaking letitia continued she said that she could see three things in your facea franciscan monk a head maïtre dhôtel at the most select of french restaurants and the modern decadent criminal as opposed to the charles peace type  i am much obliged im sure he remarked leaning back and laughing for once quite naturally  my type of criminal i presume is one who brings art to his aid in working out his nefarious schemes  precisely she murmured  like wainwright the poisoner or the borgias  but at any rate we agreed upon something  there is purpose in your face  you speak as though that were unusual  i suppose we all have a set course in life  she nodded  and a good deal depends upon the goal doesnt it  there was a briefto david an enigmatic pause  letitias questions had puzzled him  she might almost have suspected his identity  they both listened idly for a few moments to the music of a violin which some one was playing in the drawingroom  youve asked me a great many questions he said abruptly  what about you  what is your goal  my dear mr thain she replied how can you ask  i am an impecunious young woman of luxurious tastes  it is my purpose to entrap somebody with a comfortable income into marrying me  i have been at it for several seasons she went on a little dolefully but so far charles grantham is my only certainty and he wobbles sometimesespecially when he sees anything of sylvia laycey  sylvia laycey he repeated  is she the daughter of the present tenant of broomleys  letitia nodded  and a very charming girl too she declared  youll most certainly fall in love with her  everybody does when she comes up to stay with me  falling in love isnt one of my ordinary amusements he observed a little drily  superior person she mocked  the duchess suddenly appeared upon the balcony  look here she said theres been quite enough of this  mr thain came especially to see me  every one else has gone  i wonder if that might be considered a hint letitia observed glancing at the watch upon her wrist  all right aunt ill go  you wouldnt believe mr thain she added buttoning her gloves that ones relations are supposed to be a help to one in life  youre only wasting your time with mr thain dear her aunt replied equably  ive studied his character  we were eight days on that steamer you know and all the musical comedy young ladies in the world seemed to be on board and i can give you my word that mr thain is a womanhater  i am really more interested in him now than i have ever been before letitia declared laughing into his eyes  my great grievance with charlie grantham is that he cannot keep away from our hated rivals in the other world  however youll talk to me again wont you mr thain  david was conscious of a curious fit of reserve a sudden closing up of that easy intimacy into which they seemed to have drifted  i shall always be pleased he said stiffly  letitia kissed her aunt and departed  the duchess sank into her empty place  i am going to be a beast she began  have you been lending money to my brother  not a sixpence david assured her  the duchess was evidently staggered  you surprise mo she confessed  however so much the better  it wont interfere with what i have to say to you  i first took you to grosvenor square didnt i  you were so kind he admitted  now i come to think of it she reflected i remember thinking it strange at the time that though i couldnt induce you to go anywhere else or meet any one else you never hesitated about making reginalds acquaintance  he was your brother you see david reminded her  it didnt occur to me she replied drily that that was the reason however what i want to say to you is this in bald wordsdont lend him money  david looked once more across the tops of the trees  i gather that the marquis then is impecunious he said  reginald hasnt a shilling the duchess declared earnestly  let me just tell you how they live  letitia has two thousand a year and so has margaret from their mother  margarets husband who is a decent fellow wont touch her money and makes her an allowance so that nearly all her two thousand and all of letitias except the few hapence she spends on clothes go to keeping an establishment together  reginald has sold every scrap of land he could years ago mandeleys is the only estate he has left and there isnt a square yard of that that isnt mortgaged to the very fullest extent  its always a scramble between his poor devils of lawyers and himself whether theres a little margin to be got out of the rents after paying the interest  if there is it goes i believe towards satisfying the claims of a lady down at battersea  a lady down at battersea david replied  is itmay i askan old attachment  a very old one indeed the duchess replied and to tell you the truth its one of the most reputable things i know connected with reginald  he is inconstant in everything else he does and without being in any way wilfully dishonest he is absolutely unreliable  but this lady at batterseashe belonged to one of his tenants or somethingi forget the storyhas kept him within reasonable bounds for more years than i should like to say  what do you see over there mr thain she broke off suddenly following his steadfast gaze  david dropped his eyes from the clouds  his fingers relaxed their nervous clutch of the sides of his chair  nothing he answered  i am interested  please go on  reginald has stuck at nothing to get money the duchess continued he has been on the board of any company willing to pay him a few guineas for his name  i believe things have come to such a pitch in that direction that the most foolhardy investor throws the prospectus away if his name is on it  he has drained his relatives dry  and yet if you can reconcile all these things he is in his way the very soul of honour  now having told you this you can do as you please  if you lend him money youll probably never get it back  if youve any to chuck away i can show you a hundred deserving charities  reginald without money is really a harmless and extraordinarily amusing person reginald in search of money is the most dangerous person i know  that is what i wanted to tell you and if you like now you can run away  my hairdresser is waiting for me and he is just a little more independent than my chef  stop though theres one thing more  the duchess had rung a bell with her foot and a servant was waiting at the windows to show david out  the latter turned back  you are not making a fool of yourself with letitia are you  david was very white and cold for a moment  he looked his hostess in the face and as she expressed it afterwards froze her up  i am afraid that i do not understand you duchess he said  oh dont be silly she replied  remember that i am your oldest friend in this country and i say what i like to everybody  you avoid most women as you would the plaguemost women except letitia  ive warned you against the father  now i am warning you against the daughter  and then you can go and lose your heart to one and lend a million to the other if you want  letitia for all her apparent amiability is the proudest girl i ever knew  i hope you understand me  perfectly  letitia will marry for money all right her aunt continued  she understands that that is her duty and she will do it  but it will be some oneyou will forgive me mr thainwith kindred associations shall i say  letitia fortunately takes after her father  she has no temperament but a sense of family tradition which will give her all the backbone she needs  is there any other member of the family david began  dont be a silly boy the duchess interrupted because thats what you are really in this world and amongst our stupid class of people you are just as nice as can be though  run along and dont forget that you are coming to dine on friday  youll meet the chancellor of the exchequer and hes going to try and persuade you to settle down here for the sake of your income tax  another plunderer david groaned  i am beginning to feel rather like a lamb with an exceedingly long fleece  you would look better with your hair cut the duchess remarked as she waved her hand  try that place at the bottom of bond street  the duke always goes there  a mr saunders is his man  better ask for him  youll find him at the top end of the room     chapter xiii  there was just one drop of alloy in the perfect contentment with which the marquis contemplated his new prospects and that was contained in a telephone message from mr wadham junior which he received upon the afternoon of davids call upon the duchess  i must apologise for troubling your lordship mr wadham began  i know your objection to the telephone but in this instance it was quite impossible to send a message  i accept your apology and am listening the marquis declared graciously  be so good as to speak quite slowly and dont mumble  mr wadham junior cleared his throat before continuing  he was a little proud of his voice although its rise and fall was perhaps more satisfactory from the point of view of a chancery court than from one who expected to gather the sense of every syllable  i am ringing up your lordship he continued concerning the large batch of shares in the pluto oil company of arizona which you entrusted to us for safe keeping and for deposit with the bank against the advance required last monday  i can hear you perfectly the marquis acknowledged suavely  pray continue  your lordships bankers sent for me this morning mr wadham went on in connection with these shares  they thought it their duty to point out either through us or by communication with you direct that according to the advice of a most reliable broker their commercial value is practically nil  is what the marquis demanded  nilnixnot worth a cent mr wadham junior proclaimed emphatically  the marquis in that slang phraseology which he would have been the first to decry never turned a hair  he had not the least intention moreover of permitting his interlocutor at the other end of the telephone even a momentary sensation of triumph  you can present my compliments to the manager he said and tell him that the value of the shares in question does not concern either him or his brokers  in any case they could not possibly have any information concerning the company as it is only just registered and has not yet commenced operations  you understand me mr wadham  perfectly your lordship was the smooth reply  the fact remains however that the brokers do know something about the company and the persons interested in it and that knowledge i regret to say is most unfavourable  we felt it our duty therefore to pass on these facts  i am exceedingly obliged to you for your anxieties on my behalf the marquis declared  my legal interests are i am quite sure safe in your hands  my financial affairsmy outside financial affairs that is to sayi prefer to keep under my own control  i might remind you that these shares are supported and came into my hands in fact through the agency of mr david thain the great financier  there was a moments pause  i had not forgotten the fact mr wadham admitted diffidently and it certainly seems improbable that mr thain would introduce a risky investment to your lordship within a few weeks of his arrival in this country  at the same time we feel compelled of course to bring to your notice the brokers report  quite so the marquis acquiesced  kindly let the people concerned know that i am acting in this matter upon special information goodday mr wadham  my compliments to your father  so the conversation terminated but the marquis for the remainder of that day felt as though just the shadow of a cloud rested upon his happiness  twice he stared at the address of davids rooms which occupied a prominent place upon his study table but on both occasions he resisted the impulse to seek him out and obtain the reassurance he needed  he buried himself instead in a review  letitia came in to see him on the way back from her aunts tea party the marquis carefully made a note of his place and laid down his periodical  you found your aunt well i trust dear  oh she was all right letitia replied  she had an irritating lot of callers there though  her father nodded sympathetically  the extraordinary habit which people in our rank of life seem to have developed lately for making friends outside their own sphere is making society very difficult he declared  members of our own family are i am afraid amongst the transgressors  whom did you meet this afternoon  letitia mentioned a few names listlessly  and mr thain she concluded  her father betrayed his interest  mr thain was there eh  i understood that he was much averse to paying calls  he looked as though he had been roped in letitia observed and aunt was all over herself apologising to him for having other people there she wanted to consult him it seems about something or other and she turned him over to me until she was ready  and you the marquis enquired with questioning sympathy were perhaps bored  not bored exactlyrather irritated  i think i am like you in some respects father letitia went on smoothing out her gloves  i prefer to find my intimates within the circle of our own relatives and connections  a person like mr thain in some way disturbs me  that the marquis regretted is unfortunate as he is likely to be our neighbour at mandeleys  she shrugged her shoulders  oh it is of no consequence she replied  i shall never feel the slightest compunction in anything i might do or say to him  if he pays more for broomleys than it is worth he has the advantage of our countenance which i imagine to a person in his position makes the bargain equal  mr thain does not seem to me to be one of those men who would part with anything unless he got some return  money nowadays the marquis reflected pressing the tips of his fingers together is a marvellously revitalising influence  people whose social position is almost if not quite equal to our own have even taken it into the family through marriage  letitias very charming mouth twitched  her lips parted and she laughed softly  nothing amused her more than this extraordinary blindness of her father to actual factssuch for instance as the lees woollen mills  i do hope she remarked that you are not thinking of offering me up dad on the altar of the god of dollars  my dear child the marquis protested i can truthfully and proudly say that i am acquainted with no young woman of your position in connection with whom such a suggestion would be more sacrilegious  i have sometimes hoped he went on that matters were already on the eve of settlement in another direction  i dont know im sure letitia answered thoughtfully  i sometimes think that i have a great many more feelings dad than the sole remaining daughter of the right honourable reginald thursford marquis of mandeleys ought to possess  the fact is there are times when i cant stand charlie anywhere near me and as to discussing any subject of reasonable interest well he can only see anything from his own point of view and that is always wrong  you and he then the marquis observed appear to shareor rather to possess every essential for domestic happiness  the constant propinquity in which married people of the middle and lower classes are forced to live is no doubt responsible in many cases for the early termination of their domestic happiness  i always thought the middle classes were horribly virtuous letitia yawned  howeverthursday night dad  you are dining out arent you  thursday night the marquis repeated telling for the hundredth time with bland ease the falsehood which had almost ceased to have even the intention to deceive  yes i dine at my club tonight dear  she bent over and kissed his forehead  remember my dear he enjoined that i do not wish you to develop any feelings of positive dislike towards mr thain  such people have their uses in the world  we must not forget that  letitia laughed at him understandingly but she closed the door in silence     chapter xiv  marcia more especially perhaps during these later days felt her sense of humour gently excited every time she crossed the threshold of trewlys restaurant  the programme which followed was always the same the marquis rose from a cushioned seat in the small entrance lounge to greet her very distinguished looking in his plain dinner clothes his black stock vainly imitated by the younger generation his hornrimmed eyeglass his cambricfronted shirt with the black pearls which had been the gift of the regent to his greatgrandfather  the head waiter and generally the manager hovered in the background while their greetings were exchanged and marcias coat delivered to the care of an attendant  then they were shown with much ceremony to the same table which they had occupied on these weekly celebrations for many years it was in a corner of the room a corner which formed a slight recess and special flowers the gift of the management were invariably in evidence  the roseshaded lamp with its long silken hangings was arranged at precisely the right angle  the marquis asked his usual question and waved away the menu  what you choose to offer us monsieur herbrand he would say in his oldworld but perfect french  if madame has any fancy we will send you a message  so the meal commenced  trewlys was a restaurant with a past  in the days of the marquiss youth when such things were studied more carefully than now it was the one firstclass restaurant in london to which the gilded youth of the aristocracy and perhaps their sires might indulge in the indiscretion of entertaining a young lady from the italian chorus without fear of meeting staider relatives  the world of bohemian fashion had changed its laws since those days and trewlys had been left high and dry save for a small clientele who remembered its former glories and esteemed its cellar and cuisine  it belonged to the world which the marquis knew the world whose maxims he still recognised  after all these years he would still have thought himself committing a breach of social etiquette if he had invited marcia to lunch with him at the ritz or the carlton  they drank claret decanted with zealous care and served by a blackaproned cellarman who waited anxiously by until the marquis had gravely sipped his first glassful and approved  their dinner today was very much what it had been a dozen years agothe frenchfed chicken the artichokes and strawberries served with liqueurs remained whatever the season  and their conversations  marcia leaned back in her chair for a moment and again the corners of her lips twitched as she remembered  faithfully year after year she could trace those conversationsthe courtly oldfashioned criticism of the events of the week criticism from the one infallible standard the standard of the immutable whiggism upon which the constitution itself rested conversation with passing references to any new event in art and until lately the stage  tonight marcia found herself tracing the gradual birth of her stimulating rebellion  she remembered how years ago she had sat in that same seat and listened as one might listen to the words of a god  and then came the faint revolt the development of her intellect the necessity for giving tongue to those more expansive and more subtle views of life which became her heritage to do him justice the marquis encouraged her  he was as good a judge of wit and spirit as he was of claret  if marcia had expressed a single sentence awkwardly if her grammar had ever been at fault her taste to be questioned he would have relapsed into the stiffness of his ordinary manner and she would have felt herself tonguetied  but curious though it seemed to her when she looked back she was forced to realise that it was he who had always encouraged the birth of her new thoughts her new ideals her new outlook upon life her own drastic and sometimes unanswerable criticisms of that state of life in which he lived  she represented modernity seeking for expression in the culture of the moment  he remaining of the ancient world yet found himself rejuvenated mentally refreshed week by week preserved from that condition of obstinate ossification into which he would otherwise have fallen by this brilliant and unusual companionship  in all the many years of their intimacy he had felt no doubts concerning her  he was possessed of a selfconfidence wholly removed from conceit which had spared for him the knowledge of even a moments jealousy  in her company he had felt the coming and as he now realised the passing of middle age  it was only within these last few hours that certain formless apprehensions had presented themselves to him  you drink your wine slowly tonight she observed  i was just thinking how delicious it was  he touched the long forefinger of his left hand just a little swollen  a touch of gout he said come to remind me i suppose that however much we set our faces against it change does exist  you are the only person marcia who seems to defy it  she laughed at him but not with entire naturalness  he found himself studying her during the next few moments  just as he was a celebrated connoisseur of objets darts a valued visitor to christies although his purchases were small so he was in his way an excellent judge of the beautiful in living things  he realised as he studied her that marcia had only more fully developed the charm which had first attracted him  her figure was a little rounder but it had lost none of its perfections  her neck and throat were just as beautiful and the success of her work and her greater knowledge of life had brought with them an assured and dignified bearing  there was not a vestige of grey in her soft brown hair not a line in her face nor any sign of the dentists handiwork in her strong white teeth  onlywas it his fancy he wondered or was there something missing from the way she looked at hima half shy half baffled appeal for affection which had so often shone out upon him during these evenings a wholly personal wholly human note the unspoken message of a woman to her lover  he asked himself whether that had gone and if it had whether the companionship which remained sufficed  so the journey down to mandeleys has not materialised yet he asked  she shook her head  to tell you the truth she told him i rather shrank from it  i could not seem to bring it into perspectiveyou know what i mean  how am i to go to him  i dont suppose he has changed  he is still splendidly faithful to the ideas of his earlier days  i do not suppose he has moved a step out of his groove  he is looking at the same things in the same way  am i to go to him as a magdalen as a penitent  honestly reginald i couldnt play the part  their eyes met and they both smiled  it is very difficult he admitted to discuss or to hold in common a matter of importance with a person of another world  why do you go  because she replied he is after all my father because i know that the pain and rage which he felt when he left england are there today and i would like so much to make him see that they have all been wasted  i want him to realise that my life has been made not spoilt  i should find out indirectly if i were you how he is feeling the marquis advised  i rather agree with you that you will find him unchanged  his fierce opposition to my reasonable legal movements against him give one that impression  i shall probably be sorry i went she admitted but it seems to me that it is one of those things which must be done  let us talk of something else  tell me how you have spent the week  for one thing i have improved my acquaintance with the american david thain of whom i have already spoken to you he told her  and your great financial scheme  it promises well  of course if it is entirely successful it will be like starting life all over again  there is a certain amount of risk i suppose she asked a little anxiously  the marquis waved his hand  in this affair quite negligible he declared  it would make you very happy of course to free the estates she ruminated  the marquis for a moment revealed a side of himself which always made marcia feel almost maternal towards him  it would give me very great pleasure also he confessed to point out to my solicitorsto mr wadham junior especiallythat the task which they have left unaccomplished for some twentyfive years i have myself undertaken successfully  this mr thain must be rather interesting marcia said musingly could you describe him  it was at that precise moment that the marquis raised his head and discovered that david thain was being shown by an obsequious maître dhôtel to the table adjoining their own  in the case of almost any other of his acquaintances the marquiss course of action would have been entirely simple  david however complicated things  with the naïve courtesy of his american bringing up he no sooner recognised the marquis than he approached the table and offered his hand  good evening marquis he said  the marquis shook hands  some banalities passed between the two men then as though for the first time david was suddenly and vividly aware of marcias presence  some instinct told him who she was and for a moment he forgot himself  he looked at her steadily curiously striving to remember and marcia returned his gaze with a strange absorption which at first she failed to understand  this slim nervouslooking man with the earnest eyes and the slight stoop of the head was bringing back to her some memory  from the first stage of the struggle her common sense was worsted  she was looking back down the avenues of her memory  surely somewhere in that shadowland she had known some one with eyes like thesethere must be something to explain this queer sense of excitement  and then the marquis who had been deliberating spoke the words which brought her to herself  marcia let me present to you mr david thain of whom we were speaking a few minutes ago  mr thain this is miss marcia hannaway whose very clever novel you may have read  davids eyes were still eagerly fixed upon her face but the introduction had brought marcia back to the earth  there could be no connection between those halfformed memories and the american millionaire whose name was almost a household word  i am very pleased to meet you miss hannaway david said  i was just telling the marquis that i was surprised to find any one here whom i knew  i asked a friend to tell me of a restaurant near my rooms where i should meet no one and he sent me here  why such misanthropy she asked  it is my own bad manners he explained  i accepted an invitation for this evening and found at the last moment so much work that i was obliged to send an excuse  you carry your work about with you then  not always i hope he replied only i am just now clearing out a great many of my interests in america and that alone is sufficient to keep one busy  he passed on with a little bow and took his place at the table which the maître dhôtel had indicated  the marquis to whom his coming had been without any real significance continued his conversation with marcia until he found to his surprise that she was giving him less than her whole attention  what do you think of our hero of finance he enquired a little coldly  he seems very much as you described him marcia answered  to tell you the truth his sudden appearance just as we were talking about him rather took my breath away  it was a coincidence without doubt the marquis acknowledged  her eyes wandered towards the man who had given his brief order for dinner and whose whole attention now seemed absorbed by the newspaper which he was reading  it is mr thain is it not who introduced to you this wonderful speculation she asked a little abruptly  that is so the marquis admitted  i have always myself however been favourably disposed towards oil  marcia suddenly withdrew her glance laughed softly to herself and sipped her wine  i was indulging in a ridiculous train of thought she confessed mr thain looks very clever even if he is not exactly ones idea of an american financier  i expect the poor man does get hunted about  a millionaire especially from foreign parts has become a sort of monte cristo nowadays  the subject of david thain dropped  the marquis as their coffee was brought began to wonder dimly whether it was possible that the thread of their conversation was a little more difficult to hold together than in the past whether that bridge between their interests and daily life became a little more difficult to traverse as the years passed  he fell into a momentary fit of silence  marcia leaned towards him  reginald she said do you know there was something i wanted to ask you this evening  shall i ask it now  if you will dear  she paused for a moment  the matter had seemed so easy and reasonable when she had revolved it in her mind yet at this moment of broaching it she realised not for the first time how different he was from other men how difficult a nameless something about his environment made certain discussions  nevertheless she commenced her task  reginald she began do you realise that during the whole of my life i have never dined alone with any other man but you  nor i since you came with any other woman he rejoined calmly you have some proposition to make  she was surprised to find that he had penetrated her thoughts  dont you think perhaps she continued that we are a little too selfenclosing  thanks to you as i always remember dear the world has grown a larger place for me year by year  at first i really tried to avoid friendships  i was perfectly satisfied  i did not need them but my work somehow has made things different  it has brought me amongst a class of people who look upon freedom of intercourse between the sexes as a part of their everyday life  i found a grey hair in my head only the night before last and do you know how it came  just by refusing invitations from perfectly harmless people  i have never placed any restrictions upon your life her companion reminded her  i know it she admitted but you see the principal things between us have always been unspoken  i knew just how you felt about it  what i want to know is now that the times have changed around you as well as around me whether you would feel just the same if i to take an example were to lunch or dine with mr borden now and then or with morris hyde the explorer  i met him at an authors club conversazione and he was immensely interesting  it struck me then that perhaps i was interpreting your wishes a little too literally  the marquis selected a cigarette from his battered gold case with its tiny coronet tapped it upon the table and lit it  marcia was already smoking  i fear that i am very oldfashioned in my notions marcia he confessed  i should find it very difficult to adapt myself to the perfectly harmless i am sure lack of restraint which as you say has opened the doors to a much closer friendship between men and women the place which you have held in my life has grown rather than lessened with the years  it is only natural however that the opposite should be the case with you  i should like to consider what you have said marcia  you have meant so much to me she continued you have been so much in our earlier days too especially during that year when we travelled you were such a wonderful mentor  it was your fine taste reginald which enabled me to make the best of those months in florence and rome  you knew the best and you showed it to me  you never tried to understand why it was the best but you never made a mistake  those things are matters of inheritance he replied and cultivation  it was a great joy to me marcia to give you the keys  yes she repeated that is what you did reginaldyou gave me the keys and i opened the doors  and now he went on you have pushed your way further much further into the world where men and women think than i could or should care to follow you  is it likely to separate us  she saw him suddenly through a little mist of tears  no she exclaimed it must not  it shall not  nevertheless he persisted the thought is in your mind  i cannot alter my life marcia  i live to a certain extent by tradition and by habits which have become too strong to break  there is a great difference in our years and in our outlook upon life  there is much before you flowers which you may pick and heights which you may climb which can have no message for me  nothing marcia declared fervently shall disturb ourour friendship  that does not rest with you dear but rather with fate he replied you might control your actions and i know that you would but your will your desires your temperament may still lead you in opposite directions  i have been your lover too long to slip easily into the place of your guardian  hold out your hand if you will now and bid me farewell  try the other things and if they fail you send for me  i shall do nothing of the sort she objected  we are both of us much too serious  the only question we are considering is whether you would object to my dining with mr borden and lunching with mr hyde  it would give you an opportunity he remarked with a rather grim smile of seeing the inside of some other restaurant  how understanding you are she exclaimed  do you know although i love our dinners here i sometimes feel as though this room were a little cage a little corner of the world across the threshold of which you had drawn a chalk line so that no one of your world or mine might enter  the coming of mr thain was almost like an earthquake  with every moment it seemed to him that he understood her a little more and with every moment the pain of it all increased  my dear marcia he said you have spoken the word  more than once lately i have fancied that i noticed indications of this desire on your part  i am glad therefore that you have spoken  dine with your publisher by all means and lunch with mr hyde  take to yourself that greater measure of liberty which it is only too natural that you should covet  we will look upon it as a brief vacation which certainly after all these years you have earned  when you have made up your mind write to me  i shall await your letter with interest  but you mean that you are not coming down to see me before then she asked a little tremulously  i think it would be better not he decided  i have kept you to myself very stringently marcia  you see i recognise this and i set you free for a time  he paid the bill and they left the room together  you are coming home she whispered as they passed down the vestibule  he shook his head  not tonight if you will excuse me marcia he said  the car is here  i will take a cab myself  there is a meeting of the committee at my club  they were on the pavement  she gripped his hand  do come she begged  he handed her in with a smile  you will go down to battersea james he told the chauffeur and fetch me afterwards from the club  a queer feeling caught at her heart as the car glided off and left him standing there bareheaded  it was the first timeshe felt something like the snap of a chain in her heartthe first time in all these years  yet she never for a moment deceived herself  the tears which stood in her eyes the pain in her heart were for him     chapter xv  the duchess a few mornings later leaned back in her car and watched the perilous progress of her footman dodging in and out of the traffic in the widest part of piccadilly  he returned presently in safety escorting the object of his quest  the duchess pointed to the seat by her side  can i take you or drop you anywhere she asked  please dont look as though you had been taken into custody  i saw you in the distance walking aimlessly along and i really wanted to talk to you  david for a moment indulged in the remains of what was almost a boyish resentment  i have to go to the savoy he explained and i was rather intending to walk across st jamess park  you can walk after your lunch she insisted  if you walk before it gives you too much of an appetiteafterwards it helps your digestion so get in with me and i will drive you to the savoy  he took his place by her side with a distinct air of resignation  the duchess laughed at him  you are a very silly person to dislike other people so she admonished  if you begin to give way to misanthropy at your time of life you will be a withered up old stick whom no one will want to be decent to except to get money out of before youre fifty  dont you know that the society of human beings is good for you  there isnt a medicine in the world one cant take too much of david ventured smiling in spite of himself  to the savoy john his mistress directed  tell miles to drive slowly  to abandon abstruse discussions she continued leaning back have you regarded my warning  which one he demanded  i mean with reference to my brother  i happen to have come across him once or twice during the last few days  on wednesday he was in the most buoyant spiritsfor him  he had the air of a man who has accomplished some great feat  if you only knew how amusing reginald is at such times  his manner isnt in the least different but you know perfectly well that he is thinking himself one of the most brilliant creatures ever born  there is a note of the finest and most delicate condescension in the way he speaks  i am perfectly certain that if he had happened to come across the chancellor of the exchequer on wednesday he would have discussed finance with him in a patronising fashion and probably offered him a few hints as to how to reduce the national debt  on wednesday this was david murmured  and on friday the duchess continued he was a different man  he carried himself exactly as usual but his footsteps were falling like lead  he looked over the eyes of every one and there was that queer grey look in his face which helps one to remember that notwithstanding his figure he is nearly sixty years old  what have you been doing to him mr thain  nothing that would account for his latter state david assured her  when did you see him last she asked  on thursday  where  david hesitated  at trewlys restaurant  he was lunching or dining with some one  dining  the duchess nodded  of course  with a lady wasnt it  is this a fair crossexamination david protested  my dear mr thain dont be absurd his companion admonished  every one in london and out of it has known of my brothers friendship with marcia hannaway for years  as a matter of fact we all approve of it immensely  the young woman although she must be getting on now is a very clever writer and i think that the influence she has exercised upon reginald throughout his life has been an excellent one  so that was thursday night eh  david assented  he was looking out of the window of the car as though interested in the passing throngs  i will tell you something the duchess continued  you have heard i dare say of the lawsuits down at mandeleys and of that keepers cottage within a hundred yards from the lawn and of the old man vont who has come back just as bitter as ever  that girl is his daughter  the marquis seems to have displayed the most extraordinary fidelity david remarked  my dear mr thain was the emphatic reply they have been the making of one anothers lives  it is the sort of thing one reads more of in french memoirs than meets with in actual life but i can assure you that reginald would be absolutely miserable without her and shewell see what she has become through his influence and companionship  yet they tell me that that old man has come back to his ridiculous cottage and sits there in the front garden reading the bible and blasting the very gooseberry bushes with his curses against reginald  most uncomfortable it will be i should think when you all get down there  nothing that you have said alters the fact david reminded her that vonts daughter has been all her life and is today in an invidious situation with regard to your brother  the duchesss eyebrows were slightly raised  and why not she asked in genuine surprise  of course i dont claim to be so absolutely feudal in my ideas as reginald but i still cannot find the slightest disadvantage which has accrued to the young woman from her position  i have been brought up myself in a different school david said quietly in the school richard vont was brought up in  i see no difference fundamentally between a marquis and a gamekeeper and to me the womenkind of the gamekeeper should be as sacred to the marquis as the womenkind of the marquis to the gamekeeper  the duchess laughed goodhumouredly  i have always insisted she declared that america is the most backward country in the world  so many of you come to europe now though that one would have thought you would have attained to a more correct perspective of life  but you are certainly much more amusing as you are  no be quiet please she went on  i didnt call for you to enter into general discussions  i just wanted to know about reginald  of course you have discovered already that i am ridiculously fond of him and i am trying to find out what is depressing him so much  do you know what i am most afraid of  i have no idea david confessed  the workings of your mind seem to lead you to such unexpected conclusions  dont be peevish she replied  what i am really more afraid of than anything is that marcia hannaway will leave him  why  the duchess shrugged her shoulders  she is twenty years younger than reginald and she has made for herself an entirely new place in life  that is the wonderful goal a woman reaches who has brains and is enabled to put them to some practical use  she has a circle of friends and admirers and sympathisers already made  now reginald is a dear but his outlook upon life is almost whimsical and i have always wondered whether he would be able to hold a woman like this to the end  the only thing is she concluded ruminatively that the affair has been going on for so long and is so well known that it would be positively indecent of her to break it off  dont you think so mr thain  david looked at the duchess and shook his head  honestly he admitted i cant give an opinion  i thought i understood something of human nature before i came into touch with you and those few members of your aristocracy whom i have met through you but frankly to use a homely metaphor you take the wind out of my sails  i dont know where i am when you lay down the law  there is something wrong between us fundamentally  i was brought up the same way vont was brought up  things were right or wrong moral or immoral you people seem to have made laws of your own  its time some one revised the old ones his companion laughed however i can see that you can be no help to me about reginald and here we are at the savoy  bytheby ive never seen you except with men  have you no women friends  are none of those charming little musical comedy ladies i see through the windows there expecting you as their host  they look very attractive david admitted smiling back at his companion but i am in reality lunching alone  i came here because i know my stockbroker lunches every day in the grillroom and i want to see him  how pathetic she sighed  i really believe that i have a duty in connection with you  at any rate he promised as he held out his hand there is a man here who will serve us some american lobster which is very nearly the real thing  dont make me feel too gluttonous she begged as she stepped out i really am not in the habit of inviting myself to luncheon like this but the fact of it is  she hesitated  he passed behind her into the little vestibule  well  well i rather like you mr david thain she whispered  you wont be vain about it will you but all the financiers i have ever met have been so extraordinarily full of their money and how they made it  you are different arent you  i am content if you find me so he answered with rare gallantry  david ordered a thoroughly american luncheon of which his guest heartily approved  if you americans she observed only knew how to live as well as you know how to eat what a nation you would be  we fancy that we have some ideas that way also he told her wherein do we fail most from your english point of view  in matters of sex the duchess replied coolly  you know so much more about lobster newburg than you do about women  i suppose it is all this strenuous moneygetting that is responsible for your ignorance  no one over here you see tries for anything very much  you certainly all live in a more enervating atmosphere david admitted  tell me about your younger days she demanded  there is nothing to tell in the least interesting he assured her my people were poor  i was sent to harvard with great difficulty by a relative who kept a boot store  i became a clerk in a railway office took a fancy to the work and planned out some schemeswhich came off  how much money have you in plain english she asked  about four millions he answered  and what are you going to do with it  buy an estate for one thing he replied  fortunately i am very fond of shooting and riding so i suppose i shall amuse myself  are those your only resources she enquired with a faint smile  i may marry  come this gets more interesting  any lady in your mind yet  none whatever he assured her with almost exaggerated firmness  youd better give yourself a few years first and then let me choose for you she suggested  i know just the typeunless you change  and why should i change  because she said eying him penetratively there is at present something bottled up in you  i do not know what it is and if i asked you wouldnt tell me but youre not quite your natural self whatever that may be  is it i wonder the result of that twenty years struggle of yours  perhaps you have really lost the capacity for generous life mr thain  you are a very observant person  trust me then and tell me your secret sorrow she suggested  i could be a very good friend mr thain if friends amuse you  i have lived under a shadow he confessed  i am sorry but i cannot tell you much about it  but in a sense you are right  life for me will begin after the accomplishment of a certain purpose  you have a rival to ruin eh  no it isnt that he assured her  it happens to be something of which i could not give you even the smallest hint  well i dont see how you are going to get on with it down at broomleys she observed  what a horrid person you are to go there at all  you might as well bury yourself  you have the wealth of a monte cristo and you take a furnished villafor thats all it is  perhaps you are waiting till the mortgages fall in to buy mandeleys  or did my warning come too late and is letitia the attraction  he was conscious of her close observation but he gave no sign  i have seen nothing of lady letitia he said but even if she were content to accept my four millions as a compensation for my other disadvantages it would make no difference  any entanglements on the other side she asked airily  none  the duchess finished her lobster and leaned back in her chair  through her tiny platinum lorgnette she looked around the room for several moments  then a little abruptly she turned again to him  really she said people are doing such mad things nowadays that i am not at all sure that i am right in putting you off letitia  it would be frightfully useful to have four millions in the family  and yet do you know she went on its queer isnt it but i dont want you to marry my niece  why not  how crude she sighed  i really shall have to take a lot of trouble with you mr david thain  however if you persistbecause letitia is my niece  and you dont like me well enough he asked to accept me as a husband for your niece  she laughed at him very quietly  are you very ingenuous she demanded or just a little subtle hadnt it occurred to you for instance that i might prefer to keep you to myself  you must forgive me if i seem stupid he begged or unresponsive  i dont wish to be either  i can understand that in america i might be a person of some interest  over herewell the whole thing is different isnt it  apart from my money i know and realise how ignorant i am of your ways of the things to do here and how to do them  i feel utterly at a disadvantage with every one unless they happen to want my money  you are too modest mr thain she declared leaning a little towards him and dropping her voice  i will tell you one reason why you interest me  it is because i am quite certain that there is something in your life some purpose or some secret which you have not confided to any living person in this country  i want to know what it is  it isnt exactly vulgar inquisitiveness believe me  i am perfectly certain that there is something more of you than you show to people generally  david was conscious of an odd sense of relief  after all the woman was only curiousand it was most improbable that her curiosity would lead her in the right direction  you are very discerning duchess he said  unfortunately i have no confidence to offer you  the one secret in my life is some one elses and not my own  and you never betray a confidence she asked looking at him steadfastly  you could be trusted  i hope so he assured her  their lunch passed on to its final stages  the duchess smoked a russian cigarette with her coffee and it seemed to him that imperceptibly she had moved a little nearer to him  her elbows were upon the table and her hands clasped  she seemed for a moment to study one or two quaint rings upon her fingers  a few more questions and i shall feel that we know one another she said  just why have you left america and this wonderful pursuit of wealth  because there were no more railways in which i was interested he answered nor any particular speculation or enterprise that appealed to me  i have more money than i can ever spend and i know very well that if i remained in america i should have no peace  i should be a target for years for every man who has land to sell near railways or shares to sell or an invention to perfect  as soon as i decided to wind up i decided also that it was necessary for me to clear right away  apart from that england and english life attracts me  and this purpose she enquired  this secretwhich is somebody elses secret  such as it is he replied it belongs to this country  how old are you she asked suddenly  i am thirtyseven he told her  she sighed  her slightly tired blue eyes seemed to be looking through the little cloud of cigarette smoke to the confines of the room  a magnificent age for a man she murmured but a little ghastly for a woman  i was thirtynine last birthday  never mind one has the present  so here are you in the prime of life with an immense fortune and no responsibilities  if disraeli had been alive he would have written a novel about you  there is so much which you could do so much in which you could fail  will you become just a man about town here make friends partly in bohemia and partly amongst some of us endow a theatre and marry the first chorus girl who is too clever for you  or  i am more interested in the or he declared rashly  she turned her eyes slightly without moving her head and knocked the ash from her cigarette into her plate  let us go she said a little abruptly  i am tired of talking here if you really wish to know you can accept the invitation which i shall send you presently and come to scotland     chapter xvi  letitia and her escort pulled up their horses at the top of rotten row letitia was a little out of breath but her colour was delightful and the slight disarrangement of her tightly coiled brown hair most becoming  it was dear of you charlie to think of lending me a hack she declared  i havent enjoyed a gallop so much for ages  when we get down to mandeleys i am going to raid baileys stables  he always has some young horses  want schooling a bit before theyre fit to ride grantham observed  if i had been born in another walk of life letitia said i am sure horsebreaking would have been my profession  you havent been in to see us for ages charles  you werent particularly gracious the last time i did come he reminded her gloomily  dont be silly she laughed  you must have come on an irritating afternoon  i get into such a terrible tangle sometimes with my housekeeping accounts up here  you know how impossible dad is with money matters and he leaves everything to me  the young man cleared his throat  i think youve borne the burdens of the family long enough he remarked  i wish youd try mine  you do choose the most original forms of proposal letitia acknowledged frankly  as a matter of fact i have had enough of keeping accounts  i have almost made up my mind that when i do marry if i ever do i will marry some one enormously wealthy who can afford to let me have a secretarysteward as well as a housekeeper  youve been thinking of that fellow thain he muttered  oh no i havent she replied  mr thain is a very pleasant person but i can assure you that i have never considered him matrimonially  i suppose i ought to have done she went on but you know i am just a little oldfashioned  i cant see whats the matter with me the young man said disconsolately  ive a bit of my own a screw from my job and the governor allows me a trifle  we might work it up to ten thousand a year  we ought to be able to make a start on that  it is positive wealth letitia acknowledged but i am sure you dont want me really and i havent the least inclination to get married and heaven knows what would happen to dad if i let him go back to bachelor apartments  hed take care of himself all right letitias suitor observed confidently  would he she replied  i am not at all sure  our menkind always seem to have gone on sowing their wild oats most vigorously after middle age  of course if ada honeywell would marry him i might feel a little easier in my mind  ada wont marry any one grantham declared and i am perfectly certain if she were willing your father wouldnt marry her  shes too boisterous  poor woman letitia sighed  shes immensely rich but you see she has no pasti mean no pedigree  i am afraid its out of the question  i wish you would chuck rotting and marry me letitia he begged theres a little house in pont streetsuit us down to the ground  letitia found herself gazing over the tops of the more distant trees  we are going down to mandeleys in a few days she said presently ill take myself seriously to task there  i suppose i must really want to be married only i dont know it  dont be surprised if you get a telegram from me any day  id come down there myself if i had an invitation he suggested  she shook her head  charlie she declared it couldnt be done  so far as i can see at present unless some of the tenantry offer their services for nothingand our tenantry arent like thatwe shall have to keep house with about half a dozen servants which means of course only opening a few rooms  as a matter of fact we shant be able to go at all unless mr thain pays his rent for broomleys in advance  they turned out of the park and not a word passed between them again until letitia descended from her horse in grosvenor square  you were a dear to think of this charles she said standing on the steps and smiling at him  i havent enjoyed anything so much for a long time  you wouldnt care about a theatre this evening he proposed  come in at tea time and see how i am feeling she suggested  i have dad rather on my hands  he has been wandering about like a lost sheep the last few afternoons  i cant think what is wrong  she strolled across the hall and looked in at the study  the marquis was seated in an easychair reading a volume of memoirs  she crossed the room towards him  father she exclaimed you ought to have been out a beautiful morning like this  the marquis laid down his book  he was certainly looking a little tired  letitia came up to his side and patted his hand  hows the gout she asked  better he replied examining the offending finger  youre just lazy i believe letitia observed reprovingly  the sooner we get down to mandeleys the better  the marquis glanced at a silverframed calendar which stood upon the table  he had glanced at it about a hundred times during the last few days  a little country air he confessed will be very agreeable  i think perhaps too he went on that i am inclined to be weary of london it is more of a city after all isnt it for the bourgeois rich than for a penniless marquis  where did you get your mount from dear  charlie lent me a hack she replied  ive had a perfectly delightful ride  you have not yet arrived i suppose her father went on at any fixed matrimonial intentions with regard to charlie  she shook her head a little dejectedly  its so hard she confessed  i am dying to say yes especially somehow during the last few days but somehow i cant  i think it must be his fault she added resentfully  he doesnt ask me properly  youll find some one will be taking him off your hands before long her father warned her  personally i have no objection to find with the alliance  of course letitia complained its very clear what you are thinking of  you want your bachelor apartments in the albany again and the gay life  i really feel that it is my duty to remain a spinster and look after you  the marquis smiled  once more his eyes glanced towards the calendar  better ask charlie down to mandeleys and settle it with him there he suggested  thats just what he wants she sighed  if we begin a house party there though think what a picnic it will be  and besides sylvia laycey is sure to be somewhere about and hell probably fall in love with her again  i do wish i could make up my mind  what are you doing tonight dad  i am dining with montavon her father replied at the club  he has a party of four for whist  dear old things letitia murmured affectionately  i hope you have sheffield plate candlesticks on the table  why not go in fancy dressone of those georgian court dresses you knowblack velvet knickerbockers a sword and peruke  much better let me give you a lesson at auction bridge  the marquis shivered  you play the game he asked politely  i tried it as a means of subsistence letitia confessed but my partners always did such amazing things that i found there was nothing in it  if you are really dining out dad i shall go to the play with charlie  alone  dont be silly dear letitia protested flicking her whip remember what that wicked old lady wrote in her memoirsbalham requires a chaperon but grosvenor square never  i shall try and get used to him this evening  i may even have wonderful news for you in the morning  the marquis took up his book again  i wish my dear that i could believe it he told her fervently     chapter xvii  i feel like the german lady marcia observed as she stood before her little sideboard and mixed a whisky and soda who went on cutting bread and butter  the world falls to pieces before my eyesand i press the handle of a syphon  there  she carried the tumbler to borden who was seated by her fireside and threw herself into an easychair opposite to him  i know its all wrong she declared  my instincts are so obstinate even about the simplest things  you see i have even wheeled away his easychair so that you shant sit in it  women always confuse instincts with prejudices borden rejoined calmly sipping his whisky and soda  may i smoke a pipe  marcia gave a little gesture of despair  i never knew a man she exclaimed who exhibited such a propensity for making himself at home  tell me she went on did you notice a very aristocratic looking almost beautiful girl with large brown eyes and a pale skin seated in the stalls just below our box  the girl with charles grantham  marcia nodded  that was lady letitia thursford she told him  is she engaged to grantham  she wasnt last week marcia replied  i think the marquis would like it but lady letitia is by way of being difficult  i saw her looking at me thoughtfully once or twice  i was dying to send down word to her that i had permission  borden moved in his chair a little uneasily  you are bound to no one he reminded her  there is no one of whom you need to ask permission  dont be silly marcia replied  i asked permission and without it i wouldnt have dined with you alone tonight or lunched with morris hyde on tuesday  i trust that both entertainments he ventured have been a success  marcia shook her head  morris hyde was very disappointing she confessed  i was looking forward to being tremendously entertained but instead of telling me all about these unknown tribes in central america his only anxiety seemed to be to know if i was going to let him kiss me in the taxi afterwards  explorers i am afraid are far too promiscuous  publishers borden said firmly are renowned throughout the world for their fidelity  fidelity to their cash boxes marcia scoffed  borden who had lit his pipe blinked at her through a little cloud of smoke  they had come straight from the theatre and he was in the evening clothes of a man who cares nothing about his appearancethe black waistcoat the nonetoowell fitting shirt the plainest of studs and the indifferently arranged white tie  nevertheless marcia liked the look of him seated at ease in her low chair and it was very obvious that he too approved of his hostess  she was curled up now at the end of the sofa a cigarette in her mouth an expression of curious perplexity upon her face  she was dressed very plainly in black having alternately tried on and discarded all her more elaborate evening gowns  she had had a queer almost desperate fancy to make herself look as unattractive as possible but the very simplicity of her dress enhanced the gleaming perfection of her throat and arms even her posture which should have been ungraceful suited her  her disturbed and doubtful frame of mind had softened her firm mouth and lit with a sort of sweet plaintiveness her beautiful eyes  do you think he asked that i look upon you as a promising investment  well i am marcia replied  you admit having made money out of me this spring  at any rate i am willing to divide it he suggested  upon conditions  no one in the world gives something for nothing he reminded her  we seem to be mixing up business and the other things most shockingly marcia declared  do you really mean that you are willing to share the profits of my next novel with me  i couldnt do that he objected it would be too unbusinesslike  i am quite willing however to share my life and all i have with you  mere rhetoric marcia exclaimed uneasily  solemn earnest he insisted  will you marry me marcia  she looked across at him  her eyebrows were a little raised her eyes inclined to be misty her mouth tremulous  james she replied i believe id like to  im not quite surei believe i would  but just tell mehow can i  he has kept you to himself for pretty well twenty years borden said gruffly  she sighed  when i was a child of seventeen she confided a young farmer down at mandeleys kissed me  if i had been one year younger she went on i should have spat at him  as it was i never spoke to him again then a few months after that the schoolmaster at the school where i was teaching made an awkward attempt at the same thing  he missed me but his lips just touched my cheek  then reginald came  let me see that was nineteen years ago and since then no one else has kissed me  a record of fidelity borden observed at which even in your own stories you would scoff  but then you see she reminded him i never write about a person with queer ideas like mine because they wouldnt be interesting people like a little more resilience about their heroines  couldnt we talk brutal common sense for once he asked impatiently i have never abused your marquis  from your own showing he has played the game as you have  all i want to say is that the natural time has come for your separation  i have waited for you a good many years and i am a domestic man  i want a homeand children  its quite time you wanted the same  perhaps for a moment the light in her eyes was a shade softer  she moved uneasily in her place  quite primitive arent you james she murmured  lifes a primitive thing when we get down to the bone he answered you and i have wasted many an hour discussing the ologies trying to thrust ourselves into the peculiar point of view of these neurotic norwegians or mad russians  when you come down to bedrock though for sober decent people there is only one outlet to passion only one elementary satisfaction for man and woman  you make things sound very simple  it isnt that he persisted  its you who make them complex by being maudlin about this man  he has had what many would call the best part of your life  he has given up nothing for your sake done nothing for your sake  he has kept you in the same seclusion that his grandfather would have done  he has treated you so far as regards the outside world as a man does  he stopped abruptly  something in her eyes warned him  there are limits she told him drily to my appreciation of unbridled speech  according to his lights reginald has been wonderful  to me there has been more romance than ignominy in many of his ideas  my trouble is something different  i cant quite make up my mind what it would mean for him if i were to strike out for myself now  you are like all women he declared furiously  you complicate every situation in life by thinking of other people  think for yourself marcia  what about your own future  i promise you that your marquis would think for himself if he were up against a similar problem  he is getting all he wants  are you  of course you arent  does anybody get all they want out of life  it is generally their own fault if they dont get the main things he insisted  but see here ill attack you with your own weapons  here am i fortyone years old in love with you since i was thirtytwo what about those nine years  i am dropping into the ways of untidy unsatisfactory bachelordom  i only order new clothes when some friend chaffs me into it and if i do i forget the ties and shirts and those sorts of things  ive lost all interest in myself  i loaf at the club play auction bridge when i might be doing something a great deal better and drink a whisky and soda when any one asks me  i hang on to the business but when ive finished my work i drift  in another five years time i shall begin to stoop i shall live with cigar ash all over my clothes and i shall have to be taken home from the club every other night  your doing marciayour responsibility  i should think she said severely that your selfrespect  oh dont bother about my selfrespect he interrupted  i am a human being and i tell you marcia that every man needs something in his life to lift him just a little to live up to not down to  there is only one person in the world can take that place for me  im a clear charge upon your hands  you know that i love you that youve driven all thoughts of other women out of my head that you keep me beating against the walls of my impotence every time we meet and part i am perfectly certain if you dont come down to the world of common sense i shall sink into the world of melodrama and go and tackle your marquis myself  he must let you go  do you want me as much as all that she asked a little wistfully  he was by her side in a moment inspired by the break in her tone the sweet soft look in her eyes  he sank on one knee by the side of her couch and took her hands in his kissing them one after the other  ah marcia he murmured i want you more than anything else on earth  i want you so much that when you come you will make the years that have passed seem like nothing but a nightmare and the minutes as they come years of happiness  i am awkward i know sometimes and gruff and morose but so is any man who spends his life fretting for the thing he cant get  i only ask you dear to be fair  i have never said an unkind word about the man for whom you have cared so long  i only say now that you belong to me  i am not a bit foolishi am not even jealousonly your time has come your time for that little home in the country a husband always with you and i hope to heaven children  she took his face between her hands and kissed him  he understood her so perfectly that as she drew her lips away he rose and stood on the hearthrug a conqueror yet humble  you wont mind she begged if i choose my own time  it may be very soon it may be a little time  you will leave it to me and you will trust me  from tonight of course  she hesitated but his gesture was sufficient  she knew that she was understood  you have made me the happiest man in the world he said  i cant stop a moment longeri should simply say extravagant things  and i know how you feel  it isnt quite time for them yet  but youll send for me  of course  and about your visit to mandeleys he asked  i shant begin to be busy again for another fortnight  she hesitated  somehow she confessed it seems a little different now  it neednt he replied  i am content with what i have  she glanced at the calendar  tuesday she suggested  tuesday would suit me admirably he assented  she let him out herself and he kissed her fingers  he was never quite sure whether he walked down the stairs or whether he rang for the lift he was never quite sure whether he looked for a taxi or decided to walk  he passed over the bridge and the lights reflected in the dark waters below seemed suddenly like jewels  he made his way to his club because of the sheer impossibility of sleep  he stood on the threshold of the reading room and looked in at the little group of semisomnolent men  in his way he was popular and he received a good many sleepy greetings  whats the matter with borden one man drawled  he looks as though some one had left him a fortune  he has probably discovered another literary star a rival publisher suggested  i wish to god some one would send him to a decent tailor a third man yawned  borden rang the bell for a drink  dickinson was right he said  ive found a new star   letitia on her return from the theatre that same evening found her father seated in a comfortable corner of the library with a volume of don quixote in his hand a whisky and soda and a box of cigarettes by his side  he had exchanged his dinner jacket for a plain black velvet coat and as he laid his book down at her coming she seemed to notice again that vague look of tiredness in his face  quiet evening dad she asked flinging herself into a low chair by his side  a very pleasant one he replied  montavons party was postponed but i have reopened an old fund of amusement here  with the exception of borrow none of our modern humourists appeal to me like cervantes  you wouldnt call borrow exactly modern would you  perhaps not the marquis conceded  i may be wrong to ignore the literature of the present day but such attempts as i have made to appreciate it have been unsatisfactory  you enjoyed the play dear  very much letitia acquiesced  the house was crowded  any one you know  she mentioned a few names then she hesitated  and that clever woman who wrote the changing earth was there in a boxmarcia hannaway she was with rather a dourlooking manher publisher i think charlie said it was  the marquis received the information with no signs of particular interest  letitia stretched out for a cigarette lit it and looked a little appealingly at her father  dad she said ive made an awful idiot of myself  in what direction the marquis enquired sympathetically  if it is a financial matter i am fortunately  worse letitia groaned  ive promised to marry charlie grantham  the marquis stretched out his long elegant hand and patted his daughters  but my dear child he said surely that was inevitable was it not i have looked upon it as almost certain to happen some day  well im rather glad you take it like that letitia remarked  now i come to think of it i suppose i should have had to say yes sometime or another  where is charlie  gone home in a huff because i wouldnt let him kiss me in the car or bring him in with me  either course would surely have been usual the marquis ventured  perhaps but i feel unusual letitia declared  it isnt that i mind marrying charlie but i know i shall detest being married to him  one must remember dear her father went on soothingly that with us marriage is scarcely a subject for neurotic ecstasies or most unwholesome hysterics  your position imposes upon you the necessity of an alliance with some house of kindred associations  the choice therefore is not a large one and you are spared the very undignified competitive considerations which attach themselves to people when it does not matter whom on earth they marry  the dukedom of grantham is unfortunately not an ancient one nor was it conferred upon such illustrious stock as the marquisate of mandeleys  however the granthams have their place amongst us and i imagine that the alliance will generally be considered satisfactory  oh i hope so letitia replied without enthusiasm  i only hope i shall find it satisfactory  i didnt mean to say yes for at least another year  the marquis smiled tolerantly  then what my dear child he asked hastened your decision  letitia became suddenly more serious  she bit her lip and frowned distinctly into the fire  at that moment she was furious with a thought  i cant tell you dad she confessed  id hate to tell you  id hate to put it in plain words even to myself  he patted her hand tolerantly  you must not take yourself too hardly to task letitia he said if at times you feel the pressure of the outside world  you are young and of versatile temperament  believe me those voices to which you may have listened are only echoes  nothing exists or is real in life which the brain does not govern  i am quite sure that you will never regret the step which you have taken this evening  letitia stood up  i hope not father she sighed a little wistfully  there are times when i am very dissatisfied with myself and tonight i am afraid is one of them  you analyse your sentiments my dear too severely her father told her  you are too conscientious  your actions are all that could be desired  you wont be lonely if that idiot takes me away from you soon she asked  the marquis looked almost shocked  loneliness is not a complaint from which i ever expect to suffer dear he said as he rose and opened the door for her  he returned to his empty chair his half consumed whisky and soda his vellumbound volume carefully marked  somehow or other the echoes of his last words seemed to be ringing in his ears  the fire had burned a little low the sound of passing vehicles from outside had grown fainter and fainter  he took up his book threw himself into his chair gazed with vacant eyes at the thick black print  there was a sudden chill in his heart a sudden thought perhaps a fear  there was one way through which loneliness could come     chapter xviii  marcia who had dreamed all night of blue skies flecked with little fragments of white cloud a soft west wind and sunbathed meadows descended the creaking stairs of the inn at fakenham paused upon the broad landing to admire the great oak chests and the cupboards full of china and then made her way to the coffee room  she found borden standing at the window looking down into the country street and talking with a stranger whom he left however at her entrance  they took their places at the breakfast table to which a waiter ushered them  still lucky her companion remarked as he watched marcia pour out the coffee  its going to be another delightful day  she glanced out into the sunlit street  just opposite was a house almost hidden in clematis and in the background was a tall row of elm trees amongst the branches of which the rooks were cawing  i feel like rip van winkle she whispered  do you know that twentyfive years ago i came to what is called a farmers ordinary in this very room  tell me she went on who was the man with whom you were talking  his face is quite familiar to me  he glanced around  thain had taken his place at the further end of the room  the man of whom we were speaking the other day he saiddavid thain  i think that you have met him havent you  she nodded  why of course  i didnt recognise him in tweeds  whatever is he doing down here  but i know before you can tell me she continued quickly  he has taken broomleys hasnt he  he told me that he had taken a house in the neighbourhood borden replied  he is going over there this morning to meet the present occupiers  it is a very small world marcia observed  i wonder whether he recognised me  without undue flattery i think i might say that i should think it probable  and of course he is imagining all sorts of improper thingschuckling about them i dare say in the way men do  he is being what i suppose he thinks tactful  he never glances in this direction at all  ill give him a surprise in a minute or two  they finished their breakfast and marcia crossed towards davids table  as soon as he was conscious of her approach he rose  he welcomed her however without a smile  from trewlys at dinner to the mandeleys arms for breakfast she remarked smiling  i feel quite flattered that you remembered me mr thain  did i show any signs of remembering you he asked a little grimly  of course you didnt she acknowledged  you ignored even my sweetest bow  that is why i felt sure that you recognised me perfectly  david remained silent standing still with an air of complete but respectful patience  you have taken a house down here the marquis tells me she continued  i have taken broomleys  i hope that you will like the neighbourhood she said  i used to live here once myself  so i understood  she was for a moment taken aback conscious now of a certain definitely inimical attitude in the man who stood looking coldly into her eyes  you know all about me then  that is the worst of getting into whos who  i know more about you than i do about your companion certainly he admitted  she laughed mockingly  to a downright declaration of war she had no objection whatever  that is mr borden who publishes my stories she told him  i dont suppose you read them do you  i am not sure he replied  i read very little modern fiction and i never look at the names of the authors  then we must take it for granted she sighed that my fame is unknown to you  if you should see the marquis before i do please tell him that he was entirely wrong about the best route here  his advice has cost us nearly thirty miles and a punctured tire  you wont forget  certainly not he promised  she turned away with a little nod of farewell to which davids response was still entirely formal  left alone in the room he resumed his breakfast finished it with diminished appetite and within a few minutes was speeding through the country lanes in his great rollsroyce car  the chauffeur sat a little uneasily in his place  it was very seldom that his master showed such signs of haste  in a quarter of an hour they were in the avenue of mandeleys  instead of turning to the right however to broomleys he took the turning to the abbey and pulled up short when within a hundred yards of the house  wait here for me he directed  if you see another car coming up blow your horn  he walked across the smooth ancient turf stepped over the wire fence and raised the latch of richard vonts cottage gate  his uncle a little disturbed came hastily down the garden path  his clothes were stained with clay and the perspiration was on his forehead  david looked at him in surprise  working so early  vont nodded  you forget he said that this is not early for me  all my life i have risen with the sun and gone to bed with it  come inside david ill get this muck off my hands  you spoke of the afternoon  i came direct from the village david replied as he followed his uncle into the house  i came because i thought you would like to know that there is another visitor on the way to see you  richard vont looked round and faced his nephew  his shirt was open at the throat his trousers were tied up with little pieces of string  in whatever labour he had been engaged it had obviously been of a strenuous character  he wiped the perspiration from his forehead  whats that david he demanded  a visitor  marcia is at the mandeleys arms david told him  i am taking it for granted that she is on her way to see you  vont turned deliberately away and david heard his heavy feet ascending the staircase  in a few moments he called downstairs  his voice was as usual  step round this afternoon lad if you think its well  david passed out of the little garden crossed the strip of park and taking the wheel drove slowly round by the longer route to broomleys he passed before the front of the abbeya mansion of the dead with row after row of closed blinds masses of smokeless chimneys and patches of weeds growing thick in the great sweep before the house even with its air of pitiless desertion its severe semiecclesiastical outline its ruined cloisters empty to the sky on one wing its unbroken and gloomy silence the place had its atmosphere  david slackened the speed of his car paused for a moment and looked back at the little creepercovered cottage on the other side of the moat  so those two had faced one another through the yearsthe abbey silent magnificent historical with all the placid majesty of its countless rows of windows its chapel where mandeleys for generations had been christened and buriedat its gates the little cottage whose garden was filled with spring flowers and from whose single stack of chimneys the smoke curled upwards  even while he watched richard vont stood there upon the threshold with a great book under his arm  david shivered a little as he threw in the clutch passed on round the back of the building and through the iron gates of the ancient dower house  he felt a little sigh of relief as he pulled up in front of the long grey house in front of which sylvia laycey was waiting to receive him  she waved her hand gaily and looked with admiration at the car  they are all here mr thain she exclaimedmr merridrew and father and your own builder  come along and quarrel about the fixtures  i thought i had better stay with you because dad loses his temper so  david descended almost blithely from his car  he was back again in a human atmosphere and the pressure of the girls fingers was an instant relief to him  i am not going to quarrel with any one he declared  i shall do exactly what mr muddicombe tells meand you  she was a very pleasant type of young englishwomandistinctly pretty fairskinned healthy and goodhumoured  notwithstanding the fact that their acquaintance was of the briefest david was already conscious of her charm  youll find me in particular very grasping she declared as they entered the long low hall  i want to make everything i can out of you so that daddy and i can have a real good two months in london  i dont believe you know the value of things a bit do youexcept of railways and those colossal things  cupboards for instance  do you know anything about cupboards  and are you going to allow us anything for the extra bathroom we put in  well i am rather partial to bathrooms he confessed and i should hate you to take it away with you  she drew a sigh of relief  so long as you look upon the bathroom matter reasonably i am quite sure we shant quarrel  tell me about lady letitia please  is she quite welland the marquis and all of them  and when are they coming down  they are quite well he told her and lady letitia sent you her love  they talk of coming down almost at once  i do hope they will she replied because when we leave here dad and i are going to stay for a week or so with some friends quite near there  did you hear that noise  thats daddy stamping because he is getting impatient  then perhaps david suggested  i suppose wed better she interrupted  be lenient about the bathroom please  and if you could manage not to notice that the dining room wants papering youd be an angel  this way     chapter xix  david proved himself such a very satisfactory incoming tenant that the colonel insisted upon his staying to lunch and hastened off into the cellar to find a bottle of old marsala of which he proposed that they should partake with a dry biscuit before mr merridrews departure sylvia sank into a low chair with a little exclamation of despair  now daddys done it she exclaimed  are you hungry mr thain  not veryyet david replied glancing at his watch  you see its only halfpast eleven  because she said impressively there are exactly three rather skinny cutlets in the house  all the servants left this morningall i said  we only have twoand an old woman from the village is coming up at halfpast twelve to cook them  one was for me and two were for father  perhaps you will tell me what i am to do  david smiled  well he observed i was distinctly asked to luncheon and i accepted  havent you anything  anything what she asked patiently  tinned in the house or that sort of thing he suggested a little vaguely  of course we havent she replied  dont you know that we are all packed up and leaving tomorrow  its the biggest wonder in the world that we have any biscuits to eat with that precious marsala  why not he proposed hopefully put on your hat and motor into fakenham with me  i suppose there is a butchers shop there  we can buy something together  she sprang to her feet  and you can choose exactly what you like she exclaimed  mr thain you are delightful  that is the best of you americans  you are full of resource  i shant be a minute getting a hat and a pair of gloves  david strolled about the gardens of his new demesne until sylvia reappeared  she had pinned on a blue tamoshanter and was wearing a jersey of the same colour  i shall love a spin in your car she exclaimed  and you drive yourself too  how delightful  they swung off through the more thickly wooded part of the park driving in places between dense clumps of rhododendrons and coming unexpectedly upon a walled garden neglected but brilliant with spring and early summer flowers  isnt it queer to have a garden so far away from the house the girl remarked but i dare say youve heard that the late marquis of mandeleys was mad about underground passages  there is one existing somewhere or other to the summer house in that garden from the abbey and lots of others  i am not at all sure that there isnt one to broomleys  havent you been afraid sometimes lest the ghosts of the dead monks might pay you an unexpected visit  she shook her head  they always held the funeral services in the chapel she explained but the burying place is at the side of the hill there  you can see the mandeleys vault from here  and the cypress trees david pointed out  i wonder how old they are  the american of you she scoffed  you ought to love mandeleysand broomleys  everything about the place is musty and ancient and worn out  you know the marquis dont you  slightly david assented  is he really human she asked or is he something splendidly picturesque which has just stepped out of one of the frames in his picture gallery  i can never make up my mind  he is so beautiful to look at but he doesnt look as though he belonged to this generation and why on earth they ever used to call him the wicked marquis i cant imagine  ive tried him myself she went on ingenuously in no end of ways but he treats me always as though i were some grandchild walking on stilts  of course youre in love with lady letitia  must i be  but isnt it all absolutely preordained she insisted in fact its almost depressingly obvious  here are the mandeleys estates the finest in norfolk mortgaged up to the hilt the abbey shut up the marquis and all of them living on credit the family fortunes at their lowest ebb  and here come you an interesting american stranger with more millions than the world has ever heard of before  of course you marry lady letitia and release the estates  do i he murmured  well it seems plausible  it has to be done she decided with a sigh  its a pity  why  she shook her head  we mustnt flirt  we should be interfering with the decrees of providencewhat an interestinglooking woman  you know her too  they passed marcia and her companion about halfway to fakenham marcia bowed cheerfully and looked with interest at sylvia  i know her very slightly david admitted  she doesnt belong to these parts sylvia said  weve lived here for nearly seven years you know and i know every one for miles round by sight  she came originally from somewhere in the neighbourhood i believe david observed  tell me everything about her please his companion demanded  i am a born gossip  you finish with the romance of mandeleys first he suggested evasively  well weve finished that so far as you are concerned she said but as soon as you have rescued the family and the wedding bells have ceased ringing youll find yourself faced with another problem  did you notice a queer little cottage right opposite the abbey  of course i did  well theres an old man sits in the garden there she went on reading the bible and cursing the marquis most of the day  he used to do it years ago and then he went to america  now hes come back and hes started it again  and what does the marquis do about it david enquired  he cant do anything  the late marquis made the old man a present of the cottage for saving his life and they cant take it away from him now  i suppose he must have been really wicked when he was youngi mean the marquis she went on because you see he ran away with that old mans daughter  its the sort of thing she went on that marquises are supposed to do in stories but it doesnt make them popular in a small neighbourhood  now tell me about the goodlooking woman who bowed to you please  she is the daughter of the man of whom you have been speaking david told her  she is the lady with whom the wicked marquis eloped nearly twenty years ago  sylvias interest was almost breathless  you mean to say that you knew the storyyouan american  absolutely he replied  i came into touch with it in a queer way the old man vont came back from america on the same steamer that i did ill tell you another thing  the wicked marquis as you call him and that lady whom we have just passed dine together now at least one night a week and the woman has become quite a famous authoress  she writes under the name i believe of marcia hannaway  sylvia threw herself back in her seat  why its amazing she declared  it turns a sordid little village tragedy into a piece of wonderful romance  perhaps after all that is what makes the marquis seem like a piece of wood to every other woman  i have heard it said david continued that he has been entirely faithful to her all his life  where do i stop please  here she replied at this shop  please come in and choose your own meat  i feel in much too romantic a frame of mind to even know beef from mutton  david followed her a little doubtfully into the shop  perhaps he ventured to suggest as the nucleus of your meal has already been decided upon  of course she interrupted cutlets  we want more cutlets  you neednt bother  ill see about it  david slipped into the next shop and reappeared with a huge box of chocolates which he handed over apologetically  i am not sure whether youll find these up to much  for the first time she exclaimed as she accepted them i realise what it must be to be a millionaire  i have never seen such a box of chocolates in my life  do you mind going over to the grocers and letting him see me with you she went on  it will be so good for our credit and his is just one of the accounts we have to leave for a little time  were you ever poor mr thain  poor but not alas romantically so he confessed  to be the real thing i ought to have earned my first few pounds oughtnt i  you see i didnt  i was educated by relatives and when a great chance came my way i was able to take advantage of it  an uncle advanced me a thousand pounds upon one condition  had you to make him a partner she asked in the intervals of giving a small order at the grocers  he shook his head  no he answered gravely it wasnt a financial condition  in a way it was something more difficult  she looked at him curiously  whatever it was she said if you promised i am quite sure that you would keep your word  they motored homewards and david was for a few minutes unexpectedly thoughtful  he deliberately approached broomleys from the back but even then it was impossible to avoid a distant view of the cottage  he looked towards it grimly  conditions are stern things he sighed  havent you kept that one yet she asked  the time is only just coming he told her  she looked up at him pleadingly  dont bother about it now please she begged  this is such a delightful day  and whatever you do you mustnt let it interfere with your eating three cutlets     chapter xx  bordens car came to a standstill in the avenue and marcia looked across the strip of green turf towards the cottage with a queer little thrill of remembrance  you are sure you wont mind waiting she asked as she sprang down if there is any fatted calf about ill call you in  borden showed her his pockets bulging with newspapers  i shall be perfectly content here he said however long you may be i shall back the car on to the turf and read  she nodded turned away lifted the latch of the gate and made her way towards the cottagecuriously silent and with no visible sign of habitation except for the smoke curling up from the chimney  as she drew nearer to the rustic entrance she hesitated  a rush of those very sensations at which she had so often gently mocked swept through her consciousness unsteadying and bewildering her  mandeleys imposing in its grim stillness seemed to be throwing out shadows towards her catching her up in a whirlpool of memories half sentimental half tragical  it was in the little cottage garden where she now stood and in the woods beyond that she had wandered with that strange new feeling in her heart of which she was even at that moment intensely conscious gazing through the mists of her inexperience towards the new world and new heaven which her love was unfolding before her  a hundred forgotten fancies flashed into her brain  she remembered with a singular and most unnerving accuracy the silent vigils which she had spent half hidden amongst those tall hollyhocks she had seen the grey twilight of morning pass seen the mists roll away and turret by turret the great house stand out like some fairy palace fashioned from space in a single night  she had seen the thrushes hop from the shrubberies and coverts on to the dewspangled lawn had heard their song growing always in volume had seen the faint sunlight flash in the windows before she had crept back to her room  another day in that strange turmoil which had followed the coming of her love  she had watched shooting parties assemble in the drive outside her father in command she herself hidden yet watchful her eyes always upon one figure her thoughts with him  and then the nightsthe summer nightswhen men and women in evening costume strolled down from the house  she could see their white shirt fronts glistening in the twilight  again she heard the firm yet loitering step and the quiet still voice which had changed the world for her is vont about miss marcia she would hear him say  i want to have a talk with him about the partridge drives tomorrow  she closed her eyes  the smell of the honeysuckle and the early cottage roses seemed suddenly almost stupefying  there were a few secondsperhaps even a minutebefore vont had donned his brown velveteen coat and issued from the cottagejust time for a whispered word a glance a touch of the fingersmarcia felt her knees shake as she lingered underneath the porch  she was swept with recalcitrant memories stinging like the lash of a whip  perhaps this new wisdom of hers was after all a delusion the old standards of her calvinistic childhood unassailable then for the first time she was conscious of a familiar figure richard vont was seated in a hard kitchen chair at the end of the garden with a book upon his knee and his face turned to mandeleys  at the sound of her little exclamation he turned his head  at first it was clear that he did not recognise his visitor  he laid down the book and rose to his feet  marcia came a few steps towards him and then paused  several very ingenious openings escaped her altogether  father she began a little hesitatingly you see ive come to see you  are you glad  he stood looking at hera man of rather more than middle height but bowed with silvery hair and a little patch of white whiskers  the rest of his face was cleanshaven still hard and brown as in his youth and his eyes were like steel  no he answered i am not glad  since you are here though take this chair  i will fetch another while i hear what you have to say  shall we go inside she suggested  he shook his head  your mother lived and died there he reminded her  marcia set her teeth  i suppose she walked in the garden sometimes she said resentfully  the garden is different he declared  the earth changes from generation to generation just as the flowers here throw out fresh blossoms and the weeds come and go  but my rooftree stands where it always did  wait  he disappeared into the house and returned in a few moments with a chair which he placed a few feet away from marcia  then he sat and looked at her steadily  so you are marcia he said  youve grown welllooking  marciayour daughter she reminded him gently  are you going to forget that altogether  not he replied if you are in need of succour or help but i judge from your appearance that you need neither  you are flesh of my flesh as i well know  i want nothing from you father except a little kindness she pleaded  his hands trembled  kindness he repeated  thats strange hearing  you are without friends perhaps  you made some maybe and they heard of your disgrace and theyve cast you off  she shook her head  no it isnt that at all  i have many friends and they most of them know my history  friends of your own sort then  marcia moved uneasily in her chair  father she said gently dont you sometimes think that your views of life are a little narrow  i am very sorry indeed for what i did inasmuch as it brought unhappiness to you  for the rest i have nothing to regret  he was breathing a little harder now  nothing to regret he muttered  nothing she repeated firmly  for many years the man who took me away from you gave me everything i asked of him in life everything he promised  he is still willing to do the same  if any change comes into our relations now or in the future it will be my doing not his  meaning he demanded that youve seen the wickedness of it  meaning nothing of the sort she replied  i want you to try and realise father if you can that i have passed into a larger world than you or this little village community here know very much about  i have written books and been praised for them by men whose praise is worth having  there are plenty of perfectly good and wellliving people who know what i have done and who are glad to be my friends there is one who wants to marry me  richard vont looked at her long and steadily  marcia was as usual dressed with extreme simplicity but her clothes were always good and economy in boots and hats was a vice which she had never practised when she told him that she had passed into a world apart from his he realised it  the only wonder was that she had ever been his daughter  to marry you he repeated  its one of those of your own loose way of thinking eh  one of those who have forgotten the laws of god and have set up for themselves some graven image in which theres nought of the truth  the man who wishes to marry me father she said warmly is a man of honour and position  cant you believe me when i assure you that there is another way of looking at what you consider so terrible  i have been as faithful to my vows as you to your marriage ones  the man whom i am told you still hate has never wavered in his loyalty to me any more than i have in my fidelity to him  cant you believe that to some extent at least we have sanctified our love  james vont passed his hand a little wearily over his forehead  its blasphemous gibberish that youre talking he declared  if you had come back to me marcia in rags and in want maybe there is something in my heart would have gone and id have taken you and wed have found a home somewhere far away  but to see you sitting there soft and wellspoken speaking of your success pleased with your life turns that very hatred you spoke of into fury  you and your learning and your writing of books  why youre ignorant woman more ignorant than the insects about you  you dont know right from wrong  father she pleaded  aye but listen he went on  youve children eh  no she answered softly  no children to bear your shame eh  and why not  she looked for a moment into his eyes and then away  that may be the one weak spot she confessed  the one weak spot he repeated bitterly  shall i tell you what you are you women who live cheerfully with the men you sell yourselves to and defy the laws of god and the teaching of the bible  youre just wastrels and jezebels  ay and theres the garden gate marcia and my hearts as hard as a flint even though the tears are in your eyes and you look at me as your mother used to look  its no such tears as youre shedding asll bring you back into my heart  your very prosperitys an offence  you carry the price of your shame on your back and in your smooth speech and in this false likeness of yours to the world you dont belong to  if its duty thats brought you here youd better not have come  marcia rose to her feet  youre very hard father she said simply  illustration youre very hard father she said simply  the ways of the transgressors are hard he replied pointing still towards the gate  if youd come here in shame and humiliation if youd come here as one as had learnt the truth youd have found me all that you sought  but you come here a very ignorant woman marcia and you leave me a little harder than ever before and you leave the curses that choke my throat a little hotter a little more murderous  his clenched fist was pointing towards mandeleys his face was like granite  marcia turned and left him without a word opened the gate walked across the little strip of turf and half shrank from half clung to the hand which helped her up into the car  get away quickly please she implored him  dont talk to me james  outside the gates as quickly as you can go  he started his engine and they drove off through the lodge gates into the country lane where the hedges were beautiful with fresh green foliage and fragrant with early honeysuckle  to london she begged  dont stopanywhere yet  he nodded and drove a little faster his eyes always upon the road  it was not until they had reached the heath country and the great open spaces around newmarket that a little colour came back into her cheeks  it wasnt a success james she said quietly  i was afraid it mightnt be he admitted  nothing but a drury lane heroine would have moved him she went on with an uneasy little laugh  if i could have gone back in rags in a snowstorm with a child in my arms hed have forgiven me  as i am now i am an offence to all that he holds right and his ideas are like steel cablesyou cant twist or bend them  borden nodded  he relaxed his speed a little and glanced towards his companion  you know what our friend said in that russian manuscript i lent you he reminded her the primitive laws are for the primitive world  but what do we learn jim she asked him tremulously  what is its value  is it sophistry or knowledge  i lived in that little cottage once  i have smiled at the memory of those days so often  i did homely tasks and dreamed of books and learning  to me it seems although my fingers are bleeding that i have climbed  and to himand he looked just like something out of the bible jimi am nothing more  dont he interrupted  he is of his world and you of yours  you cant work out the sum you are trying to solve there isnt any common denominator  i dont know she answered a little pitifully  there was a single second as i saw him sitting there with his bible on his knee and remembered that he was a clean wellliving honest man when my heart began to shake  i remembered that he was my father  it seems to me that it is all wrong that there should be any difference between us  i suddenly felt that a brain really didnt count for anything after all that all the culture in the world wasnt so beautiful as a single right feeling  he slackened again the speed of the car  as far as they could see was a great open space of moorland with flaming bushes of yellow gorse little clumps of early heather and in the distance a streak of blue from the undergrowth of a long belt of firs  she looked about her for a moment and closed her eyes  there he said is one of the simplest phases of beauty the world has ever given usflowers and trees an open space and a west wind there isnt any one who can look at these things and be happy who isnt somewhere near the right path marcia  she leaned back her eyes fixed dreamily upon the blue distance  just drive on please jim she begged     chapter xxi  david ate his three cutlets and both as regards appetite and in other ways was a great success at the little luncheon party  afterwards they finished the bottle of marsala under a cedar tree and whilst the colonel indulged in reminiscences sylvias eyes rested more than once upon the automobile drawn up before the door  it was quite an adventure in her rather humdrum life and after all there was no reason why a fairy prince shouldnt be an american millionaire and come in a rollsroyce  i am sure i hope youll like broomleys mr thain the colonel said as david rose to make his adieux  i am delighted to leave the place in the hands of such a good tenant  it makes one almost sorry to go away when one realises what one is missing in the shape of neighbours eh sylvia  sylvia was unaccountably shy but she raised her eyes to davids for a moment  it is most disappointing she agreed  mr thain is such a sympathetic shopper  david drove off a little gloomily  why the devil couldnt i fall in love with a nice girl like that he muttered to himself instead of  he pulled up short set his heel upon that other vision and braced himself for the immediate task before him  he drove around the park drew up outside the cottage and descending from the car approached the low hedge  at the further end of the garden he could hear his uncles sonorous voice  he was seated in a highbacked chair the bible upon his knee reading to himself slowly and with great distinctness the ten commandments  on the ground by his side were the remnants of another chair  as david came up the little path his uncle concluded his reading and laid down the bible  bring out a chair and sit with me david he invited  david pointed to the ground  your furniture seems  dont jest his uncle interrupted  that chair i have broken to pieces with my own hands because of the woman who sat upon it not many hours since  david frowned  you mean marcia  i mean marciathe woman who was my daughter was the stern reply the woman of whose visit you warned me  come into the house with me david begged turning his back upon mandeleys  you sit and look at that great drear building and brood overmuch  i want to talk with you  richard vont rose obediently to his feet and followed his visitor into the little parlour  david looked around him curiously  this place seems to have the flavour of many years ago he said sometimes i can scarcely realise that i have ever eaten my meals off that oak table  sometimes it seems like yesterday  time passes but time dont count for much the old man sighed mary wells will be up from the village soon and shell make us a cup of tea  sit opposite me lad  is there any more news  none  them shares for instance  there will be no change in them david replied  in two months time he will know it  and hell have forty thousand pounds to find ehforty thousand pounds which he will never be able to raise richard vont muttered his eyes curiously bright  there isnt an acre of land here that isnt mortgaged over and over again  youll make him a bankrupt i suppose david said thoughtfully  ay a bankrupt his uncle repeated lingering over the word with a fierce joy  but theres something more asll fall to your lot david he went onsomething moreand the times none so far off  david moved in his chair uneasily  something more  ay ay the old man assented  youll find it hard my boy but youll keep your word  youve got that much of the vonts in your blood  your words a bond with you  tell me david begged about that something more  the times not yet his uncle replied  you shall know lad in good season  david was silent for a moment filled with nameless and displeasing apprehensions  he was brave enough prepared to meet any ordinary emergency but somehow or other the vagueness of the task which lay before him seemed appalling  outside was mandeleys a grim and silent remembrance  inside the cottage everything seemed to speak of changeless times  the pendulum of the tall clock swung drowsily as it had swung thirty years ago  the pictures on the wall were the same the china the furniture even its arrangement  and the man who sat in his easychair was the same only that his whiskers and hair were white where once they had been black  uncle he begged let me know the worst now  youll know in good time and not before was the almost fierce reply dont weary me tonight lad vent continued his voice breaking a little  the day has been full of trials for me  twas no light matter to have a strange woman herethe strange woman david that was once my daughter  david frowned a little  uncle he said i dont wish to pain you but i am sorry about marcia  you dont need to be lad  she isnt sorry for herself  she is puffed up with the vanity of her brain  she came here in fine clothes and with gentle manners and a new sort of voice  she has made herselfa lady  poor lass her day of suffering is to come  maybe i was hard on her but i couldnt bear the sight of her and thats the truth  she talked to me like one filled with wisdom  it was me whom she thought the ignorant one  put marcia out of your mind david  we will talk of other things  david leaned forward in his chair  his eyes were bright his tone eager  let us have this out uncle he begged  ive been thinking of itperhaps as much as you lately  they may have been wrong those two they may be sinners but after all the world isnt a place for holy people only  the bible tells you that  for nearly twenty years he has stood by her and cared for her  there has been no meanness no backing out on his part  he is as much to her today as ever he was  ay his listener interposed scornfully she talked that way  do you reckon that a man and woman who sinned a score of years ago are any the better because they are going on sinning today  faithfulness to good is part of the word of god  faithfulness in sin is of the devils handing out  david shook his head  i am sorry uncle he said earnestly i have come to look on these things a little differently  many years ago in america i used to wonder what it was that kept you apart from every one else kept the smile from your lips made you accept good fortune or ill without any sign of feeling  i was too young to understand then but i realise everything now  i know how you denied yourself to send me to school and college  i know how you left yourself almost a beggar when you gave me the chance of my life and trusted me with all your savings these things i shall never forget  one word lad vont interrupted  its the truth you say  i trusted you with wellnigh all i had that stood between me and starvation but i trusted you with it on one condition  do you mind that condition we sat outside the little shanty id built with my own hands up in the adirondacks there and before us were the mountains and the woods and the silence  we were close to god up there david  you remember  i remember  youd come hotfoot from the city and you told me your story  i sat and listened and then i told you mine  i told you of the shame that had driven me from england and i told you of the thoughts that were simmering in my mind  as we sat there your wrath was as mine and the oath which i had sworn you swore too  i lent you the money over that oath boy  look back if you will  you remember the night  there was a hot windcool before it reached us thoughrushing up from the earth rushing through the pine trees till they shook and bowed around us and a moon with the black clouds being driven across it looking down and the smell of the pines  you remember  i remember david repeated  we stood there hand in hand and there was no one to hear us except those voices that come from god only knows where and you swore on your soul that you would help me as soon as the time came to punish the man who had blasted my life  in my way you promisednot yours  there should be no will but mine  for this one thing i was master and you were slave and you swore  i swore  i am not denying it david acknowledged  havent i made a start  havent i deceived the man at whose table i sat and laid a plot to ruin him  and i have ruined him  do you want more than this  yes was the unshaken reply  then what in heavens name is it david demanded  out with it for gods sake  i carry this whole thing about with me like a weight upon my soul  granted that you are master and i am slave  well ive done much  what is there left  that you will be told in due season  and meantime david continued passionately i am to live in a sort of prison  youve no need to find it such the old man declared doggedly  david sprang to his feet  the time had come for his appeal  the words seemed to rush to his lips  he was full of confidence and hope  uncle he began you must never let a single word that i may say seem to you ungrateful but i beseech you to listen to me  life is like a great city in which there are many thoroughfares  it is an immense insoluble problem which no one can understand  you never open another book except your bible  you have never willingly exchanged speech with any human being since you left here  in america you shunned all company you lived in the gloomiest of solitudes  this little corner of the earth is all you know of  perhaps there is more in life even than that book can teach you  marcia talked like this richard vont said quietly  she spoke of another world a world for cleverer folk than i  are you going to try and break my purpose too  i would if i could david declared fervently  this man is what his ancestors and his education have made him  he has led a simple ignorant and yet in some respects a decent life  he is too narrow to understand any ones point of view except his own  when he took marcia away she was the village girl and he the great nobleman  today marcia holds his future in her hands  she is the strong woman and he is the weak man  she has achieved fame and made friends  she has lived a happy life she is at the present moment perfectly content every promise he made her he has kept  well why not let it go at that  so you are another poor child who knows all about this wonderful world of which i am so ignorant richard vont said bitterly  yet my lad i tell you that theres one great truth that none of you can get over and that is that sin lives and there is nothing in this world save atonement can wash it out  theres a newer doctrine than that uncle david insisted  you talk with the voice of the blackfrocked minister who dangles hell in front of his congregation  there is something else can clear away sin and the book over which you pore day by day will teach it you if you know where to look for it  theres love  was it love then that brought him down through the darkness to dishonour my daughter vont demanded with blazing eyes  it didnt seem like it but love must have been there david answered  nothing but love could have kept these two people together all this time each filling a great place in the others life  i havent thought of these things much uncle but i tell you frankly ive read the bible as well as you and i dont believe in this black ogre of unforgivable sin  if these two started in wrong fashion theyve purified themselves  i hold that its your duty now to leave them alone  i say that this vengeance you still hanker after is the eye for an eye and limb for a limb of the old testament  there has been a greater light in the world since then  have you done vont asked without the slightest change in his tone or expression  i suppose so david replied wearily  i wish youd think over it all uncle  i know im right  i know there is justice in my point of view  ill not argue with you lad his uncle declared  ill ask you nobut this one question and before you answer it just go back in your mind to the night we stood outside my shack when the wind was blowing up from the valleys  are you going to stand by your pledged word or are you going to play me false  the great clock ticked drearily on  from outside came the clatter of teacups  david walked to the latticed window and came back again richard vont was seated in his highbacked chair his hands grasping its sides  his mouth was as hard and tightly drawn as one of his own vermin traps but his eyes steadfastly fixed upon his nephew were filled with an inscrutable pathos  david remembered that passionate outburst of feeling on a fardistant night when the tears had rolled down this mans cheeks and his voice was choked with sobs  and he remembered  i shall keep my word in every way he promised solemnly  vont rose slowly to his feet  his knees were trembling  he seemed to be looking into a mist  his hands shook as he laid them on davids shoulders  thank god he muttered  david boy remember  this light talk is like an april shower on the warm earth  goodness and sin are the same now as a thousand years ago and they will be the same in a thousand years to come  we may pipe a new tune but its only the devils children that dance to itsin must be punished  theres no getting over that  forgiveness later maybebut first comes punishment     chapter xxii  a queer atmosphere of depression seemed about this time to have affected the two inhabitants of number 94 grosvenor square  the marquis had suddenly become aware of an aimlessness in life which not even his new financial hopes enabled him to combat  the night of his weekly dinner at trewlys he spent in the entertainment of three ancient whist companions and it was not until they had gone and he was left alone in the silent house that he realised how empty and profitless the evening had been  day by day after lunch he sent out the same message to his chauffeurfive oclock for the club instead of three oclock for battersea and on each occasion the words seemed to leave his lips with more reluctance  he walked each morning in the park as carefully dressed and as upright as ever but one or two of his acquaintances noticed a certain difference  there was an increased pallor a listlessness of gait which seemed to bespeak an absent or a preoccupied mind  he even welcomed the coming one morning just as he was starting for his promenade of mr wadham junior  here at least was diversion  mr wadham junior had been rehearsing his interview and his prospective deportment towards the marquis on the way up and he started the enterprise to his own entire satisfaction  he entered the library with an exceedingly serious air and he took great pains to be sure that the door was closed after the retreating butler before he did more than respond to his distinguished clients greeting  anything fresh wadham the latter enquired  i have ventured to see your lordship once more mr wadham began with reference to the scrip which we deposited at the bank to meet certain liabilities on your behalf  well what about it the marquis asked goodhumouredly  you lawyers know nothing of the stock exchange  mr wadham assumed an expression of great gravity  would your lordship he begged for the satisfaction of my firm the members of which i think you will admit have always been devoted to your lordships interests ring up the stockbroking firm ofsaymessrs youngs fielden and company or any other you like with reference to the value of those shares  i am unfortunately the marquis replied not in a position to do so  the shares were sold me by a personal friend  i am content to believe that if they had not been of their face value the transaction would not have been suggested to me  that mr wadham declared seriously is not business  it happens to be the only way in which i can look upon the matter was the cool reply  to proceed a little further the lawyer continued i am here to enquire solely in your own interests and as a matter of business whether you have made any definite agreement to pay for these shares i am under the impression that your lordship mentioned a note of hand  i have signed the marquis acknowledged a bill i believe the document was called for forty thousand pounds due in about two months time  has your lordship any idea as to how this liability is to be met  none at all  it is possible that the shares will have advanced in value sufficiently to justify my selling them  if not i take it that the bank will advance the sum against the scrip  mr wadham junior could scarcely contain himself  does your lordship know he exclaimed that the bank hesitated about advancing a sum of less than a thousand pounds upon the security of those shares  the marquis yawned  they will probably have changed their minds in two months time he remarked  but if they have not mr wadham persisted  it is the unfortunate proclivity of you who are immersed in the narrow ways of legal procedure his client observed to look only upon the worst side of a matter  personally i am an optimist  i rather expect to make a fortune on those shares  it is the belief of my firm on the contrary mr wadham confessed gloomily that they will end in a petition in bankruptcy being presented against your lordship  the marquis shook out his handkerchief wiped his lips and lit a cigarette  yours appears to be rather a dismal errand mr wadham he said coldly  is there any reason why i should detain you further  none whatever so long as i have made it quite clear that there is no prospect of raising a single halfpenny in excess of the mortgages already completed  the matter of the forty thousand pounds draft is of course entirely in your lordships hands  i thought it my duty to inform you as to the value of the shares in case you were able to persuade the gentleman who sold them to you to cancel the transaction  you mean well wadham no doubt the marquis declared a little patronisingly but as i said before your turn of mind is too legal my respects to your father  you will forgive my ringing will you not lady letitia is waiting for me to walk with her  mr wadham departed saying blasphemous things all the way into piccadilly and the marquis walked with lady letitia in the park  as a rule their conversation although mostly of personal matters was conducted in lighthearted fashion enough by letitia and responded to with a certain dry though stately humour by her father  this morning however a silence which amounted almost to constraint reigned between them  the marquis realising this finally dragged his thoughts with difficulty away from his own affairs  i had intended to speak to you letitia he began concerning the announcement of your marriage  some festivities must naturally follow and a meeting between myself and the duke  whom you hate like poison dont you dad letitia said with a little grimace  well so do i for the matter of that  ones personal feelings are scarcely of account in such a case the marquis averred that is to say any personal feelings with the exception of yours and granthams  the match is suitable in every way and at a time when every young man of account is being chased by a new race of ineligible young women it must be a comfort to his family to contemplate an alliance like this  letitia shrugged her shoulders  with regard to the actual announcement dad she said we are going to keep it to ourselves for a few weeks longer or at any rate until we are safely settled in the country  its such a bore to have every one you have ever spoken to in your life come rushing round to wish you happiness and that sort of thing  charlie rather agrees with me  the matter naturally is in your hands the marquis replied with a slight air of relief  of course i am seeing rather more of charlie letitia went on but people wont take any notice of that  there have been rumours of our engagement at least half a dozen times already  arent you getting just a little sick dad of this everlasting walk and these everlasting people we keep on bowing to and wish we didnt know  i hadnt thought of it exactly in that way her father confessed and yet perhaps london is a little wearisome this season  i think letitia sighed that i never felt so keen about leaving town and getting into the country  i suppose you wouldnt care to go down to mandeleys a week earlier would you she asked tentatively  the marquis looked upwards towards the tops of the trees  he thought of that particular spot on the hall table where notes were left for him of the oldfashioned silver salver laid by his side on the breakfast table upon which his letters were placed  he thought of the queer new feeling with which day by day he glanced them through opening none searching always covering his disappointment by means of some ingenious remark and of the days when he returned from such a walk as this or from the club his eyes glued upon the sideboard even while the butler was relieving him of his coat and gloves  this morning all the accumulated sickness all the little throbs of disappointment seemed to be lumped into one gigantic and intolerable depression so that his knees even trembled a little while he walked and his feet felt as though they were shod with lead  he remembered his sleepless nights  he thought of that dull ache which came to him sometimes in the still hours when he lay and fancied that he could hear her voice her cheerful laugh the tender touch of her fingers he felt a sudden overmastering desire to be free at any rate from that minute by minute agony  at mandeleys there would be only the post  or perhaps if he made up his mind to leave town earlier than he had expected he would not be breaking his word to himself if he sent just a line to tell her of his changed plans  the country by all means  so far as i am concerned letitia he said i think that i have never before felt so strongly the desire to leave london  i suppose that if we were content to take things quietly we could collect a few servants and be comfortable there  i am sure of it dad she exclaimed eagerly  you dont need to bother  i could arrange it all she went on passing her arm through his  four or five women will be all that we need and mrs harris can collect those in the village  then we need only take gossett and smith from here and of course cook  the others can go on to board wages  the marquis smiled indulgently  you must not disperse the establishment too completely my dear he said  i have great hopes that a certain business venture which i have made will place us in a very different financial position before very long  she looked a little dubious  was that what mr wadham was worrying about this morning she asked  mr wadham junior is a most ignorant young man her father proclaimed stiffly  the venture such as it is is one which i have made entirely on my own responsibility  a sudden thought struck her  her arm tightened upon her fathers  has it anything to do with mr thain  it was mr thain who placed the matter before me he assented  and mr wadham doesnt approve  you really are a most intelligent young person her father declared smiling  mr wadhams disapproval however does not disturb me  letitia was conscious of a curious uneasiness  are you quite sure that mr thain is an honest man father she asked  the marquiss eyebrows were slightly elevated  my dear he said reprovingly  mr thains position as a financier is i believe beyond all question  your aunt who you will remember first brought him to us spoke of his reputation in the states as being entirely unexceptionable  after all aunt only met him on the steamer letitia observed  consider further the marquis continued that he has taken broomleys and will therefore be a neighbour of ours for some time  do you think that he would have done this with the knowledge in his mind he had involved me in a transaction which was destined to have an unfortunate conclusion  letitia was silent  her fine forehead was clouded by a little perplexed frown  the problem of david thain was not so easily solved then the duchess called to them from her car and beckoned letitia to her side  i have heard rumours letitia she whispered  letitia nodded  i was coming round to see you aunt she replied  we are not going to announce it until a little later on  the duchess smiled her approbation  i am delighted she declared  you are so difficult letitia and there are so many girls about just now trying to get hold of our young men  some one was telling me only last night of an american girlor was she south american i dont rememberwith millions and millions who almost followed charlie about  of course that sort of thing is being done but it hasnt happened in our family yet  dear people both of you  when are you going to mandeleys  we have just decided the marquis told her to shorten our stay in london  letitias engagements are capable of curtailment and my own are of no account  we are thinking of going at once  and your neighbour the duchess enquired when is he going into residence  i have not heard  i am expecting him to come to scotland later on she observed  the marquis was gently surprised  wont he be just a little  not at all the duchess interrupted  he shoots and fishes and does everything other men do  i am not quite sure she went on that you thoroughly appreciate mr thain  my dear caroline you are entirely mistaken the marquis assured her what letitias sentiments with regard to him may be i do not know but so far as i am concerned i consider him a most desirable acquisition to my acquaintances  if only i had your manner she said earnestly  poor mr thain  with a little nod she drove off  the marquis and letitia continued their promenade  why poor mr thain the former mused  exactly what did caroline mean i wonder  i think letitia replied that she was emphasising the distinction between your acceptance of mr thain and hers  her father remained puzzled  mr thain has been a guest at my house he said and we shall treat him as a neighbour when we meet at mandeleys  those things are indications of a friendly feeling letitia observed but you yourself know where you have placed the barriers  now aunt caroline doesnt mean to have any barriers  if mr thain can be awakened to his great opportunities it is perfectly clear that she means to enter upon a flirtation with him  the marquis was a little shocked  you are somewhat blunt my dear he said  so far as your aunt caroline is concerned too i fear that she has in a measure lost that fine edgeperhaps i should say that very delicate perception of the differences which undoubtedly do exist  i am pointing this out to you letitia he continued as they left the park but it occurs to me that my doing so is unnecessary  i have noticed that since your entrance into society some four or five years ago you have identified yourself entirely with my views  nothing could have been more discriminating than your treatment of the various excellent people with whom you have been brought into contact  letitia did not speak for a moment  then she turned to her father with a little sigh  an inherited weakness i suppose she murmured  i sometimes rather envy other people their standpoint  the marquis made no reply  they were nearing number 94 and he was conscious of that slight nervous expectancy which required always a firm hand  the door was opened before they could ring  the young man who served under gossett was already relieving him of his hat and gloves  with a perfectly leisurely step the marquis advanced towards the hall table  he glanced at the superscription of two or three notes dropped his eyeglass and turned away towards his studyemptyhanded  several notes for you letitia he said without looking around     chapter xxiii  richard vont a few mornings later leaned upon his spade and gazed over towards mandeleys with set fixed eyes  his clothes and hands were stained with clay the sweat was pouring down his face he was breathing heavily like a man who has been engaged in strenuous labour but of his exhausted condition he seemed to take no count  there was something new at the abbey something which spoke to him intimately which was crowding his somewhat turgid brain with the one great imagining of his life  for mandeleys had opened its eyes  a hundred blinds had been raised long rows of windows stood open  men were at work weeding the avenue and driving mowing machines across the lawns which stretched down to the ring fence and the moat  flaming borders of yellow crocuses became miraculously visible as the dank grass disappeared and many spiral wreaths of smoke were ascending into the misty stillness of the spring morning  away behind in the highwalled garden were more gardeners bending at their toil  richard vont was no reader of the morning post but an item in its fashionable intelligence of that morning lay clearly written before him  the marquis was coming back  vont turned slowly away left his spade in the tool shed entered the cottage by the back door carefully changed his clothes washed the clay from his face and hands and descended into the sitting room where his breakfast awaited him  mrs wells looked at him curiously she was a distant connection and stood upon no ceremony with him  richard she demanded where were you when i come this morning  sleeping maybe he answered taking his place at the table  and that you werent she contradicted for i made bold to knock at your door to ask if youd like a rasher of bacon with your eggs  he raised his head and looked at her steadily  well  im not one to pry into other peoples affairs she continued but your goings on are more than i can understand  all day long you sit with the book upon your knee and if a neighbour asks why you never pass the gate or seemingly move a limb its the rheumatics you speak of  and yet last night your bed was never slept in my man and i begin to suspect other nights as well  whats it mean eh  richard vont rose to his feet and opened the door  just that he answered harshly pointing to it  ill not be spied on  inch for inch and yard for yard this cottage and garden are mine i tell youmine with dishonour maybe but mine  ill have none around me that watches and frets because of the things that i choose to do  ill lie out in the garden at nights if i will and not account to you mary wells or sleep on the floor if it pleases me and its no concern of any one but mine  so back to the village gossips if you will and spread your tale  maybe im a midnight robber and roam the countryside at night  its my affair  a robber youre not richard vont was the somewhat dazed reply and that the world knows  and theres summut more that the world knows too and that is that since you came back from americy never have you set foot outside that gate  theres friends waiting for you at the village and theres them as smokes their pipe at night in the alehouse whose company d do you no harm but for some reason of your own you live like a hermit  and yetyet  go on mary he said sturdily  finish it  its the nights that are baffling mrs wells declared  theres some of your clothes in the morning wrings with sweat  theres sometimes the look in your face at breakfast time as though youd had a hard days work and done more than was good for your strength  im no sleeper he declared no sleeper at all  if i choose to walk in the garden what business is it of yours mary or of any one down in th village  answer me that woman  every man i suppose may please himself she conceded grudgingly but i dont hold with mysteries myself  then you full well know he replied how to escape from them  if theyre too much for you mary ive fended for myself before and i can do it again  mrs wells snorted  keep your own counsel then richard  and you keep yours he advised  youre my nearest of kin mary though youre but my cousins widdy  if you can learn to keep a still tongue in your head and do whats asked of you there may be a trifle coming to you when my time comes  but if you get these curious fits on you and theyre more than you can stand if youre going bleating from house to house in the village and spending your time in tittletattling then well part  thems plain words anyhow  mrs wells became almost abject  youve said the word richard and ill bide by it she declared you can run races with yourself round the garden all night long if youve a will  ill close my eyes from now  but she added as a parting shot that clay on your old clothes takes a sight of getting off  richard vont ate his breakfast slowly and thoughtfully entirely with the air of a man who accomplishes a duty  afterwards with the bible under his arm he took his accustomed seat at the end of the garden facing mandeleys  there were tradesmens carts and motorvans passing occasionally on their way to and from the house but he saw none of them  he was in his place waiting watching perhaps but without curiosity  presently a summons came however which he could not ignore  he turned his head  david thain on a great black horse had come galloping across the park from broomleys and had brought his restive horse with some difficulty up to the side of the paling  the greeting between the two was a silent yet so far as vont was concerned an eager one  you know what that means david observed pointing with his crop towards the house  i know well was the swift answer  its what ive prayed for  move your horse out of the way boy  cant you see im watching  david looked at the old man curiously  then he dismounted and with his arm through the reins leaned against the paling  theres nothing to watch yet he said but tradesmens carts  its just the beginning vont muttered  soon therell be servants and thenhim  if he comes in the night the old man went on his voice thickening ill  words seemed to fail him but he had clenched his hands on the cover of the book he had closed and his blue veins stood out in ugly fashion david sighed  yet notwithstanding his despair some measure of curiosity prompted a question  just why do you want to see him so much he asked  hate was the quiet reply  its twenty years since and ive a kind of craving to see him that much older  theres hate and love you know david  theyre both writ of here  but i tell you its hate that lasts the longest  love is like my flowers  look at themmy tall hollyhocks my bush roses my snapdragon there  they blossom and they fade and they lie deadwho knows where  and in the spring they come again or something like them  and hate he went on pointing to a spade which lay propped against the paling is like that lump of metal  its here winter and summer alike  it doesnt change it doesnt die theres no heat would melt it  it was there last year its there today it will be there tomorrow  david sighed and looked for a moment wearily away  the old man watched him anxiously  exercise had brought a slight flush to his pallid cheeks and an added brightness to his eyes  he sat his horse well and his tweed ridingclothes were fashionably cut  his uncles frown became deeper  youre young david he said and i know well that you and me look out on life full differently  but an oathan oaths a sacred thing eh  an oath is a sacred thing david repeated  ive never denied it  youll not flinch lad the old man persisted eagerly  i shall not flinch  then ride off now  theres no gain to either of us in talking here for your mind is set one way and mine another  youll have a score of years of youth left after youve done my behest  david paused with his foot in the stirrup withdrew it and returned to the paling  let me know the worst he begged  ive beggared your enemy for you ive soiled my conscience for the first time in my life  ive lied to and ruined the man who trusted in my word  what is this further deed that i must do  richard vont shook his head  when the time comes he promised you shall know  meanwhile let be  its a summer morning and you are but young make the most of it come when i send for you  so david rode off up the broad slopes of the great park along the wonderful beech avenue and out on to the highway  he turned in his saddle for a moment and looked towards the road from london     chapter xxiv  the marquis with an afterbreakfast cigarette in his mouth strolled out of his front door a few mornings later to find himself face to face with richard vont  he called letitia who was behind  the worst has happened he groaned  letitia stood by her fathers side and looked across the stone flags across the avenue with its central bed of gaycoloured flowers the ring fence the moat the few yards of park to where just inside his little enclosed garden richard vont was seated directly facing them  well you expected it didnt you father she observed  all the same the marquis declared with a frown its an irritating thing to have a man seated there within a hundred yards of your front door with a bible on his knee cursing you  i am convinced now more than ever that my case against this man must have been grossly mismanaged  the law could never permit such an indignity  letitia stepped back for a moment to light a cigarette  then she rejoined her father and contemplated that somewhat grim figure critically  if he is going to do that all the time the marquis went on i shall have nerves  i shall have to live in the back part of the house  letitia gravely considered the matter  why dont you try talking common sense to him she suggested perhaps a few words from you would make all the difference  he is probably sitting there with a gun her father sighed however its an idea letitia  ill try it  he strolled across the avenue through a little iron gate in the railings and across the moat by a footbridge  when he had approached within a dozen paces of the palings however richard vont rose to his feet  youre nigh enough lord mandeleys he called out nigh enough for your own safety  the marquis advanced with his usual leisurely and aristocratic walk to the edge of the palings  richard vont stood glaring at him like a wild beast but there was no signs of any weapon about  vont the former said we both have rights  this park is mine so far as your paling just as your garden is yours where you are  i have no fancy for shouting and i have a word to say to you  say it and begone then vont exclaimed fiercely  really the marquis expostulated you are behaving in a most unreasonable manner  i am here to discuss the past  for any wrong which you may consider i have done you i express my regret  i suggest to you that your daughters present position in life should reconcile you to what has happened  my daughters brains nor your money dont make an honest woman of her  the marquis sighed wearily  your outlook vont he said is full of prejudice and utterly illogical  i found qualities in your daughter which endeared her to me and she has lived a perfectly reputable and engrossing life ever since she left your home such a life as she could not possibly have lived under your roof or in this part of the world  in every way that counts she has prospered  therefore i ask you to reconsider the matter  i claim that any wrong i may have done you is expiated and i suggest that you abandon an attitude whichpardon meis just a little theatrical put aside that very excellent book or else read it as a whole and give me your hand  id cut it off first vont declared savagely  this is rank prejudice the marquis protested  it seems so to you belike was the scornful answer  you clever folk who can crowd your brain with thoughts and ideas from booksyouve no room there for the big things  youve so many little weeds growing up around that the flower doesnt count  nought that you can say about marcia can alter matters  id sooner have seen her married to the poorest creature on your land than to know that she has lived as your dependent for all these years  the marquis shook his head sorrowfully  youre an obstinate old man vont he said and a very selfish one you are wrapped up in your own narrow ideas and you wont even allow any one else to show you the truth  marcia has been happy with me she would have been the most miserable creature on earth married to a clod  ay shes been here to show herself vont muttered down in a motorcar in furs and silks like a creature from some world that i know not about  shes talked as youve talked  ive listened to the pair of you  i thrust my daughter out of the garden and bade her go away and learn the truth  and youwell i just take leave to say that as i cursed you nigh on a score of years ago and have cursed you in my heart ever since so i curse you now  but are you going to sit there every day doing it the marquis enquired a little irritably  this house and garden are mine richard vont replied stolidly although youve done your best to beggar me by taking them away  when i choose i shall sit here  when i choose i shall sit and watch you with your guests watch you morning noon and night  ive one wish in my heart hour by hour  maybe that wish will reach home marquis of mandeleys  if it does youll see them all in black along the churchyard path there and hear the doors of your vault roll open  youre a little mixed in your similes my friend the marquis remarked because you know if those things happento me i shall be the one person who doesnt hear them  still i gather that you are implacable and that is what i came to find out  what astonishingly fine hollyhocks he observed as he turned away  i must go and look at my own  for a moment there was tragedy in vonts clenched fists and fierce convulsive movement forward  the marquis however without a backward glance lounged carelessly away and finding letitia strolled with her to the walled garden  the man is impossible he proclaimed  it is obviously his intention to sit there and make himself a nuisance  well we get used to everything  i may get used to richard vont  letitia hesitated for a few moments  father she said there are certain subjects which are not as a rule mentioned but if you will permit me  the marquis stopped her  my dear please not he begged a little stiffly  remember if you will that i have little in common with the somewhat modern school of thought indulged in by most of your friends  there are certain subjects which cannot be discussed between us  let us hear what mr hales has to say  hat in hand the head gardener had hastened down to meet them and under his tutelage they explored his domain  his master murmured little words of congratulation  i have done my best your lordship the man observed but mr merridrew has been cruel hard on me for bulbs and seeds and plants and as to shrubs and young trees hell not have a word to say  the marquis nodded sympathetically  we may be able to alter that next year hales he promised  mr merridrew i know has had great trouble with the tenants for the last few quarters  next year mr hales we will see what we can do  the gardener once more doffed his cap and received the intelligence with gratified interest  over the top of the hill a small governess cart drawn by a fat pony came into sight and letitia waved her hand to the girl who was driving  its sylvia laycey she murmured  now how on earth can that child still be at broomleys if mr thain is really here  sylvia explained the matter as she drove into the great stableyard letitia walking on one side of her and the marquis on the other  of course weve left broomleys she told them but we are staying with the medlingcourts for three or four days  they asked us at the last moment  and then your letter came letitiajust in time  im simply crazy to come and stay with you  letitia you lucky girl  you are going to be here all the time  i am simply foolish about him  about whom letitia asked indifferently  why mr david thain of course  hes the nicest thing ive ever talked to  he lunched with us on thursdaybut of course youre in love with him too so therell be no chance for me  letitias laugh was half amused half scornful  if you are in earnest sylvia she said which doesnt seem very likely i can assure you that you need fear no rival  mr thain does not appeal to me  we have nevertheless found mr thain the marquis observed suddenly reminding them both of his presence a very agreeable and interesting acquaintance  sylvia made a little grimace  she thrust her arm through letitias and drew her off towards the lawn where some chairs had been brought out under a cedar tree  you are such a wonderful person letitia she said and of course your fathers a marquis and mine isnt  but i thought nowadays americans were good enough for anybody in the world if only they had enough money  both my father and i you see letitia observed are a little oldfashioned  i have never had any idea of marriage except with some one whose family i knew all about  of course sylvia declared i am a horrid radical and i think id sooner not know about mine  if mr thains antecedents were unmentionable i should adore him just the same but as i know your father would remind me in some very delicate fashion if he were here the situation is different  you dont mind talking about him do you letitia because thats what ive come for  well ill listen letitia promised as she settled herself in an easychair  i really dont know what i should find to say except that hes moderately goodlooking has quite nice manners and money enough to buy the whole county  you are fearfully severe sylvia sighed  of course ive been talking rot as i always do but we did find him charming letitia both daddy and i  he was so simple and unaffected and he drove me into fakenham and bought cutlets for our luncheon  when i come to think of it she went on with a look of horror in her face i believe he paid for them too  he can well afford to letitia laughed  the marquis came to them across the lawn  he held in his hand an open telegram  from grantham my dear he said to letitia  it appears that he is bored with town and proposes to come down tomorrow night instead of waiting until saturday  i have replied that he will be very welcome mrs foulds will really have to bestir herself  i have a line from caroline too to ask if she may stay for a couple of days on her way to harrogate  letitia rose to her feet  the cloud which had fallen upon her face was doubtless owing to housekeeping cares  the marquis shading his eyes with his hand was gazing across the park  really he remarked a little drily i shall have to hint to our new neighbour that turf which is several hundred years old is not meant to be cut up like prairieland  he sits his horse well though  sylvia jumped quickly up and letitia gazed in the direction which her father had indicated  david on his black horse was riding across the park towards broomleys     chapter xxv  the marquis as he sat at his study table after lunch was not inclined to regard his first day at mandeleys as a success  the only post of the day had been delivered and the letter for which he was waiting with an anxiety greater than he even realised himself was still absent  there was a letter however from mr wadham which afforded him some food for thought  it was a personal letter written by the head of the firm and he perused it for the second time with a frown upon his forehead   my dear lord mandeleys  i have ventured in your interests to do what my son tells me you yourself felt some hesitation in doingnamely i have made enquiry through a firm of stockbrokers who make a speciality of american oil shares as to the pluto oil company limited of whose shares you have made so large a purchase  i find that no development of this property has taken place very little if any machinery has been erected no oil has ever been discovered in the locality or upon the estate  may i beg of you that to avoid disastrous consequences you at once see your friend from whom you purchased these shares and endeavour to make some arrangement with him to take them off your hands as they were doubtless tendered to you by false representations  i am quite sure that i need not point out to your lordship that i write you this letter entirely without prejudice and in the interests of the mandeleys name and estates  there could be no possibility of the drafts executed by your lordship being met unless the shares themselves provided the funds which under the existing conditions appears impossible  respectfully yours   stephen wadham   the marquis looked out upon the lawn  there was in his memory too a recent and serious conversation with mr merridrew concerning the accumulating charges for dilapidations upon the property  he watched david playing croquet with sylvia laycey with a deepening frown upon his face glanced from them to where letitia sat apparently absorbed in a book which she was reading and from her he looked through a side window towards that hated little demesne across the moat where richard vont in his shabby brown velveteen suit with his white hair and his motionless figure seemed to dominate the otherwise peaceful prospect somehow or other both outlooks irritated him almost as much as his own mental condition  the hard pressure of circumstances was asserting itself in his mind  he found himself struggling against an insidious longing to see letitia in sylvias place  in his way he was superstitious  he even began to wonder whether that silent ceaseless hate that daily litany of curses could really in any way be responsible for the increasing embarrassments by which he was surrounded that great dumb anxiety which kept him with wideopen eyes at night and sent him about in the daytime with a constant wearing pain at his heart  he turned at last wearily away from the window rose to his feet opened the french doors which led out into the gardens and strolled across the lawn to where letitia was seated  she laid down her book and welcomed him with a smile which had in it just a shade of fatigue  our friend thain he observed seems to be a success with miss sylvia  letitia turned her head and watched them  sylvia has already confided to me her ardent admiration  the marquis sighed as he sank into a chair  letitia glanced at him a little anxiously  anything wrong dad  nothing that should depress one on such a wonderful day  it is more a state of mind than anything  you and i i fancy were both born a few hundred years too late  money again  he nodded  it is one of the most humiliating features of modern existence he declared to find the course of ones daily life interfered with by the paltry necessities of pounds shillings and pence  one inherits a great name he went on ruminatively great traditions an estate brimful of associations with illustrious ancestors  in ones daily life ones sense of dignity ones whole position is all the time affected i may say poisoned by the lack of that one commodity which is neither a proof of greatness or even deserving  we are very poor indeed letitia  she sighed  is it anything fresh  mr merridrew has been here this morning her father continued and has spoken to me very seriously about the condition of the whole estate  no repairs or rebuilding have been effected for years  the whole of the rents as they have been received have been required to pay interests on the mortgages  mr merridrew adds that he scarcely dare show himself before any one of the tenants to whose just demands he is continually promising attention  he considers that unless the whole of the next quarters rents are spent in making repairs we shall lose our tenants and the property itself will be immensely deteriorated  there are those shares that mr thain sold you she reminded him hopefully  you must take this for what it is worth he said  i have a private letter from mr wadham himself this morning in which he tells me frankly that he has received reports indicating that those shares are worthless  worthless letitia exclaimed bewildered  her father nodded  he begs me earnestly to appeal to mr thain to take them off my hands even if i could bring myself to contemplate such a step we should even then be faced with the fact that adopting mr merridrews views there are no funds to provide the interest on the mortgages next quarter day  letitia glanced once more uneasily towards david thain  worthless she repeated  i dont understand it father  do you really believe that mr thain would do you an ill turn like this  the marquis shook his head  i can conceive no possible reason for such an action he declared we have not injured him in any way  on the contrary we have at your aunt carolines solicitation offered him a hospitality somewhat rarely accorded by you and me dear to persons of his nationality and position  letitia made a little grimace  aunt caroline looks at him from a different point of view doesnt she  your aunt is intensely modern the marquis agreed  she is modern too without any real necessity  her outlook upon life is one which considering her descent i cannot understand  dont you think father letitia asked him squarely that however disagreeable it may be you ought to speak to mr thain about the shares  he could probably tell you something which would relieve your mind or he might offer to take them back  the marquis was silent for a moment  probably no one in the world except letitia knew how much it cost him to say the next few words  i will do so he promised  i will find an early opportunity of doing so  at the same time in the absence of any more definite information i prefer to retain my belief in their value  sylvia and david came strolling towards them  the former was looking almost distressed  letitia dear isnt it horrid she said  i must go now  i promised mrs medlingcourt that id be back to tea  she has some stupid people coming in  weve had such a wonderful game of croquet  i am quite sure i could make an expert of mr thain in a very short time  can i have my pony cart please letitia  and what time shall i come on thursday  we shall be ready for you any time you like letitia replied so please suit yourself  they all strolled round to see her start  she looked a little wistfully at the vacant place in the governess cart as she took her seat  i cant drop you at broomleys gate can i mr thain she asked  he shook his head smilingly  i should never dare to face your pony again he declared  bring your father over to see me and well mark out a croquet court at broomleys  well come she promised  she drove away  david too turned to take his leave  so nice of you to entertain our little visitor letitia said smiling graciously upon him  she is charming isnt she  quite he replied  ill show you a way into the park from the flower gardens she continued  it saves you a little  she led the way across the lawn very erect very graceful very indifferent  david walked by her side with his hands behind him  you must find these country pursuits a relaxation after your more strenuous life she observed  i find them very pleasant  tomorrow letitia told him my aunt arrives for a day or two  you are almost as popular with her you know as you seem to be with sylvia  the duchess he repeated  i did not know that she was coming here she was kind enough to ask me to go to scotland later on  you will be very foolish if you dont go then letitia advised the rossdale grouse moors are almost the best in scotland  aunt caroline is staying here for two days on her way to harrogate  you must dine with us on thursday night  she will be so disappointed if she does not see you at once  you are very kind lady letitia he said  i fear that i am inclined to encroach upon your hospitality  she picked a rose and held it to her lips for a moment  we must amuse aunt caroline she observed languidly  it is many years since she imposed herself as a visitor here  we dine at a quarter past eight  this is the gate  he passed through it and turned to make his farewells  her left hand was resting upon the iron railing her right supported her parasol she nodded to him a little curtly  you promised he reminded her that some day you would come over and help me about the garden  did i she answered  well remind me sometime wont you  why not now he persisted  she shook her head  i have to go and consult with mrs foulds as to where to put all our visitors  charlie grantham is coming with aunt i think and we have so many rooms closed up  dont fall into the moat  theres a bridge just to the left  she turned away and david watched her for several moments before he swung round  he was conscious of a sudden and entirely purposeless feeling of anger almost of fury  from the higher slopes of the park he turned and looked once more towards mandeleys  letitia had evidently forgotten her household duties  she had thrown herself back in her chair and was once more apparently engrossed in her book     chapter xxvi  david thain a few hours later lounged in a basket chair in the one corner of his lawn from which he could catch through the hedge of yew trees a furtive glimpse of mandeleys  by his side stood a small coffee equipage and an unopened box of cigars in the distance was the vanishing figure of the quietmannered and very excellent butler with whom a famous registry office had endowed his household  it was an hour of supreme ease  an unusually warm day was succeeded by an evening from which only the warmth of the sun had departed an evening full of scents from flowers and shrubs alike an evening during which the thrushes prolonged their music until from somewhere in the distant groves at the back of the house a nightingale commenced like the tuning up of an orchestra to make faint but sweet essays at continued song  it was as light as day but there were stars already in the sky and a pale colourless moon was there waiting for the slowly moving mantle of twilight  david thain was alone with his thoughts  they had started somewhere in the background in the first throb and excitement of life in the moment when his lips had framed that horrible oath which held him now in its meshes  then had come the real struggle years of brilliant successes the final coup the stepping in a single day on to one of those pedestals which a great republic keeps for her most worshipped sons  always it seemed to him that there was that old man in the background waiting  at last had come the question  yes he was ready  he had come to england a little protesting a little incredulous always believing that those fierce fires which had burned for so long in the greyhaired patient old man would have burned themselves out or would become softened by sentimental associations as soon as he set foot in his native place davids awakening was complete and disconcerting  the fury of richard vont showed no signs of abatement  he found himself committed already to one loathsome enterpriseand there was the future  he looked down gloomily at the magnificent pile below with its many chimneys its stretching front and farreaching wings and some echo of the bitterness which raged in the old man who sat and watched at its gates found an echo in his own heart  he remembered the amusement with which that subtle but absolutely natural air of superiority on the part of father and daughter alike had first imbued him  their very kindness the frank efforts of the marquis as well as of lady letitia to lead him into some channel of conversation in which he could easily express himself was the kindness of those belonging to another world and fearing lest the consciousness of it might depress their visitor  and with his resentment was mingled another feeling not exactly acquiescencehis american education had been too strong for thatbut admiration for those inherent gifts which seemed to bring with them a certain grace carried into even the smaller matters of life  perhaps he exaggerated to himself their importance as he sat there in the soft gathering twilight poured out his neglected coffee and still played with his unlighted cigar  the rooks had ceased to caw above his head some of the peace of night was stealing down upon the land  in the windows of mandeleys little pinpricks of light were beginning to show  the iron handgate which led from the park into his domain was suddenly opened and closed  the way led through a grove of trees and through another gate into the garden  he turned his head and watched the spot where the figure of his visitor must appear  it was curious that from the first although his common sense should have told him how impossible such a thing was he had an intuitive presentiment as to who this visitor might be  he laid down the unlighted cigar upon his table and leaned a little forward in his chair  first he heard footsteps falling softly upon a carpet of pine needles and yielding turf slowly too as though the movements of their owner were in a sense reluctant and then a slim tall figure in whitea familiar figure  he was up in a moment striding forwards  she had already passed through the gate however and was moving towards him across the lawn  lady letitia he exclaimed  she nodded  please dont look as though id done anything so terribly unusual she begged  what a pleasant spot you have chosen for your coffee  davids new treasure proved fully equal to the occasion  from some unseen point of vantage he seemed to have foretold the coming of this visitor and prepared to minister to her entertainment  lady letitia sank into her chair and praised the coffee  so much better than the stuff we have been trying to drink she told david  i must bring dad round one evening  he loves good coffee how beautiful your trees are  your trees he reminded her  she shrugged her shoulders  it seems ages since i was here she remarked  sylvia was away when we were down last and dad and colonel laycey were annoyed with one another about some repairs  you dont want any repairs do you mr thain  i have arranged to do whatever is necessary myself david told her in consideration of a somewhat reduced rent  i am glad you consider it reduced letitia observed  of course you think i am mad to come and see you like this dont you she added a little aggressively  not in the least he replied  i should not have ventured to have expected such a visit but now that you are here it seems quite natural  after all why isnt it she agreed  i walked round the garden once thinking about a certain matter in which you are concerned and then i walked in the park and it occurred to me that you would probably be sitting out here only a few hundred yards away just as you are doing and that you could if you would set my mind at rest  if i can do that he said i am very glad that you came  i am going to unburden my mind then she continued  it is about those shares you sold father mr thain  his manner seemed to her quick apprehension instantly to stiffen nevertheless he was expectant  he was willing to go through a good deal if only he could hear her voice for once falter if even her tone would lose its halfwearied halfinsolent note if she would raise her eyes and speak to him as woman to man  the pluto oil shares he murmured  well  of course father hadnt the least right to buy them she went on because we havent a penny in the world and he couldnt possibly pay for them unless they fetched as much when the payment fell due as he gave for them  i am rather stupid at these things mr thain but you understand  perfectly  her long fingers stole into the cigarette box  she accepted a light from him and leaned back once more in her chair  father she proceeded has the most implicit faith in everybody the fact that you are an american millionaire was ample proof to him that anything in the way of shares you possessed must be worth a great deal more than their face value  i do not know what led to his buying themyou probably do  did he asked for any assurances as to their intrinsic value  i warned him david said that they were entirely a speculation  he asked my advice as to some way of raising a large sum of money much larger than he could hope to gain by any ordinary enterprise  i presumed that he was willing to speculate and i suggested these shares they certainly are as speculative as any man could desire  are they worth any more now than when father bought them she enquired  to the best of my belief they have not moved he replied  as a matter of fact they have not yet had a chance to prove themselves  they are still worth a dollar a share then  they are worth a dollar a share as much as they were when your father bought them  she turned her head and looked at him  my father she said declines to ask you any questions  he would consider it in bad taste to suggest for a moment that he felt any uneasiness with regard to the necessary payment for them  he is none the less however worried  he was foolish enough to tell his lawyers about them and lawyers i am afraid have very little faith in him as a business man  the result of the enquiries they made was most depressing  it probably would be david assented  forty thousand pounds worth of shares letitia continued which are worth as much now as when my father bought them are i suppose nothing to you  i wondered whether you would object to have them back again  i think that it would relieve my fathers mind  thain was silent for a moment  he had lit a cigar now and was smoking steadily  you have not much idea of business lady letitia he remarked  business she repeated with a note of surprise in her tone  how should i have  there are certain matters of common sense and of honour which i suppose are common to every one of reasonable intelligence there did not seem to me to be any principle of business involved in this  supposing david said the shares had risen and were worth two dollars today you would not in that case i presume have honoured me with this visit  certainly not she replied  i did not sell those shares to your father as an act of philanthropy he continued  he asked me to show him a speculation and i showed him this  those shares so far as i know are as likely to be worth five times their value next week or nothing at all  i am a very large holder and it seemed to me that it would be a reasonable act of prudence to sell a few of them at a price which showed me a small margin of profit  profit she repeated wonderingly  are you in need of profit  it is the poison of wealth he observed  one is always trying to add to what one has  she turned her head and looked at him intently  for a moment she was almost startled  there was something unreal in the sound of his words something that was almost a foreboding chilled her  mr thain she said calmly  yes  had you any reasonany special reason i meanfor selling those shares to my father  his face was inscrutable  what reason should i have lady letitia  i cant imagine any she replied and yetfor a moment i thought that you were talking artificially  i probably did you an injustice i am sorry  davids teeth came together  there was lightning in his eyes as he glanced down through the trees towards vonts little cottage  dont apologise too soon lady letitia he warned her  she raised her eyebrows  i am not accustomed to think the worst of people she said  i can scarcely picture to myself any person already inordinately wealthy singling out my father as a victim for his further cupidity  let me return to the question which i have already asked you  would you care without letting my father know of this visit and my request to return his cheque or promissory note or whatever it was in exchange for these shares  i am not even sure lady letitia he reminded her after a moments pause that your father wishes this  you can i think take my word that it would be a relief to him she asserted  he pondered for a few moments  the light through the trees seemed to be burning brighter in vonts sitting room  i will be frank with you lady letitia he said  there has been no increase in the value of these shares  the news which i have expected concerning them has not arrived  the transaction therefore is one which at the present moment would probably entail a loss  do you wish me to make your father a present of twenty or thirty thousand pounds  she rose deliberately to her feet and shook the few grains of cigarette ash from her dress  the cigarette itself she threw into a laurel bush  i understand she remarked what you implied when you said that women did not understand business  her tone was unhurried her manner expressed no indignation  yet as she strolled towards the gate david felt the colour drained from his cheeks felt the wicker sides of his chair crash in the grip of his fingers  he rose and hurried after her  lady letitia he began impulsively  she turned upon him as though surprised  pray do not trouble to escort me home she begged  it isnt that he went on falling into step by her side  you make me feel like a thief  are you not a thief she asked  i have been told that nearly all very rich men are thieves  i begin to understand that it may be so  it is possible to juggle with money honestly he assured her  it is also possible i suppose she observed with faint sarcasm to lower the standard of honesty  thank you she added as she passed through the second gate you perhaps did not understand me  i should prefer to return alone  i am going your way he insisted desperately  my way she repeated  but there is nowhere to go to unless you are proposing to honour us with a call at mandeleys  i am going in to see old richard vont he said  she laughed in surprised fashion  what the old man who sits and curses us  is he a friend of yours  he was on the steamer coming home david reminded her  i told you so before  i take an interest in him  his point now was momentarily gained and he walked unhindered by her side  the soft twilight had fallen around them little wreaths of mist were floating across the meadows the birds were all silent  the pathway led through another narrow grove of trees  as they neared the gate letitia hesitated  i think it is just as near across the meadow she said  he held open the gate for her  you had better stay on the path he advised  the grass is wet and your shoes are thin  she looked into his face still hesitating  then she swiftly dropped her eyes  the man must be mad  nevertheless she seemed for a moment to lose her will  the gate had fastened behind them with a sharp click  they were in the grove  the way was very narrow and the fir trees almost black  there was only a glimpse of deep blue sky to be seen ahead and in front  the pigeons rustled their wings and a great owl lumbered across the way  something happened to letitia then which had never happened before  she felt both her hands gripped by a mans felt herself powerless in his grasp  lady letitia he exclaimed feverishly dont think im a fool  ill not ask for what you havent got to giveme  you shall have your fathers noteyou shall havefor himwhat will make him free if youll only treat me like a human beingif youll bekinda little kinder  her eyes flashed at him through the darkness yet he could see that one thing at least he had achieved  her bosom was rising and falling quickly her voice shook as she answered him  for the first time he had penetrated that intolerable reserve  are you mad she cried  are you trying to buy me  how else should i win even a kind glance he answered bitterly  you mistake me for a railroad system she mocked  i have never mistaken you for anything but a woman was the vibrating reply  the only trouble is that to me you always posture as something else  his hands were burning upon her wrists but she showed no resentment  is this the way she asked that americans woo  do they imprison the lady of their choice in some retired spot and make a cash offer for their affections  you are at least original mr thain  if i cant bring myself to ask you in plain words what i am craving for he answered hoarsely you can guess why  i know very well that there is only one thing about me that counts in your eyes  i know that i should be only an appendage to the money that would make your father happy and mandeleys free  and yet i dont care  i want youyou first and then yourself  you have some faith then in your eligibilityand your methods of persuasion she observed  havent i reason he retorted  you people here are all filled up with rotten timeexploded notions bound with silken bonds worshippers of false gods  you dont see the truthyou dont know it i am not sure that i blame you for its a beautiful slavery and but for the ugly realities of life youd prosper in it and have children just as wonderful and just as ignorant  but you see the times are changing  i am one of the signs of them  if this were an impersonal discussion letitia began struggling to compose her voice  but it isnt he broke in  i am speaking of you and of me and no one else  im fool enough to love you to be mad about you  fool enough to make you an offer of which any man with a grain of selfrespect should be ashamed  i quite agree with you she said smoothly  perhaps it will end this very interesting little episode if i tell you that i am engaged to marry lord charles grantham and that he is coming down tomorrow  he released her handsflung them from him almost  is this the truth he demanded  she laughed lightly  why on earth she asked should i take the trouble to tell you anything else  he pointed to the path  get on he ordered  she found herself obeying himwithout resentment even  when they reached the gate that led into the park he held it open and remained she hesitated for a moment  you are going to leave me to brave the perils of the rest of the journey alone she asked  he made no answer  she lifted her skirts a little for the dew was becoming heavier and made her graceful way down the slope and across the bridge to the postern gate  arrived there she looked round david thain had vanished back into the grove  letitia made her way into her own room and closed the door  she lit both of the candles upon her dressing table pulled back the lace of her sleeves and looked at her wrists  there were two red marks there red marks which as she stared at them seemed suddenly again to feel the iron pressure  she stared at them half in surprise without anger and yet with a curious emotion  suddenly she found that she was trembling obsessed with a strange yet irresistible impulse  she bent down and lightly kissed the flaming marks  then she blew out the candles threw herself into the easychair which earlier in the day she had drawn up to the window and looked steadily back into the park now fast becoming a phantasy of shadowland     chapter xxvii  the marquis with several account books and mr merridrew who had ridden over from his office on a motorbicycle had settled down to a laborious evening  the former for no particular reason was enjoying a slight relapse into his customary optimism  i am not without expectation the marquis commenced by explaining to his agent that at the end of the next two months i may find myself in possession of a large sum of money  under those circumstances it will not be a purposeless proceeding to work out what is really required in the way of repairs on the various farms  it will be a great pleasure for me to meet my tenants in any way possible  on the whole i consider that they have been very reasonable and loyal  mr merridrew agreed with his lordship agreed with him fervently  some of them he confessed have been very troublesome  a few of them have been driven to make some slight repairs themselves but on the whole your lordship it would be a great relief if one were able to assist them so far as regards positive dilapidations  the marquis dipped his pen in the ink and settled down to his task  at that moment however gossett knocked at the door opened it and advanced towards his master with a card upon a salver  the gentleman is staying at fakenham i believe sir and has motored over  the marquis lifted the card  mr james borden at first conveyed nothing to him  then he felt a sudden stab of memory  the gentleman wishes to see me he enquired  he begs to be allowed a short interview with your lordship gossett replied  you can show him into the library was the brief direction  mr merridrew he added turning to the agent you can proceed with the abstract without me  i shall return in time to go through the totals and learn the family records of the various tenantsi refer of course to those with which i am not acquainted  mr merridrew was quite sure that he could manage alone and settled down to his task  the marquis presently left him and crossed the great hall one of the wonders of mandeleys the walls of which were still hung with faded reproductions in ornate tapestry of mediaeval incidents  from somewhere amongst the shadows came gossett who gravely took up his stand outside the library  as though with some curious prescience of the fact that this was an unwelcome visitor his bow as he threw open the door was lower even than usual  shall i light the lamp your lordship he asked  the marquis glanced towards the oriel windows through which the light came scantily and at the figure of james borden advancing now from somewhere in the dim recesses of the rooman apartment which remained marvellously little altered since the days when it had contained the laboriously collected books of a franciscan order of monks  perhaps it would be as well gossett his master assented  you wish to see me he added turning towards his visitor  james borden had come posthaste from london acting upon an impulse which had swept him off his feet  all the way down he had been the prey to turbulent thoughts  a hundred different ways of conducting this interview had presented themselves before him with such facility that he had come to look upon it as one of the easiest things on earth yet now the moment had arrived he was conscious of an unexpected embarrassment  the strange tranquillity of the house and this stately apartment the personality of the marquis himselfserene slightly curious yet with that indefinable air of goodbreeding which magnifies the obligations of a hosthad a paralysing effect upon him  he was tonguetied uncertain of himself  all the many openings which had come to him so readily faded away  my name is borden he announced  i have come here hoping for a short conversation with you  the marquis made no immediate reply  he watched the lighting of a huge lamp which gossett silently placed in the middle of an ebony black writing table to the side of which he had already drawn up two highbacked chairs  is there anything else your lordship desires the man asked  not at present gossett  i will ring  the marquis pointed towards one of the chairs and seated himself in the other  i shall be very glad to hear of your business with me mr borden he said courteously  his visitor had lost none of his embarrassment  the marquis in his oldfashioned dinner clothes his black stock the fob which hung from his waistcoat his finely chiselled features and that mysterious air of being entirely in touch with his surroundings had him at a disadvantage from the first  borden was wearing the somewhat shabby blue serge suit in which he had travelled all day and which he had neglected to brush  he had been too much in earnest about his mission to do more than make the most hasty toilet at the hotel  the highbacked chair which suited the marquis so well was an unfamiliar article of furniture to him and he sat upon it stiffly and without ease  nevertheless he reminded himself that he was therehe must say what he had come to say  i am venturing to address you lord mandeleys he began upon a personal subject  the marquis raised his eyebrows gently  it was perhaps a suggestion of surprise that a personal subject should exist lending itself to discussion between him and this visitor  and before i go any further the latter continued i want to make it clear that i am here at my own initiative onlythat the other person interested is entirely ignorant of my visit  mr borden paused and the marquis made no sign whatever  he was sitting quite upright in his chair the fingers of his right hand toying lazily with an ancient paper knife fashioned of yellow ivory  nevertheless the speaker went on i wish to tell you that my visit is a sequel to a conversation which i had last night with miss marcia hannaway a conversation during which i asked her not for the first time to be my wife  the marquiss fingers ceased to trifle with the paper knife otherwise not a muscle of his body or a single twitch of the features betrayed any emotion  nevertheless his visitor realised for the first time that all his life he had had a wrong conception of this man  he knew quite well that he had altogether underrated the difficulties of his task  i am taking it for granted he proceeded that you are broadminded enough lord mandeleys to admit that we can discuss this or any other matter on terms of equality  i am unknown to you  my father was a dean of peterborough i was myself at harrow and magdalen  the marquiss fingers stretched out once more towards the paper knife  you mentioned i believe he said the name of a lady with whom i am acquainted  i am coming to that was the eager reply  i only wanted to have it understood that this was a matter which we could discuss as equals as man to man  i am so far from agreeing with you the marquis declared calmly that i prefer to choose my own companions in any discussion and my own subjects  it happens that you are a stranger to me  borden checked a hasty retort which he realised at once would have placed him at a further disadvantage  lord mandeleys he said i was at first miss hannaways publisher i have become her friend  i desire to become her husband  her whole story is known to me even from the day when you brought her away from the vont cottage and chose her for your companion  i have watched the slow development of her brain i know how much she has benefited intellectually by the forced seclusion entailed upon her by the conditions of your friendship  i realise however that the time has come when in justice to her gifts which have not yet reached fruition it is necessary that she should come into closer personal contact with the world of which she knows so little  she can attain that position by becoming my wife  really his listener murmured with a faint note of unruffled surprise in his tone  borden set his teeth  the task which had seemed to him so easy was presenting now a very different appearance  nevertheless he kept an iron restraint upon himself  i do not wish to weary you he went on by making a long story of this  i am fortyone years old and unmarried  marcia hannaway is the first woman whom i have wished to make my wife and i wish it because icare for her  i have been her suitor for nine years  during all that time she has given me no word of encouragement  i have never once until these last few days been permitted to dine alone with her nor been allowed even the privilege of visiting her at her home  the restrictions upon our intercourse have been i presume in obedience to your wishes or to marcias interpretation of them  if we could come the marquis said gently to the reason for this visit  the words supplied the sting that borden needed  i believe he declared that marcia hannaway in her heart wishes to marry me  i believe that she cares enough to marry me  only a short time ago she admitted it and within twelve hours i received a note retracting all that she had promised  there was a deep silence throughout the great room  the faces of the two mena little closer now for borden had moved his chairwere both under the little circle of lamplight  for a single second something had disturbed the imperturbability of the marquiss countenanceit seemed indeed as though some strange finger had humanised it had softened the eyes and drawn apart the lips  then the moment passed  are we nearing the end of this discussion mr borden  every word brings us nearer the end was the ready reply  i am going to tell you the truth as i feel it in my heart  marcia would be at her best in the life to which i should bring her  mentally spiritually and humanly as my wife she would be happier  she has refused me out of loyalty to you  are you suggesting the marquis enquired that i should intervene in favour of your suit  borden struck the table with the flat of his hand  damn it he exclaimed cant you talk of this like a man  dont you care enough for marcia to think a little of her happiness  i want you to let her goto let her believe whether it is the truth or not that she is not as she seems to think necessary to your life  come  life has its sacrifices as well as its compensations  youve had the best part of a wonderful womans life  i am not saying a word about the conditions which exist between you  i dont presume  if i did i should have to remember that marcia speaks always of your treatment of her with tears of gratitude in her eyes  but your time has come marcia has many years to live  there is something grown up within her which you have nothing to do witha little flame of genius which burns there all the time which at this very moment would be a furnace but for the fact of the unnatural life she is forced to lead as yourcompanion  now you ask what ive come for and you know  i want you to forget yourself and to think of the woman who has been your faithful and sympathetic companion for all these years  she hasnt come to her own yet  she cant with you  she can with me  write and thank her for what she has given you and tell her that for the future she is free  she can make her choice then unfettered by these infernal bonds which you have laid around her  the marquis turned the lamp a little lower with steady fingers  the necessity for his action was not altogether apparent  you suggest mr borden if i understand you rightly he said that i am now too old and too unintelligent to afford marcia the stimulating companionship which her gifts deserve  there cant be a great sympathy between you the other declared and to be brutal the place in life which she deserves and to which she aspires is not open to her under present conditions  you allude i presume the marquis said to the absence of any legal tie between miss hannaway and myself  i do borden assented  the world is a broadminded place enough but there are differences and backwatersi am not here to explain them to you  i dont need to  marcia hannaway married to her publisher going where she will thinking how she will meeting whom she will would be a different person to miss marcia hannaway living in isolation in battersea with nothing warm nor human in her life except  precisely the marquis interrupted with a little gesture which might have concealedanything  i am beginning to grasp your point of view mr borden  and your answer  i have no answer to give you sir  you have made certain suggestions which i may or may not be prepared to accept  in any case matters of so much importance scarcely lend themselves to decisions between strangers  i shall probably allude to what you have said when i see or write miss hannaway  youve nothing more to say to me about it then borden persisted a little wistfully  nothing whatever  you may possibly consider my attitude selfish the marquis added but i find myself wholly indifferent to your interests in this matter  i should be able to reconcile myself even to that was the grim reply if i have been able to penetrate for a single moment that accursed selfishness of yoursif i have been able to make you think for however short a time of marcias future instead of your own  the marquis rose without haste from his place and rang the bell  you will permit me mr borden he invited to offer you some refreshments  thank you i desire nothing  the marquis pointed to the door by which gossett was standing  that then i think concludes our interview he said with icy courtesy  mr borden walked the full length of the very long apartment suffered himself to be respectfully conducted across the great hall out on to the flags and into the motorcar which he had hired in fakenham  it was not until he was on his way through the park that he opened his lips and found them attuned to blasphemy  at the top of the gentle slope however where the car was brought to a standstill while the driver opened the iron gate he turned back and looked at mandeleys looked at its timeworn turrets its mullioned windows the norman chapel the ruined cloisters the ivycovered west wing the beautiful elizabethan chimneys  a strange heterogeneous mass of architecture yet magnificent in its way impressive almost inspiring  he looked at the little cottage almost at its gates from which a thin spiral column of smoke was ascending  perhaps in those few seconds and with the memory of that interview still rankling he felt a glimmering of real understanding  something which had always been incomprehensible to him in marcias story stood more or less revealed     chapter xxviii  the marquis if he had been a keen physiognomist might perhaps have read all that he had come to london to know in marcias expression as he made his unexpected entrance into her sitting room on the following day  she was seated at her desk with a great pile of red roses on one side of her and a secretary to whom she was dictating on the other she swung round in her chair and for a moment was speechless  she looked at her visitor incredulously a little helplessly with some traces of an emotion which puzzled him  her greeting however was hearty enough  she sprang to her feet and held out both her hands  my dear man how unlike you  really i think that i like surprises give me both your handsso  let me look at you  i should have warned you of my coming he said raising the inkstained fingers which he was clasping to his lips but to tell you the truth it was a caprice  i thought you were in the country at mandeleys she exclaimed  i was he replied  i have motored up from there this morning  i came to see you  she dismissed her secretary gazed at herself in the glass and made a grimace  and a nice sight i look  never mind  fancy motoring up from mandeleys  what time did you start  at six oclock he answered with a little smile  it was somewhat before my regular hour for rising  if you have no other arrangements i should be glad if you would take luncheon with me  bless the man of course i will she assented passing her arm through his and leading him to a chair  you are not looking quite so well as you ought to after a breath of country air  i am passing through a time of some anxiety he acknowledged  she remained on the side of his chair still holding his arm  the marquis sank back with a little air of relief  there seemed to be something different something warmer in the world  he was moved by a rare and unaccountable impulsehe drew her towards him and kissed her lips  i had a birthday last week he said with a very slight smile  i think that it affected me  one begins to wonder after one has passed middle age not what there is to look forward to but how much it is worth while enduring  of course she declared with a grimace youve been diving into musty old volumes at mandeleys and reading the mutterings of one of those primitive philosophers who growled at life from a cave  i have found myself a little lonely at mandeleys he confessed  but this visit to london she persisted  is it business  is there anything wrong  i came to see you  my head is going round she declared  this is wednesday  besides i thought you were going to stay away until i wrote younot that i wanted you to  i changed my mind he told her in consequence of a visit which i received yesterday from a mr james borden  she gave vent to an exclamation of dismay  you mean that jimmy has been down to see you  if jimmy and mr james borden are identical the marquis replied a little stiffly he undoubtedly has  she looked at him helplessly  oh dear she exclaimed how could he be so foolish  he wanted it seems the marquis continued to have what he called a mantoman talk  i am not the sort of person as you know marcia who appreciates mantoman talks with strangers  i listened to all that he had to say and because i gathered that he was your friend i was polite to him  that is all  he gave me to understand that he was your suitor  hed no right to tell you anything of the sort she declared but in a sense i suppose it is true  he wants me to marry him  its most fearfully unsettling  but that he should come to you  i wish he hadnt reginald  it appeared to me to be a quixotic action the marquis assented however indirectly it has been conducive of goodit has brought me a great pleasure  i have missed you very much marcia  i am very happy to be here again for however short a time  you are going back then to mandeleys  when we part directly after luncheon  i have guests arriving there tonightmy sister and grantham and i believe some others  but after my talk with borden or rather his talk to me i felt that i must see you  well ive missed you she confessed frankly  i seem to have had lots to do and i have been going to the theatres and i have quite made up my mind to write a play  but i have missed youshall i go and put on my hat  if you will he answered  we can talk in the car and at luncheon  the marquis watched her cross the room and sighed  at thirtynine he thought she was wonderfully young  her figure was a little more mature but in all other respects she seemed only to have found poise and assurance with the passing years  he leaned back in his chair almost with a sense of luxury  he was back again in the atmosphere which had kept him young the atmosphere which unconsciously had hung around him and kept him warm and contentedkept him too from looking over the edge into strange places  the room was deliciously feminine notwithstanding a certain fascinating disorder  there were magazines reviews and illustrated papers everywhere in evidence an open box of cigarettes upon the chimneypiece an armful of flowers thrown loose upon the table as well as the roses upon her desk  one of her gloves lay upon a chair by the side of a pile of proofs  it seemed to him that there were some new photographs on the mantelpiece but his own in the uniform of his county yeomanry still occupied the central position  there were songs upon the piano on the sideboard a silver cocktail shaker and as he noticed with a little pang two glasses nevertheless he sat there waiting in great content until marcia came in dressed for the street  she was followed by a servant with some ice upon a tray and bottles  now for my new vice she exclaimed gaily taking up the cocktail shaker and half filling it with ice  you are not going to be obstinate are you  i shall take anything you may give me with great pleasure he assured her a little stiffly  she saw him looking at the second glass and laughed  it is phyllis grant who is responsible for this she explained  she lives in the next flat you know and she comes in most days either before luncheon or before dinner for an apéritif and a cigarette  the marquiss face cleared  he drank his cocktail and pronounced it delicious  on the threshold he paused and looked back  i like your little room marcia he said  i find it a strange thing to confess but there is nowhere else in the world where i feel quite as much at home quite as contented as i do here  she seemed almost startled for a moment unresponsive  such a speech was so unlike him that it seemed impossible that he could be in earnest  she walked down the stairs by his side with a new gravity in her face  perhaps he noticed it  at any rate as soon as they were seated in the car he began to talk to her  the object of mr bordens visit to me i gathered was to impress upon me the fact that by marrying him you would gain many advantages from which you are at present debarred  i naturally made no comment nor did i argue the matter with him  i have come to you  she sat silent in her corner  her eyes were fixed upon a nursemaid with two or three young children passing by  suddenly she touched her companion on the arm and pointed to them  there is that you know she faltered  the marquis nodded  my great fear he continued is that sometimes i am too much inclined to treat you as a contemporary and to forget that you have never known those things which are a part of every womans life  i must give mr borden the credit for having had the good taste not to mention them  oh jimmy isnt a cad she answered but without mentioning them i cannot understand what he came to you for  as regards the other things you have spoken of i dont care a rap about them in fact i love my independence  i go where i choose i have found no one indisposed to make my acquaintance and the more i see of lifesuch life as comes to methe more i love it  when jimmr bordenuses such arguments he bores me  they are directly against him instead of for him  if i were mrs james borden people would leave cards upon me and i should have to eat dinners with fellowpublishers wives and exchange calls and waste many hours of my life in all the tomfoolery of middleclass respectable living  it doesnt appeal to me reginald  he is an idiot not to realise it  what does appeal to you then he asked  that she answered moving her head backwards  they crossed battersea bridge in silence  its such a silly ordinary problem she went on presently and yet its so difficult  its either now or never you know reginald  i shall say goodby to the thirties before long  it is your problem he said sadly not mine  she held his fingers in hers  if only when we were both so much younger she sighed we had had a little more courage  but i was so ignorant and there was so much else too to distract  i shall never forget our first few months of travelparis the riviera italy  i was impressionable too and i loved it all sothe colour and the beauty the rich warm stream of life after that wretched village school  i was so aching to understand and you were such a good tutor  you fed my brain wonderfully  oh i suppose i ought to be content  and i he murmured i too ought to be ready to creep into my own little shelter and be content withmemories  ah no she protested laying her hand upon his  if you feel like that it is endednow come this is a gala day  you have come so far to see me  i am seriously flattered  you must be starved too  not another word until we have lunched  at trewlys their entrance produced a mild sensation  their usual table was fortunately unoccupied  the manager himself welcomed them with many compliments  marcia glanced around her a little listlessly  there is something rather mausoleumlike about this restaurant in the daytime she declared  wont you take me somewhere else one day reginald  why not he answered  it is for you to choose  there are some queer foreign little places she went on hastily the things to eat perhaps are not so good but the people seem alive  there is an air here isnt there of faded splendour about the decorations and the people too  i will make enquiries the marquis promised  dont she begged  you must leave it to me  i will find somewhere and now let us be serious reginald  here we are come to rather a late crisis in our lives  tell me how much do i really mean to you  am i just a habit or have you really in the background memories and thoughts about me which you seldom express  he leaned across the table  i will confess he said that i have been surprised during the last few days to discover how much you do mean to me marcia  your quicker apprehension perhaps finds fault with me rebels against the too great passivity of my appreciation  you have been the refuge of my life  perhaps i have accepted too much and given too little  that is what may reasonably happen when there is a disparity in years and vitality as great as exists between us  what seemed to you to be habit marcia is really peace  i have forgotten what i should always have rememberedthat you are still young  her eyes glistened as she looked at him  a ray of sunshine which found its way through an overhead window was momentarily unkind  the lines under his eyes the wrinkles in his face the thinning of his hair were all a little more apparent  marcia was conscious of an unworthy a hateful feeling a sensation of which she was hideously ashamed  and yet though her voice shook there was still selfpity in her heart  i am so glad that you came she said  i am so glad that you have spoken to me like this  you need have no fear  those other things were born of just a temperamental fancy  they will pass  be to me just what you have been  i shall be satisfied  a cloud passed over the sun  his face was once more in the shadow and curiously enough her fancy saw him through strangely different eyes age seemed to pass although something of the helpless wistfulness remained  it was the pleading of a boy the eager hope of a child of which she suddenly seemed conscious  do you think that you can be happyas things are marcia he asked your friend mr borden doesnt think so  he came downhe was just a little melodramatic i thinkhoping to incite me to a great sacrifice  i was to play the part of the selfdenying hero  i was to give away the thing i loved for its own sake  i had no fancy for the rôle marcia  and i should hate you in it dear she assured him  mr james borden will always be a dear friend but he must learn what every one else in the world has had to learna lesson of selfdenial he will find some one else  i am not jealous of the man the marquis said  i am jealous of just one thought that his coming may have brought into your brainone instinct  dont be she begged  it will go just as it came  it is part of a womans nature i suppose  every now and then it tortures  luncheon was served excellently but without undue haste  they fell to discussing lighter topics  you will be interested to hear he told her that my daughter letitia is engaged to be married to charles grantham  i am quite expecting that by christmas i shall be alone  i find letitia a charming and dutiful companion he went on but i must confess that i look forward to her marriage with some satisfaction  it has occurred to me that if it suited your work we might travel for a time or rather settle downin italy if you prefer it  there is so much there to keep one always occupied  in florence for instance one commences a new education every spring  i should love it she answered with an enthusiasm which still lacked something  a villa somewhere on the slopes of fiesole he continued with a garden a real italian garden with fountains and statuary and straight paths and little strips of deep lawn and a few cypress trees  and there must be a view of florence  i think that you would work well there marcia  if things go as i expect i thought that we might leave england about christmastime and loiter a little on the riviera till the season for the cold winds has passed  browning wrote of the delights of an english spring but he lived in florence  there is so much there that i am longing to see again she murmured  you shall see it all he promised  if you wish you shall live with it  i do not know whether there is anything strange about me he went on after a moments hesitation but i must confess that i find myself a little out of touch with modern english life  the atmosphere of my sisters house for instance invariably repels me  the last generation was amused by the efforts of those without just claims to penetrate into the circles of their social superiors  today the reverse seems to be the case  the men and the women especially of my order seem to be perpetually struggling to imitate the manners and weaknesses of a very interesting but irresponsible world of bohemia  i find myself with few friends nowadays  the freedom and yet the isolation of foreign life therefore perhaps appeals to me all the more  but you would not care to leave mandeleys surely  my dear marcia he said i am possessed perhaps of a peculiar temperament but i can assure you that mandeleys is spoiled for me so long as thatthat ridiculous old manyou will forgive meyour father sits at the end of his garden invoking curses upon my head to every one except myself the humour of the situation is obvious  to me there is something else which i cannot explain  whether it is a presentiment a fear an offence to my dignity i cannot tell  i have spent all the spare money i have in the world trying to get that vont cottage back again into the family estates but i have failed  really your father might just as well have mandeleys itself  you know that i went to see him she asked  i remember your telling me that you were going he replied  my mission was a dismal failure she confessed  i felt as though i were talking to a stranger and he looked as though he were speaking to a jezebel  we stood in different worlds and called to one another over the gulf in different languages  perhaps the marquis sighed it is as well that he is your father the other morning i passed down the fencing gallery and examined my fathers collection of rifles  there was one there with a range of six hundred yards which was supposed in those days to be marvellous and some cartridges which fitted it  the window was open  you think marcia that i am too placid for impulses yet i can assure you that i slipped a cartridge into the magazine of that rifle closed it and knelt down before the open window  i held your father covered by the sight until i could have shrieked  then i turned away and fired at a log of wood in the park  i found the bullet afterwards half a foot deep in the centre of it  she shivered a little  for heavens sake dont go near that fencing gallery again she beggedyou see the time  he rose to his feet and they passed down the restaurant together outside the car was waiting  will you think me very discourteous he asked if i send you back in a taxicab  i shall be hard pushed as it is to reach home before my guests  of course she assented  he stood for a moment after she had taken her place in the vehicle with her hand in his  my visit he whispered has made me very happy  she looked at him through a mist of unexpected tears  come to me soon she begged a little abruptly  i shall want you  early next month he promised or if you send for me before  she seemed restless indisposed to let him go  i wish you werent going away at all she declared with unusual fervour  i wishcome back with me now wont you  do  for a moment he hesitated  he felt an extraordinary impulse to throw everything on one side and accept her invitation  the crisis passed however before he could yield  marcia with a little laugh became her normal self  what an idiot i am she exclaimed goodhumouredly  of course you must get down to mandeleys as quickly as you can  goodby  she threw herself back in the corner of the taxicab and waved her farewells  the marquis stood for a moment bareheaded upon the pavement  he watched the vehicle until it became lost in the stream of traffic  the impulse of a few moments ago was stronger than ever linked now too with an intolerable sense of depression  it was with an extraordinary effort of will that he took his place in his own car and motioned the chauffeur to proceed     chapter xxix  the duchess walked with letitia in the highwalled garden at mandeleys on the morning after her arrival  she appeared to be in a remarkably good temper  i have not the least intention of boring myself my dear letitia she said in reply to some conventional remark of her nieces  so long as i get plenty of fresh air during the day good plain food and my bridge between tea and dinner i am always contented  let me see she went on coming to a standstill and pointing with her stick to the little belt of tall elm trees and the fir plantation behind broomleys is that way isnt it  yes i can see the house  letitia nodded but only glanced in the direction her aunt indicated  and mr thain  do you find him a pleasant neighbour  letitia looked deliberately the other way  it was just as well that her aunt should not see the flash in her eyes  we do not see much of him she replied  he gallops round the park every day like a lunatic and he spends a great deal of time i think in his car  my dear the duchess said impressively david thain may have his peculiarities but he is really a most simple and sincere person  i was attracted to him upon the steamer simply because of his shyness and a good thing for you dear that i was  it must make quite a difference to have broomleys properly let to a man who can pay a good rent for it  we have never denied that letitia admitted drily  we are keeping house now upon the first quarters rent  is it my fancy her aunt continued stooping to pick herself a sprig of lavender or do you really dislike mr thain  intensely letitia confessed with emphasis  the duchess was surprised  well really she exclaimed  and to me he seems such a harmless inoffensive person absolutely without selfconsciousness and not in the least bumptious  what on earth has he to be bumptious about letitia scoffed  he has simply made a lot of money out of other people  that shows brains at least her aunt reminded her  cunning letitia retorted  the duchess twirled the sprig of lavender between her fingers  she could not remember ever to have heard her niece so much in earnest  well i hope you dont feel too strongly about him she said  i must have him asked to dinner while i am here  we have anticipated your wishes letitia remarked  he is coming tonight  i am very glad to hear it was the satisfied reply  i shall do my best to persuade him to come up to scotland later on  there is nothing that henry enjoys more than a little flutter in american railways perhaps he will help us to make some money  personally letitia said slowly i should be very careful how i trusted mr thain  the duchess was shocked  you carry your aversions too far my dear she remonstrated  perhaps i only know that he sold father a lot of shares which it is my profound conviction are entirely worthless  sold your father shares the duchess repeated  i dont understand how on earth could reginald pay for any shares  he gave what is called an acceptance letitia explained  it falls due in about six weeks  the duchess smiled  she had a great idea of her own capacity for business  my dear she said if between now and then the shares have not improved sufficiently for your father to make a profitable sale mr thain can extend the time of payment by renewing the bill  you have more confidence in mr thain than i have letitia remarked drily  her aunt was a little puzzled  she decided to change the conversation  where is charles this morning she enquired  in the library with father  they are discussing possible settlements i thought that sort of thing was always left to lawyers  i hope you are happier about your marriage than you seem her aunt observed  charles is quite a parti in a way you know although he is not rich  oh i suppose it may as well be charles as any one else letitia assented a little drearily  the duchess shook her head  you need a change my dear she declared  i hate to hear you talk like that especially as you are by way of being one of those singleminded young persons who must find everything in marriage or else be profoundly unhappy  i am not at all sure that you ought to have considered the question of marriage until you were in love  thank you letitia retorted i have a horror of being an old maid  her aunt sighed  now i come to think of it she went on reminiscently there is a curious streak of fidelity isnt there in your fathers character you must take after him  it ought to make you very careful letitia i dont want to say a word against charles but he doesnt carry his head quite so high as you do you know  when are you going to announce your engagement  as soon as he leaves here i think  hm  is charlie very much in love with you  if he is he hasnt mentioned it letitia observed  nowadays men seem to reserve that sort of protestation for their musical comedy friends and suggest a joint establishment as a matter of mutual convenience to us  bitter my dearvery bitter for your years her aunt sighed  what would you like to do this morning letitia asked abruptly changing the subject  i shall amuse myself was the prompt reply  first of all i am going to undertake a little mission on reginalds account  i am going over to talk to that ridiculous old man vont  afterwards i shall walk across to broomleys  most improper letitia remarked  my dear her aunt reminded her i am nearly forty years old although no one in the world would guess it if it were not for those wretched court guides  i look upon mr thain as a sort of protégé of mine and i have an idea that you are not being so nice to him as you might be  i do my best letitia replied and i really dont think he has anything to complain of  the duchess parted from her niece as they neared the house and proceeded to pay her first visit  she crossed the moat by the little handbridge walked briskly across the intervening strip of park and approached the little enclosure in which the cottage was situated richard vont seated in his usual corner of the garden remained motionless at her approach  he neither rose nor offered any sort of greeting  good morning vont she said briskly as she reached the paling  he was looking at her fixedly from underneath his bushy grey eyebrows he sat bolt upright in his chair and he kept his hat upon his head  what do you want he demanded  my good man she remonstrated you might as well be civil  why dont you stand up and take off your hat  you know who i am  yes i know who you are he replied without moving  you are caroline duchess of winchester  i keep my hat upon my head because i owe you no respect and i feel none  as to asking you in no one of your family will ever of my will step inside these palings  you are a very obstinate old man vont she said severely  i am what the lord made me  well she continued leaning slightly against the paling and looking down at him i came down here to say a few words to you and i shall say them unless you run away  you are one of those simple ignorant men vont who love to nurse an imaginary injustice until the idea that you have been wronged becomes so fixed in your brain that you havent room for anything else there  this behaviour of yours you know is perfectly ridiculous  vont made no sign even of having heard her  she continued  you havent even a grievance  my brother took your daughter away from her home  under some conditions that would have been a very reprehensible thing  as things turned out it has been the making of the young woman  she has received a wonderful education has been taken abroad and has been treated with respect and consideration by every one  my brother has devoted a considerable portion of his lifetime to ensuring her happiness  she is now a contented clever talented and respected woman  if she had remained here she would probably have become the wifedrudge of a farmer or a local tradesman you are listening richard vont  yes i am listening  if the marquis had betrayed your daughter taken her away and deserted her she continued there might have been some justification for this theatrical attitude of yours  under the present circumstances there is none at all  why dont you rid yourself of the idea once for all that you or your daughter have suffered any wrong  youve only a few years to live  take up your work again  there is plenty to be done here  go and mix with your old friends and live like a reasonable man this brooding attitude of yours is all out of date  put your bible away light a pipe and set to work and kill some of the rabbits  the farmers are always complaining  you have a niece up yonder vont said knitting his shaggy grey eyebrows and gazing steadfastly at his visitor a welllooking young woman they saylady letitia thursford  would you like her to live with a man and not be married to him  of course the duchess replied that is simply impertinent  if you are going to compare the doings of your very excellent yeomen stock with the doings of the thursfords you are talking and thinking like a fool  a few hundred years ago it would have been your duty to have offered your womenkind to your master when you paid your rent  we have changed all that quite properly but not all the socialists who ever breathed or all the democratic teachings you may have imbibed in america can entitle you to talk of the vonts and the thursfords in the same breath  the old man rose slowly to his feet  he leaned a little upon his stick and pointed to mandeleys  you are an ignorant shameless woman he said  get you home and read your bible  if you want a last word to carry away with you here it is  my daughter was just as much to me as the young woman who walked yonder with you in the garden is to her father  let him remember that  but you foolish person she expostulated lady letitia enjoys all the advantages to which her station entitles her  your daughter with a mind and intelligence very much superior to her position was employed in the miserable drudgery of teaching village children  honest work he replied hurts no one unless they are full of sickly fancies  its idleness that brings sin  they tell me youve new creeds amongst those in your walk of life and a new manner of living  live as you will then but let others do the same  i stand by the book and maybe when your last days come you will be sorry you cast it aside  so far as i remember she reminded him the chief teaching of that book is forgiveness  your memory fails you then he answered grimly for what the book preaches is justice to poor and rich alike  the duchess sighed  she was a goodhearted woman and full of confidence but she recognised her limitations  my good man she said i shall not argue with you any more  you wont believe it but you are simply narrow and pigheaded and obstinate and you wont believe that there may be a grain of reason in anybody elses point of view but your own  just look at yourself  you cant be more than sixtyfive or so and you might be a hundred  you sit there nursing your grievance and thinking about it while your whole life is running to seed  why dont you get up and be a human being  send for your daughter to come down and look after youshed comeand choke it all down  put the book away for a time or read a little more of the new testament and a little less of the old  come will you be sensible and ill come in and shake hands with you and well write your daughter together  vont was still leaning on his stick  save that his eyebrows were drawn a little closer together his expression was unchanged  yet his visitor though the sunshine was all around them shivered  did he send you here  of course not she replied  i came of my own accord  i remembered the days when you used to take me rabbiting and let me shoot a pheasant if there was no one about  you were a sensible wellbalanced man then  i came hoping to find that there was a little of the old richard vont left in you  there is just enough of the old richard vont left he said to send you back to where you came from with a message if you care to carry it  tell himyour brother the lord of mandeleysthat i am not sitting here of idle purpose that i dont hear the voices around me for nothing that i dont look day and night at mandeleys for nothing tell him to make the most of the sun that shines today and the soft bed he lies on tonight and the woman he kisses tomorrow for he is very close to the end  i am an old man but im here to see the end it has been promised  the duchess brimful of common sense and good humour brave as a lion and ready of tongue as she was felt a little giddy and clung to the rail as she crossed the little bridge over the moat  she looked back only once  richard vont remained standing just as she had left himgrim motionless menacing     chapter xxx  the marquis glanced at the note which was handed to him at luncheon time frowned slightly and handed it across to letitia  what have you people been doing to thain he asked a little irritably  he doesnt want to come to dinner  the duchess and sylvia who had just arrived on her projected visit made no attempt to conceal their disappointment  letitia picked up the note and read it indifferently  i am very sorry aunt she said  i gave him all the notice i could  there is perhaps some misunderstanding the marquis remarked  in any case he would not know that you were here for so short a time caroline  after luncheon i will walk across and see him  i will go with you the duchess decided  i should like to see broomleys again  as a matter of fact i meant to go there this morning but i found one call enough for me  they took their coffee in the garden  letitia followed her father to a rose bush which he had crossed the lawn to examine  dad she asked passing her hand through his arm have you had any good news  he shook his head  why  because you look so much better  i think that motoring must agree with you  he patted her hand  i rather enjoyed the drive he admitted  as a matter of fact perhaps i am better he went on  you havent any good news about the shares i suppose she asked hesitatingly  for a moment he was grave  i have no news at all he confessed or rather what news i have is not good  i put an enquiry through an independent firm of stockbrokers with whom i have had some transactions and their reply coincided with the information already afforded to me  letitia glanced across the park and her face darkened  has it ever struck you she asked that there is something peculiar about mr thain in his attitude towards usas a family i mean  the marquis shook his head  on the contrary he replied i have always considered his deportment unimpeachable  letitia hesitated pulled a rose to pieces and turned back with her father towards where the duchess was reclining in a wicker chair  i dare say its my fancy  why dont you all go she suggested and take mr thain by storm  he can scarcely resist you aunt and sylvia  why dont you come yourself the duchess asked  my duty lies here letitia observed with a little smile towards grantham who had just strolled up with sylvia  the duchess rose to her feet  dear me yes she acquiesced  you two had better go off and have a long country walk  if i sit for long after luncheon i always go to sleep so come along reginald well beard the lion in his den  the marquis glanced towards sylvia but she shook her head  i must see after my unpacking she said but i should very much like mr thain to come  do try to persuade him  the duchess and her brother strolled up the garden and out of the postern gate into the park  thats a terrible old man of yours reginald the former observed glancing over her shoulder  i never came across such a person off the boards at drury lane  he is an infernal nuisance the marquis grumbled  it seems absurd but he gets on my nerves  day by day there he sits wet or fine  you cant see his lips move but you can always feel sure that he is hunting up choice bits of damnation out of the old testament and hurling them across at me  i have come to the conclusion his sister decided that he is out of his mind  an ignorant man who lives with one idea all his life is apt to lose his reason  he has never attempted any violence has he  never the marquis replied but since you have mentioned it caroline i always have a queer sensation when i am that side of the house  it is just about the distance to be picked off nicely with a rifle  i cant think why he doesnt do itwhy he contents himself with abuse  i am going to consult mr thain about him his companion said  a man of his robust common sense is much more likely to influence a lunatic like vont than you or iso this is where our millionaire hermit is hidden she went on as they reached the gate  dear me the place has changed  it will soon be in order again the marquis observed  thain has a dozen men at work in the grounds and he is having the rooms done up one by one  he lives in the library i think and the bedroom over it  they passed through the plantation and into the gardens  thain was there talking to one of the workmen  he came to meet them with a somewhat forced smile of welcome upon his lips  this is very unexpected he declared as he shook hands  i should have called upon you this afternoon duchess  i should think so she replied severely  will you be so good as to tell me at once what you mean by refusing my nieces invitation to dine  he hesitated for a moment then he smiled  there was something very attractive about his visitors frank directness of speech and manner  i refused he admitted glancing around to where the marquis was engaged in conversation with a gardener because i didnt want to come  but i am there you stupid person she reminded him  you are invited to dine with me  i know you dont get on with lady letitia and i know you dont like large parties but there are only half a dozen of us there and i promise you my whole protection  show me something at once  i want to talk to you  those dorothy perkins roses will do at the other end of the lawn  he walked in silence by her side  she waited until they were well out of earshot  david thain she said have i shown an interest in you or have i not  you have been extraordinarily kind he confessed  and in return she continued you have decided to avoid me  i wont have it  are you afraid that i might want you to make love to me  he shook his head  i am sure you wouldnt find that amusing he declared  in the society of your sex i generally behave pretty well as your brother would do if he were dumped down in an office in wall street  i honestly believe that you are diffident she admitted  i never met a millionaire before who was and at first i thought it was a pose with you  perhaps i was mistaken  you really dont think then that you have any attraction apart from your millions  im quite sure that i havent he answered bitterly  a love affair she exclaimed looking into his face scrutinisingly and i knew nothing of iti your sponsor your lady confessor yourwell heaven knows what i might not be if you would only behave decently  a love affair indeed  that little yellowhaired chit i suppose who is down here raving about you all the timesylvia whatshername  he smiled  i know very little of miss sylvia laycey he said beyond the fact that she seems very charming  i suppose you ought to marry she continued regretfully  it seems a pity but theyll never leave you alone till you do  what is your type then  sylvia laycey is much too young for you  i suppose you know that  i dont think i have one he answered  thats because i am married of course she went on  if you were a sensible man you would settle down to adore me and not think of anybody else at all  but you wont do it  youll want to buy palaces and yachts and town houses and theatres like all the rest of the superfluously rich and youll want a musical comedy star to wear your jewels and a wife to entertain your friends  well you must admit that i havent been in a hurry about any of these things yet he observed  she looked at him keenly  look here my young friend she said you havent made the one mistake i warned you against have you  you havent fallen in love with letitia  he laughed almost brutally  i am not quite such a fool as that he assured her  well i should hope not she enjoined severely  besides as a matter of fact letitia is engaged  her young man is staying at mandeleys now  just answer me one question davidwhy did you refuse that invitation to dinner  because i didnt feel like coming he answered  i thought it would probably be a large party most of them neighbours and every one would have to make an effort to entertain me because i am a stranger and dont know their ways or anything about them  there you are again she exclaimed  just as sensitive as you can be for all your millions  youll come davidplease  of course i will if you ask me like that he assented  she turned to her brother who was approaching  success she announced  mr thain has promised to dine  he refused under a misapprehension  we are delighted the marquis said  at a quarter past eight mr thain     chapter xxxi  gossett in the country was a very different person from gossett in grosvenor square  an intimate at mandeleys was not at all the same thing as a caller in town and david found himself welcomed that evening with a grave but confidential smile  the drawingroom here is closed for the present sir he observed after he had superintended the bestowal of davids coat and hat upon an underling  we are using the gallery on the left wing  if you will be so kind as to come this way  david was escorted into a long and very lofty apartment cut off from the hall by some wonderful curtains obviously of another generation the walls were hung with pictures and oldfashioned weapons  at the far end was a small stage and at the opposite extremity a little box which had apparently at some time been used by musicians  some large beech logs were burning in an open fireplace  the room contained nothing in the way of furniture except a dozen or so oldfashioned chairs and a great settee  these large rooms gossett explained get a little damp sir so his lordship desired a fire here  he had scarcely disappeared when a door which led into the gallery was opened and lady letitia came slowly down the stairs  the place was lit only by hanging lamps and davids impression of her as he turned around were a little unsubstantial  all the way down the stairs and across that strip of floor it seemed to him that he could see nothing but her face  she carried herself as usual there was all the pride of generations of mandeleys in her slow unhurried movements and the carriage of her head  but her facedavid gripped at the back of one of the tall chairs  he made at first no movement towards her  this was the face of a woman into which he looked  the change there was so complete that the high walls seemed to melt away  it was just such a vision as he might have conceived to himself  her words checked the fancies which were pouring into his brain  he became again the puzzled but everyday dinner guest  i am very glad that you have come mr thain she said giving him her hand and i am very glad indeed to see you alone even if it is only for a moment because i feelperhaps it is my thoughts that feelthat they owe you an amende  you are very kind he replied a little bewildered  i am glad to be here  what have you ever done which needs apology  i spoke of my thoughts she reminded him with a little smile  what i once thought or rather feared i am now ashamed of and now that i have told you so i am more at ease  she stood up by his side little flashes of firelight lighting her soft white skin gleaming upon the soft fabric of her gown  she wore no ornaments  the mandeleys pearls generally worn by the unmarried women of the family were reposing in the famous vaults of a west end pawnbroker  her strong capable fingers were innocent of even a single ring although upon her dressing table there was even at that moment reposing a very beautiful pearl one concerning which she had made some insignificant criticism with only one object an object which she refused to admit even to herself  david remained silent through sheer wonder  he had a sudden feeling that he had been admitted even if for only these few moments into the inner circle of her tolerationperhaps even more than that  i hurried down she explained just to say these few words and i see that i was only just in time  the curtain had been raised without their noticing it and the duchess with grantham by her side had entered  there was a slight frown upon the latters forehead the duchess was humming softly to herself  well sir anthony so youve kept your word she said to david when he had shaken hands with grantham  i can see quite well what the country is going to do for you unless you are looked after  the amiable misanthrope is the part you have in your mind  gracious motors outside  have we got a party letitia  letitia who to davids keen observation seemed already to have lost something of that strange new quality which she had shown to him only a few moments ago shook her head  the vicar and mrs vicar and the turnbulls and sylvias father  i am not going to be bored the duchess declared firmly  i insist upon sitting next to mr thain  how pretty sylvia looks  and what a becoming colour  now listen to me david thain she went on drawing him a little on one side you are not to flirt with that child  its like shooting them before they begin to fly  you understand  not guilty david protested  i can assure you that i am a passive victim  silly little goose the duchess murmured under her breath waiting there for you to go and speak to her with all sorts of sentimental nonsense shining out of her great eyes too  i shall go and talk to old general turnbull till the gong goes  why we cant have dinner punctually with a small party like this i cant imagine  sylvia was certainly glad to welcome david  her father came up in a few moments and shook hands heartily  still buy your own cutlets eh mr thain he asked  jolly good cutlets they were too  i suppose you have a housekeeper and all sorts of things sylvia laughed and live in what they call regal magnificence  davids protest was almost eager  i have a man and his wife who came down with me from london he said and one or two servantsvery few i can assure you  wont you come and try my housekeeping colonel before you move on and bring miss sylvia  with pleasure my boy the colonel declared  we leave for town next saturday  any day between now and then that suits sylvia  dinner was announced and david found himself placed at a round table between the duchess and sylvia  the former looked around the banqueting hall with a shiver  reginald she protested why on earth do you plant us in the middle of a vault like this  why on earth not open up some of the smaller rooms  the marquis smiled deprecatingly  his extreme pallor of the last few days had disappeared  he seemed younger and his tone was more alert  this room is really a weakness of mine he confessed  i like a vaulted roof and i rather like the shadows  it isnt damp if that is what you are thinking of caroline  we have had fires in it ever since we came downtimber being the only thing for which we dont have to pay he added  it makes one feel so insignificant the duchess sighed  if you were dining fifty or sixty people of course i should love it but a dozen of uswhy we seem like spectral mites  look at old granduncle philip staring at us she went on gazing at one of the huge pictures opposite  pity you cannot afford to have electric light here reginald and have it set in the frames  a most unpleasant idea her brother objected  confess now if you could see two rows of ancestors all illuminated looking at you while you ate wouldnt it make you feel greedy  the conversation drifted away and became general  the duchess leaned towards her neighbour  i think i am rather sorry i came here she whispered  why he asked  because i find you disappointing  i thoroughly enjoyed discovering you upon the steamer  you were delightfully primitive an absolute cavedweller but you quite repaid my efforts to make a human being of you  you were really almost as interesting when we first met in london  and now i dont know what it is but you seem to have gone thousands of miles away again  you dont seem properly human  dont you like women or have you got some queer scheme in your head which keeps you living like a man with his head in the clouds  or are you in love  i havent settled down to idleness yet perhaps he suggested  of course she went on you ought to be in love with me and miserable about it but i am horribly afraid you arent  i believe you have matrimonial schemes in your mind  i believe that your affections are so welltrained that they mean to trot all along the broad way to st georges hanover square  and would you advise something different he asked bluntly  my dear man why am i here she expostulated  i have a fancy for having you devoted to me  what i mean to do with it when i have captured your heart i am not quite sure  every one was listening to a story which old general turnbull was telling  even sylvia had leaned across the table  david turned and looked steadily into his companions face  it seems to me he said that only a very short time ago duchess out of solicitude for my extreme ignorance you warned me against setting my affections too high  i was speaking then of marriage she replied coolly  i see  and yet he went on i am not quite sure that i do see  is there any radical difference between marriage and a really intimate friendship between a man and a woman  she smiled  her slight movement towards him was almost a caress  my dear unsophisticated cavedweller she murmured  marriage is an alliance which lasts for all time  it is apt is it not to leave its stamp upon future generations  great friendships have existed amongst people curiously diverse in tastes and temperament and position  a certain disparity in fact is rather the vogue  i begin to understand he admitted  that accounts for the curious club stories which one is always having dinned into ones ears hatefully uninteresting though they are of lady soandso entertaining a great fiddler at her country house or some other society lady dancing in a singular lack of costume for the pleasure of artists in a borrowed studio  you are not nearly so niceminded as i thought you were the duchess snapped  it is just my painful efforts to understand he protested  any one but an idiot would have understood long ago she retorted  david turned to his lefthand neighbour  the duchess is being unkind he said  will you please take some notice of me  id love to she replied  i was just thinking that you were rather neglecting me  i want to know all about america please and american people  i am afraid he told her that i know much more about america than i do about american people  all my life since i left harvard i have been busy making money  i never went into society over there  i never accepted an invitation if i could help it  when i had any time to spare i went and camped out up in the adirondacks or further afield still when i could  we had lots of sport and we were able to lead a simple life well away from the end of the cable  and you killed bears and things i suppose she said  how lucky that you are fond of sport  it makes living in england so easy  he smiled  i am not so sure he confessed that i should consider england quite so much of a sporting country as she thinks herself  what heresy the marquis exclaimed leaning forward  of course i didnt know that i was going to be overheard david said goodhumouredly but i must stick to it  i mean of course sport as apart from games  shooting the marquis queried  i am afraid i dont consider that shooting at birds half of them handreared is much of a sport david continued  have you ever tried pigsticking or lying on the edge of a mountain after three hours tramp watching for the snout of a bear  letitia had broken off her conversation with lord charles and was leaning a little forward  the marquis nodded sympathetically  hunting then  david smiled  you gallop over a pastoral country on a highlytrained animal with a pack of assistant hounds to destroy one miserable verminous creature he said  of course you take risks now and then and the whole thing looks exceedingly nice on a christmas card but for thrills for real intense excitement i prefer the mountain ledge and the bear or the rounding up of a herd of wild elephants  mr thain preserves the instincts of the savage the duchess observed as she sipped her wine  perhaps he may be right civilisation certainly tends to emasculate sport  the sports to which mr thain has alluded the marquis pointed out are the sports of the stayathome englishman  most of our younger generationthose whose careers permitted of ithave tried their hand at big game shooting  i myself he continued reminiscently have never felt quite the same with a shotgun and a stream of pheasants since a very wonderful three weeks i had in my youth tiger hunting in indiai see that letitia is trying to catch your eye caroline  the women left the room in a little group their figures merging almost into indistinctness as they passed out of the lighted zone  davids eyes followed letitia until she had disappeared  then he was conscious that a servant was standing with a note on a salver by his side  this has been sent down from broomleys sir the man explained  david took it and felt a sudden sinking of the heart  the envelope was thin square and of common type the writing was painstaking but irregular  there was a smudge on one corner a blot on another  david glanced at the marquis who nodded and immediately commenced a conversation with grantham  he tore open his message and read it   the time has arrived  i wait for you here   he crushed the halfsheet of notepaper in his fingers and then dropped it into his pocket  there is no answer he told the servant     chapter xxxii  grantham who had been unusually silent throughout the service of dinner slipped away from the room a few minutes before the other men he found letitia arranging a bridge table and drew her a little on one side  letitia he said i am annoyed  my dear charles she replied was anything ever more obvious  you perhaps do not realise he continued that you are the cause  she shrugged her shoulders  well  in the first place he complained you are not wearing my ring  i thought i told you she reminded him that i would prefer not to until we formally announced our engagement  why on earth shouldnt we do that at oncethis evening he suggested  i can see no reason for delay  i on the other hand have a fancy to wait she replied carelessly at least until your visit here is over  your hesitation is scarcely flattering he remarked with some irritation  is there anything else you wish to say she enquired  i really must get out those bridge markers  he began to show signs of temper  watching him closely for the first time letitia decided that he had most unpleasantlooking eyes  i should like to know the subject of your conversation with that thain fellow when i came in this evening he demanded  i am sorry she said coolly  we were speaking upon a private subject  the anger in his eyes became more evident  private subject  you mean to say that you have secrets with a fellow like that  a fellow like that she repeated  you dont like mr thain then  like him  i dont like him or dislike him  i think he ought to be very flattered to be here at alland you are the last person in the world letitia i should have expected to find talking in whispers with him with your heads only a few inches apart  i feel quite justified in asking what that confidence indicated  letitia smiled sweetly but dangerously  and i feel quite justified she retorted in refusing to answer that or any similar question  are you going to play bridge charlie  no he replied turning away  i am going to talk to miss laycey  sylvia was quite willing and they soon established themselves on a settee  the duchess rather against her inclinations was included in the bridge quartette  letitia having disposed of her guests strolled over towards david who was standing with his hands behind him gloomily studying one of the paintings  i must show you our vandykes mr thain she said leading him a little further away  when these wonderful oil shares of yours have made us all rich we shall have little electric globes round our old masters  until then i find it produces quite a curious effect to try one of these  she drew an electric torch from one of the drawers of an oak cabinet and flashed a small circle of light upon the picture  thain gave a little exclamation  the face which seemed to spring suddenly into life looking down upon them with a faintly repressed smile upon the mandeleys mouth presented an almost startling likeness to the marquis  fearfully alike all our menkind arent they she observed lowering the torch  come and i will show you a lely  they passed further down the gallery  she looked at him a little curiously  is it my fancy she asked or have you something on your mind  the note which reached you contained no ill news i hope  i dont know he answered with unexpected candour  i have a great deal on my mind  i am so sorry she murmured  they had reached the further end of the gallery now  she sank into the window seat and made room for him by her side  for a moment he looked out across the park  in the moonless night the trees were like little dark blurs the country rose and fell like a turbulent sea  and very close at hand ominously close at hand as it seemed to him a bright light from richard vonts cottage was burning steadily  let me ask you a question he begged a little abruptly  supposing that you had given your word of honour solemnly in return for a vital service rendered to commit a dishonourable action what should you do  well that is rather a dilemma isnt it she acknowledged  to tell you the truth i cant quite reconcile the circumstances  i cant for instance conceive your promising to do a dishonourable thing  at the time he explained it did not seem dishonourable  at the time it seemed just an act of justice  then circumstances changed new considerations intervened and the whole situation was altered  is it a monetary matter she enquired one in which money would make any difference i mean  he shook his head  money has nothing to do with it he replied  it is just a question whether one is justified in breaking a solemn oath ones word of honour because the action which it entails has become owing to later circumstances hideously repugnant  why ask my advice  i do not know  anyhow i desire it  i should go she said thoughtfully to the person to whom i had bound myself and i should explain the change in my feelings and in the circumstances  i should beg to be released from my word  and if they refused  i dont see how you could possibly break your word of honour she decided reluctantly  it is not done is it  he looked steadily down the gallery through the darkened portion to where the soft overhead lights fell upon the two card tables  there was very little conversation  they could even hear the soft fall of the cards and sylvias musical laugh in the background  all the time letitia watched him  the strength of his face seemed only intensified by his angry indecision  you are right he assented finally  i must not  perhaps she suggested you can find some way of keeping it and yet keeping it without that secondary dishonour you spoke of  now i must really go and see that my guests are behaving properly  she rose to her feet  sylvias laugh rang out again from the far corner of the gallery where she and grantham were seated their heads very close together  letitia watched them for a moment tolerantly  i will recall my fiancé to his duty she declared and you can go and talk nonsense to sylvia  thank you he answered i am afraid that i am not in the humour to talk nonsense with anybody  she turned her head slightly and looked at him  sylvia is such an admirer of yours she said and she has such a delightful way of being lighthearted herself and affecting others in the same fashion  if i were a man  yes  i should marry sylvia  and if i he declared with a sudden flash in his eyes possessed that ridiculous family tree of lord charles granthams  well  i should marry you  she looked at him through halfclosed eyes  there was a little smile on her lips which at first he thought insolent but concerning which afterwards he permitted himself to speculate  he stopped short  lady letitia he pleaded there is a door there which leads into the hall  you dont expect manners of me anyway but could you accept my farewell and excuse me to the others  i have really a serious reason for wishing to leavea reason connected with the note i received at dinner time  of course she answered but you are sure that you are well  there is nothing that we can do for you  he paused for a moment with his hand upon the fastening of the door  there is nothing anybody can do for me lady letitia he said goodby  she stood for a moment watching the door through which he had passed with a puzzled frown upon her face  then she continued her progress down the room  arrived at the bridge table she stooped for a moment to look over her aunts score  finished your flirtation my dear the latter asked coolly  letitia accepted the challenge  so effectually she replied that the poor man has gone home  i am to present his excuses to every one  the duchess paused for a moment in the playing of her hand  her brother with unfailing tact threw himself into the breach  i suppose he said that we can scarcely realise the responsibilities which these kings of finance carry always upon their shoulders  they tell me that mr thain has his telegrams and cables stopped in london by a secretary and telephoned here just to save a few minutes  he receives sometimes as many as half a dozen messages during the night  the duchess continued to play her hand  after all she remarked i fear that i shall not be able to ask mr thain to scotland  one would feel the responsibility so much if he were to lose anything he valued by coming     chapter xxxiii  richard vont as though he had been sitting there listening for the raising of the latch was on his feet before david could enter the sitting room  the lords day has come he muttered dragging him in  its been a weary while but its come  david threw off his overcoat in silence and the old man looked wonderingly at his clothes  youve been taking your dinner up with themat the house he asked  david nodded  yes he assented  your note found me there  i came as soon as i could  i never doubted ye the old man muttered  i knew youd come  david suddenly stifled threw open the cottage window  when he came back into the little circle of lamplight his face was pale and set he was filled with a premonition of evil  i want you to listen to me uncle he said earnestly  i have something to say  something to say the old man repeated  another time my boyanother time  tonight you have work to do he added with a fierce flash of triumph in his eyes  work  ayeto keep your oath  but tonight  what can i do tonight david exclaimed  no dont tell me he went on quickly  ill have my say first  get on with it then  theres time  im listening  i have forgotten nothing david began i am denying nothing  i remember even the words of the oath i swore  with your hand upon the bible vont interrupted eagerlyyour hand upon the book  david shivered  i am not likely to forget that night he said  what i swore we both know  well  i have begun to keep my word  you know that  aye and tonight youll finish it vont cried with uplifted head after tonight youll be quit of your oath and you can go free of me ive made it all easy for you  its all planned out  i must finish what i have to say david insisted  its been on my mind like lead  hes a ruined man unclebeggared to the last penny ive dishonoured myself but ive done itfor your sake  beyond that i cannot go  you cannot go vont muttered blankly  i cannot  i dont know what this scheme of yours is uncle but leave me out of it  im in hell already  you think  vont was breathing heavily  the words suddenly failed him his fingers seemed to grip the air  david had a momentary shock of terror  then before he could stop him the old man was down upon his knees holding him by the legs his upraised face horrible with a new storm of passion  david youll not back out  youll not break that oath you swore when i lent you the moneyall my savings  and it might have gone wrong you know  it might have beggared me  but i risked it for this  you dont know what ive been through  i tell you there isnt a night from darkness till nigh the dawn i havent toiled with these hands toiled while the sweats run off my forehead and my breaths gone from me  and ive done it  ive made all ready for youand tonightits tonight boy  if you go back on me david as sure as that books the truth you shall know what it is to feel like a murderer for ill sit and face you and ill die  i mean it  as god hears me at this moment i mean it  if you falter tonight you shall find me dead tomorrow and if it blackens my lips ill die cursing you as well as himyou for your softness because theyve flattered you round him because he still lives with the wrong he did me unpunished  david dragged him up by sheer force and pushed him back into his chair  what is it you want me to do he asked in despair  you cant refuse me vont went on his voice strong enough now watch me and listen he added leaning forward  theres my hand on the book  heres my right hand to heaven and i swear by the living god that if you fail me you shall find me tomorrow sitting dead thats what your broken oath will do  oh i hear david answered drearily  ill keep my word  come what is it  vont rose deliberately to his feet  all trace of passion seemed to have disappeared  he took an electric torch from his pocket and led the way to the door  just follow me he whispered  they made their way down the little tiled path to the bottom of the garden  in the righthand corner was what seemed to be the top of a well  you remember that perhaps  david nodded  i know he said  i used to play down there once  vont rolled the top away and stooping down flashed the light  there were stone steps leading to a small opening and at the bottom the mouth of what seemed to be a tunnel  david started  its one of the secret passages to mandeleys he exclaimed  there are seven of them somewhere his uncle replied in a hoarse undertoneone they say from broomleys but thats too far and the air would be too foul and maybe it dont lead where i want it to ive made airholes along this david  you take the torch and you make your way  theres nothing to stop you  its dryive sprinkled sand in placesand theres air too  when you come to the end theres a door  four nights it took me to move that door  its wide open now then you mount a little flight of stairs  they go round and round and at the top theres a little stone landing  youll see before you what seems to be blank wall  you press your palms on itsoand soon you find an iron handle  itll turn easyive oiled it welland you step right into the room  what room david demanded in bewilderment  the old mans fingers clutched his arm  into the bedchamber of the lady letitia mandeleys he proclaimed triumphantly  keep your voice low boy  remember we are out of doors  into the  are you mad uncle david muttered catching at his voice as though it were some loose quality that had escaped from him  theres never a saner man in this county was the fierce reply its what ive worked for  its the worst blow i can deal his pride oh i know she is a haughty lady  youll step into her chamber and shell see you and shell shriek for her servants butbut david he added leaning forward theyll find you theretheyll find you there  the marquishell be told  the nephew of richard vont will be found in his daughters chamber  therell be explanations enough but those things stick  david suddenly found himself laughing like a madman  uncle he cried for gods sakefor heavens sake listen to me this is the maddest scheme that ever entered into any ones head  i should be treated simply like a common burglar  i should have no excuse to offer nothing to say  i should be thrown out of the house and there isnt a human being breathing whod think the worse of the lady letitia  you dont know what shes like  shes wonderful shes  ill not argue with you boy vont interrupted doggedly  you think i know nothing of the world and its ways of the talebearing and the storytelling that goes on women backbiting each other men grasping even at shadows for a sensation  youll do your job david youll keep your oath and from tonight youll stand free of me  therell be no more  you can lift your head again after youve crossed that threshold  make what excuse you likecome back if you will like a frightened hare after theyve found you therebut youll have stood in her bedchamber  david shivered like a man in a fever  he was beginning to realise that this was no nightmarethat the wildeyed man by his side was in sober and ghastly earnest  uncle he pleaded not this  lady letitia has been kind and gracious to me always  we cant strike through women  id rather you bade me take his life  but i dont bid you do anything of the sort was the sullen reply deaths no punishment to any man and the like of hims too brave to feel the fear of it  its through her the blow must come and youll do my bidding david or youll see me sitting waiting for you tomorrow with a last message to you upon my dead lips  david gripped the torch from his hand  after all hell might come to any man  ill go he said  it was a nightmare that followed  stooping only a little flashing his torch always in front he half ran half scrambled along a paved way between paved walls which even the damp of centuries seemed scarcely to have entered  soon the path descended steeply and then rose on the other side of the moat  once a rat paused to look at him with eyes gleaming like diamonds and bolted at the flash of the torch  more than once he fancied that he heard footsteps echoing behind him  he paused to listen  there was nothing  he lost sense of time or distance  he stole on dreading the endand the end came sooner even than he had feared  there was the door that yielded easily to his touch the steep steps round and round the interior of the tower the blank wall before him  the iron handle was there  his hands closed upon it  for a moment he stood in terrible silence  this was something worse than death  then he set his teeth firmly pressed the handle and stepped through the wall  afterwards it seemed to him that there must have been something mortally terrifying in his own appearance as he stood there with his back to the wall and his eyes fixed upon the solitary occupant of the room  lady letitia in a blue dressing gown was lying upon a couch drawn up before a small log fire  there seemed to be no detail of the room which in those sickening moments of mental absorption was not photographed into his memory  the old fourposter bedstead hung with chintz the long black dressing table once a dresser covered carelessly with tortoiseshell backed toilet articles with a large mirror in the centre from which a chair had just been pushed back but above all that look in her face from which every other expression seemed to have permanently fled  her lips were parted her eyes were round with horrified surprise  the book which she had been reading slipped from her fingers and fell noiselessly on to the hearthrug  she sat up supporting herself with her hands one on either side pressed into the sofa  she seemed denied the power of speech almost as he was  and then a sudden wonderful change came to him  he spoke quite distinctly although he kept his voice low  lady letitia he said let me explain  i shall never ask for your forgiveness  i shall never venture to approach you again  i have come here by the secret passage from vonts cottage  i have come here to keep an oath which i swore in america to richard vont and i have come because if i had broken my word he would have killed himself  he spoke with so little emotion so reasonably that she found herself answering him notwithstanding her bewilderment almost in the same key  but who are you she demanded  who are you to be the slave of that old man  i am his nephew david answered  i am the little boy who played about the park when you were a girl who picked you up on the ice once when you fell  all that i have i owe to richard vont  he sent me to college  he lent me the money upon which i built my fortune but on the day he lent it to me he made me swear a terrible oath and tonight he has forced me to keep it by setting foot within your chamber  now i shall return the way i came and may god grant that some day you will forgive me  almost as he spoke there was a little click behind  he started round and felt along the wall  there was a moments silence  then he turned once more towards letitia his cheeks whiter than ever his sunken eyes filled with a new horror  even the composure which had enabled him to explain his coming with some show of reason had deserted him  he seemed threatened with a sort of hysteria  he followed me  damn him he followed me he muttered  i heard footsteps  he has fastened us in  he tore desperately at the tapestry shook the concealed door and rattled it in vain  letitia rose slowly to her feet  you see what has happened she said  richard vont was more cunning than you  he was not content that you should make your little speech and creep back amongst the rats  tell me what do you propose to do  he looked around him helplessly  there is the window he muttered  she shook her head  we are on the second story she told him and there is nothing to break your fall upon the flags below  to be found with a broken neck beneath my window would be almost as bad as anything that could happen  i am not afraid to try he declared  he moved towards the window  she crossed the room swiftly and intercepted him  dont be absurd she admonished  come let us think  there must be a way  let me out of your room on to the landing he begged eagerly  if i can reach the hall it will be all right  i can find a window open or hide somewhere  only for gods sake he added his voice breaking let me out of this room  a flash of her old manner came back to her  i am sorry you find it so unattractive she said  i thought it rather pretty myself  and blue after all is my colour you know although i dont often wear it  oh bless you he exclaimed  bless you lady letitia for speaking to me as though i were a human being  now i am going to steal out of that door on tiptoe  wait till i have listened there she whispered  she stole past him and stooped down with her ear to the keyhole  she frowned for a moment and held out her hand warningly  it seemed to him that he could feel his heart beating  close to where he was standing her silk stockings were hanging over the back of a chairhe suddenly closed his eyes covered them desperately with the palms of his hand her warning finger was still extended  that was some one passing she said  i dont understand why  they all came to bed some time ago  stay where you are and dont move  they both listened  david seemed in those few minutes to have lost all the composure which had become the habit of years  his heart was beating madly  he was shaking as though with intense cold  lady letitia on the other hand seemed almost unruffled  only he fancied that at the back of her eyes there was something to which as yet she had given no expression something which terrified him  then as they stood there neither of them daring to move there came a sudden awful sound  it had seemed to him that the world could hold no greater horror than he was already suffering but the sound to which they listened was paralysing hideous stupefying  with hoarse brazen note rusty and wheezy yet pulled as though with some desperate clutch the great alarm bell which hung over the courtyard was tolling its dreadful summons  letitia stood up her cheeks ghastly pale  she too was struggling now for composure  really she exclaimed this is an evening full of incidentsdont touch me she added  i shall be all right directly  for a single moment he knew that she had nearly fainted  she caught at the side of the wall  then they heard a cry from outside  a spark flew past the window  a hoarse voice from somewhere below shouted fire  and then something more alarming still  all down the corridor doors were thrown open  there was the sound of eager voicesfinally a loud knocking at the door which they were guarding letitia shrugged her shoulders  this she murmured is fate  she opened the door  there was a little confused group outside  the marquis fully dressed stood with his eyes fixed upon thain at first in blank astonishmentafterwards as one who looks upon some horrible thing  grantham in a dressing gown took a quick step forward  my god its thain he exclaimed  what in hells name  letitia turned towards her father  father she began  the marquis made no movement yet she was suddenly aware of something in his expression something which shone more dimly in the face of her aunt which throbbed in granthams incoherent words  her brave little speech died away  she staggered  the marquis still made no movement it was david who caught her in his arms and carried her to the couch he turned and faced them  in the background sylvia was clinging to granthams arm  you gibbering fools he cried  what if an accursed chance has brought me here  isnt she lady letitia your daughter marquis isnt she your betrothed grantham  your niece duchess  do you think that anything but the rankest and most accursed accident could ever have brought me within reach even of her fingers  no one spoke  the faces into which he looked seemed to david like a hideous accusation  suddenly gossetts voice was heard from behind  the fire is nothing your lordship  it is already extinguished  some one seems to have brought some blazing brambles and thrown them into the courtyard  get some water you fools thain shouted  cant you see that she is faint  the duchess began to collect herself  she advanced further into the room in search of restoratives  the marquis came a step nearer to thain  tell me how you found your way into this room sir he demanded  by the foulest means on gods earth thain answered  i came through the secret passage from vonts cottage  without lady letitias knowledge i presume grantham interposed hoarsely  no one but a cad would have asked such a question david thundered i broke into her room meaning to deliver one brief message and to go back again  vont followed me and fastened the doorcant you read the story he added turning appealingly to the marquis  dont you know who i am  i am vonts nephew the boy who played about here years ago  i lived with him in america  he paid for my education at harvard he lent me the money to make my first venture  he has been all the relative i ever had  out there i pledged my word blindly to help him in his revenge upon you marquis in whatever manner he might direct  tonight he sprung this upon me  i was face to face with my word of honour and the certainty that if i refused to fulfil my pledge he would kill himself before morning  so i came  it was he who rang the alarm bell he who planned the pretence of a fire to trap me here this was to be his vengeancebe reasonable  dont take this miserable affair seriously  god knows what i have suffered these last few minutes  letitia sat up revived  she was still very pale and there was something terrible in her face  for heavens sake she begged bring this wretched melodrama to an end  turn that poor man out she added pointing to david  his story is quite true  every one had gone except the marquis and grantham  neither of them spoke for several moments  then the marquis as though he were awaking from a dream moved to the door opened it and beckoned to david  will you follow me he invited  very slowly they passed along the great corridor down the broad stairs and into the hall  the marquis led the way to the front door and opened it  neither had spoken  to thain every moment was a moment of agony  the marquis held the door open and stood on one side  david realised that he was expected to depart without a word  there is nothing more i can say he faltered despairingly  the marquis stood upon his own threshold  he spoke slowly and with a curious lack of expression  nothing  it is the times that are to blame  we open our houses and offer our hospitality to servants and the sons of servants and we expect them to understand our code  we are very foolishsince you have broken this silence let me spare myself the necessity of further words  if your contrition is genuine you will break the lease of broomleys and depart from this neighbourhood without further delay  my agent will wait upon you  without haste yet before any reply was possible the marquis had closed the great door  david was once more in the darkness staggering as though his knees would give way  the avenue stretched unevenly before him  he started off towards broomleys     chapter xxxiv  at a few minutes after nine the following morning the marquis entered the room where breakfast was usually served  the duchess in travelling clothes and a hat was lifting the covers from the silver dishes upon the sideboard with a fork in her hand  she welcomed him a little shortly  good morning reginald  good morning caroline he replied  are you the only representative of the household  she snorted  charlie grantham went off in his little twoseater at eight oclock this morning she announced  he is motoring up to town  left apologies with gossett i believetelegram or something in the night all fiddlesticks of course  naturally the marquis assented helping himself from one of the dishes and drawing his chair up to his sisters side  so exit charles grantham eh  and me the duchess declared returning to her place and pouring out the coffee  i suppose you can send me to fakenham for the ten oclock train  the marquis considered for a moment  i am not sure caroline he said that your departure is entirely kind  well im jolly certain i dont mean it to be she answered bitterly i ask no questions and i hate scenes  a week ago i should have scoffed at the idea of david thain as a prospective suitor for letitia now my advice to you is the sooner you can get them married the better  really he murmured  youve given up the idea then of taking the young man to scotland  entirely the duchess assured him emphatically  i was an idiot to ever consider it  when people of his class find their way amongst us disaster nearly always follows  you see they dont know the rules of the game as we play it  whilst we are on this subject reginald what are you going to do about it  the marquis unlocked his letter case and shook out the contents  you mean about last night he asked  well as i dont want to be the laughingstock of the county i shall keep as quiet as i can  i knew that something ridiculous would happen with that poor lunatic sitting in the garden poring over the bible all day long  the duchess looked distinctly malicious  i am not at all as sure as i should like to be she said that the old man is to blame for everything  the marquis looked at his sister intently  she bent over the milk jug  you leave me in some doubt caroline he observed coldly as to what frame of mind you are in when you make such utterly incomprehensible remarks and curtail your visit to us so suddenly  at the same time i hope that whatever your private feelings may be you will not forget certainshall i call them obligations  oh dont be afraid she rejoined  i am not likely to advertise my folly especially at letitias expense  i dont care a jot whether the young man came through a hole in the wall or dropped down from the clouds  i only know that his presence in letitias bedchamber  we will drop the discussion if you please the marquis interrupted  there was just the one note in his tone an inheritance perhaps from those more virile ancestors which reduced even his sister to silence the marquis adjusted his eyeglass and commenced a leisurely inspection of his letters  he did so without any anxiety without the slightest premonition of evil  even when he recognised her handwriting he did so with a little thrill of pleasurable anticipation  he drew the letter closer to him and with a word of excuse turned away towards the window  perhaps she was wanting him  after all it would be quite easy to run up to london for a dayand wonderfully pleasant  he drew the single sheet from its envelope  the letters seemed magnified  the whole significance of those cruel words seemed to reach him with a single mental effort   reginald i was married to james borden this morning  i suppose it is the uncivilised part of me which has been pulling at my heartstrings day by day week by week the savage in me clamouring for its right before it is too late  so we change positions only whereas you have atoned and justified every one of your actions towards me since our eyes first met i am left without any means of atonement  will you forgive  your very humble and penitent   marcia   the marquis replaced the letter in the envelope  for several moments he stood looking across the park beyond to the wellcultivated farms rolling away to the distant line of hills  his brain was numbed marcia had gonethere was a mist somewhere  he rubbed the windowpane in vain  then he set his teeth and his long nervous fingers gripped at his throat for a moment  your coffee is getting cold his sister reminded him  he came back to his place  she watched him a little curiously  any message from our pseudolothario she asked  the marquis gathered up his other letters  there is nothing here from him he said but i must ask you to excuse me caroline  there is an urgent matter which needs my attention  he crossed the room a little more slowly than usual and his sister who was still watching him critically sighed  there was no doubt at all that his walk was becoming the walk of an old man  the stoop of the shoulders was also a new thing  she counted up his age on her fingers and rising from her place looked at herself in the mirror opposite  her face for a moment was hard and set and her fingers clenched  years she muttered to herself  how i hate them   the marquis selected a grey homburg hat of considerable antiquity and a thicker stick than usual from the rack in the hall  the front doors stood wide open and he walked out into the pleasant sunshine  it was a warm morning but twice he shivered as he passed down the broad sweep of drive and with a curious sensation of unfamiliarity crossed the little bridge over the moat the few yards of park and finally approached the palings which bordered richard vonts domain  the mist still seemed to linger before his eyes but through it he could see the familiar figure seated in his ancient chair with the book upon his knee  the marquis drew close to the side of the palings  richard vont he began i have come down from mandeleys to speak to you  will you listen to what i have to say  there was no reply  the marquis drew the letter from his pocket  you are a cruel and stubborn man vont he continued  you have gone far out of your way to bring injury and unhappiness upon me  all your efforts are as nothing  will you hear from me what has happened  there was silence still grim silence  the marquis stretched out his hand and leaned a little upon the paling  i took your daughter richard vont not as a libertine but as a lover it was perhaps the truest impulse my life has ever felt  if there was sin in it listen  hear how i am punished  month followed month and year followed year and marcia was content with my love and i with hers so that during all this time my lips have touched no other womans no other woman has for a moment engaged even my fancy  i have been as faithful to your daughter richard vont as you to your vindictive enmity  from a discontented and unhappy girl she has become a woman with a position in the world a brilliant writer filled with the desire and happiness of life to her finger tips  from me she received the education the travel the experience which have helped her to her place in the world and with them i gave her my heart  and nowyou are listening richard vont  you will hear what has happened  still that stony silence from the figure in the chair  still that increasing mist before the eyes of the man who leaned towards him  your daughter richard vont the marquis concluded has taken your vengeance into her own hands  your prayers have come true though not from the quarter you had hoped  you saw only a little way  you tried to strike only a foolish blow  it has been given to your daughter to do more than this  she has broken my heart richard vont  she grew to become the dearest thing in my life and she has left meyesterday she was married  no exclamation no movement  the marquis wiped his eyes and saw with unexpected clearness  what had happened seemed so natural that for a moment he was not even surprised  he stepped over the palings leaned for a single moment over the body of the man to whom he had been talking and laid the palm of his hand over the lifeless eyes  then he walked down the tiled path and called to the woman whose face he had seen through the latticed window  mrs wells he said something serious has happened to vont  your lordship  he is dead the marquis told her  you had better go down to the village and fetch the doctor  i will send a message to his nephew  back again across the park very gorgeous now in the fuller sunshine casting quaint shadows underneath the trees glittering upon the streaks of yellow cowslips on the hillside  the birds were singing and the air was as soft as midsummer  he crossed the bridge turned into the drive and stood for a moment in his own hall  a servant came hurrying towards him  run across the park to broomleys as fast as you can his master directed  tell mr thain to go at once to vonts cottage  you had better let him know that vont is dead  the young man hastened off  gossett appeared from somewhere in the background and opened the door of the study towards which the marquis was slowly making his way  the shock has been too much for your lordship the man murmured may i bring you some brandy  the marquis shook his head  it is necessary gossett he said that i should be absolutely undisturbed for an hour  kindly see that no one even knocks at my door for that period of time  gossett held open the door and closed it softly  he was a very old servant and in great measure he understood     chapter xxxv  richard vont was buried in the little churchyard behind mandeleys the churchyard in which was the family vault and which was consecrated entirely to tenants and dependents of the estate  the little congregation of soberlyclad villagers received more than one surprise during the course of the short and simple service  the marquis himself clad in sombre and unfamiliar garments stood in his pew and followed the little procession to the graveside  the new tenant of broomleys was there and marcia deeply veiled but easily recognisable by that brief moment of emotion which followed the final ceremony  at its conclusion the steward following an immemorial custom invited the little crowd to accompany him to mandeleys where refreshments were provided in the back hall  the marquis had stepped back into the church  david and marcia were alone  he came round to her side  you dont remember me he asked  remember you she repeated  arent you mr david thain  yes he admitted but many years ago i was called richard david vontwhen i lived down there with you marcia  emotion had become so dulled that even her wonder found scanty expression  i remember your eyes she said  they puzzled me more than once did he know  of course david answered  we lived together in america for many years and we came home together  directly we arrived however he insisted on our separating  you know the madness of his life marcia  i know she answered bitterly  was i not the cause of it  it was part of his scheme that i should help towards his revenge he explained  i did his bidding and the end was disaster and humiliation  they stood under the little wooden porch which led out into the park  you will come up to broomleys he invited  she shook her head  just now i would rather go back to the cottage she said  we shall meet again  i shall be in england only for a few more days he told her gloomily i am returning to america  she looked at him in some surprise  i thought you had settled down here  only to carry out my share in that infernal bargain  i have done it i kept my word i am miserably ashamed of myself and i have but one feeling nowto get as far away as i can  but tell me david she asked what was this scheme  what have you done to hurt himthe marquis  i have done my best to ruin him david replied and through some accursed scheme in which i bore an evil and humiliating part i have brought some shadow of a scandal upon  he broke off  marcia waited for him to continue but he shook his head  the whole thing is too insignificant and yet too damnable he said some day marcia i will tell you of it  if you wont come with me forgive me if i hurry away  he was gone before she could remonstrate  she looked around and saw the reason  the marquis was coming down the gravel path from the church in which he had taken refuge from the crowd  she felt a sudden shaking of the knees a momentary return of that old ascendency which he had always held over her  then she turned and waited for him  he smiled very gravely as he held her hand for a moment  you are going back to the cottage he asked  i will walk with you if i may  they had a stretch of park before them a wonderful rolling stretch of ancient turf  here and there were little clusters of cowslips golden as the sunshine which was making quaint patterns of shadow beneath the oaks and drawing the perfume from the hawthorn trees drooping beneath their weight of blossom  marcia tried twice to speak but her voice broke  there was the one look in his face which she dreaded  i shall not say any conventional things to you he began gently your fathers life for many years must have been most unhappy  in a way i suppose you and i are the people who are responsible for it and yet behind it alli say it in justice to ourselves and not with disrespect to the deadit was his primeval and colossal ignorance the heritage of that stubborn race of yeomen which was responsible for his sorrow  he never understood she murmured  no one in this world could make him understand  you know that our new neighbour up there he continued moving his head towards broomleys was his nephewa sharer however unwilling in his folly  he has just told me she admitted  i was the first to find your father dead he went on  when i received your letter marcia i took it to him  i went to offer him the sacrifice of my desolation  that i thought would end his enmity and i read your letter to dead ears  he was seated there believing that all the evil he wished me had come  i suppose the belief brought him peace  he was a stubborn old man  marcia would have spoken but there was a lump in her throat  she opened her lips only to close them again  i wished to see you marcia he continued because i wanted you to understand that i have only one feeling in my heart towards you and that is a feeling of wonderful gratitude  for many years you have been the most sympathetic companion a somewhat dull person could have had the memory of these years is imperishable  and i want to tell you something else  in my heart i approve of what you have done  oh but that is impossible she replied  i cannot keep the bitter thoughts from my own heart  i am ashamed when i think of your kindness of your fidelity of all that you have given and done for me throughout these years  and now i have the feeling that i am leaving you when you need me most  he smiled at her  your knowledge of life he said gently should teach you better the years that lay between us when you first gave me all that there was worth having of love in the world were nothing  today they are an impassable gulf  i have reached just those few years which become the aftermath of actual living and you are young still young in mind and body  we part so naturally  there is something still alive in you which is dead in me  but you are so lonely she faltered  i should be lonelier still he answered or at least more unhappy if i dragged you with me through the cheerless years  life is a matter of cycles  you are commencing a new one and so am i only the things that are necessary to you are not now necessary to me  so it is natural and best that we should part  she pointed to the cottage now only a few yards away  its doors and windows were wide open there was smoke coming from the chimney a wealth of flowers in the garden  the cottage is mine she said  sometimes i believe that it was left to me in the hope that i might come back with my heart too full of bitterness and that i might take his place  it is yours whenever you choose to take it  i shall send the deeds to mr merridrew  he looked at it thoughtfully  for a moment the shadow passed from his face  he stood a little more upright his eyes seemed to grow larger perhaps he thought of those days when he had stolen down from the house with beating heart drawn nearer and nearer to the cottage felt all the glow and fervour of his great love  there was a breath of perfume from the garden full of torturing memoriesa little wind in the trees  one of the desires of my life gratified he declared  mr merridrew shall draw up a deed of sale  look he added pointing to the drive there is some one waiting for you in the car there  isnt it your husband  she glanced in the direction he indicated  yes she murmured  i will not stay and see him now the marquis continued  you will forgive me i know  present to him if you will he went on with some faint touch of his old manner my heartiest good wishes  and to you marcia he added raising the fingers of her ungloved hand to his lips well may you find all that there is left in the world of happiness  and remember too that every drop of happiness that comes into your life means greater peace for mewe talk too seriously for such a brilliant morning he concluded his voice measured though kindly his attitude suddenly reminiscent of that long pictured line of gallant ancestors  take my advice and use some of this beautiful afternoon for your ride to london  there will be a moon tonight and you may enter it as the heroine in your last storya fairy city  he left her quite easily but when she tried to start to meet her husband her knees gave way  she clung to the paling and watched him cross the bridge and stroll up the little strip of turf still erect contemplating the great pile in front of him with the beneficent satisfaction of inherited proprietorship  she watched him pass through the front door and disappear  then she turned around and drew her husband into the cottage  james she cried sobbing in his arms take me awayplease take me away     chapter xxxvi  during those few hours of strenuous almost fierce work into which david threw himself after the funeral he found in a collection of belated cablegrams which his secretary handed him an explanation of letitias half apology an explanation he told himself bitterly of her altered demeanour towards him  the old proverb stood justified even this the wildest of his speculations had become miraculously successful  pluto oil shares unsalable at a dollar a few weeks ago now stood at eight  oil had been discovered in extraordinary and unprecedented quantities  oil was spurting another great fortune for him out of the sandy earth  he paused to make a calculation  the marquiss forty thousand pounds worth were worth at a rough estimate three hundred thousand  extraordinary news this jackson he remarked to the quiet sadfaced young man who had been his right hand since the time of his first railway deal  most extraordinary was the quiet reply  i congratulate you mr thain  you do seem to have the knack of turning everything you touch into gold  do i thain murmured listlessly  i took the liberty of investing in a small parcel of shares myself just to lock away the young man continued  i gave seventy cents for them  not enough to make you a millionaire i hope thain asked with some bitterness  enough with my savings to give me a very comfortable feeling of independence sir jackson replied  i have never aspired any further than that  thain returned to his desk  he gave letter after letter and more than once his secretary who had received no previous intimation of his masters intended departure glanced at him in mild surprise  i presume as you are returning to the states sir he suggested that we must try to cancel the contracts which we have already concluded for the restoration of this place  thain shook his head  let them go on he said  it makes very little difference  i have a seven years lease  i may come back again  the letters which i gave you with a cross you had better take into your own study and type  i shall be here to sign them when you have finished  the young man bowed and departed  david listened to the closing of the door and turned his head a little wearily towards the night  the french windows stood open  through the still fir trees whose perfume reached him every now and then in little wafts he could see one or two of the earlier lights shining from the great house  once more his thoughts travelled back to the everpresent subject  could he have done differently  was there any way in which he could have spared himself the ignominy the terrible humiliation of those few minutes there was something wrong about it all something almost suicidalhis blind obedience to the old mans prejudiced hatred his own frenzied tearing to pieces of what might at least have remained a wonderful dream  one half of his efforts too had fallen pitifully flat  the marquis had only to keep the shares to which he was justly entitled to free for the first time for generations his farspreading estates to take his place once more as the greatest nobleman and landowner in the county  if only it had been the other scheme which had miscarried  his avenue of elms was sheltering now an orchestra of singing birds with the slightly moving breeze which had sprung up since sunset the perfume of his roses became alluringly manifest  through the trees he heard the chiming of the great stable clock from mandeleys and the sound seemed somehow to torture him  his head drooped for a moment upon his arms  the room seemed suddenly to become darker  he raised his head and remained staring like a man who looks upon some impossible vision lady letitia bareheaded a little paler than usual a little it seemed to him more human was standing there looking in upon him  he managed to rise to his feet but he had no words  i am not a ghost she said  please come out into the garden  i want to talk to you  he followed her without a word  it was significant that his first impulse had been to shrink away from her as one dreading to receive a hurt  she seemed to notice it and smiled  let us try and be reasonable for a short time she continued  we seem to have been living in some perfectly absurd nightmare for the last few hours  i have come to you to try and regain my poise  yes we will sit downhere please  they sat in the same chairs which they had occupied on her previous visit  david had been through many crises in his life but this one left him with no command of coherent speechleft him curiously idiotically tonguetied  i have thought over this ridiculous affair she went on  i must talk about it to some one and there is only you left  your guests he faltered  gone she told him a little melodramatically  didnt you know that we had been alone ever since the morning afterwards  first of all my almost fiancé charlie grantham drove off at dawn  he left behind him a little note  he had every confidence in me buthe went  then my aunt  she was the most peevish person i ever knew  she seemed to imagine that i had in some way interfered with her plans for your subjugation and although she knew quite well that no woman of the mandeleys family could ever stoop to any unworthy or undignified action she decided to hurry her departure  she left at midday  but miss sylvia  sylvia was most ingenuous letitia continued her voice regaining a little of its natural quality  sylvia came to me quite timidly and asked me to walk with her in the garden  she wonderedwas it really settled between me and lord charles  if it was she was quite willing to go into a nunnery or something equivalentchiswick i believe it was with a maiden aunt  but if not she believedhe had whispered a few things to herhe was hoping to see her that week in town  it was most extraordinaryshe couldnt understand itbut it seemed that their old flirtationsyou knew of course that they had met often beforehad left a void in his heart which only she could fill  he had discovered his mistake in time  she threw herself upon my mercy  she left by the threethirty  my god he groaned  and this was all my doing  all your doing she assented equably  they were all of them perfectly content to accept your story  there is not one of them who disputes it for a single moment  but you were there with the secret door closed behind you and as my aunt said there is really no accounting for what people will do nowadays  and now she concluded i gather that you are leaving too  i am motoring up to town tomorrow morning he said  i havent ventured to speak of atonement but your coming here like this lady letitia is the kindest thing you have ever doneyou could ever do  i have tried in my way he went on after a moments pause to live what i suppose one calls a selfrespecting life  i have never before been in a position when i have been ashamed of anything i have done and now since those few minutes i have lived in a burning furnace of it  i darent let my mind dwell upon it  those few minutes were the most horrible psychological tragedy which any man could face  if your coming really means he went on and his voice shook and his eyes glowed as he leaned towards her that i may carry away with me the feeling that you have forgiven me i cant tell you the difference it will make  but why go she asked him softly  his heart began to beat with sudden feverish throbs  his eyes searched her face hungrily  she seemed in earnest  her lips had lost even their usual faintly contemptuous curl  if anything she was smiling at him  why go he repeated  cant you understand that the one desire i have the one burning desire is to put myself as far away as possible from the sight and memory of what happened that night  we have been telephoning through to london  i have taken my passage for america on saturday  i shall go straight out to the rockies  i just want to get where i can forget your look and the words with which your father turned me out of his house  and worse than that he added with a little shake in his tone their justicetheir cruel abominable justice  then what was surely a miracle happened  she leaned forward and took his hand  her eyes were soft with sympathy  you poor thing she exclaimed  you couldnt do anything else  i have been thinking it over very seriously  it was a horrible position for you but you really couldnt do anything else that i can see  you told your story simply and like a man  but wait  there is one thing i cant understand  those shareswere they not to be part of that poor mans vengeance  you surely never intended that we should benefit by them in this extraordinary way  i believed them he told her firmly when i sold them to your father to be until long after he would have had to pay for them at any rate absolutely worthless  the wholly unexpected has happened as it does often in oil  your fathers shares are worth a fortune  he can realise his idea of clearing mandeleys  he can dispose of them today for three hundred thousand pounds  lady letitia you have come to me like an angel  this is the sweetest thing any woman ever did be still kinder  please make your father keep the shares  they are his  they were sold to ruin him  it is just the chance of something that happened many thousand miles away which has turned them in his favour  he accepts nothing from me  it is fate only which brings him this windfall  i promise she said  to tell you the truth i think father is as much changed during the last few days as i am  when i saw him about an hour ago and told him that i was coming to see you i was almost frightened at first  he looks older and i fancy that something which has happened latelysomething quite outsidehas been a great blow to him  does he know then how kind you are being to me david asked  she nodded  he rather hoped she whispered leaning a little closer still to him and smiling into his face that you would come back with me and dine  david suddenly clutched her hands  he was a man again  he threw away his doubts  he accepted paradise  on their way across the park a short time later he suddenly pointed down towards the little cottage  you havent forgotten letitia he said that i lived there  you havent forgotten that that old man was my unclethat his father and grandfather were the servants of your
