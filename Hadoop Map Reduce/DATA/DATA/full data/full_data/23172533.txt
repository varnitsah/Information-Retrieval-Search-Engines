23172533	a week                                  on the                        concord and merrimack rivers    page                                     a week                                  on the                        concord and merrimack rivers                              by henry d thoreau                          author of walden etc   page        whereer thou sailst who sailed with me

     there it is there it is the treasure i seek      on the barren sands of a desolate creek   page        i sailed up a river with a pleasant wind      new lands new people and new thoughts to find      many fair reaches and headlands appeared      and many dangers were there to be feared      but when i remember where i have been      and the fair landscapes that i have seen      thou seemest the only permanent shore      the cape never rounded nor wandered oer   page        fluminaque obliquis cinxit declivia ripis      quae diversa locis partim sorbentur ab ipsa      in mare perveniunt

places are part absorbed by the earth    part reach the sea and being received within the plain    of its freer waters beat the shore for banks    page                    concord river       beneath low hills in the broad interval      through which at will our indian rivulet      winds mindful still of sannup and of squaw      whose pipe and arrow oft the plough unburies      here in pine houses built of newfallen trees      supplanters of the tribe the farmers dwell                                            emerson   the musketaquid or grassground river though probably as old as the nile or euphrates did not begin to have a place in civilized history until the fame of its grassy meadows and its fish attracted settlers out of england in 1635 when it received the other but kindred name of concord from the first plantation on its banks which appears to have been commenced in a spirit of peace and harmony  it will be grassground river as long as grass grows and water runs here it will be concord river only while men lead peaceable lives on its banks  to an extinct race it was grassground where they hunted and fished and it is still perennial grassground to concord farmers who own the great meadows and get the hay from year to year  one branch of it according to the historian of concord for i love to quote so good authority rises in the south part of hopkinton and another from a pond and a large cedarswamp in westborough and flowing between hopkinton and southborough through framingham and between sudbury and wayland where it is sometimes called sudbury river it enters concord at the south part of the town and after receiving the north or assabeth river which has its source a little farther to the north and west goes out at the northeast angle and flowing between bedford and carlisle and through billerica empties into the merrimack at lowell  in concord it is in summer from four to fifteen feet deep and from one hundred to three hundred feet wide but in the spring freshets when it overflows its banks it is in some places nearly a mile wide  between sudbury and wayland the meadows acquire their greatest breadth and when covered with water they form a handsome chain of shallow vernal lakes resorted to by numerous gulls and ducks  just above shermans bridge between these towns is the largest expanse and when the wind blows freshly in a raw march day heaving up the surface into dark and sober billows or regular swells skirted as it is in the distance with alderswamps and smokelike maples it looks like a smaller lake huron and is very pleasant and exciting for a landsman to row or sail over  the farmhouses along the sudbury shore which rises gently to a considerable height command fine water prospects at this season  the shore is more flat on the wayland side and this town is the greatest loser by the flood  its farmers tell me that thousands of acres are flooded now since the dams have been erected where they remember to have seen the white honeysuckle or clover growing once and they could go dry with shoes only in summer  now there is nothing but bluejoint and sedge and cutgrass there standing in water all the year round  for a long time they made the most of the driest season to get their hay working sometimes till nine oclock at night sedulously paring with their scythes in the twilight round the hummocks left by the ice but now it is not worth the getting when they can come at it and they look sadly round to their woodlots and upland as a last resource  it is worth the while to make a voyage up this stream if you go no farther than sudbury only to see how much country there is in the rear of us great hills and a hundred brooks and farmhouses and barns and haystacks you never saw before and men everywhere sudbury that is southborough men and wayland and nineacrecorner men and bound rock where four towns bound on a rock in the river lincoln wayland sudbury concord  many waves are there agitated by the wind keeping nature fresh the spray blowing in your face reeds and rushes waving ducks by the hundred all uneasy in the surf in the raw wind just ready to rise and now going off with a clatter and a whistling like riggers straight for labrador flying against the stiff gale with reefed wings or else circling round first with all their paddles briskly moving just over the surf to reconnoitre you before they leave these parts gulls wheeling overhead muskrats swimming for dear life wet and cold with no fire to warm them by that you know of their labored homes rising here and there like haystacks and countless mice and moles and winged titmice along the sunny windy shore cranberries tossed on the waves and heaving up on the beach their little red skiffs beating about among the alderssuch healthy natural tumult as proves the last day is not yet at hand  and there stand all around the alders and birches and oaks and maples full of glee and sap holding in their buds until the waters subside  you shall perhaps run aground on cranberry island only some spires of last years pipegrass above water to show where the danger is and get as good a freezing there as anywhere on the northwest coast  i never voyaged so far in all my life  you shall see men you never heard of before whose names you dont know going away down through the meadows with long duckingguns with watertight boots wading through the fowlmeadow grass on bleak wintry distant shores with guns at halfcock and they shall see teal bluewinged greenwinged shelldrakes whistlers black ducks ospreys and many other wild and noble sights before night such as they who sit in parlors never dream of  you shall see rude and sturdy experienced and wise men keeping their castles or teaming up their summers wood or chopping alone in the woods men fuller of talk and rare adventure in the sun and wind and rain than a chestnut is of meat who were out not only in 75 and 1812 but have been out every day of their lives greater men than homer or chaucer or shakespeare only they never got time to say so they never took to the way of writing  look at their fields and imagine what they might write if ever they should put pen to paper  or what have they not written on the face of the earth already clearing and burning and scratching and harrowing and ploughing and subsoiling in and in and out and out and over and over again and again erasing what they had already written for want of parchment  as yesterday and the historical ages are past as the work of today is present so some flitting perspectives and demiexperiences of the life that is in nature are in time veritably future or rather outside to time perennial young divine in the wind and rain which never die       the respectable folks      where dwell they      they whisper in the oaks      and they sigh in the hay      summer and winter night and day      out on the meadow there dwell they      they never die      nor snivel nor cry      nor ask our pity      with a wet eye      a sound estate they ever mend      to every asker readily lend      to the ocean wealth      to the meadow health      to time his length      to the rocks strength      to the stars light      to the weary night      to the busy day      to the idle play      and so their good cheer never ends      for all are their debtors and all their friends  concord river is remarkable for the gentleness of its current which is scarcely perceptible and some have referred to its influence the proverbial moderation of the inhabitants of concord as exhibited in the revolution and on later occasions it has been proposed that the town should adopt for its coat of arms a field verdant with the concord circling nine times round i have read that a descent of an eighth of an inch in a mile is sufficient to produce a flow  our river has probably very near the smallest allowance  the story is current at any rate though i believe that strict history will not bear it out that the only bridge ever carried away on the main branch within the limits of the town was driven up stream by the wind  but wherever it makes a sudden bend it is shallower and swifter and asserts its title to be called a river  compared with the other tributaries of the merrimack it appears to have been properly named musketaquid or meadow river by the indians  for the most part it creeps through broad meadows adorned with scattered oaks where the cranberry is found in abundance covering the ground like a mossbed  a row of sunken dwarf willows borders the stream on one or both sides while at a greater distance the meadow is skirted with maples alders and other fluviatile trees overrun with the grapevine which bears fruit in its season purple red white and other grapes  still farther from the stream on the edge of the firm land are seen the gray and white dwellings of the inhabitants  according to the valuation of 1831 there were in concord two thousand one hundred and eleven acres or about one seventh of the whole territory in meadow this standing next in the list after pasturage and unimproved lands and judging from the returns of previous years the meadow is not reclaimed so fast as the woods are cleared  let us here read what old johnson says of these meadows in his wonderworking providence which gives the account of new england from 1628 to 1652 and see how matters looked to him  he says of the twelfth church of christ gathered at concord this town is seated upon a fair fresh river whose rivulets are filled with fresh marsh and her streams with fish it being a branch of that large river of merrimack  allwifes and shad in their season come up to this town but salmon and dace cannot come up by reason of the rocky falls which causeth their meadows to lie much covered with water the which these people together with their neighbor town have several times essayed to cut through but cannot yet it may be turned another way with an hundred pound charge as it appeared  as to their farming he says having laid out their estate upon cattle at 5 to 20 pound a cow when they came to winter them with inland hay and feed upon such wild fother as was never cut before they could not hold out the winter but ordinarily the first or second year after their coming up to a new plantation many of their cattle died and this from the same author of the planting of the 19th church in the mattachusets government called sudbury this year does he mean 1654 the town and church of christ at sudbury began to have the first foundation stones laid taking up her station in the inland country as her elder sister concord had formerly done lying further up the same river being furnished with great plenty of fresh marsh but it lying very low is much indamaged with land floods insomuch that when the summer proves wet they lose part of their hay yet are they so sufficiently provided that they take in cattle of other towns to winter  the sluggish artery of the concord meadows steals thus unobserved through the town without a murmur or a pulsebeat its general course from southwest to northeast and its length about fifty miles a huge volume of matter ceaselessly rolling through the plains and valleys of the substantial earth with the moccasoned tread of an indian warrior making haste from the high places of the earth to its ancient reservoir  the murmurs of many a famous river on the other side of the globe reach even to us here as to more distant dwellers on its banks many a poets stream floating the helms and shields of heroes on its bosom  the xanthus or scamander is not a mere dry channel and bed of a mountain torrent but fed by the everflowing springs of fame      and thou simois that as an arrowe clere      through troy rennest aie downward to the sea  and i trust that i may be allowed to associate our muddy but much abused concord river with the most famous in history      sure there are poets which did never dream      upon parnassus nor did taste the stream      of helicon we therefore may suppose      those made not poets but the poets those  the mississippi the ganges and the nile those journeying atoms from the rocky mountains the himmaleh and mountains of the moon have a kind of personal importance in the annals of the world  the heavens are not yet drained over their sources but the mountains of the moon still send their annual tribute to the pasha without fail as they did to the pharaohs though he must collect the rest of his revenue at the point of the sword rivers must have been the guides which conducted the footsteps of the first travellers  they are the constant lure when they flow by our doors to distant enterprise and adventure and by a natural impulse the dwellers on their banks will at length accompany their currents to the lowlands of the globe or explore at their invitation the interior of continents  they are the natural highways of all nations not only levelling the ground and removing obstacles from the path of the traveller quenching his thirst and bearing him on their bosoms but conducting him through the most interesting scenery the most populous portions of the globe and where the animal and vegetable kingdoms attain their greatest perfection  i had often stood on the banks of the concord watching the lapse of the current an emblem of all progress following the same law with the system with time and all that is made the weeds at the bottom gently bending down the stream shaken by the watery wind still planted where their seeds had sunk but erelong to die and go down likewise the shining pebbles not yet anxious to better their condition the chips and weeds and occasional logs and stems of trees that floated past fulfilling their fate were objects of singular interest to me and at last i resolved to launch myself on its bosom and float whither it would bear me     page                          saturday      come come my lovely fair and let us try     those rural delicacies                christs invitation to the soul  quarles    page                         saturday                             at length on saturday the last day of august 1839 we two brothers and natives of concord weighed anchor in this river port for concord too lies under the sun a port of entry and departure for the bodies as well as the souls of men one shore at least exempted from all duties but such as an honest man will gladly discharge  a warm drizzling rain had obscured the morning and threatened to delay our voyage but at length the leaves and grass were dried and it came out a mild afternoon as serene and fresh as if nature were maturing some greater scheme of her own  after this long dripping and oozing from every pore she began to respire again more healthily than ever  so with a vigorous shove we launched our boat from the bank while the flags and bulrushes courtesied a godspeed and dropped silently down the stream  our boat which had cost us a weeks labor in the spring was in form like a fishermans dory fifteen feet long by three and a half in breadth at the widest part painted green below with a border of blue with reference to the two elements in which it was to spend its existence  it had been loaded the evening before at our door half a mile from the river with potatoes and melons from a patch which we had cultivated and a few utensils and was provided with wheels in order to be rolled around falls as well as with two sets of oars and several slender poles for shoving in shallow places and also two masts one of which served for a tentpole at night for a buffaloskin was to be our bed and a tent of cotton cloth our roof  it was strongly built but heavy and hardly of better model than usual  if rightly made a boat would be a sort of amphibious animal a creature of two elements related by one half its structure to some swift and shapely fish and by the other to some strongwinged and graceful bird  the fish shows where there should be the greatest breadth of beam and depth in the hold its fins direct where to set the oars and the tail gives some hint for the form and position of the rudder  the bird shows how to rig and trim the sails and what form to give to the prow that it may balance the boat and divide the air and water best  these hints we had but partially obeyed  but the eyes though they are no sailors will never be satisfied with any model however fashionable which does not answer all the requisitions of art  however as art is all of a ship but the wood and yet the wood alone will rudely serve the purpose of a ship so our boat being of wood gladly availed itself of the old law that the heavier shall float the lighter and though a dull waterfowl proved a sufficient buoy for our purpose      were it the will of heaven an osier bough      were vessel safe enough the seas to plough  some village friends stood upon a promontory lower down the stream to wave us a last farewell but we having already performed these shore rites with excusable reserve as befits those who are embarked on unusual enterprises who behold but speak not silently glided past the firm lands of concord both peopled cape and lonely summer meadow with steady sweeps  and yet we did unbend so far as to let our guns speak for us when at length we had swept out of sight and thus left the woods to ring again with their echoes and it may be many russetclad children lurking in those broad meadows with the bittern and the woodcock and the rail though wholly concealed by brakes and hardhack and meadowsweet heard our salute that afternoon  we were soon floating past the first regular battle ground of the revolution resting on our oars between the still visible abutments of that north bridge over which in april 1775 rolled the first faint tide of that war which ceased not till as we read on the stone on our right it gave peace to these united states as a concord poet has sung      by the rude bridge that arched the flood       their flag to aprils breeze unfurled     here once the embattled farmers stood       and fired the shot heard round the world      the foe long since in silence slept       alike the conqueror silent sleeps     and time the ruined bridge has swept       down the dark stream which seaward creeps  our reflections had already acquired a historical remoteness from the scenes we had left and we ourselves essayed to sing      ah t is in vain the peaceful din       that wakes the ignoble town     not thus did braver spirits win       a patriots renown      there is one field beside this stream       wherein no foot does fall     but yet it beareth in my dream       a richer crop than all      let me believe a dream so dear      some heart beat high that day     above the petty province here      and britain far away      some hero of the ancient mould      some arm of knightly worth     of strength unbought and faith unsold      honored this spot of earth      who sought the prize his heart described      and did not ask release     whose freeborn valor was not bribed      by prospect of a peace      the men who stood on yonder height      that day are long since gone     not the same hand directs the fight      and monumental stone      ye were the grecian cities then      the romes of modern birth     where the new england husbandmen      have shown a roman worth      in vain i search a foreign land      to find our bunker hill     and lexington and concord stand      by no laconian rill  with such thoughts we swept gently by this now peaceful pastureground on waves of concord in which was long since drowned the din of war      but since we sailed     some things have failed     and many a dream     gone down the stream      here then an aged shepherd dwelt     who to his flock his substance dealt     and ruled them with a vigorous crook     by precept of the sacred book     but he the pierless bridge passed oer     and solitary left the shore      anon a youthful pastor came     whose crook was not unknown to fame     his lambs he viewed with gentle glance     spread oer the countrys wide expanse     and fed with mosses from the manse     here was our hawthorne in the dale     and here the shepherd told his tale  that slight shaft had now sunk behind the hills and we had floated round the neighboring bend and under the new north bridge between ponkawtasset and the poplar hill into the great meadows which like a broad moccason print have levelled a fertile and juicy place in nature       on ponkawtasset since we took our way      down this still stream to far billericay      a poet wise has settled whose fine ray      doth often shine on concords twilight day       like those first stars whose silver beams on high      shining more brightly as the day goes by      most travellers cannot at first descry      but eyes that wont to range the evening sky       and know celestial lights do plainly see      and gladly hail them numbering two or three      for lore thats deep must deeply studied be      as from deep wells men read starpoetry       these stars are never paled though out of sight      but like the sun they shine forever bright      ay they are suns though earth must in its flight      put out its eyes that it may see their light       who would neglect the least celestial sound      or faintest light that falls on earthly ground      if he could know it one day would be found      that star in cygnus whither we are bound      and pale our sun with heavenly radiance round  gradually the village murmur subsided and we seemed to be embarked on the placid current of our dreams floating from past to future as silently as one awakes to fresh morning or evening thoughts  we glided noiselessly down the stream occasionally driving a pickerel or a bream from the covert of the pads and the smaller bittern now and then sailed away on sluggish wings from some recess in the shore or the larger lifted itself out of the long grass at our approach and carried its precious legs away to deposit them in a place of safety  the tortoises also rapidly dropped into the water as our boat ruffled the surface amid the willows breaking the reflections of the trees  the banks had passed the height of their beauty and some of the brighter flowers showed by their faded tints that the season was verging towards the afternoon of the year but this sombre tinge enhanced their sincerity and in the still unabated heats they seemed like the mossy brink of some cool well  the narrowleaved willow salix purshiana lay along the surface of the water in masses of light green foliage interspersed with the large balls of the buttonbush  the small rosecolored polygonum raised its head proudly above the water on either hand and flowering at this season and in these localities in front of dense fields of the white species which skirted the sides of the stream its little streak of red looked very rare and precious  the pure white blossoms of the arrowhead stood in the shallower parts and a few cardinals on the margin still proudly surveyed themselves reflected in the water though the latter as well as the pickerelweed was now nearly out of blossom  the snakehead chelone glabra grew close to the shore while a kind of coreopsis turning its brazen face to the sun full and rank and a tall dull red flower eupatorium purpureum or trumpetweed formed the rear rank of the fluvial array  the bright blue flowers of the soapwort gentian were sprinkled here and there in the adjacent meadows like flowers which proserpine had dropped and still farther in the fields or higher on the bank were seen the purple gerardia the virginian rhexia and drooping neottia or ladiestresses while from the more distant waysides which we occasionally passed and banks where the sun had lodged was reflected still a dull yellow beam from the ranks of tansy now past its prime  in short nature seemed to have adorned herself for our departure with a profusion of fringes and curls mingled with the bright tints of flowers reflected in the water  but we missed the white waterlily which is the queen of river flowers its reign being over for this season  he makes his voyage too late perhaps by a true water clock who delays so long  many of this species inhabit our concord water  i have passed down the river before sunrise on a summer morning between fields of lilies still shut in sleep and when at length the flakes of sunlight from over the bank fell on the surface of the water whole fields of white blossoms seemed to flash open before me as i floated along like the unfolding of a banner so sensible is this flower to the influence of the suns rays  as we were floating through the last of these familiar meadows we observed the large and conspicuous flowers of the hibiscus covering the dwarf willows and mingled with the leaves of the grape and wished that we could inform one of our friends behind of the locality of this somewhat rare and inaccessible flower before it was too late to pluck it but we were just gliding out of sight of the village spire before it occurred to us that the farmer in the adjacent meadow would go to church on the morrow and would carry this news for us and so by the monday while we should be floating on the merrimack our friend would be reaching to pluck this blossom on the bank of the concord  after a pause at balls hill the st anns of concord voyageurs not to say any prayer for the success of our voyage but to gather the few berries which were still left on the hills hanging by very slender threads we weighed anchor again and were soon out of sight of our native village  the land seemed to grow fairer as we withdrew from it  far away to the southwest lay the quiet village left alone under its elms and buttonwoods in mid afternoon and the hills notwithstanding their blue ethereal faces seemed to cast a saddened eye on their old playfellows but turning short to the north we bade adieu to their familiar outlines and addressed ourselves to new scenes and adventures  naught was familiar but the heavens from under whose roof the voyageur never passes but with their countenance and the acquaintance we had with river and wood we trusted to fare well under any circumstances  from this point the river runs perfectly straight for a mile or more to carlisle bridge which consists of twenty wooden piers and when we looked back over it its surface was reduced to a lines breadth and appeared like a cobweb gleaming in the sun here and there might be seen a pole sticking up to mark the place where some fisherman had enjoyed unusual luck and in return had consecrated his rod to the deities who preside over these shallows  it was full twice as broad as before deep and tranquil with a muddy bottom and bordered with willows beyond which spread broad lagoons covered with pads bulrushes and flags  late in the afternoon we passed a man on the shore fishing with a long birch pole its silvery bark left on and a dog at his side rowing so near as to agitate his cork with our oars and drive away luck for a season and when we had rowed a mile as straight as an arrow with our faces turned towards him and the bubbles in our wake still visible on the tranquil surface there stood the fisher still with his dog like statues under the other side of the heavens the only objects to relieve the eye in the extended meadow and there would he stand abiding his luck till he took his way home through the fields at evening with his fish  thus by one bait or another nature allures inhabitants into all her recesses  this man was the last of our townsmen whom we saw and we silently through him bade adieu to our friends   the characteristics and pursuits of various ages and races of men are always existing in epitome in every neighborhood  the pleasures of my earliest youth have become the inheritance of other men  this man is still a fisher and belongs to an era in which i myself have lived  perchance he is not confounded by many knowledges and has not sought out many inventions but how to take many fishes before the sun sets with his slender birchen pole and flaxen line that is invention enough for him  it is good even to be a fisherman in summer and in winter  some men are judges these august days sitting on benches even till the court rises they sit judging there honorably between the seasons and between meals leading a civil politic life arbitrating in the case of spaulding versus cummings it may be from highest noon till the red vesper sinks into the west  the fisherman meanwhile stands in three feet of water under the same summers sun arbitrating in other cases between muckworm and shiner amid the fragrance of waterlilies mint and pontederia leading his life many rods from the dry land within a poles length of where the larger fishes swim  human life is to him very much like a river     renning aie downward to the sea  this was his observation  his honor made a great discovery in bailments  i can just remember an old browncoated man who was the walton of this stream who had come over from newcastle england with his sonthe latter a stout and hearty man who had lifted an anchor in his day  a straight old man he was who took his way in silence through the meadows having passed the period of communication with his fellows his old experienced coat hanging long and straight and brown as the yellowpine bark glittering with so much smothered sunlight if you stood near enough no work of art but naturalized at length  i often discovered him unexpectedly amid the pads and the gray willows when he moved fishing in some old country methodfor youth and age then went a fishing togetherfull of incommunicable thoughts perchance about his own tyne and northumberland  he was always to be seen in serene afternoons haunting the river and almost rustling with the sedge so many sunny hours in an old mans life entrapping silly fish almost grown to be the suns familiar what need had he of hat or raiment any having served out his time and seen through such thin disguises  i have seen how his coeval fates rewarded him with the yellow perch and yet i thought his luck was not in proportion to his years and i have seen when with slow steps and weighed down with aged thoughts he disappeared with his fish under his lowroofed house on the skirts of the village  i think nobody else saw him nobody else remembers him now for he soon after died and migrated to new tyne streams  his fishing was not a sport nor solely a means of subsistence but a sort of solemn sacrament and withdrawal from the world just as the aged read their bibles   whether we live by the seaside or by the lakes and rivers or on the prairie it concerns us to attend to the nature of fishes since they are not phenomena confined to certain localities only but forms and phases of the life in nature universally dispersed the countless shoals which annually coast the shores of europe and america are not so interesting to the student of nature as the more fertile law itself which deposits their spawn on the tops of mountains and on the interior plains the fish principle in nature from which it results that they may be found in water in so many places in greater or less numbers  the natural historian is not a fisherman who prays for cloudy days and good luck merely but as fishing has been styled a contemplative mans recreation introducing him profitably to woods and water so the fruit of the naturalists observations is not in new genera or species but in new contemplations still and science is only a more contemplative mans recreation  the seeds of the life of fishes are everywhere disseminated whether the winds waft them or the waters float them or the deep earth holds them wherever a pond is dug straightway it is stocked with this vivacious race  they have a lease of nature and it is not yet out  the chinese are bribed to carry their ova from province to province in jars or in hollow reeds or the waterbirds to transport them to the mountain tarns and interior lakes  there are fishes wherever there is a fluid medium and even in clouds and in melted metals we detect their semblance  think how in winter you can sink a line down straight in a pasture through snow and through ice and pull up a bright slippery dumb subterranean silver or golden fish  it is curious also to reflect how they make one family from the largest to the smallest  the least minnow that lies on the ice as bait for pickerel looks like a huge seafish cast up on the shore  in the waters of this town there are about a dozen distinct species though the inexperienced would expect many more   it enhances our sense of the grand security and serenity of nature to observe the still undisturbed economy and content of the fishes of this century their happiness a regular fruit of the summer  the freshwater sunfish bream or ruff pomotis vulgaris as it were without ancestry without posterity still represents the freshwater sunfish in nature  it is the most common of all and seen on every urchins string a simple and inoffensive fish whose nests are visible all along the shore hollowed in the sand over which it is steadily poised through the summer hours on waving fin  sometimes there are twenty or thirty nests in the space of a few rods two feet wide by half a foot in depth and made with no little labor the weeds being removed and the sand shoved up on the sides like a bowl  here it may be seen early in summer assiduously brooding and driving away minnows and larger fishes even its own species which would disturb its ova pursuing them a few feet and circling round swiftly to its nest again the minnows like young sharks instantly entering the empty nests meanwhile and swallowing the spawn which is attached to the weeds and to the bottom on the sunny side  the spawn is exposed to so many dangers that a very small proportion can ever become fishes for beside being the constant prey of birds and fishes a great many nests are made so near the shore in shallow water that they are left dry in a few days as the river goes down  these and the lampreys are the only fishes nests that i have observed though the ova of some species may be seen floating on the surface  the breams are so careful of their charge that you may stand close by in the water and examine them at your leisure  i have thus stood over them half an hour at a time and stroked them familiarly without frightening them suffering them to nibble my fingers harmlessly and seen them erect their dorsal fins in anger when my hand approached their ova and have even taken them gently out of the water with my hand though this cannot be accomplished by a sudden movement however dexterous for instant warning is conveyed to them through their denser element but only by letting the fingers gradually close about them as they are poised over the palm and with the utmost gentleness raising them slowly to the surface  though stationary they keep up a constant sculling or waving motion with their fins which is exceedingly graceful and expressive of their humble happiness for unlike ours the element in which they live is a stream which must be constantly resisted  from time to time they nibble the weeds at the bottom or overhanging their nests or dart after a fly or a worm  the dorsal fin besides answering the purpose of a keel with the anal serves to keep the fish upright for in shallow water where this is not covered they fall on their sides  as you stand thus stooping over the bream in its nest the edges of the dorsal and caudal fins have a singular dusty golden reflection and its eyes which stand out from the head are transparent and colorless  seen in its native element it is a very beautiful and compact fish perfect in all its parts and looks like a brilliant coin fresh from the mint  it is a perfect jewel of the river the green red coppery and golden reflections of its mottled sides being the concentration of such rays as struggle through the floating pads and flowers to the sandy bottom and in harmony with the sunlit brown and yellow pebbles  behind its watery shield it dwells far from many accidents inevitable to human life  there is also another species of bream found in our river without the red spot on the operculum which according to m  agassiz is undescribed  the common perch perca flavescens which name describes well the gleaming golden reflections of its scales as it is drawn out of the water its red gills standing out in vain in the thin element is one of the handsomest and most regularly formed of our fishes and at such a moment as this reminds us of the fish in the picture which wished to be restored to its native element until it had grown larger and indeed most of this species that are caught are not half grown  in the ponds there is a lightcolored and slender kind which swim in shoals of many hundreds in the sunny water in company with the shiner averaging not more than six or seven inches in length while only a few larger specimens are found in the deepest water which prey upon their weaker brethren  i have often attracted these small perch to the shore at evening by rippling the water with my fingers and they may sometimes be caught while attempting to pass inside your hands  it is a tough and heedless fish biting from impulse without nibbling and from impulse refraining to bite and sculling indifferently past  it rather prefers the clear water and sandy bottoms though here it has not much choice  it is a true fish such as the angler loves to put into his basket or hang at the top of his willow twig in shady afternoons along the banks of the stream  so many unquestionable fishes he counts and so many shiners which he counts and then throws away  old josselyn in his new englands rarities published in 1672 mentions the perch or river partridge  the chivin dace roach cousin trout or whatever else it is called leuciscus pulchellus white and red always an unexpected prize which however any angler is glad to hook for its rarity  a name that reminds us of many an unsuccessful ramble by swift streams when the wind rose to disappoint the fisher  it is commonly a silvery softscaled fish of graceful scholarlike and classical look like many a picture in an english book  it loves a swift current and a sandy bottom and bites inadvertently yet not without appetite for the bait  the minnows are used as bait for pickerel in the winter  the red chivin according to some is still the same fish only older or with its tints deepened as they think by the darker water it inhabits as the red clouds swim in the twilight atmosphere  he who has not hooked the red chivin is not yet a complete angler other fishes methinks are slightly amphibious but this is a denizen of the water wholly  the cork goes dancing down the swiftrushing stream amid the weeds and sands when suddenly by a coincidence never to be remembered emerges this fabulous inhabitant of another element a thing heard of but not seen as if it were the instant creation of an eddy a true product of the running stream  and this bright cupreous dolphin was spawned and has passed its life beneath the level of your feet in your native fields  fishes too as well as birds and clouds derive their armor from the mine  i have heard of mackerel visiting the copper banks at a particular season this fish perchance has its habitat in the coppermine river  i have caught white chivin of great size in the aboljacknagesic where it empties into the penobscot at the base of mount ktaadn but no red ones there  the latter variety seems not to have been sufficiently observed  the dace leuciscus argenteus is a slight silvery minnow found generally in the middle of the stream where the current is most rapid and frequently confounded with the last named  the shiner leuciscus crysoleucas is a softscaled and tender fish the victim of its stronger neighbors found in all places deep and shallow clear and turbid generally the first nibbler at the bait but with its small mouth and nibbling propensities not easily caught  it is a gold or silver bit that passes current in the river its limber tail dimpling the surface in sport or flight  i have seen the fry when frightened by something thrown into the water leap out by dozens together with the dace and wreck themselves upon a floating plank  it is the little lightinfant of the river with body armor of gold or silver spangles slipping gliding its life through with a quirk of the tail half in the water half in the air upward and ever upward with flitting fin to more crystalline tides yet still abreast of us dwellers on the bank  it is almost dissolved by the summer heats  a slighter and lighter colored shiner is found in one of our ponds  the pickerel esox reticulatus the swiftest wariest and most ravenous of fishes which josselyn calls the freshwater or river wolf is very common in the shallow and weedy lagoons along the sides of the stream  it is a solemn stately ruminant fish lurking under the shadow of a pad at noon with still circumspect voracious eye motionless as a jewel set in water or moving slowly along to take up its position darting from time to time at such unlucky fish or frog or insect as comes within its range and swallowing it at a gulp  i have caught one which had swallowed a brother pickerel half as large as itself with the tail still visible in its mouth while the head was already digested in its stomach  sometimes a striped snake bound to greener meadows across the stream ends its undulatory progress in the same receptacle  they are so greedy and impetuous that they are frequently caught by being entangled in the line the moment it is cast  fishermen also distinguish the brook pickerel a shorter and thicker fish than the former  the horned pout pimelodus nebulosus sometimes called minister from the peculiar squeaking noise it makes when drawn out of the water is a dull and blundering fellow and like the eel vespertinal in his habits and fond of the mud  it bites deliberately as if about its business  they are taken at night with a mass of worms strung on a thread which catches in their teeth sometimes three or four with an eel at one pull  they are extremely tenacious of life opening and shutting their mouths for half an hour after their heads have been cut off  a bloodthirsty and bullying race of rangers inhabiting the fertile river bottoms with ever a lance in rest and ready to do battle with their nearest neighbor  i have observed them in summer when every other one had a long and bloody scar upon his back where the skin was gone the mark perhaps of some fierce encounter  sometimes the fry not an inch long are seen darkening the shore with their myriads  the suckers catostomi bostonienses and tuberculati common and horned perhaps on an average the largest of our fishes may be seen in shoals of a hundred or more stemming the current in the sun on their mysterious migrations and sometimes sucking in the bait which the fisherman suffers to float toward them  the former which sometimes grow to a large size are frequently caught by the hand in the brooks or like the red chivin are jerked out by a hook fastened firmly to the end of a stick and placed under their jaws  they are hardly known to the mere angler however not often biting at his baits though the spearer carries home many a mess in the spring  to our village eyes these shoals have a foreign and imposing aspect realizing the fertility of the seas  the common eel too muraena bostoniensis the only species of eel known in the state a slimy squirming creature informed of mud still squirming in the pan is speared and hooked up with various success  methinks it too occurs in picture left after the deluge in many a meadow high and dry  in the shallow parts of the river where the current is rapid and the bottom pebbly you may sometimes see the curious circular nests of the lamprey eel petromyzon americanus the american stonesucker as large as a cartwheel a foot or two in height and sometimes rising half a foot above the surface of the water  they collect these stones of the size of a hens egg with their mouths as their name implies and are said to fashion them into circles with their tails  they ascend falls by clinging to the stones which may sometimes be raised by lifting the fish by the tail  as they are not seen on their way down the streams it is thought by fishermen that they never return but waste away and die clinging to rocks and stumps of trees for an indefinite period a tragic feature in the scenery of the river bottoms worthy to be remembered with shakespeares description of the seafloor  they are rarely seen in our waters at present on account of the dams though they are taken in great quantities at the mouth of the river in lowell  their nests which are very conspicuous look more like art than anything in the river  if we had leisure this afternoon we might turn our prow up the brooks in quest of the classical trout and the minnows  of the last alone according to m  agassiz several of the species found in this town are yet undescribed  these would perhaps complete the list of our finny contemporaries in the concord waters  salmon shad and alewives were formerly abundant here and taken in weirs by the indians who taught this method to the whites by whom they were used as food and as manure until the dam and afterward the canal at billerica and the factories at lowell put an end to their migrations hitherward though it is thought that a few more enterprising shad may still occasionally be seen in this part of the river  it is said to account for the destruction of the fishery that those who at that time represented the interests of the fishermen and the fishes remembering between what dates they were accustomed to take the grown shad stipulated that the dams should be left open for that season only and the fry which go down a month later were consequently stopped and destroyed by myriads  others say that the fishways were not properly constructed  perchance after a few thousands of years if the fishes will be patient and pass their summers elsewhere meanwhile nature will have levelled the billerica dam and the lowell factories and the grassground river run clear again to be explored by new migratory shoals even as far as the hopkinton pond and westborough swamp  one would like to know more of that race now extinct whose seines lie rotting in the garrets of their children who openly professed the trade of fishermen and even fed their townsmen creditably not skulking through the meadows to a rainy afternoon sport  dim visions we still get of miraculous draughts of fishes and heaps uncountable by the riverside from the tales of our seniors sent on horseback in their childhood from the neighboring towns perched on saddlebags with instructions to get the one bag filled with shad the other with alewives  at least one memento of those days may still exist in the memory of this generation in the familiar appellation of a celebrated trainband of this town whose untrained ancestors stood creditably at concord north bridge  their captain a man of piscatory tastes having duly warned his company to turn out on a certain day they like obedient soldiers appeared promptly on parade at the appointed time but unfortunately they went undrilled except in the manuoevres of a soldiers wit and unlicensed jesting that may day for their captain forgetting his own appointment and warned only by the favorable aspect of the heavens as he had often done before went afishing that afternoon and his company thenceforth was known to old and young grave and gay as the shad and by the youths of this vicinity this was long regarded as the proper name of all the irregular militia in christendom  but alas no record of these fishers lives remains that we know unless it be one brief page of hard but unquestionable history which occurs in day book no  4 of an old trader of this town long since dead which shows pretty plainly what constituted a fishermans stock in trade in those days  it purports to be a fishermans account current probably for the fishing season of the year 1805 during which months he purchased daily rum and sugar sugar and rum n e  and w i one cod line one brown mug and a line for the seine rum and sugar sugar and rum good loaf sugar and good brown w i  and n e in short and uniform entries to the bottom of the page all carried out in pounds shillings and pence from march 25th to june 5th and promptly settled by receiving cash in full at the last date  but perhaps not so settled altogether  these were the necessaries of life in those days with salmon shad and alewives fresh and pickled he was thereafter independent on the groceries  rather a preponderance of the fluid elements but such is the fishermans nature  i can faintly remember to have seen this same fisher in my earliest youth still as near the river as he could get with uncertain undulatory step after so many things had gone down stream swinging a scythe in the meadow his bottle like a serpent hid in the grass himself as yet not cut down by the great mower  surely the fates are forever kind though natures laws are more immutable than any despots yet to mans daily life they rarely seem rigid but permit him to relax with license in summer weather  he is not harshly reminded of the things he may not do  she is very kind and liberal to all men of vicious habits and certainly does not deny them quarter they do not die without priest  still they maintain life along the way keeping this side the styx still hearty still resolute never better in their lives and again after a dozen years have elapsed they start up from behind a hedge asking for work and wages for ablebodied men  who has not met such         a beggar on the way    who sturdily could gang     who cared neither for wind nor wet    in lands whereer he past     that bold adopts each house he views his own    makes every pulse his checquer and at pleasure    walks forth and taxes all the world like caesar  as if consistency were the secret of health while the poor inconsistent aspirant man seeking to live a pure life feeding on air divided against himself cannot stand but pines and dies after a life of sickness on beds of down  the unwise are accustomed to speak as if some were not sick but methinks the difference between men in respect to health is not great enough to lay much stress upon  some are reputed sick and some are not  it often happens that the sicker man is the nurse to the sounder  shad are still taken in the basin of concord river at lowell where they are said to be a month earlier than the merrimack shad on account of the warmth of the water  still patiently almost pathetically with instinct not to be discouraged not to be reasoned with revisiting their old haunts as if their stern fates would relent and still met by the corporation with its dam  poor shad  where is thy redress  when nature gave thee instinct gave she thee the heart to bear thy fate  still wandering the sea in thy scaly armor to inquire humbly at the mouths of rivers if man has perchance left them free for thee to enter  by countless shoals loitering uncertain meanwhile merely stemming the tide there in danger from sea foes in spite of thy bright armor awaiting new instructions until the sands until the water itself tell thee if it be so or not  thus by whole migrating nations full of instinct which is thy faith in this backward spring turned adrift and perchance knowest not where men do not dwell where there are not factories in these days  armed with no sword no electric shock but mere shad armed only with innocence and a just cause with tender dumb mouth only forward and scales easy to be detached  i for one am with thee and who knows what may avail a crowbar against that billerica damnot despairing when whole myriads have gone to feed those sea monsters during thy suspense but still brave indifferent on easy fin there like shad reserved for higher destinies  willing to be decimated for mans behoof after the spawning season  away with the superficial and selfish philanthropy of menwho knows what admirable virtue of fishes may be below lowwatermark bearing up against a hard destiny not admired by that fellowcreature who alone can appreciate it  who hears the fishes when they cry  it will not be forgotten by some memory that we were contemporaries  thou shalt erelong have thy way up the rivers up all the rivers of the globe if i am not mistaken  yea even thy dull watery dream shall be more than realized  if it were not so but thou wert to be overlooked at first and at last then would not i take their heaven  yes i say so who think i know better than thou canst keep a stiff fin then and stem all the tides thou mayst meet  at length it would seem that the interests not of the fishes only but of the men of wayland of sudbury of concord demand the levelling of that dam  innumerable acres of meadow are waiting to be made dry land wild native grass to give place to english  the farmers stand with scythes whet waiting the subsiding of the waters by gravitation by evaporation or otherwise but sometimes their eyes do not rest their wheels do not roll on the quaking meadow ground during the haying season at all  so many sources of wealth inaccessible  they rate the loss hereby incurred in the single town of wayland alone as equal to the expense of keeping a hundred yoke of oxen the year round  one year as i learn not long ago the farmers standing ready to drive their teams afield as usual the water gave no signs of falling without new attraction in the heavens without freshet or visible cause still standing stagnant at an unprecedented height  all hydrometers were at fault some trembled for their english even  but speedy emissaries revealed the unnatural secret in the new floatboard wholly a foot in width added to their already too high privileges by the dam proprietors  the hundred yoke of oxen meanwhile standing patient gazing wishfully meadowward at that inaccessible waving native grass uncut but by the great mower time who cuts so broad a swathe without so much as a wisp to wind about their horns   that was a long pull from balls hill to carlisle bridge sitting with our faces to the south a slight breeze rising from the north but nevertheless water still runs and grass grows for now having passed the bridge between carlisle and bedford we see men haying far off in the meadow their heads waving like the grass which they cut  in the distance the wind seemed to bend all alike  as the night stole over such a freshness was wafted across the meadow that every blade of cut grass seemed to teem with life  faint purple clouds began to be reflected in the water and the cowbells tinkled louder along the banks while like sly waterrats we stole along nearer the shore looking for a place to pitch our camp  at length when we had made about seven miles as far as billerica we moored our boat on the west side of a little rising ground which in the spring forms an island in the river  here we found huckleberries still hanging upon the bushes where they seemed to have slowly ripened for our especial use  bread and sugar and cocoa boiled in river water made our repast and as we had drank in the fluvial prospect all day so now we took a draft of the water with our evening meal to propitiate the river gods and whet our vision for the sights it was to behold  the sun was setting on the one hand while our eminence was contributing its shadow to the night on the other  it seemed insensibly to grow lighter as the night shut in and a distant and solitary farmhouse was revealed which before lurked in the shadows of the noon  there was no other house in sight nor any cultivated field  to the right and left as far as the horizon were straggling pine woods with their plumes against the sky and across the river were rugged hills covered with shrub oaks tangled with grapevines and ivy with here and there a gray rock jutting out from the maze  the sides of these cliffs though a quarter of a mile distant were almost heard to rustle while we looked at them it was such a leafy wilderness a place for fauns and satyrs and where bats hung all day to the rocks and at evening flitted over the water and fireflies husbanded their light under the grass and leaves against the night  when we had pitched our tent on the hillside a few rods from the shore we sat looking through its triangular door in the twilight at our lonely mast on the shore just seen above the alders and hardly yet come to a standstill from the swaying of the stream the first encroachment of commerce on this land  there was our port our ostia  that straight geometrical line against the water and the sky stood for the last refinements of civilized life and what of sublimity there is in history was there symbolized  for the most part there was no recognition of human life in the night no human breathing was heard only the breathing of the wind  as we sat up kept awake by the novelty of our situation we heard at intervals foxes stepping about over the dead leaves and brushing the dewy grass close to our tent and once a musquash fumbling among the potatoes and melons in our boat but when we hastened to the shore we could detect only a ripple in the water ruffling the disk of a star  at intervals we were serenaded by the song of a dreaming sparrow or the throttled cry of an owl but after each sound which near at hand broke the stillness of the night each crackling of the twigs or rustling among the leaves there was a sudden pause and deeper and more conscious silence as if the intruder were aware that no life was rightfully abroad at that hour  there was a fire in lowell as we judged this night and we saw the horizon blazing and heard the distant alarmbells as it were a faint tinkling music borne to these woods  but the most constant and memorable sound of a summers night which we did not fail to hear every night afterward though at no time so incessantly and so favorably as now was the barking of the housedogs from the loudest and hoarsest bark to the faintest aerial palpitation under the eaves of heaven from the patient but anxious mastiff to the timid and wakeful terrier at first loud and rapid then faint and slow to be imitated only in a whisper wowwowwowwowwowoww even in a retired and uninhabited district like this it was a sufficiency of sound for the ear of night and more impressive than any music  i have heard the voice of a hound just before daylight while the stars were shining from over the woods and river far in the horizon when it sounded as sweet and melodious as an instrument  the hounding of a dog pursuing a fox or other animal in the horizon may have first suggested the notes of the huntinghorn to alternate with and relieve the lungs of the dog this natural bugle long resounded in the woods of the ancient world before the horn was invented  the very dogs that sullenly bay the moon from farmyards in these nights excite more heroism in our breasts than all the civil exhortations or war sermons of the age  i would rather be a dog and bay the moon than many a roman that i know  the night is equally indebted to the clarion of the cock with wakeful hope from the very setting of the sun prematurely ushering in the dawn  all these sounds the crowing of cocks the baying of dogs and the hum of insects at noon are the evidence of natures health or sound state  such is the neverfailing beauty and accuracy of language the most perfect art in the world the chisel of a thousand years retouches it  at length the antepenultimate and drowsy hours drew on and all sounds were denied entrance to our ears       who sleeps by day and walks by night      will meet no spirit but some sprite     page                            sunday              the river calmly flows         through shining banks through lonely glen      where the owl shrieks though neer the cheer of men            has stirred its mute repose      still if you should walk there you would go there again                                           channing   page      the indians tell us of a beautiful river lying far to the south which they call merrimack                sieur de monts relations of the jesuits 1604   page                            sunday                             in the morning the river and adjacent country were covered with a dense fog through which the smoke of our fire curled up like a still subtiler mist but before we had rowed many rods the sun arose and the fog rapidly dispersed leaving a slight steam only to curl along the surface of the water  it was a quiet sunday morning with more of the auroral rosy and white than of the yellow light in it as if it dated from earlier than the fall of man and still preserved a heathenish integrity       an early unconverted saint      free from noontide or evening taint      heathen without reproach      that did upon the civil day encroach      and ever since its birth      had trod the outskirts of the earth  but the impressions which the morning makes vanish with its dews and not even the most persevering mortal can preserve the memory of its freshness to midday  as we passed the various islands or what were islands in the spring rowing with our backs down stream we gave names to them  the one on which we had camped we called fox island and one fine densely wooded island surrounded by deep water and overrun by grapevines which looked like a mass of verdure and of flowers cast upon the waves we named grape island  from balls hill to billerica meetinghouse the river was still twice as broad as in concord a deep dark and dead stream flowing between gentle hills and sometimes cliffs and well wooded all the way  it was a long woodland lake bordered with willows  for long reaches we could see neither house nor cultivated field nor any sign of the vicinity of man  now we coasted along some shallow shore by the edge of a dense palisade of bulrushes which straightly bounded the water as if clipt by art reminding us of the reed forts of the eastindians of which we had read and now the bank slightly raised was overhung with graceful grasses and various species of brake whose downy stems stood closely grouped and naked as in a vase while their heads spread several feet on either side  the dead limbs of the willow were rounded and adorned by the climbing mikania mikania scandens which filled every crevice in the leafy bank contrasting agreeably with the gray bark of its supporter and the balls of the buttonbush  the water willow salix purshiana when it is of large size and entire is the most graceful and ethereal of our trees  its masses of light green foliage piled one upon another to the height of twenty or thirty feet seemed to float on the surface of the water while the slight gray stems and the shore were hardly visible between them  no tree is so wedded to the water and harmonizes so well with still streams  it is even more graceful than the weeping willow or any pendulous trees which dip their branches in the stream instead of being buoyed up by it  its limbs curved outward over the surface as if attracted by it  it had not a new england but an oriental character reminding us of trim persian gardens of haroun alraschid and the artificial lakes of the east  as we thus dipped our way along between fresh masses of foliage overrun with the grape and smaller flowering vines the surface was so calm and both air and water so transparent that the flight of a kingfisher or robin over the river was as distinctly seen reflected in the water below as in the air above  the birds seemed to flit through submerged groves alighting on the yielding sprays and their clear notes to come up from below  we were uncertain whether the water floated the land or the land held the water in its bosom  it was such a season in short as that in which one of our concord poets sailed on its stream and sung its quiet glories     there is an inward voice that in the stream    sends forth its spirit to the listening ear    and in a calm content it floweth on    like wisdom welcome with its own respect    clear in its breast lie all these beauteous thoughts    it doth receive the green and graceful trees    and the gray rocks smile in its peaceful arms  and more he sung but too serious for our page  for every oak and birch too growing on the hilltop as well as for these elms and willows we knew that there was a graceful ethereal and ideal tree making down from the roots and sometimes nature in high tides brings her mirror to its foot and makes it visible  the stillness was intense and almost conscious as if it were a natural sabbath and we fancied that the morning was the evening of a celestial day  the air was so elastic and crystalline that it had the same effect on the landscape that a glass has on a picture to give it an ideal remoteness and perfection  the landscape was clothed in a mild and quiet light in which the woods and fences checkered and partitioned it with new regularity and rough and uneven fields stretched away with lawnlike smoothness to the horizon and the clouds finely distinct and picturesque seemed a fit drapery to hang over fairyland  the world seemed decked for some holiday or prouder pageantry with silken streamers flying and the course of our lives to wind on before us like a green lane into a country maze at the season when fruittrees are in blossom  why should not our whole life and its scenery be actually thus fair and distinct  all our lives want a suitable background  they should at least like the life of the anchorite be as impressive to behold as objects in the desert a broken shaft or crumbling mound against a limitless horizon  character always secures for itself this advantage and is thus distinct and unrelated to near or trivial objects whether things or persons  on this same stream a maiden once sailed in my boat thus unattended but by invisible guardians and as she sat in the prow there was nothing but herself between the steersman and the sky  i could then say with the poet           sweet falls the summer air       over her frame who sails with me       her way like that is beautifully free          her nature far more rare    and is her constant heart of virgin purity  at evening still the very stars seem but this maidens emissaries and reporters of her progress     low in the eastern sky    is set thy glancing eye    and though its gracious light    neer riseth to my sight    yet every star that climbs    above the gnarled limbs        of yonder hill    conveys thy gentle will     believe i knew thy thought    and that the zephyrs brought    thy kindest wishes through    as mine they bear to you    that some attentive cloud    did pause amid the crowd        over my head    while gentle things were said     believe the thrushes sung    and that the flowerbells rung    that herbs exhaled their scent    and beasts knew what was meant    the trees a welcome waved    and lakes their margins laved        when thy free mind    to my retreat did wind     it was a summer eve    the air did gently heave    while yet a lowhung cloud    thy eastern skies did shroud    the lightnings silent gleam    startling my drowsy dream        seemed like the flash    under thy dark eyelash     still will i strive to be    as if thou wert with me    whatever path i take    it shall be for thy sake    of gentle slope and wide    as thou wert by my side        without a root    to trip thy gentle foot     i ll walk with gentle pace    and choose the smoothest place    and careful dip the oar    and shun the winding shore    and gently steer my boat    where waterlilies float        and cardinal flowers    stand in their sylvan bowers  it required some rudeness to disturb with our boat the mirrorlike surface of the water in which every twig and blade of grass was so faithfully reflected too faithfully indeed for art to imitate for only nature may exaggerate herself  the shallowest still water is unfathomable  wherever the trees and skies are reflected there is more than atlantic depth and no danger of fancy running aground  we notice that it required a separate intention of the eye a more free and abstracted vision to see the reflected trees and the sky than to see the river bottom merely and so are there manifold visions in the direction of every object and even the most opaque reflect the heavens from their surface  some men have their eyes naturally intended to the one and some to the other object           a man that looks on glass             on it may stay his eye           or if he pleaseth through it pass             and the heavens espy  two men in a skiff whom we passed hereabouts floating buoyantly amid the reflections of the trees like a feather in midair or a leaf which is wafted gently from its twig to the water without turning over seemed still in their element and to have very delicately availed themselves of the natural laws  their floating there was a beautiful and successful experiment in natural philosophy and it served to ennoble in our eyes the art of navigation for as birds fly and fishes swim so these men sailed  it reminded us how much fairer and nobler all the actions of man might be and that our life in its whole economy might be as beautiful as the fairest works of art or nature  the sun lodged on the old gray cliffs and glanced from every pad the bulrushes and flags seemed to rejoice in the delicious light and air the meadows were adrinking at their leisure the frogs sat meditating all sabbath thoughts summing up their week with one eye out on the golden sun and one toe upon a reed eying the wondrous universe in which they act their part the fishes swam more staid and soberly as maidens go to church shoals of golden and silver minnows rose to the surface to behold the heavens and then sheered off into more sombre aisles they swept by as if moved by one mind continually gliding past each other and yet preserving the form of their battalion unchanged as if they were still embraced by the transparent membrane which held the spawn a young band of brethren and sisters trying their new fins now they wheeled now shot ahead and when we drove them to the shore and cut them off they dexterously tacked and passed underneath the boat  over the old wooden bridges no traveller crossed and neither the river nor the fishes avoided to glide between the abutments  here was a village not far off behind the woods billerica settled not long ago and the children still bear the names of the first settlers in this late howling wilderness yet to all intents and purposes it is as old as fernay or as mantua an old gray town where men grow old and sleep already under mossgrown monumentsoutgrow their usefulness  this is ancient billerica villarica now in its dotage named from the english billericay and whose indian name was shawshine  i never heard that it was young  see is not nature here gone to decay farms all run out meetinghouse grown gray and racked with age  if you would know of its early youth ask those old gray rocks in the pasture  it has a bell that sounds sometimes as far as concord woods i have heard thatay hear it now  no wonder that such a sound startled the dreaming indian and frightened his game when the first bells were swung on trees and sounded through the forest beyond the plantations of the white man  but today i like best the echo amid these cliffs and woods  it is no feeble imitation but rather its original or as if some rural orpheus played over the strain again to show how it should sound     dong sounds the brass in the east    as if to a funeral feast    but i like that sound the best    out of the fluttering west     the steeple ringeth a knell    but the fairies silvery bell    is the voice of that gentle folk    or else the horizon that spoke     its metal is not of brass    but air and water and glass    and under a cloud it is swung    and by the wind it is rung     when the steeple tolleth the noon    it soundeth not so soon    yet it rings a far earlier hour    and the sun has not reached its tower  on the other hand the road runs up to carlisle city of the woods which if it is less civil is the more natural  it does well hold the earth together  it gets laughed at because it is a small town i know but nevertheless it is a place where great men may be born any day for fair winds and foul blow right on over it without distinction  it has a meetinghouse and horsesheds a tavern and a blacksmiths shop for centre and a good deal of wood to cut and cord yet  and       bedford most noble bedford      i shall not thee forget  history has remembered thee especially that meek and humble petition of thy old planters like the wailing of the lords own people to the gentlemen the selectmen of concord praying to be erected into a separate parish  we can hardly credit that so plaintive a psalm resounded but little more than a century ago along these babylonish waters  in the extreme difficult seasons of heat and cold said they we were ready to say of the sabbath behold what a weariness is itgentlemen if our seeking to draw off proceed from any disaffection to our present reverend pastor or the christian society with whom we have taken such sweet counsel together and walked unto the house of god in company then hear us not this day but we greatly desire if god please to be eased of our burden on the sabbath the travel and fatigue thereof that the word of god may be nigh to us near to our houses and in our hearts that we and our little ones may serve the lord  we hope that god who stirred up the spirit of cyrus to set forward temple work has stirred us up to ask and will stir you up to grant the prayer of our petition so shall your humble petitioners ever pray as in duty bound and so the temple work went forward here to a happy conclusion  yonder in carlisle the building of the temple was many wearisome years delayed not that there was wanting of shittim wood or the gold of ophir but a site therefor convenient to all the worshippers whether on buttricks plain or rather on poplar hillit was a tedious question  in this billerica solid men must have lived select from year to year a series of town clerks at least and there are old records that you may search  some spring the white man came built him a house and made a clearing here letting in the sun dried up a farm piled up the old gray stones in fences cut down the pines around his dwelling planted orchard seeds brought from the old country and persuaded the civil appletree to blossom next to the wild pine and the juniper shedding its perfume in the wilderness  their old stocks still remain  he culled the graceful elm from out the woods and from the riverside and so refined and smoothed his village plot  he rudely bridged the stream and drove his team afield into the river meadows cut the wild grass and laid bare the homes of beaver otter muskrat and with the whetting of his scythe scared off the deer and bear he set up a mill and fields of english grain sprang in the virgin soil  and with his grain he scattered the seeds of the dandelion and the wild trefoil over the meadows mingling his english flowers with the wild native ones  the bristling burdock the sweetscented catnip and the humble yarrow planted themselves along his woodland road they too seeking freedom to worship god in their way  and thus he plants a town  the white mans mullein soon reigned in indian cornfields and sweetscented english grasses clothed the new soil  where then could the red man set his foot  the honeybee hummed through the massachusetts woods and sipped the wildflowers round the indians wigwam perchance unnoticed when with prophetic warning it stung the red childs hand forerunner of that industrious tribe that was to come and pluck the wildflower of his race up by the root  the white man comes pale as the dawn with a load of thought with a slumbering intelligence as a fire raked up knowing well what he knows not guessing but calculating strong in community yielding obedience to authority of experienced race of wonderful wonderful common sense dull but capable slow but persevering severe but just of little humor but genuine a laboring man despising game and sport building a house that endures a framed house  he buys the indians moccasins and baskets then buys his huntinggrounds and at length forgets where he is buried and ploughs up his bones  and here town records old tattered timeworn weatherstained chronicles contain the indian sachems mark perchance an arrow or a beaver and the few fatal words by which he deeded his huntinggrounds away  he comes with a list of ancient saxon norman and celtic names and strews them up and down this riverframingham sudbury bedford carlisle billerica chelmsfordand this is new angleland and these are the new west saxons whom the red men call not angleish or english but yengeese and so at last they are known for yankees  when we were opposite to the middle of billerica the fields on either hand had a soft and cultivated english aspect the village spire being seen over the copses which skirt the river and sometimes an orchard straggled down to the waterside though generally our course this forenoon was the wildest part of our voyage  it seemed that men led a quiet and very civil life there  the inhabitants were plainly cultivators of the earth and lived under an organized political government  the schoolhouse stood with a meek aspect entreating a long truce to war and savage life  every one finds by his own experience as well as in history that the era in which men cultivate the apple and the amenities of the garden is essentially different from that of the hunter and forest life and neither can displace the other without loss  we have all had our daydreams as well as more prophetic nocturnal vision but as for farming i am convinced that my genius dates from an older era than the agricultural  i would at least strike my spade into the earth with such careless freedom but accuracy as the woodpecker his bill into a tree  there is in my nature methinks a singular yearning toward all wildness  i know of no redeeming qualities in myself but a sincere love for some things and when i am reproved i fall back on to this ground  what have i to do with ploughs  i cut another furrow than you see  where the off ox treads there is it not it is farther off where the nigh ox walks it will not be it is nigher still  if corn fails my crop fails not and what are drought and rain to me  the rude saxon pioneer will sometimes pine for that refinement and artificial beauty which are english and love to hear the sound of such sweet and classical names as the pentland and malvern hills the cliffs of dover and the trosachs richmond derwent and winandermere which are to him now instead of the acropolis and parthenon of baiae and athens with its seawalls and arcadia and tempe       greece who am i that should remember thee      thy marathon and thy thermopylae      is my life vulgar my fate mean      which on these golden memories can lean  we are apt enough to be pleased with such books as evelyns sylva acetarium and kalendarium hortense but they imply a relaxed nerve in the reader  gardening is civil and social but it wants the vigor and freedom of the forest and the outlaw there may be an excess of cultivation as well as of anything else until civilization becomes pathetic  a highly cultivated manall whose bones can be bent  whose heavenborn virtues are but good manners  the young pines springing up in the cornfields from year to year are to me a refreshing fact  we talk of civilizing the indian but that is not the name for his improvement  by the wary independence and aloofness of his dim forest life he preserves his intercourse with his native gods and is admitted from time to time to a rare and peculiar society with nature  he has glances of starry recognition to which our saloons are strangers  the steady illumination of his genius dim only because distant is like the faint but satisfying light of the stars compared with the dazzling but ineffectual and shortlived blaze of candles  the societyislanders had their dayborn gods but they were not supposed to be of equal antiquity with the atua fauau po or nightborn gods  it is true there are the innocent pleasures of country life and it is sometimes pleasant to make the earth yield her increase and gather the fruits in their season but the heroic spirit will not fail to dream of remoter retirements and more rugged paths  it will have its gardenplots and its parterres elsewhere than on the earth and gather nuts and berries by the way for its subsistence or orchard fruits with such heedlessness as berries we would not always be soothing and taming nature breaking the horse and the ox but sometimes ride the horse wild and chase the buffalo  the indians intercourse with nature is at least such as admits of the greatest independence of each  if he is somewhat of a stranger in her midst the gardener is too much of a familiar  there is something vulgar and foul in the latters closeness to his mistress something noble and cleanly in the formers distance  in civilization as in a southern latitude man degenerates at length and yields to the incursion of more northern tribes       some nation yet shut in         with hills of ice  there are other savager and more primeval aspects of nature than our poets have sung  it is only white mans poetry  homer and ossian even can never revive in london or boston  and yet behold how these cities are refreshed by the mere tradition or the imperfectly transmitted fragrance and flavor of these wild fruits  if we could listen but for an instant to the chant of the indian muse we should understand why he will not exchange his savageness for civilization  nations are not whimsical  steel and blankets are strong temptations but the indian does well to continue indian  after sitting in my chamber many days reading the poets i have been out early on a foggy morning and heard the cry of an owl in a neighboring wood as from a nature behind the common unexplored by science or by literature  none of the feathered race has yet realized my youthful conceptions of the woodland depths  i had seen the red electionbird brought from their recesses on my comrades string and fancied that their plumage would assume stranger and more dazzling colors like the tints of evening in proportion as i advanced farther into the darkness and solitude of the forest  still less have i seen such strong and wilderness tints on any poets string  these modern ingenious sciences and arts do not affect me as those more venerable arts of hunting and fishing and even of husbandry in its primitive and simple form as ancient and honorable trades as the sun and moon and winds pursue coeval with the faculties of man and invented when these were invented we do not know their john gutenberg or richard arkwright though the poets would fain make them to have been gradually learned and taught  according to gower       and iadahel as saith the boke        firste made nette and fishes toke      of huntyng eke he fond the chace      whiche nowe is knowe in many place      a tent of clothe with corde and stake      he sette up first and did it make  also lydgate says       jason first sayled in story it is tolde      toward colchos to wynne the flees of golde      ceres the goddess fond first the tilthe of londe                                              also aristeus fonde first the usage      of mylke and cruddis and of honey swote      peryodes for grete avauntage      from flyntes smote fuyre daryng in the roote  we read that aristeus obtained of jupiter and neptune that the pestilential heat of the dogdays wherein was great mortality should be mitigated with wind this is one of those dateless benefits conferred on man which have no record in our vulgar day though we still find some similitude to them in our dreams in which we have a more liberal and juster apprehension of things unconstrained by habit which is then in some measure put off and divested of memory which we call history  according to fable when the island of aegina was depopulated by sickness at the instance of aeacus jupiter turned the ants into men that is as some think he made men of the inhabitants who lived meanly like ants  this is perhaps the fullest history of those early days extant   the fable which is naturally and truly composed so as to satisfy the imagination ere it addresses the understanding beautiful though strange as a wildflower is to the wise man an apothegm and admits of his most generous interpretation  when we read that bacchus made the tyrrhenian mariners mad so that they leapt into the sea mistaking it for a meadow full of flowers and so became dolphins we are not concerned about the historical truth of this but rather a higher poetical truth  we seem to hear the music of a thought and care not if the understanding be not gratified  for their beauty consider the fables of narcissus of endymion of memnon son of morning the representative of all promising youths who have died a premature death and whose memory is melodiously prolonged to the latest morning the beautiful stories of phaeton and of the sirens whose isle shone afar off white with the bones of unburied men and the pregnant ones of pan prometheus and the sphinx and that long list of names which have already become part of the universal language of civilized men and from proper are becoming common names or nounsthe sibyls the eumenides the parcae the graces the muses nemesis c  it is interesting to observe with what singular unanimity the farthest sundered nations and generations consent to give completeness and roundness to an ancient fable of which they indistinctly appreciate the beauty or the truth  by a faint and dreamlike effort though it be only by the vote of a scientific body the dullest posterity slowly add some trait to the mythus as when astronomers call the lately discovered planet neptune or the asteroid astraea that the virgin who was driven from earth to heaven at the end of the golden age may have her local habitation in the heavens more distinctly assigned herfor the slightest recognition of poetic worth is significant  by such slow aggregation has mythology grown from the first  the very nursery tales of this generation were the nursery tales of primeval races  they migrate from east to west and again from west to east now expanded into the tale divine of bards now shrunk into a popular rhyme  this is an approach to that universal language which men have sought in vain  this fond reiteration of the oldest expressions of truth by the latest posterity content with slightly and religiously retouching the old material is the most impressive proof of a common humanity  all nations love the same jests and tales jews christians and mahometans and the same translated suffice for all  all men are children and of one family  the same tale sends them all to bed and wakes them in the morning  joseph wolff the missionary distributed copies of robinson crusoe translated into arabic among the arabs and they made a great sensation robinson crusoes adventures and wisdom says he were read by mahometans in the marketplaces of sanaa hodyeda and loheya and admired and believed on reading the book the arabians exclaimed o that robinson crusoe must have been a great prophet  to some extent mythology is only the most ancient history and biography  so far from being false or fabulous in the common sense it contains only enduring and essential truth the i and you the here and there the now and then being omitted  either time or rare wisdom writes it  before printing was discovered a century was equal to a thousand years  the poet is he who can write some pure mythology today without the aid of posterity in how few words for instance the greeks would have told the story of abelard and heloise making but a sentence for our classical dictionaryand then perchance have stuck up their names to shine in some corner of the firmament  we moderns on the other hand collect only the raw materials of biography and history memoirs to serve for a history which itself is but materials to serve for a mythology  how many volumes folio would the life and labors of prometheus have filled if perchance it had fallen as perchance it did first in days of cheap printing who knows what shape the fable of columbus will at length assume to be confounded with that of jason and the expedition of the argonauts  and franklinthere may be a line for him in the future classical dictionary recording what that demigod did and referring him to some new genealogy  son ofand  he aided the americans to gain their independence instructed mankind in economy and drew down lightning from the clouds  the hidden significance of these fables which is sometimes thought to have been detected the ethics running parallel to the poetry and history are not so remarkable as the readiness with which they may be made to express a variety of truths  as if they were the skeletons of still older and more universal truths than any whose flesh and blood they are for the time made to wear  it is like striving to make the sun or the wind or the sea symbols to signify exclusively the particular thoughts of our day  but what signifies it  in the mythus a superhuman intelligence uses the unconscious thoughts and dreams of men as its hieroglyphics to address men unborn  in the history of the human mind these glowing and ruddy fables precede the noonday thoughts of men as aurora the suns rays  the matutine intellect of the poet keeping in advance of the glare of philosophy always dwells in this auroral atmosphere   as we said before the concord is a dead stream but its scenery is the more suggestive to the contemplative voyager and this day its water was fuller of reflections than our pages even  just before it reaches the falls in billerica it is contracted and becomes swifter and shallower with a yellow pebbly bottom hardly passable for a canalboat leaving the broader and more stagnant portion above like a lake among the hills  all through the concord bedford and billerica meadows we had heard no murmur from its stream except where some tributary runnel tumbled in       some tumultuous little rill        purling round its storied pebble      tinkling to the selfsame tune      from september until june        which no drought doth eer enfeeble       silent flows the parent stream        and if rocks do lie below      smothers with her waves the din      as it were a youthful sin        just as still and just as slow  but now at length we heard this staid and primitive river rushing to her fall like any rill  we here left its channel just above the billerica falls and entered the canal which runs or rather is conducted six miles through the woods to the merrimack at middlesex and as we did not care to loiter in this part of our voyage while one ran along the towpath drawing the boat by a cord the other kept it off the shore with a pole so that we accomplished the whole distance in little more than an hour this canal which is the oldest in the country and has even an antique look beside the more modern railroads is fed by the concord so that we were still floating on its familiar waters it is so much water which the river lets for the advantage of commerce  there appeared some want of harmony in its scenery since it was not of equal date with the woods and meadows through which it is led and we missed the conciliatory influence of time on land and water but in the lapse of ages nature will recover and indemnify herself and gradually plant fit shrubs and flowers along its borders  already the kingfisher sat upon a pine over the water and the bream and pickerel swam below  thus all works pass directly out of the hands of the architect into the hands of nature to be perfected  it was a retired and pleasant route without houses or travellers except some young men who were lounging upon a bridge in chelmsford who leaned impudently over the rails to pry into our concerns but we caught the eye of the most forward and looked at him till he was visibly discomfited  not that there was any peculiar efficacy in our look but rather a sense of shame left in him which disarmed him  it is a very true and expressive phrase he looked daggers at me for the first pattern and prototype of all daggers must have been a glance of the eye  first there was the glance of joves eye then his fiery bolt then the material gradually hardening tridents spears javelins and finally for the convenience of private men daggers krisses and so forth were invented  it is wonderful how we get about the streets without being wounded by these delicate and glancing weapons a man can so nimbly whip out his rapier or without being noticed carry it unsheathed yet it is rare that one gets seriously looked at  as we passed under the last bridge over the canal just before reaching the merrimack the people coming out of church paused to look at us from above and apparently so strong is custom indulged in some heathenish comparisons but we were the truest observers of this sunny day  according to hesiod                the seventh is a holy day    for then latona brought forth goldenrayed apollo  and by our reckoning this was the seventh day of the week and not the first  i find among the papers of an old justice of the peace and deacon of the town of concord this singular memorandum which is worth preserving as a relic of an ancient custom  after reforming the spelling and grammar it runs as follows men that travelled with teams on the sabbath dec 18th 1803 were jeremiah richardson and jonas parker both of shirley  they had teams with rigging such as is used to carry barrels and they were travelling westward  richardson was questioned by the hon ephraim wood esq and he said that jonas parker was his fellowtraveller and he further said that a mr longley was his employer who promised to bear him out  we were the men that were gliding northward this sept 1st 1839 with still team and rigging not the most convenient to carry barrels unquestioned by any squire or church deacon and ready to bear ourselves out if need were  in the latter part of the seventeenth century according to the historian of dunstable towns were directed to erect a cage near the meetinghouse and in this all offenders against the sanctity of the sabbath were confined  society has relaxed a little from its strictness one would say but i presume that there is not less religion than formerly  if the ligature is found to be loosened in one part it is only drawn the tighter in another  you can hardly convince a man of an error in a lifetime but must content yourself with the reflection that the progress of science is slow  if he is not convinced his grandchildren may be  the geologists tell us that it took one hundred years to prove that fossils are organic and one hundred and fifty more to prove that they are not to be referred to the noachian deluge  i am not sure but i should betake myself in extremities to the liberal divinities of greece rather than to my countrys god  jehovah though with us he has acquired new attributes is more absolute and unapproachable but hardly more divine than jove  he is not so much of a gentleman not so gracious and catholic he does not exert so intimate and genial an influence on nature as many a god of the greeks  i should fear the infinite power and inflexible justice of the almighty mortal hardly as yet apotheosized so wholly masculine with no sister juno no apollo no venus nor minerva to intercede for me thumoi phyleousa te kedomene te  the grecian are youthful and erring and fallen gods with the vices of men but in many important respects essentially of the divine race  in my pantheon pan still reigns in his pristine glory with his ruddy face his flowing beard and his shaggy body his pipe and his crook his nymph echo and his chosen daughter iambe for the great god pan is not dead as was rumored  no god ever dies perhaps of all the gods of new england and of ancient greece i am most constant at his shrine  it seems to me that the god that is commonly worshipped in civilized countries is not at all divine though he bears a divine name but is the overwhelming authority and respectability of mankind combined  men reverence one another not yet god  if i thought that i could speak with discrimination and impartiality of the nations of christendom i should praise them but it tasks me too much  they seem to be the most civil and humane but i may be mistaken  every people have gods to suit their circumstances the society islanders had a god called toahitu in shape like a dog he saved such as were in danger of falling from rocks and trees  i think that we can do without him as we have not much climbing to do  among them a man could make himself a god out of a piece of wood in a few minutes which would frighten him out of his wits  i fancy that some indefatigable spinster of the old school who had the supreme felicity to be born in days that tried mens souls hearing this may say with nestor another of the old school but you are younger than i  for time was when i conversed with greater men than you  for not at any time have i seen such men nor shall see them as perithous and dryas and poimena laon that is probably washington sole shepherd of the people and when apollo has now six times rolled westward or seemed to roll and now for the seventh time shows his face in the east eyes wellnigh glazed long glassed which have fluctuated only between lambs wool and worsted explore ceaselessly some

when they rest as when they toil not without a feeling of gratitude whose life is as blameless how blameworthy soever it may be on the lords monaday as on his sunaday  there are various nay incredible faiths why should we be alarmed at any of them  what man believes god believes  long as i have lived and many blasphemers as i have heard and seen i have never yet heard or witnessed any direct and conscious blasphemy or irreverence but of indirect and habitual enough where is the man who is guilty of direct and personal insolence to him that made him  one memorable addition to the old mythology is due to this erathe christian fable  with what pains and tears and blood these centuries have woven this and added it to the mythology of mankind  the new prometheus  with what miraculous consent and patience and persistency has this mythus been stamped on the memory of the race  it would seem as if it were in the progress of our mythology to dethrone jehovah and crown christ in his stead  if it is not a tragical life we live then i know not what to call it  such a story as that of jesus christthe history of jerusalem say being a part of the universal history  the naked the embalmed unburied death of jerusalem amid its desolate hillsthink of it  in tassos poem i trust some things are sweetly buried  consider the snappish tenacity with which they preach christianity still  what

within it old drayton thought that a man that lived here and would be a poet for instance should have in him certain brave translunary things and a fine madness should possess his brain  certainly it were as well that he might be up to the occasion  that is a superfluous wonder which dr  johnson expresses at the assertion of sir thomas browne that his life has been a miracle of thirty years which to relate were not history but a piece of poetry and would sound like a fable the wonder is rather that all men do not assert as much  that would be a rare praise if it were true which was addressed to francis beaumontspectators sate part in your tragedies  think what a mean and wretched place this world is that half the time we have to light a lamp that we may see to live in it  this is half our

burn dryrotted and powderpost methinkswhich they set up between you and them in the shortest intercourse an ancient and tottering frame with all its boards blown off  they do not walk without their bed  some to me seemingly very unimportant and unsubstantial things and relations are for them everlastingly settledas father son and holy ghost and the like  these are like the everlasting hills to them  but in all my wanderings i never came across the least vestige of authority for these things  they have not left so distinct a trace as the delicate flower of a remote geological period on the coal in my grate the wisest man preaches no doctrines he has no scheme he sees no rafter not even a cobweb against the heavens  it is clear sky  if i ever see more clearly at one time than at another the medium through which i see is clearer  to see from earth to heaven and see there standing still a fixture that old jewish scheme  what right have you to hold up this obstacle to my understanding you to your understanding me  you did not invent it it was imposed on you  examine your authority  even christ we fear had his scheme his conformity to tradition which slightly vitiates his teaching  he had not swallowed all formulas  he preached some mere doctrines  as for me abraham isaac and jacob are now only the subtilest imaginable essences which would not stain the morning sky  your scheme must be the framework of the universe all other schemes will soon be ruins the perfect god in his revelations of himself has never got to the length of one such proposition as you his prophets state have you learned the alphabet of heaven and can count three  do you know the number of gods family  can you put mysteries into words  do you presume to fable of the ineffable  pray what geographer are you that speak of heavens topography  whose friend are you that speak of gods personality  do you miles howard think that he has made you his confidant  tell me of the height of the mountains of the moon or of the diameter of space and i may believe you but of the secret history of the almighty and i shall pronounce thee mad  yet we have a sort of family history of our godso have the tahitians of theirsand some old poets grand imagination is imposed on us as adamantine everlasting truth and gods own word  pythagoras says truly enough a true assertion respecting god is an assertion of god but we may well doubt if there is any example of this in literature  the new testament is an invaluable book though i confess to having been slightly prejudiced against it in my very early days by the church and the sabbath school so that it seemed before i read it to be the yellowest book in the catalogue  yet i early escaped from their meshes  it was hard to get the commentaries out of ones head and taste its true flavori think that pilgrims progress is the best sermon which has been preached from this text almost all other sermons that i have heard or heard of have been but poor imitations of thisit would be a poor story to be prejudiced against the life of christ because the book has been edited by christians  in fact i love this book rarely though it is a sort of castle in the air to me which i am permitted to dream  having come to it so recently and freshly it has the greater charm so that i cannot find any to talk with about it  i never read a novel they have so little real life and thought in them  the reading which i love best is the scriptures of the several nations though it happens that i am better acquainted with those of the hindoos the chinese and the persians than of the hebrews which i have come to last give me one of these bibles and you have silenced me for a while when i recover the use of my tongue i am wont to worry my neighbors with the new sentences but commonly they cannot see that there is any wit in them  such has been my experience with the new testament  i have not yet got to the crucifixion i have read it over so many times  i should love dearly to read it aloud to my friends some of whom are seriously inclined it is so good and i am sure that they have never heard it it fits their case exactly and we should enjoy it so much togetherbut i instinctively despair of getting their ears  they soon show by signs not to be mistaken that it is inexpressibly wearisome to them  i do not mean to imply that i am any better than my neighbors for alas  i know that i am only as good though i love better books than they  it is remarkable that notwithstanding the universal favor with which the new testament is outwardly received and even the bigotry with which it is defended there is no hospitality shown to there is no appreciation of the order of truth with which it deals  i know of no book that has so few readers  there is none so truly strange and heretical and unpopular  to christians no less than greeks and jews it is foolishness and a stumblingblock  there are indeed severe things in it which no man should read aloud more than onceseek first the kingdom of heavenlay not up for yourselves treasures on earthif thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heavenfor what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul  or what shall a man give in exchange for his soulthink of this yankeesverily i say unto you if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto youthink of repeating these things to a new england audience  thirdly fourthly fifteenthly till there are three barrels of sermons  who without cant can read them aloud  who without cant can hear them and not go out of the meetinghouse  they never were read they never were heard let but one of these sentences be rightly read from any pulpit in the land and there would not be left one stone of that meetinghouse upon another  yet the new testament treats of man and mans socalled spiritual affairs too exclusively and is too constantly moral and personal to alone content me who am not interested solely in mans religious or moral nature or in man even  i have not the most definite designs on the future  absolutely speaking do unto others as you would that they should do unto you is by no means a golden rule but the best of current silver  an honest man would have but little occasion for it  it is golden not to have any rule at all in such a case  the book has never been written which is to be accepted without any allowance  christ was a sublime actor on the stage of the world  he knew what he was thinking of when he said heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away i draw near to him at such a time  yet he taught mankind but imperfectly how to live his thoughts were all directed toward another world  there is another kind of success than his  even here we have a sort of living to get and must buffet it somewhat longer  there are various tough problems yet to solve and we must make shift to live betwixt spirit and matter such a human life as we can  a healthy man with steady employment as woodchopping at fifty cents a cord and a camp in the woods will not be a good subject for christianity  the new testament may be a choice book to him on some but not on all or most of his days  he will rather go afishing in his leisure hours  the apostles though they were fishers too were of the solemn race of seafishers and never trolled for pickerel on inland streams  men have a singular desire to be good without being good for anything because perchance they think vaguely that so it will be good for them in the end  the sort of morality which the priests inculcate is a very subtle policy far finer than the politicians and the world is very successfully ruled by them as the policemen  it is not worth the while to let our imperfections disturb us always  the conscience really does not and ought not to monopolize the whole of our lives any more than the heart or the head  it is as liable to disease as any other part  i have seen some whose consciences owing undoubtedly to former indulgence had grown to be as irritable as spoilt children and at length gave them no peace  they did not know when to swallow their cud and their lives of course yielded no milk      conscience is instinct bred in the house     feeling and thinking propagate the sin     by an unnatural breeding in and in     i say turn it out doors     into the moors     i love a life whose plot is simple     and does not thicken with every pimple     a soul so sound no sickly conscience binds it     that makes the universe no worse than t finds it     i love an earnest soul     whose mighty joy and sorrow     are not drowned in a bowl     and brought to life tomorrow     that lives one tragedy     and not seventy     a conscience worth keeping     laughing not weeping     a conscience wise and steady     and forever ready     not changing with events     dealing in compliments     a conscience exercised about     large things where one may doubt     i love a soul not all of wood     predestinated to be good     but true to the backbone     unto itself alone     and false to none     born to its own affairs     its own joys and own cares     by whom the work which god begun     is finished and not undone     taken up where he left off     whether to worship or to scoff     if not good why then evil     if not good god good devil     goodnessyou hypocrite come out of that     live your life do your work then take your hat     i have no patience towards     such conscientious cowards     give me simple laboring folk     who love their work     whose virtue is a song     to cheer god along  i was once reproved by a minister who was driving a poor beast to some meetinghouse horsesheds among the hills of new hampshire because i was bending my steps to a mountaintop on the sabbath instead of a church when i would have gone farther than he to hear a true word spoken on that or any day  he declared that i was breaking the lords fourth commandment and proceeded to enumerate in a sepulchral tone the disasters which had befallen him whenever he had done any ordinary work on the sabbath  he really thought that a god was on the watch to trip up those men who followed any secular work on this day and did not see that it was the evil conscience of the workers that did it  the country is full of this superstition so that when one enters a village the church not only really but from association is the ugliest looking building in it because it is the one in which human nature stoops the lowest and is most disgraced  certainly such temples as these shall erelong cease to deform the landscape  there are few things more disheartening and disgusting than when you are walking the streets of a strange village on the sabbath to hear a preacher shouting like a boatswain in a gale of wind and thus harshly profaning the quiet atmosphere of the day  you fancy him to have taken off his coat as when men are about to do hot and dirty work  if i should ask the minister of middlesex to let me speak in his pulpit on a sunday he would object because i do not pray as he does or because i am not ordained  what under the sun are these things  really there is no infidelity nowadays so great as that which prays and keeps the sabbath and rebuilds the churches the sealer of the south pacific preaches a truer doctrine  the church is a sort of hospital for mens souls and as full of quackery as the hospital for their bodies  those who are taken into it live like pensioners in their retreat or sailors sung harbor where you may see a row of religious cripples sitting outside in sunny weather  let not the apprehension that he may one day have to occupy a ward therein discourage the cheerful labors of the ablesouled man  while he remembers the sick in their extremities let him not look thither as to his goal  one is sick at heart of this pagoda worship  it is like the beating of gongs in a hindoo subterranean temple  in dark places and dungeons the preachers words might perhaps strike root and grow but not in broad daylight in any part of the world that i know the sound of the sabbath bell far away now breaking on these shores does not awaken pleasing associations but melancholy and sombre ones rather  one involuntarily rests on his oar to humor his unusually meditative mood  it is as the sound of many catechisms and religious books twanging a canting peal round the earth seeming to issue from some egyptian temple and echo along the shore of the nile right opposite to pharaohs palace and moses in the bulrushes startling a multitude of storks and alligators basking in the sun  everywhere good men sound a retreat and the word has gone forth to fall back on innocence  fall forward rather on to whatever there is there  christianity only hopes  it has hung its harp on the willows and cannot sing a song in a strange land  it has dreamed a sad dream and does not yet welcome the morning with joy  the mother tells her falsehoods to her child but thank heaven the child does not grow up in its parents shadow  our mothers faith has not grown with her experience her experience has been too much for her  the lesson of life was too hard for her to learn  it is remarkable that almost all speakers and writers feel it to be incumbent on them sooner or later to prove or to acknowledge the personality of god  some earl of bridgewater thinking it better late than never has provided for it in his will  it is a sad mistake  in reading a work on agriculture we have to skip the authors moral reflections and the words providence and he scattered along the page to come at the profitable level of what he has to say  what he calls his religion is for the most part offensive to the nostrils  he should know better than expose himself and keep his foul sores covered till they are quite healed  there is more religion in mens science than there is science in their religion  let us make haste to the report of the committee on swine  a mans real faith is never contained in his creed nor is his creed an article of his faith  the last is never adopted  this it is that permits him to smile ever and to live even as bravely as he does  and yet he clings anxiously to his creed as to a straw thinking that that does him good service because his sheet anchor does not drag  in most mens religion the ligature which should be its umbilical cord connecting them with divinity is rather like that thread which the accomplices of cylon held in their hands when they went abroad from the temple of minerva the other end being attached to the statue of the goddess  but frequently as in their case the thread breaks being stretched and they are left without an asylum    a good and pious man reclined his head on the bosom of   contemplation and was absorbed in the ocean of a revery  at   the instant when he awaked from his vision one of his friends   by way of pleasantry said what rare gift have you brought us   from that garden where you have been recreating  he replied   i fancied to myself and said when i can reach the rosebower   i will fill my lap with the flowers and bring them as a   present to my friends but when i got there the fragrance of   the roses so intoxicated me that the skirt dropped from my   handso bird of dawn learn the warmth of affection from   the moth for that scorched creature gave up the ghost and   uttered not a groan these vain pretenders are ignorant of him   they seek after for of him that knew him we never heard   againo thou who towerest above the flights of conjecture   opinion and comprehension whatever has been reported of thee   we have heard and read the congregation is dismissed and life   drawn to a close and we still rest at our first encomium of   theesadi  by noon we were let down into the merrimack through the locks at middlesex just above pawtucket falls by a serene and liberalminded man who came quietly from his book though his duties we supposed did not require him to open the locks on sundays  with him we had a just and equal encounter of the eyes as between two honest men  the movements of the eyes express the perpetual and unconscious courtesy of the parties  it is said that a rogue does not look you in the face neither does an honest man look at you as if he had his reputation to establish  i have seen some who did not know when to turn aside their eyes in meeting yours  a truly confident and magnanimous spirit is wiser than to contend for the mastery in such encounters  serpents alone conquer by the steadiness of their gaze  my friend looks me in the face and sees me that is all  the best relations were at once established between us and this man and though few words were spoken he could not conceal a visible interest in us and our excursion  he was a lover of the higher mathematics as we found and in the midst of some vast sunny problem when we overtook him and whispered our conjectures by this man we were presented with the freedom of the merrimack we now felt as if we were fairly launched on the oceanstream of our voyage and were pleased to find that our boat would float on merrimack water  we began again busily to put in practice those old arts of rowing steering and paddling  it seemed a strange phenomenon to us that the two rivers should mingle their waters so readily since we had never associated them in our thoughts  as we glided over the broad bosom of the merrimack between chelmsford and dracut at noon here a quarter of a mile wide the rattling of our oars was echoed over the water to those villages and their slight sounds to us  their harbors lay as smooth and fairylike as the lido or syracuse or rhodes in our imagination while like some strange roving craft we flitted past what seemed the dwellings of noble homestaying men seemingly as conspicuous as if on an eminence or floating upon a tide which came up to those villagers breasts  at a third of a mile over the water we heard distinctly some children repeating their catechism in a cottage near the shore while in the broad shallows between a herd of cows stood lashing their sides and waging war with the flies  two hundred years ago other catechizing than this was going on here for here came the sachem wannalancet and his people and sometimes tahatawan our concord sachem who afterwards had a church at home to catch fish at the falls and here also came john eliot with the bible and catechism and baxters call to the unconverted and other tracts done into the massachusetts tongue and taught them christianity meanwhile  this place says gookin referring to wamesit    being an ancient and capital seat of indians they come to   fish and this good man takes this opportunity to spread the   net of the gospel to fish for their soulsmay 5th 1674   he continues according to our usual custom mr eliot and   myself took our journey to wamesit or pawtuckett and arriving   there that evening mr eliot preached to as many of them as   could be got together out of matt  xxii  114 the parable   of the marriage of the kings son  we met at the wigwam of one   called wannalancet about two miles from the town near   pawtuckett falls and bordering upon merrimak river  this   person wannalancet is the eldest son of old pasaconaway the   chiefest sachem of pawtuckett  he is a sober and grave person   and of years between fifty and sixty  he hath been always   loving and friendly to the english  as yet however they had   not prevailed on him to embrace the christian religion  but   at this time says gookin may 6 1674after some   deliberation and serious pause he stood up and made a speech   to this effecti must acknowledge i have all my days used   to pass in an old canoe alluding to his frequent custom to   pass in a canoe upon the river and now you exhort me to   change and leave my old canoe and embark in a new canoe to   which i have hitherto been unwilling but now i yield up myself   to your advice and enter into a new canoe and do engage to   pray to god hereafter  one mr richard daniel a gentleman   that lived in billerica who with other persons of quality   was present desired brother eliot to tell the sachem from   him that it may be while he went in his old canoe he passed   in a quiet stream but the end thereof was death and   destruction to soul and body  but now he went into a new   canoe perhaps he would meet with storms and trials but yet he   should be encouraged to persevere for the end of his voyage   would be everlasting restsince that time i hear this   sachem doth persevere and is a constant and diligent hearer of   gods word and sanctifieth the sabbath though he doth travel   to wamesit meeting every sabbath which is above two miles and   though sundry of his people have deserted him since he   subjected to the gospel yet he continues and   persists   gookins hist coll of the indians in new england 1674  already as appears from the records at a general court held at boston in new england the 7th of the first month 16434wassamequin nashoonon kutchamaquin massaconomet and squaw sachem did voluntarily submit themselves to the english and among other things did promise to be willing from time to time to be instructed in the knowledge of god being asked not to do any unnecessary work on the sabbath day especially within the gates of christian towns they answered it is easy to them they have not much to do on any day and they can well take their rest on that dayso says winthrop in his journal we causing them to understand the articles and all the ten commandments of god and they freely assenting to all they were solemnly received and then presented the court with twentysix fathom more of wampom and the court gave each of them a coat of two yards of cloth and their dinner and to them and their men every of them a cup of sack at their departure so they took leave and went away  what journeyings on foot and on horseback through the wilderness to preach the gospel to these minks and muskrats who first no doubt listened with their red ears out of a natural hospitality and courtesy and afterward from curiosity or even interest till at length there were praying indians and as the general court wrote to cromwell the work is brought to this perfection that some of the indians themselves can pray and prophesy in a comfortable manner  it was in fact an old battle and hunting ground through which we had been floating the ancient dwellingplace of a race of hunters and warriors  their weirs of stone their arrowheads and hatchets their pestles and the mortars in which they pounded indian corn before the white man had tasted it lay concealed in the mud of the river bottom  tradition still points out the spots where they took fish in the greatest numbers by such arts as they possessed  it is a rapid story the historian will have to put together  miantonimowinthropwebster  soon he comes from montaup to bunker hill from bearskins parched corn bows and arrows to tiled roofs wheatfields guns and swords pawtucket and wamesit where the indians resorted in the fishing season are now lowell the city of spindles and manchester of america which sends its cotton cloth round the globe  even we youthful voyagers had spent a part of our lives in the village of chelmsford when the present city whose bells we heard was its obscure north district only and the giant weaver was not yet fairly born  so old are we so young is it   we were thus entering the state of new hampshire on the bosom of the flood formed by the tribute of its innumerable valleys  the river was the only key which could unlock its maze presenting its hills and valleys its lakes and streams in their natural order and position  the merrimack or sturgeon river is formed by the confluence of the pemigewasset which rises near the notch of the white mountains and the winnipiseogee which drains the lake of the same name signifying the smile of the great spirit from their junction it runs south seventyeight miles to massachusetts and thence east thirtyfive miles to the sea  i have traced its stream from where it bubbles out of the rocks of the white mountains above the clouds to where it is lost amid the salt billows of the ocean on plum island beach  at first it comes on murmuring to itself by the base of stately and retired mountains through moist primitive woods whose juices it receives where the bear still drinks it and the cabins of settlers are far between and there are few to cross its stream enjoying in solitude its cascades still unknown to fame by long ranges of mountains of sandwich and of squam slumbering like tumuli of titans with the peaks of moosehillock the haystack and kearsarge reflected in its waters where the maple and the raspberry those lovers of the hills flourish amid temperate dewsflowing long and full of meaning but untranslatable as its name pemigewasset by many a pastured pelion and ossa where unnamed muses haunt tended by oreads dryads naiads and receiving the tribute of many an untasted hippocrene  there are earth air fire and watervery well this is water and down it comes     such water do the gods distil    and pour down every hill       for their new england men    a draught of this wild nectar bring    and ill not taste the spring       of helicon again  falling all the way and yet not discouraged by the lowest fall by the law of its birth never to become stagnant for it has come out of the clouds and down the sides of precipices worn in the flood through beaverdams broke loose not splitting but splicing and mending itself until it found a breathingplace in this low land  there is no danger now that the sun will steal it back to heaven again before it reach the sea for it has a warrant even to recover its own dews into its bosom again with interest at every eve  it was already the water of squam and newfound lake and winnipiseogee and white mountain snow dissolved on which we were floating and smiths and bakers and mad rivers and nashua and souhegan and piscataquoag and suncook and soucook and contoocook mingled in incalculable proportions still fluid yellowish restless all with an ancient ineradicable inclination to the sea  so it flows on down by lowell and haverhill at which last place it first suffers a sea change and a few masts betray the vicinity of the ocean  between the towns of amesbury and newbury it is a broad commercial river from a third to half a mile in width no longer skirted with yellow and crumbling banks but backed by high green hills and pastures with frequent white beaches on which the fishermen draw up their nets  i have passed down this portion of the river in a steamboat and it was a pleasant sight to watch from its deck the fishermen dragging their seines on the distant shore as in pictures of a foreign strand  at intervals you may meet with a schooner laden with lumber standing up to haverhill or else lying at anchor or aground waiting for wind or tide until at last you glide under the famous chain bridge and are landed at newburyport thus she who at first was poore of waters naked of renowne having received so many fair tributaries as was said of the forth     doth grow the greater still the further downe       till that abounding both in power and fame       she long doth strive to give the sea her name  or if not her name in this case at least the impulse of her stream  from the steeples of newburyport you may review this river stretching far up into the country with many a white sail glancing over it like an inland sea and behold as one wrote who was born on its headwaters down out at its mouth the dark inky main blending with the blue above  plum island its sand ridges scolloping along the horizon like the seaserpent and the distant outline broken by many a tall ship leaning still against the sky  rising at an equal height with the connecticut the merrimack reaches the sea by a course only half as long and hence has no leisure to form broad and fertile meadows like the former but is hurried along rapids and down numerous falls without long delay  the banks are generally steep and high with a narrow interval reaching back to the hills which is only rarely or partially overflown at present and is much valued by the farmers  between chelmsford and concord in new hampshire it varies from twenty to seventyfive rods in width  it is probably wider than it was formerly in many places owing to the trees having been cut down and the consequent wasting away of its banks  the influence of the pawtucket dam is felt as far up as cromwells falls and many think that the banks are being abraded and the river filled up again by this cause  like all our rivers it is liable to freshets and the pemigewasset has been known to rise twentyfive feet in a few hours  it is navigable for vessels of burden about twenty miles for canalboats by means of locks as far as concord in new hampshire about seventyfive miles from its mouth and for smaller boats to plymouth one hundred and thirteen miles  a small steamboat once plied between lowell and nashua before the railroad was built and one now runs from newburyport to haverhill  unfitted to some extent for the purposes of commerce by the sandbar at its mouth see how this river was devoted from the first to the service of manufactures  issuing from the iron region of franconia and flowing through still uncut forests by inexhaustible ledges of granite with squam and winnipiseogee and newfound and massabesic lakes for its millponds it falls over a succession of natural dams where it has been offering its privileges in vain for ages until at last the yankee race came to improve them  standing at its mouth look up its sparkling stream to its sourcea silver cascade which falls all the way from the white mountains to the seaand behold a city on each successive plateau a busy colony of human beaver around every fall  not to mention newburyport and haverhill see lawrence and lowell and nashua and manchester and concord gleaming one above the other  when at length it has escaped from under the last of the factories it has a level and unmolested passage to the sea a mere waste water as it were bearing little with it but its fame its pleasant course revealed by the morning fog which hangs over it and the sails of the few small vessels which transact the commerce of haverhill and newburyport  but its real vessels are railroad cars and its true and main stream flowing by an iron channel farther south may be traced by a long line of vapor amid the hills which no morning wind ever disperses to where it empties into the sea at boston  this side is the louder murmur now  instead of the scream of a fishhawk scaring the fishes is heard the whistle of the steamengine arousing a country to its progress   this river too was at length discovered by the white man trending up into the land he knew not how far possibly an inlet to the south sea  its valley as far as the winnipiseogee was first surveyed in 1652  the first settlers of massachusetts supposed that the connecticut in one part of its course ran northwest so near the great lake as the indians do pass their canoes into it over land  from which lake and the hideous swamps about it as they supposed came all the beaver that was traded between virginia and canadaand the potomac was thought to come out of or from very near it  afterward the connecticut came so near the course of the merrimack that with a little pains they expected to divert the current of the trade into the latter river and its profits from their dutch neighbors into their own pockets  unlike the concord the merrimack is not a dead but a living stream though it has less life within its waters and on its banks  it has a swift current and in this part of its course a clayey bottom almost no weeds and comparatively few fishes we looked down into its yellow water with the more curiosity who were accustomed to the nilelike blackness of the former river shad and alewives are taken here in their season but salmon though at one time more numerous than shad are now more rare bass also are taken occasionally but locks and dams have proved more or less destructive to the fisheries  the shad make their appearance early in may at the same time with the blossoms of the pyrus one of the most conspicuous early flowers which is for this reason called the shadblossom  an insect called the shadfly also appears at the same time covering the houses and fences  we are told that their greatest run is when the appletrees are in full blossom  the old shad return in august the young three or four inches long in september  these are very fond of flies a rather picturesque and luxurious mode of fishing was formerly practised on the connecticut at bellows falls where a large rock divides the stream  on the steep sides of the island rock says belknap hang several armchairs fastened to ladders and secured by a counterpoise in which fishermen sit to catch salmon and shad with dipping nets the remains of indian weirs made of large stones are still to be seen in the winnipiseogee one of the headwaters of this river  it cannot but affect our philosophy favorably to be reminded of these shoals of migratory fishes of salmon shad alewives marshbankers and others which penetrate up the innumerable rivers of our coast in the spring even to the interior lakes their scales gleaming in the sun and again of the fry which in still greater numbers wend their way downward to the sea  and is it not pretty sport wrote captain john smith who was on this coast as early as 1614 to pull up twopence sixpence and twelvepence as fast as you can haul and veer a lineand what sport doth yield a more pleasing content and less hurt or charge than angling with a hook and crossing the sweet air from isle to isle over the silent streams of a calm sea   on the sandy shore opposite the glasshouse village in chelmsford at the great bend where we landed to rest us and gather a few wild plums we discovered the campanula rotundifolia a new flower to us the harebell of the poets which is common to both hemispheres growing close to the water here in the shady branches of an appletree on the sand we took our nooning where there was not a zephyr to disturb the repose of this glorious sabbath day and we reflected serenely on the long past and successful labors of latona       so silent is the cessile air         that every cry and call      the hills and dales and forest fair         again repeats them all       the herds beneath some leafy trees         amidst the flowers they lie      the stable ships upon the seas         tend up their sails to dry  as we thus rested in the shade or rowed leisurely along we had recourse from time to time to the gazetteer which was our navigator and from its bald natural facts extracted the pleasure of poetry  beaver river comes in a little lower down draining the meadows of pelham windham and londonderry  the scotchirish settlers of the latter town according to this authority were the first to introduce the potato into new england as well as the manufacture of linen cloth  everything that is printed and bound in a book contains some echo at least of the best that is in literature  indeed the best books have a use like sticks and stones which is above or beside their design not anticipated in the preface nor concluded in the appendix  even virgils poetry serves a very different use to me today from what it did to his contemporaries it has often an acquired and accidental value merely proving that man is still man in the world  it is pleasant to meet with such still lines as      jam laeto turgent in palmite gemmae      now the buds swell on the joyful stem      strata jacent passim sua quaeque sub arbore poma      the apples lie scattered everywhere each under its tree  in an ancient and dead language any recognition of living nature attracts us  these are such sentences as were written while grass grew and water ran  it is no small recommendation when a book will stand the test of mere unobstructed sunshine and daylight  what would we not give for some great poem to read now which would be in harmony with the sceneryfor if men read aright methinks they would never read anything but poems  no history nor philosophy can supply their place  the wisest definition of poetry the poet will instantly prove false by setting aside its requisitions  we can therefore publish only our advertisement of it  there is no doubt that the loftiest written wisdom is either rhymed or in some way musically measuredis in form as well as substance poetry and a volume which should contain the condensed wisdom of mankind need not have one rhythmless line  yet poetry though the last and finest result is a natural fruit  as naturally as the oak bears an acorn and the vine a gourd man bears a poem either spoken or done  it is the chief and most memorable success for history is but a prose narrative of poetic deeds  what else have the hindoos the persians the babylonians the egyptians done that can be told  it is the simplest relation of phenomena and describes the commonest sensations with more truth than science does and the latter at a distance slowly mimics its style and methods  the poet sings how the blood flows in his veins  he performs his functions and is so well that he needs such stimulus to sing only as plants to put forth leaves and blossoms  he would strive in vain to modulate the remote and transient music which he sometimes hears since his song is a vital function like breathing and an integral result like weight  it is not the overflowing of life but its subsidence rather and is drawn from under the feet of the poet it is enough if homer but say the sun sets  he is as serene as nature and we can hardly detect the enthusiasm of the bard  it is as if nature spoke  he presents to us the simplest pictures of human life so the child itself can understand them and the man must not think twice to appreciate his naturalness  each reader discovers for himself that with respect to the simpler features of nature succeeding poets have done little else than copy his similes  his more memorable passages are as naturally bright as gleams of sunshine in misty weather  nature furnishes him not only with words but with stereotyped lines and sentences from her mint     as from the clouds appears the full moon    all shining and then again it goes behind the shadowy clouds    so hector at one time appeared among the foremost    and at another in the rear commanding and all with brass    he shone like to the lightning of aegisbearing zeus  he conveys the least information even the hour of the day with such magnificence and vast expense of natural imagery as if it were a message from the gods     while it was dawn and sacred day was advancing    for that space the weapons of both flew fast and the people fell    but when now the woodcutter was preparing his morning meal    in the recesses of the mountain and had wearied his hands    with cutting lofty trees and satiety came to his mind    and the desire of sweet food took possession of his thoughts    then the danaans by their valor broke the phalanxes    shouting to their companions from rank to rank  when the army of the trojans passed the night under arms keeping watch lest the enemy should reembark under cover of the dark     they thinking great things upon the neutral ground of war    sat all the night and many fires burned for them    as when in the heavens the stars round the bright moon    appear beautiful and the air is without wind    and all the heights and the extreme summits    and the wooded sides of the mountains appear and from the         heavens an infinite ether is diffused    and all the stars are seen and the shepherd rejoices in his heart    so between the ships and the streams of xanthus    appeared the fires of the trojans before ilium    a thousand fires burned on the plain and by each    sat fifty in the light of the blazing fire    and horses eating white barley and corn    standing by the chariots awaited fairthroned aurora   the whitearmed goddess juno sent by the father of gods and men for iris and apollo      went down the idaean mountains to far olympus    as when the mind of a man who has come over much earth    sallies forth and he reflects with rapid thoughts    there was i and there and remembers many things    so swiftly the august juno hastening flew through the air    and came to high olympus  his scenery is always true and not invented  he does not leap in imagination from asia to greece through mid air     epeie mala polla metaxy     ourea te skioenta thalassa te echeessa          for there are very many    shady mountains and resounding seas between

pylians against the epeians is extremely lifelike     then rose up to them sweetworded nestor the shrill orator        of the pylians    and words sweeter than honey flowed from his tongue  this time however he addresses patroclus alone a certain river minyas by name leaps seaward near to arene where we pylians wait the dawn both horse and foot  thence with all haste we sped us on the morrow ere t was noonday accoutred for the fight even to alpheuss sacred source c  we fancy that we hear the subdued murmuring of the minyas discharging its waters into the main the livelong night and the hollow sound of the waves breaking on the shoreuntil at length we are cheered at the close of a toilsome march by the gurgling fountains of alpheus  there are few books which are fit to be remembered in our wisest hours but the iliad is brightest in the serenest days and embodies still all the sunlight that fell on asia minor  no modern joy or ecstasy of ours can lower its height or dim its lustre but there it lies in the east of literature as it were the earliest and latest production of the mind  the ruins of egypt oppress and stifle us with their dust foulness preserved in cassia and pitch and swathed in linen the death of that which never lived  but the rays of greek poetry struggle down to us and mingle with the sunbeams of the recent day  the statue of memnon is cast down but the shaft of the iliad still meets the sun in his rising       homer is gone and where is jove and where       the rival cities seven  his song outlives       time tower and godall that then was save heaven  so too no doubt homer had his homer and orpheus his orpheus in the dim antiquity which preceded them  the mythological system of the ancients and it is still the mythology of the moderns the poem of mankind interwoven so wonderfully with their astronomy and matching in grandeur and harmony the architecture of the heavens themselves seems to point to a time when a mightier genius inhabited the earth  but after all man is the great poet and not homer nor shakespeare and our language itself and the common arts of life are his work poetry is so universally true and independent of experience that it does not need any particular biography to illustrate it but we refer it sooner or later to some orpheus or linus and after ages to the genius of humanity and the gods themselves   it would be worth the while to select our reading for books are the society we keep to read only the serenely true never statistics nor fiction nor news nor reports nor periodicals but only great poems and when they failed read them again or perchance write more  instead of other sacrifice we might offer up our perfect teleia thoughts to the gods daily in hymns or psalms  for we should be at the helm at least once a day  the whole of the day should not be daytime there should be one hour if no more which the day did not bring forth  scholars are wont to sell their birthright for a mess of learning  but is it necessary to know what the speculator prints or the thoughtless study or the idle read the literature of the russians and the chinese or even french philosophy and much of german criticism read the best books first or you may not have a chance to read them at all  there are the worshippers with offerings and the worshippers with mortifications and again the worshippers with enthusiastic devotion so there are those the wisdom of whose reading is their worship men of subdued passions and severe mannersthis world is not for him who doth not worship and where o arjoon is there another  certainly we do not need to be soothed and entertained always like children  he who resorts to the easy novel because he is languid does no better than if he took a nap  the front aspect of great thoughts can only be enjoyed by those who stand on the side whence they arrive books not which afford us a cowering enjoyment but in which each thought is of unusual daring such as an idle man cannot read and a timid one would not be entertained by which even make us dangerous to existing institutionssuch call i good books  all that are printed and bound are not books they do not necessarily belong to letters but are oftener to be ranked with the other luxuries and appendages of civilized life  base wares are palmed off under a thousand disguises  the way to trade as a pedler once told me is to put it right through no matter what it is anything that is agreed on      you grovling worldlings you whose wisdom trades      where light neer shot his golden ray  by dint of able writing and pencraft books are cunningly compiled and have their run and success even among the learned as if they were the result of a new mans thinking and their birth were attended with some natural throes  but in a little while their covers fall off for no binding will avail and it appears that they are not books or bibles at all  there are new and patented inventions in this shape purporting to be for the elevation of the race which many a pure scholar and genius who has learned to read is for a moment deceived by and finds himself reading a horserake or spinningjenny or wooden nutmeg or oakleaf cigar or steampower press or kitchen range perchance when he was seeking serene and biblical truths                            merchants arise      and mingle conscience with your merchandise  paper is cheap and authors need not now erase one book before they write another  instead of cultivating the earth for wheat and potatoes they cultivate literature and fill a place in the republic of letters  or they would fain write for fame merely as others actually raise crops of grain to be distilled into brandy  books are for the most part wilfully and hastily written as parts of a system to supply a want real or imagined books of natural history aim commonly to be hasty schedules or inventories of gods property by some clerk  they do not in the least teach the divine view of nature but the popular view or rather the popular method of studying nature and make haste to conduct the persevering pupil only into that dilemma where the professors always dwell      to athens gowned he goes and from that school      returns unsped a more instructed fool  they teach the elements really of ignorance not of knowledge for to speak deliberately and in view of the highest truths it is not easy to distinguish elementary knowledge  there is a chasm between knowledge and ignorance which the arches of science can never span  a book should contain pure discoveries glimpses of terra firma though by shipwrecked mariners and not the art of navigation by those who have never been out of sight of land they must not yield wheat and potatoes but must themselves be the unconstrained and natural harvest of their authors lives      what i have learned is mine ive had my thought      and me the muses noble truths have taught  we do not learn much from learned books but from true sincere human books from frank and honest biographies  the life of a good man will hardly improve us more than the life of a freebooter for the inevitable laws appear as plainly in the infringement as in the observance and our lives are sustained by a nearly equal expense of virtue of some kind  the decaying tree while yet it lives demands sun wind and rain no less than the green one  it secretes sap and performs the functions of health  if we choose we may study the alburnum only  the gnarled stump has as tender a bud as the sapling  at least let us have healthy books a stout horserake or a kitchen range which is not cracked  let not the poet shed tears only for the public weal  he should be as vigorous as a sugarmaple with sap enough to maintain his own verdure beside what runs into the troughs and not like a vine which being cut in the spring bears no fruit but bleeds to death in the endeavor to heal its wounds  the poet is he that hath fat enough like bears and marmots to suck his claws all winter  he hibernates in this world and feeds on his own marrow  we love to think in winter as we walk over the snowy pastures of those happy dreamers that lie under the sod of dormice and all that race of dormant creatures which have such a superfluity of life enveloped in thick folds of fur impervious to cold  alas the poet too is in one sense a sort of dormouse gone into winter quarters of deep and serene thoughts insensible to surrounding circumstances his words are the relation of his oldest and finest memory a wisdom drawn from the remotest experience other men lead a starved existence meanwhile like hawks that would fain keep on the wing and trust to pick up a sparrow now and then   there are already essays and poems the growth of this land which are not in vain all which however we could conveniently have stowed in the till of our chest  if the gods permitted their own inspiration to be breathed in vain these might be overlooked in the crowd but the accents of truth are as sure to be heard at last on earth as in heaven  they already seem ancient and in some measure have lost the traces of their modern birth  here are they who     ask for that which is our whole lifes light    for the perpetual true and clear insight  i remember a few sentences which spring like the sward in its native pasture where its roots were never disturbed and not as if spread over a sandy embankment answering to the poets prayer                  let us set so just    a rate on knowledge that the world may trust    the poets sentence and not still aver    each art is to itself a flatterer  but above all in our native port did we not frequent the peaceful games of the lyceum from which a new era will be dated to new england as from the games of greece  for if herodotus carried his history to olympia to read after the cestus and the race have we not heard such histories recited there which since our countrymen have read as made greece sometimes to be forgottenphilosophy too has there her grove and portico not wholly unfrequented in these days  lately the victor whom all pindars praised has won another palm contending with     olympian bards who sung    divine ideas below    which always find us young    and always keep us so  what earth or sea mountain or stream or muses spring or grove is safe from his allsearching ardent eye who drives off phoebus beaten track visits unwonted zones makes the gelid hyperboreans glow and the old polar serpent writhe and many a nile flow back and hide his head     that phaeton of our day    whod make another milky way    and burn the world up with his ray     by us an undisputed seer    whod drive his flaming car so near    unto our shuddering mortal sphere     disgracing all our slender worth    and scorching up the living earth    to prove his heavenly birth     the silver spokes the golden tire    are glowing with unwonted fire    and ever nigher roll and nigher     the pins and axle melted are    the silver

   lips of cunning fell    the thrilling delphic oracle  and yet sometimes     we should not mind if on our ear there fell    some less of cunning more of oracle  it is apollo shining in your face  o rare contemporary let us have faroff heats  give us the subtler the heavenlier though fleeting beauty which passes through and through and dwells not in the verse even pure water which but reflects those tints which wine wears in its grain  let epic tradewinds blow and cease this waltz of inspirations  let us oftener feel even the gentle southwest wind upon our cheeks blowing from the indians heaven  what though we lose a thousand meteors from the sky if skyey depths if stardust and undissolvable nebulae remain what though we lose a thousand wise responses of the oracle if we may have instead some natural acres of ionian earth  though we know well     thatt is not in the power of kings or presidents to raise     a spirit for verse that is not born thereto     nor are they born in every princes days  yet spite of all they sang in praise of their elizas reign we have evidence that poets may be born and sing in our day in the presidency of james k  polk      and that the utmost powers of english rhyme     were not within her peaceful reign confined  the prophecy of the poet daniel is already how much more than fulfilled      and who in time knows whither we may vent     the treasure of our tongue  to what strange shores     this gain of our best glory shall be sent     t enrich unknowing nations with our stores     what worlds in th yet unformed occident     may come refined with the accents that are ours  enough has been said in these days of the charm of fluent writing  we hear it complained of some works of genius that they have fine thoughts but are irregular and have no flow  but even the mountain peaks in the horizon are to the eye of science parts of one range  we should consider that the flow of thought is more like a tidal wave than a prone river and is the result of a celestial influence not of any declivity in its channel  the river flows because it runs down hill and flows the faster the faster it descends  the reader who expects to float down stream for the whole voyage may well complain of nauseating swells and choppings of the sea when his frail shorecraft gets amidst the billows of the ocean stream which flows as much to sun and moon as lesser streams to it  but if we would appreciate the flow that is in these books we must expect to feel it rise from the page like an exhalation and wash away our critical brains like burr millstones flowing to higher levels above and behind ourselves  there is many a book which ripples on like a freshet and flows as glibly as a millstream sucking under a causeway and when their authors are in the full tide of their discourse pythagoras and plato and jamblichus halt beside them  their long stringy slimy sentences are of that consistency that they naturally flow and run together  they read as if written for military men for men of business there is such a despatch in them  compared with these the grave thinkers and philosophers seem not to have got their swaddlingclothes off they are slower than a roman army in its march the rear camping tonight where the van camped last night  the wise jamblichus eddies and gleams like a watery slough      how many thousands never heard the name     of sidney or of spenser or their books     and yet brave fellows and presume of fame     and seem to bear down all the world with looks  the ready writer seizes the pen and shouts forward  alamo and fanning  and after rolls the tide of war  the very walls and fences seem to travel  but the most rapid trot is no flow after all and thither reader you and i at least will not follow  a perfectly healthy sentence it is true is extremely rare  for the most part we miss the hue and fragrance of the thought as if we could be satisfied with the dews of the morning or evening without their colors or the heavens without their azure  the most attractive sentences are perhaps not the wisest but the surest and roundest  they are spoken firmly and conclusively as if the speaker had a right to know what he says and if not wise they have at least been well learned  sir walter raleigh might well be studied if only for the excellence of his style for he is remarkable in the midst of so many masters  there is a natural emphasis in his style like a mans tread and a breathing space between the sentences which the best of modern writing does not furnish  his chapters are like english parks or say rather like a western forest where the larger growth keeps down the underwood and one may ride on horseback through the openings  all the distinguished writers of that period possess a greater vigor and naturalness than the more modernfor it is allowed to slander our own timeand when we read a quotation from one of them in the midst of a modern author we seem to have come suddenly upon a greener ground a greater depth and strength of soil  it is as if a green bough were laid across the page and we are refreshed as by the sight of fresh grass in midwinter or early spring  you have constantly the warrant of life and experience in what you read  the little that is said is eked out by implication of the much that was done  the sentences are verdurous and blooming as evergreen and flowers because they are rooted in fact and experience but our false and florid sentence have only the tints of flowers without their sap or roots  all men are really most attracted by the beauty of plain speech and they even write in a florid style in imitation of this  they prefer to be misunderstood rather than to come short of its exuberance  hussein effendi praised the epistolary style of ibrahim pasha to the french traveller botta because of the difficulty of understanding it there was he said but one person at jidda who was capable of understanding and explaining the pashas correspondence a mans whole life is taxed for the least thing well done  it is its net result every sentence is the result of a long probation  where shall we look for standard english but to the words of a standard man the word which is best said came nearest to not being spoken at all for it is cousin to a deed which the speaker could have better done  nay almost it must have taken the place of a deed by some urgent necessity even by some misfortune so that the truest writer will be some captive knight after all  and perhaps the fates had such a design when having stored raleigh so richly with the substance of life and experience they made him a fast prisoner and compelled him to make his words his deeds and transfer to his expression the emphasis and sincerity of his action  men have a respect for scholarship and learning greatly out of proportion to the use they commonly serve  we are amused to read how ben jonson engaged that the dull masks with which the royal family and nobility were to be entertained should be grounded upon antiquity and solid learning can there be any greater reproach than an idle learning  learn to split wood at least the necessity of labor and conversation with many men and things to the scholar is rarely well remembered steady labor with the hands which engrosses the attention also is unquestionably the best method of removing palaver and sentimentality out of ones style both of speaking and writing  if he has worked hard from morning till night though he may have grieved that he could not be watching the train of his thoughts during that time yet the few hasty lines which at evening record his days experience will be more musical and true than his freest but idle fancy could have furnished  surely the writer is to address a world of laborers and such therefore must be his own discipline  he will not idly dance at his work who has wood to cut and cord before nightfall in the short days of winter but every stroke will be husbanded and ring soberly through the wood and so will the strokes of that scholars pen which at evening record the story of the day ring soberly yet cheerily on the ear of the reader long after the echoes of his axe have died away  the scholar may be sure that he writes the tougher truth for the calluses on his palms  they give firmness to the sentence  indeed the mind never makes a great and successful effort without a corresponding energy of the body  we are often struck by the force and precision of style to which hardworking men unpractised in writing easily attain when required to make the effort  as if plainness and vigor and sincerity the ornaments of style were better learned on the farm and in the workshop than in the schools  the sentences written by such rude hands are nervous and tough like hardened thongs the sinews of the deer or the roots of the pine  as for the graces of expression a great thought is never found in a mean dress but though it proceed from the lips of the woloffs the nine muses and the three graces will have conspired to clothe it in fit phrase  its education has always been liberal and its implied wit can endow a college  the world which the greeks called beauty has been made such by being gradually divested of every ornament which was not fitted to endure  the sibyl speaking with inspired mouth smileless inornate and unperfumed pierces through centuries by the power of the god  the scholar might frequently emulate the propriety and emphasis of the farmers call to his team and confess that if that were written it would surpass his labored sentences  whose are the truly labored sentences  from the weak and flimsy periods of the politician and literary man we are glad to turn even to the description of work the simple record of the months labor in the farmers almanac to restore our tone and spirits  a sentence should read as if its author had he held a plough instead of a pen could have drawn a furrow deep and straight to the end  the scholar requires hard and serious labor to give an impetus to his thought  he will learn to grasp the pen firmly so and wield it gracefully and effectively as an axe or a sword  when we consider the weak and nerveless periods of some literary men who perchance in feet and inches come up to the standard of their race and are not deficient in girth also we are amazed at the immense sacrifice of thews and sinews  what these proportionsthese bonesand this their work  hands which could have felled an ox have hewed this fragile matter which would not have tasked a ladys fingers can this be a stalwart mans work who has a marrow in his back and a tendon achilles in his heel  they who set up the blocks of stonehenge did somewhat if they only laid out their strength for once and stretched themselves  yet after all the truly efficient laborer will not crowd his day with work but will saunter to his task surrounded by a wide halo of ease and leisure and then do but what he loves best  he is anxious only about the fruitful kernels of time  though the hen should sit all day she could lay only one egg and besides would not have picked up materials for another  let a man take time enough for the most trivial deed though it be but the paring of his nails  the buds swell imperceptibly without hurry or confusion as if the short spring days were an eternity       then spend an age in whetting thy desire      thou needst not hasten if thou dost stand fast  some hours seem not to be occasion for any deed but for resolves to draw breath in  we do not directly go about the execution of the purpose that thrills us but shut our doors behind us and ramble with prepared mind as if the half were already done  our resolution is taking root or hold on the earth then as seeds first send a shoot downward which is fed by their own albumen ere they send one upward to the light   there is a sort of homely truth and naturalness in some books which is very rare to find and yet looks cheap enough  there may be nothing lofty in the sentiment or fine in the expression but it is careless country talk  homeliness is almost as great a merit in a book as in a house if the reader would abide there it is next to beauty and a very high art  some have this merit only  the scholar is not apt to make his most familiar experience come gracefully to the aid of his expression  very few men can speak of nature for instance with any truth  they overstep her modesty somehow or other and confer no favor they do not speak a good word for her  most cry better than they speak and you can get more nature out of them by pinching than by addressing them  the surliness with which the woodchopper speaks of his woods handling them as indifferently as his axe is better than the mealymouthed enthusiasm of the lover of nature  better that the primrose by the rivers brim be a yellow primrose and nothing more than that it be something less aubrey relates of thomas fuller that his was a very working head insomuch that walking and meditating before dinner he would eat up a penny loaf not knowing that he did it  his natural memory was very great to which he added the art of memory  he would repeat to you forwards and backwards all the signs from ludgate to charing cross he says of mr john hales that he loved canarie and was buried under an altar monument of black marblewith a too long epitaph of edmund halley that he at sixteen could make a dial and then he said he thought himself a brave fellow of william holder who wrote a book upon his curing one popham who was deaf and dumb he was beholding to no author did only consult with nature for the most part an author consults only with all who have written before him upon a subject and his book is but the advice of so many  but a good book will never have been forestalled but the topic itself will in one sense be new and its author by consulting with nature will consult not only with those who have gone before but with those who may come after  there is always room and occasion enough for a true book on any subject as there is room for more light the brightest day and more rays will not interfere with the first  we thus worked our way up this river gradually adjusting our thoughts to novelties beholding from its placid bosom a new nature and new works of men and as it were with increasing confidence finding nature still habitable genial and propitious to us not following any beaten path but the windings of the river as ever the nearest way for us  fortunately we had no business in this country  the concord had rarely been a river or rivus but barely fluvius or between fluvius and lacus  this merrimack was neither rivus nor fluvius nor lacus but rather amnis here a gently swelling and stately rolling flood approaching the sea  we could even sympathize with its buoyant tide going to seek its fortune in the ocean and anticipating the time when being received within the plain of its freer water it should beat the shores for banks     campoque recepta    liberioris aquae pro ripis litora pulsant  at length we doubled a low shrubby islet called rabbit island subjected alternately to the sun and to the waves as desolate as if it lay some leagues within the icy sea and found ourselves in a narrower part of the river near the sheds and yards for picking the stone known as the chelmsford granite which is quarried in westford and the neighboring towns  we passed wicasuck island which contains seventy acres or more on our right between chelmsford and tyngsborough  this was a favorite residence of the indians  according to the history of dunstable about 1663 the eldest son of passaconaway chief of the penacooks was thrown into jail for a debt of 45 due to john tinker by one of his tribe and which he had promised verbally should be paid  to relieve him from his imprisonment his brother wannalancet and others who owned wicasuck island sold it and paid the debt it was however restored to the indians by the general court in 1665  after the departure of the indians in 1683 it was granted to jonathan tyng in payment for his services to the colony in maintaining a garrison at his house tyngs house stood not far from wicasuck falls  gookin who in his epistle dedicatory to robert boyle apologizes for presenting his matter clothed in a wilderness dress says that on the breaking out of philips war in 1675 there were taken up by the christian indians and the english in marlborough and sent to cambridge seven indians belonging to narragansett long island and pequod who had all been at work about seven weeks with one mr jonathan tyng of dunstable upon merrimack river and hearing of the war they reckoned with their master and getting their wages conveyed themselves away without his privity and being afraid marched secretly through the woods designing to go to their own country however they were released soon after such were the hired men in those days  tyng was the first permanent settler of dunstable which then embraced what is now tyngsborough and many other towns  in the winter of 1675 in philips war every other settler left the town but he says the historian of dunstable fortified his house and although obliged to send to boston for his food sat himself down in the midst of his savage enemies alone in the wilderness to defend his home  deeming his position an important one for the defence of the frontiers in february 1676 he petitioned the colony for aid humbly showing as his petition runs that as he lived in the uppermost house on merrimac river lying open to ye enemy yet being so seated that it is as it were a watchhouse to the neighboring towns he could render important service to his country if only he had some assistance there being he said never an inhabitant left in the town but myself wherefore he requests that their honors would be pleased to order him three or four men to help garrison his said house which they did but methinks that such a garrison would be weakened by the addition of a man      make bandog thy scout watch to bark at a thief      make courage for life to be capitain chief      make trapdoor thy bulwark make bell to begin      make gunstone and arrow show who is within  thus he earned the title of first permanent settler  in 1694 a law was passed that every settler who deserted a town for fear of the indians should forfeit all his rights therein but now at any rate as i have frequently observed a man may desert the fertile frontier territories of truth and justice which are the states best lands for fear of far more insignificant foes without forfeiting any of his civil rights therein  nay townships are granted to deserters and the general court as i am sometimes inclined to regard it is but a deserters camp itself  as we rowed along near the shore of wicasuck island which was then covered with wood in order to avoid the current two men who looked as if they had just run out of lowell where they had been waylaid by the sabbath meaning to go to nashua and who now found themselves in the strange natural uncultivated and unsettled part of the globe which intervenes full of walls and barriers a rough and uncivil place to them seeing our boat moving so smoothly up the stream called out from the high bank above our heads to know if we would take them as passengers as if this were the street they had missed that they might sit and chat and drive away the time and so at last find themselves in nashua  this smooth way they much preferred  but our boat was crowded with necessary furniture and sunk low in the water and moreover required to be worked for even it did not progress against the stream without effort so we were obliged to deny them passage  as we glided away with even sweeps while the fates scattered oil in our course the sun now sinking behind the alders on the distant shore we could still see them far off over the water running along the shore and climbing over the rocks and fallen trees like insectsfor they did not know any better than we that they were on an islandthe unsympathizing river ever flowing in an opposite direction until having reached the entrance of the island brook which they had probably crossed upon the locks below they found a more effectual barrier to their progress  they seemed to be learning much in a little time  they ran about like ants on a burning brand and once more they tried the river here and once more there to see if water still indeed was not to be walked on as if a new thought inspired them and by some peculiar disposition of the limbs they could accomplish it  at length sober common sense seemed to have resumed its sway and they concluded that what they had so long heard must be true and resolved to ford the shallower stream when nearly a mile distant we could see them stripping off their clothes and preparing for this experiment yet it seemed likely that a new dilemma would arise they were so thoughtlessly throwing away their clothes on the wrong side of the stream as in the case of the countryman with his corn his fox and his goose which had to be transported one at a time  whether they got safely through or went round by the locks we never learned we could not help being struck by the seeming though innocent indifference of nature to these mens necessities while elsewhere she was equally serving others  like a true benefactress the secret of her service is unchangeableness thus is the busiest merchant though within sight of his lowell put to pilgrims shifts and soon comes to staff and scrip and scallop shell  we too who held the middle of the stream came near experiencing a pilgrims fate being tempted to pursue what seemed a sturgeon or larger fish for we remembered that this was the sturgeon river its dark and monstrous back alternately rising and sinking in midstream  we kept falling behind but the fish kept his back well out and did not dive and seemed to prefer to swim against the stream so at any rate he would not escape us by going out to sea  at length having got as near as was convenient and looking out not to get a blow from his tail now the bowgunner delivered his charge while the sternman held his ground  but the halibutskinned monster in one of these swiftgliding pregnant moments without ever ceasing his bobbing up and down saw fit without a chuckle or other prelude to proclaim himself a huge imprisoned spar placed there as a buoy to warn sailors of sunken rocks  so each casting some blame upon the other we withdrew quickly to safer waters  the sceneshifter saw fit here to close the drama of this day without regard to any unities which we mortals prize  whether it might have proved tragedy or comedy or tragicomedy or pastoral we cannot tell  this sunday ended by the going down of the sun leaving us still on the waves  but they who are on the water enjoy a longer and brighter twilight than they who are on the land for here the water as well as the atmosphere absorbs and reflects the light and some of the day seems to have sunk down into the waves  the light gradually forsook the deep water as well as the deeper air and the gloaming came to the fishes as well as to us and more dim and gloomy to them whose day is a perpetual twilight though sufficiently bright for their weak and watery eyes  vespers had already rung in many a dim and watery chapel down below where the shadows of the weeds were extended in length over the sandy floor  the vespertinal pout had already begun to flit on leathern fin and the finny gossips withdrew from the fluvial street to creeks and coves and other private haunts excepting a few of stronger fin which anchored in the stream stemming the tide even in their dreams  meanwhile like a dark evening cloud we were wafted over the cope of their sky deepening the shadows on their deluged fields  having reached a retired part of the river where it spread out to sixty rods in width we pitched our tent on the east side in tyngsborough just above some patches of the beach plum which was now nearly ripe where the sloping bank was a sufficient pillow and with the bustle of sailors making the land we transferred such stores as were required from boat to tent and hung a lantern to the tentpole and so our house was ready with a buffalo spread on the grass and a blanket for our covering our bed was soon made  a fire crackled merrily before the entrance so near that we could tend it without stepping abroad and when we had supped we put out the blaze and closed the door and with the semblance of domestic comfort sat up to read the gazetteer to learn our latitude and longitude and write the journal of the voyage or listened to the wind and the rippling of the river till sleep overtook us  there we lay under an oak on the bank of the stream near to some farmers cornfield getting sleep and forgetting where we were a great blessing that we are obliged to forget our enterprises every twelve hours  minks muskrats meadowmice woodchucks squirrels skunks rabbits foxes and weasels all inhabit near but keep very close while you are there  the river sucking and eddying away all night down toward the marts and the seaboard a great wash and freshet and no small enterprise to reflect on instead of the scythian vastness of the billerica night and its wild musical sounds we were kept awake by the boisterous sport of some irish laborers on the railroad wafted to us over the water still unwearied and unresting on this seventh day who would not have done with whirling up and down the track with ever increasing velocity and still reviving shouts till late in the night  one sailor was visited in his dreams this night by the evil destinies and all those powers that are hostile to human life which constrain and oppress the minds of men and make their path seem difficult and narrow and beset with dangers so that the most innocent and worthy enterprises appear insolent and a tempting of fate and the gods go not with us  but the other happily passed a serene and even ambrosial or immortal night and his sleep was dreamless or only the atmosphere of pleasant dreams remained a happy natural sleep until the morning and his cheerful spirit soothed and reassured his brother for whenever they meet the good genius is sure to prevail     page

rippling confidently seaward and the nimble early rising wind rustled the oak leaves about our tent all men having reinforced their bodies and their souls with sleep and cast aside doubt and fear were invited to unattempted adventures       all courageous knichtis       agains the day dichtis       the breestplate that bricht is            to feght with their foue       the stoned steed stampis       throw curage and crampis       syne on the land lampis            the night is neir gone  one of us took the boat over to the opposite shore which was flat and accessible a quarter of a mile distant to empty it of water and wash out the clay while the other kindled a fire and got breakfast ready  at an early hour we were again on our way rowing through the fog as before the river already awake and a million crisped waves come forth to meet the sun when he should show himself  the countrymen recruited by their day of rest were already stirring and had begun to cross the ferry on the business of the week  this ferry was as busy as a beaver dam and all the world seemed anxious to get across the merrimack river at this particular point waiting to get set overchildren  with their two cents done up in paper jailbirds broke loose and constable with warrant travellers from distant lands to distant lands men and women to whom the merrimack river was a bar  there stands a gig in the gray morning in the mist the impatient traveller pacing the wet shore with whip in hand and shouting through the fog after the regardless charon and his retreating ark as if he might throw that passenger overboard and return forthwith for himself he will compensate him  he is to break his fast at some unseen place on the opposite side  it may be ledyard or the wandering jew  whence pray did he come out of the foggy night  and whither through the sunny day will he go  we observe only his transit important to us forgotten by him transiting all day  there are two of them  may be they are virgil and dante  but when they crossed the styx none were seen bound up or down the stream that i remember  it is only a transjectus a transitory voyage like life itself none but the longlived gods bound up or down the stream  many of these monday men are ministers no doubt reseeking their parishes with hired horses with sermons in their valises all read and gutted the day after never with them  they cross each others routes all the country over like woof and warp making a garment of loose texture vacation now for six days  they stop to pick nuts and berries and gather apples by the wayside at their leisure good religious men with the love of men in their hearts and the means to pay their toll in their pockets  we got over this ferry chain without scraping rowing athwart the tide of travelno toll for us that day  the fog dispersed and we rowed leisurely along through tyngsborough with a clear sky and a mild atmosphere leaving the habitations of men behind and penetrating yet farther into the territory of ancient dunstable  it was from dunstable then a frontier town that the famous captain lovewell with his company marched in quest of the indians on the 18th of april 1725  he was the son of an ensign in the army of oliver cromwell who came to this country and settled at dunstable where he died at the great age of one hundred and twenty years in the words of the old nursery tale sung about a hundred years ago       he and his valiant soldiers did range the woods full wide       and hardships they endured to quell the indians pride  in the shaggy pine forest of pequawket they met the rebel indians and prevailed after a bloody fight and a remnant returned home to enjoy the fame of their victory  a township called lovewells town but now for some reason or perhaps without reason pembroke was granted them by the state       of all our valiant english there were but thirtyfour       and of the rebel indians there were about fourscore       and sixteen of our english did safely home return       the rest were killed and wounded for which we all must mourn       our worthy capt  lovewell among them there did die       they killed lieut  robbins and wounded good young frye       who was our english chaplin he many indians slew       and some of them he scalped while bullets round him flew  our brave forefathers have exterminated all the indians and their degenerate children no longer dwell in garrisoned houses nor hear any warwhoop in their path  it would be well perchance if many an english chaplin in these days could exhibit as unquestionable trophies of his valor as did good young frye  we have need to be as sturdy pioneers still as miles standish or church or lovewell  we are to follow on another trail it is true but one as convenient for ambushes what if the indians are exterminated are not savages as grim prowling about the clearings today       and braving many dangers and hardships in the way      they safe arrived at dunstable the thirteenth  day of may  but they did not all safe arrive in dunstable the thirteenth or the fifteenth or the thirtieth day of may  eleazer davis and josiah jones both of concord for our native town had seven men in this fight lieutenant farwell of dunstable and jonathan frye of andover who were all wounded were left behind creeping toward the settlements  after travelling several miles frye was left and lost though a more recent poet has assigned him company in his last hours       a man he was of comely form        polished and brave well learned and kind      old harvards learned halls he left        far in the wilds a grave to find       ah now his bloodred arm he lifts        his closing lids he tries to raise      and speak once more before he dies        in supplication and in praise       he prays kind heaven to grant success        brave lovewells men to guide and bless      and when theyve shed their heartblood true        to raise them all to happiness                              lieutenant farwell took his hand        his arm around his neck he threw      and said brave chaplain i could wish        that heaven had made me die for you                           farwell held out eleven days  a tradition says as we learn from the history of concord that arriving at a pond with lieut farwell davis pulled off one of his moccasins cut it in strings on which he fastened a hook caught some fish fried and ate them  they refreshed him but were injurious to farwell who died soon after  davis had a ball lodged in his body and his right hand shot off but on the whole he seems to have been less damaged than his companion  he came into berwick after being out fourteen days  jones also had a ball lodged in his body but he likewise got into saco after fourteen days though not in the best condition imaginable  he had subsisted says an old journal on the spontaneous vegetables of the forest and cranberries which he had eaten came out of wounds he had received in his body  this was also the case with davis  the last two reached home at length safe if not sound and lived many years in a crippled state to enjoy their pension  but alas of the crippled indians and their adventures in the woods       for as we are informed so thick and fast they fell      scarce twenty of their number at night did get home well  how many balls lodged with them how fared their cranberries what berwick or saco they got into and finally what pension or township was granted them there is no journal to tell  it is stated in the history of dunstable that just before his last march lovewell was warned to beware of the ambuscades of the enemy but he replied that he did not care for them and bending down a small elm beside which he was standing into a bow declared that he would treat the indians in the same way this elm is still standing in nashua a venerable and magnificent tree   meanwhile having passed the horseshoe interval in tyngsborough where the river makes a sudden bend to the northwestfor our reflections have anticipated our progress somewhatwe were advancing farther into the country and into the day which last proved almost as golden as the preceding though the slight bustle and activity of the monday seemed to penetrate even to this scenery  now and then we had to muster all our energy to get round a point where the river broke rippling over rocks and the maples trailed their branches in the stream but there was generally a backwater or eddy on the side of which we took advantage  the river was here about forty rods wide and fifteen feet deep  occasionally one ran along the shore examining the country and visiting the nearest farmhouses while the other followed the windings of the stream alone to meet his companion at some distant point and hear the report of his adventures how the farmer praised the coolness of his well and his wife offered the stranger a draught of milk or the children quarrelled for the only transparency in the window that they might get sight of the man at the well  for though the country seemed so new and no house was observed by us shut in between the banks that sunny day we did not have to travel far to find where men inhabited like wild bees and had sunk wells in the loose sand and loam of the merrimack  there dwelt the subject of the hebrew scriptures and the esprit des lois where a thin vaporous smoke curled up through the noon  all that is told of mankind of the inhabitants of the upper nile and the sunderbunds and timbuctoo and the orinoko was experience here  every race and class of men was represented  according to belknap the historian of new hampshire who wrote sixty years ago here too perchance dwelt new lights and free thinking men even then  the people in general throughout the state it is written are professors of the christian religion in some form or other  there is however a sort of wise men who pretend to reject it but they have not yet been able to substitute a better in its place  the other voyageur perhaps would in the mean while have seen a brown hawk or a woodchuck or a musquash creeping under the alders  we occasionally rested in the shade of a maple or a willow and drew forth a melon for our refreshment while we contemplated at our leisure the lapse of the river and of human life and as that current with its floating twigs and leaves so did all things pass in review before us while far away in cities and marts on this very stream the old routine was proceeding still  there is indeed a tide in the affairs of men as the poet says and yet as things flow they circulate and the ebb always balances the flow  all streams are but tributary to the ocean which itself does not stream and the shores are unchanged but in longer periods than man can measure  go where we will we discover infinite change in particulars only not in generals when i go into a museum and see the mummies wrapped in their linen bandages i see that the lives of men began to need reform as long ago as when they walked the earth  i come out into the streets and meet men who declare that the time is near at hand for the redemption of the race  but as men lived in thebes so do they live in dunstable today  time drinketh up the essence of every great and noble action which ought to be performed and is delayed in the execution so says veeshnoo sarma and we perceive that the schemers return again and again to common sense and labor  such is the evidence of history     yet i doubt not through the ages one increasing purpose runs    and the thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns  there are secret articles in our treaties with the gods of more importance than all the rest which the historian can never know  there are many skilful apprentices but few master workmen  on every hand we observe a truly wise practice in education in morals and in the arts of life the embodied wisdom of many an ancient philosopher  who does not see that heresies have some time prevailed that reforms have already taken place  all this worldly wisdom might be regarded as the once unamiable heresy of some wise man  some interests have got a footing on the earth which we have not made sufficient allowance for  even they who first built these barns and cleared the land thus had some valor  the abrupt epochs and chasms are smoothed down in history as the inequalities of the plain are concealed by distance  but unless we do more than simply learn the trade of our time we are but apprentices and not yet masters of the art of life  now that we are casting away these melon seeds how can we help feeling reproach  he who eats the fruit should at least plant the seed aye if possible a better seed than that whose fruit he has enjoyed  seeds  there are seeds enough which need only to be stirred in with the soil where they lie by an inspired voice or pen to bear fruit of a divine flavor  o thou spendthrift  defray thy debt to the world eat not the seed of institutions as the luxurious do but plant it rather while thou devourest the pulp and tuber for thy subsistence that so perchance one variety may at last be found worthy of preservation  there are moments when all anxiety and stated toil are becalmed in the infinite leisure and repose of nature  all laborers must have their nooning and at this season of the day we are all more or less asiatics and give over all work and reform  while lying thus on our oars by the side of the stream in the heat of the day our boat held by an osier put through the staple in its prow and slicing the melons which are a fruit of the east our thoughts reverted to arabia persia and hindostan the lands of contemplation and dwellingplaces of the ruminant nations  in the experience of this noontide we could find some apology even for the instinct of the opium betel and tobacco chewers  mount saber according to the french traveller and naturalist botta is celebrated for producing the kattree of which the soft tops of the twigs and tender leaves are eaten says his reviewer and produce an agreeable soothing excitement restoring from fatigue banishing sleep and disposing to the enjoyment of conversation  we thought that we might lead a dignified oriental life along this stream as well and the maple and alders would be our kattrees  it is a great pleasure to escape sometimes from the restless class of reformers  what if these grievances exist  so do you and i  think you that sitting hens are troubled with ennui these long summer days sitting on and on in the crevice of a hayloft without active employment  by the faint cackling in distant barns i judge that dame nature is interested still to know how many eggs her hens lay  the universal soul as it is called has an interest in the stacking of hay the foddering of cattle and the draining of peatmeadows  away in scythia away in india it makes butter and cheese  suppose that all farms are run out and we youths must buy old land and bring it to still everywhere the relentless opponents of reform bear a strange resemblance to ourselves or perchance they are a few old maids and bachelors who sit round the kitchen hearth and listen to the singing of the kettle  the oracles often give victory to our choice and not to the order alone of the mundane periods  as for instance when they say that our voluntary sorrows germinate in us as the growth of the particular life we lead the reform which you talk about can be undertaken any morning before unbarring our doors we need not call any convention  when two neighbors begin to eat corn bread who before ate wheat then the gods smile from ear to ear for it is very pleasant to them  why do you not try it dont let me hinder you  there are theoretical reformers at all times and all the world over living on anticipation  wolff travelling in the deserts of bokhara says another party of derveeshes came to me and observed the time will come when there shall be no difference between rich and poor between high and low when property will be in common even wives and children but forever i ask of such what then  the derveeshes in the deserts of bokhara and the reformers in marlboro chapel sing the same song  theres a good time coming boys but asked one of the audience in good faith can you fix the date said i will you help it along  the nonchalance and dolcefarniente air of nature and society hint at infinite periods in the progress of mankind  the states have leisure to laugh from maine to texas at some newspaper joke and new england shakes at the doubleentendres of australian circles while the poor reformer cannot get a hearing  men do not fail commonly for want of knowledge but for want of prudence to give wisdom the preference  what we need to know in any case is very simple  it is but too easy to establish another durable and harmonious routine  immediately all parts of nature consent to it  only make something to take the place of something and men will behave as if it was the very thing they wanted they must behave at any rate and will work up any material there is always a present and extant life be it better or worse which all combine to uphold  we should be slow to mend my friends as slow to require mending not hurling according to the oracle a transcendent foot towards piety  the language of excitement is at best picturesque merely  you must be calm before you can utter oracles  what was the excitement of the delphic priestess compared with the calm wisdom of socratesor whoever it was that was wiseenthusiasm is a supernatural serenity       men find that action is another thing        than what they in discoursing papers read      the worlds affairs require in managing        more arts than those wherein you clerks proceed  as in geology so in social institutions we may discover the causes of all past change in the present invariable order of society  the greatest appreciable physical revolutions are the work of the lightfooted air the stealthypaced water and the subterranean fire  aristotle said as time never fails and the universe is eternal neither the tanais nor the nile can have flowed forever we are independent of the change we detect the longer the lever the less perceptible its motion  it is the slowest pulsation which is the most vital  the hero then will know how to wait as well as to make haste  all good abides with him who waiteth wisely we shall sooner overtake the dawn by remaining here than by hurrying over the hills of the west  be assured that every mans success is in proportion to his average ability  the meadow flowers spring and bloom where the waters annually deposit their slime not where they reach in some freshet only  a man is not his hope nor his despair nor yet his past deed  we know not yet what we have done still less what we are doing  wait till evening and other parts of our days work will shine than we had thought at noon and we shall discover the real purport of our toil  as when the farmer has reached the end of the furrow and looks back he can tell best where the pressed earth shines most   to one who habitually endeavors to contemplate the true state of things the political state can hardly be said to have any existence whatever  it is unreal incredible and insignificant to him and for him to endeavor to extract the truth from such lean material is like making sugar from linen rags when sugarcane may be had  generally speaking the political news whether domestic or foreign might be written today for the next ten years with sufficient accuracy  most revolutions in society have not power to interest still less alarm us but tell me that our rivers are drying up or the genus pine dying out in the country and i might attend  most events recorded in history are more remarkable than important like eclipses of the sun and moon by which all are attracted but whose effects no one takes the trouble to calculate  but will the government never be so well administered inquired one that we private men shall hear nothing about it  the king answered at all events i require a prudent and able man who is capable of managing the state affairs of my kingdom  the exminister said the criterion o sire of a wise and competent man is that he will not meddle with such like matters  alas that the exminister should have been so nearly right  in my short experience of human life the outward obstacles if there were any such have not been living men but the institutions of the dead  it is grateful to make ones way through this latest generation as through dewy grass  men are as innocent as the morning to the unsuspicious       and round about good morrows fly      as if day taught humanity  not being reve of this shire       the early pilgrim blithe he hailed      that oer the hills did stray      and many an early husbandman      that he met on the way  thieves and robbers all nevertheless  i have not so surely foreseen that any cossack or chippeway would come to disturb the honest and simple commonwealth as that some monster institution would at length embrace and crush its free members in its scaly folds for it is not to be forgotten that while the law holds fast the thief and murderer it lets itself go loose  when i have not paid the tax which the state demanded for that protection which i did not want itself has robbed me when i have asserted the liberty it presumed to declare itself has imprisoned me  poor creature if it knows no better i will not blame it  if it cannot live but by these means i can  i do not wish it happens to be associated with massachusetts either in holding slaves or in conquering mexico  i am a little better than herself in these respectsas for massachusetts that huge she briareus argus and colchian dragon conjoined set to watch the heifer of the constitution and the golden fleece we would not warrant our respect for her like some compositions to preserve its qualities through all weathersthus it has happened that not the arch fiend himself has been in my way but these toils which tradition says were originally spun to obstruct him  they are cobwebs and trifling obstacles in an earnest mans path it is true and at length one even becomes attached to his unswept and undusted garret  i love mankind but i hate the institutions of the dead unkind  men execute nothing so faithfully as the wills of the dead to the last codicil and letter  they rule this world and the living are but their executors  such foundation too have our lectures and our sermons commonly  they are all dudleian and piety derives its origin still from that exploit of pius aeneas who bore his father anchises on his shoulders from the ruins of troy  or rather like some indian tribes we bear about with us the mouldering relics of our ancestors on our shoulders  if for instance a man asserts the value of individual liberty over the merely political commonweal his neighbor still tolerates him that he who is living near him sometimes even sustains him but never the state  its officer as a living man may have human virtues and a thought in his brain but as the tool of an institution a jailer or constable it may be he is not a whit superior to his prison key or his staff  herein is the tragedy that men doing outrage to their proper natures even those called wise and good lend themselves to perform the office of inferior and brutal ones  hence come war and slavery in and what else may not come in by this opening  but certainly there are modes by which a man may put bread into his mouth which will not prejudice him as a companion and neighbor       now turn again turn again said the pinder      for a wrong way you have gone      for you have forsaken the kings highway      and made a path over the corn  undoubtedly countless reforms are called for because society is not animated or instinct enough with life but in the condition of some snakes which i have seen in early spring with alternate portions of their bodies torpid and flexible so that they could wriggle neither way  all men are partially buried in the grave of custom and of some we see only the crown of the head above ground  better are the physically dead for they more lively rot  even virtue is no longer such if it be stagnant  a mans life should be constantly as fresh as this river  it should be the same channel but a new water every instant                 virtues as rivers pass      but still remains that virtuous man there was  most men have no inclination no rapids no cascades but marshes and alligators and miasma instead  we read that when in the expedition of alexander onesicritus was sent forward to meet certain of the indian sect of gymnosophists and he had told them of those new philosophers of the west pythagoras socrates and diogenes and their doctrines one of them named dandamis answered that they appeared to him to have been men of genius but to have lived with too passive a regard for the laws the philosophers of the west are liable to this rebuke still  they say that lieouhiahoei and chaolien did not sustain to the end their resolutions and that they dishonored their character their language was in harmony with reason and justice while their acts were in harmony with the sentiments of men  chateaubriand said there are two things which grow stronger in the breast of man in proportion as he advances in years the love of country and religion  let them be never so much forgotten in youth they sooner or later present themselves to us arrayed in all their charms and excite in the recesses of our hearts an attachment justly due to their beauty it may be so but even this infirmity of noble minds marks the gradual decay of youthful hope and faith  it is the allowed infidelity of age there is a saying of the yoloffs he who was born first has the greatest number of old clothes consequently m  chateaubriand has more old clothes than i have  it is comparatively a faint and reflected beauty that is admired not an essential and intrinsic one  it is because the old are weak feel their mortality and think that they have measured the strength of man they will not boast they will be frank and humble  well let them have the few poor comforts they can keep  humility is still a very human virtue  they look back on life and so see not into the future  the prospect of the young is forward and unbounded mingling the future with the present  in the declining day the thoughts make haste to rest in darkness and hardly look forward to the ensuing morning  the thoughts of the old prepare for night and slumber  the same hopes and prospects are not for him who stands upon the rosy mountaintops of life and him who expects the setting of his earthly day  i must conclude that conscience if that be the name of it was not given us for no purpose or for a hinderance  however flattering order and expediency may look it is but the repose of a lethargy and we will choose rather to be awake though it be stormy and maintain ourselves on this earth and in this life as we may without signing our deathwarrant  let us see if we cannot stay here where he has put us on his own conditions  does not his law reach as far as his light  the expedients of the nations clash with one another only the absolutely right is expedient for all  there are some passages in the antigone of sophocles well known to scholars of which i am reminded in this connection  antigone has resolved to sprinkle sand on the dead body of her brother polynices notwithstanding the edict of king creon condemning to death that one who should perform this service which the greeks deemed so important for the enemy of his country but ismene who is of a less resolute and noble spirit declines taking part with her sister in this work and says  i therefore asking those under the earth to consider me that i am compelled to do thus will obey those who are placed in office for to do extreme things is not wise                             antigone  i would not ask you nor would you if you still wished do it joyfully with me  be such as seems good to you  but i will bury him  it is glorious for me doing this to die  i beloved will lie with him beloved having like a criminal done what is holy since the time is longer which it is necessary for me to please those below than those here for there i shall always lie  but if it seems good to you hold in dishonor things which are honored by the gods                               ismene  i indeed do not hold them in dishonor but to act in opposition to the citizens i am by nature unable   antigone being at length brought before king creon he asks   did you then dare to transgress these laws                               antigone  for it was not zeus who proclaimed these to me nor justice who dwells with the gods below it was not they who established these laws among men  nor did i think that your proclamations were so strong as being a mortal to be able to transcend the unwritten and immovable laws of the gods  for not something now and yesterday but forever these live and no one knows from what time they appeared  i was not about to pay the penalty of violating these to the gods fearing the presumption of any man for i well knew that i should die and why not even if you had not proclaimed it  this was concerning the burial of a dead body   the wisest conservatism is that of the hindoos  immemorial custom is transcendent law says menu  that is it was the custom of the gods before men used it  the fault of our new england custom is that it is memorial  what is morality but immemorial custom  conscience is the chief of conservatives perform the settled functions says kreeshna in the bhagvatgeeta action is preferable to inaction  the journey of thy mortal frame may not succeed from inactiona mans own calling with all its faults ought not to be forsaken  every undertaking is involved in its faults as the fire in its smokethe man who is acquainted with the whole should not drive those from their works who are slow of comprehension and less experienced than himselfwherefore o arjoon resolve to fight is the advice of the god to the irresolute soldier who fears to slay his best friends  it is a sublime conservatism as wide as the world and as unwearied as time preserving the universe with asiatic anxiety in that state in which it appeared to their minds  these philosophers dwell on the inevitability and unchangeableness of laws on the power of temperament and constitution the three goon or qualities and the circumstances of birth and affinity  the end is an immense consolation eternal absorption in brahma  their speculations never venture beyond their own tablelands though they are high and vast as they  buoyancy freedom flexibility variety possibility which also are qualities of the unnamed they deal not with  the undeserved reward is to be earned by an everlasting moral drudgery the incalculable promise of the morrow is as it were weighed  and who will say that their conservatism has not been effectual  assuredly says a french translator speaking of the antiquity and durability of the chinese and indian nations and of the wisdom of their legislators there are there some vestiges of the eternal laws which govern the world  christianity on the other hand is humane practical and in a large sense radical  so many years and ages of the gods those eastern sages sat contemplating brahm uttering in silence the mystic om being absorbed into the essence of the supreme being never going out of themselves but subsiding farther and deeper within so infinitely wise yet infinitely stagnant until at last in that same asia but in the western part of it appeared a youth wholly unforetold by themnot being absorbed into brahm but bringing brahm down to earth and to mankind in whom brahm had awaked from his long sleep and exerted himself and the day begana new avatar  the brahman had never thought to be a brother of mankind as well as a child of god  christ is the prince of reformers and radicals  many expressions in the new testament come naturally to the lips of all protestants and it furnishes the most pregnant and practical texts  there is no harmless dreaming no wise speculation in it but everywhere a substratum of good sense  it never reflects but it repents there is no poetry in it we may say nothing regarded in the light of beauty merely but moral truth is its object  all mortals are convicted by its conscience  the new testament is remarkable for its pure morality the best of the hindo scripture for its pure intellectuality  the reader is nowhere raised into and sustained in a higher purer or rarer region of thought than in the bhagvatgeeta  warren hastings in his sensible letter recommending the translation of this book to the chairman of the east india company declares the original to be of a sublimity of conception reasoning and diction almost unequalled and that the writings of the indian philosophers will survive when the british dominion in india shall have long ceased to exist and when the sources which it once yielded of wealth and power are lost to remembrance it is unquestionably one of the noblest and most sacred scriptures which have come down to us  books are to be distinguished by the grandeur of their topics even more than by the manner in which they are treated  the oriental philosophy approaches easily loftier themes than the modern aspires to and no wonder if it sometimes prattle about them  it only assigns their due rank respectively to action and contemplation or rather does full justice to the latter  western philosophers have not conceived of the significance of contemplation in their sense  speaking of the spiritual discipline to which the brahmans subjected themselves and the wonderful power of abstraction to which they attained instances of which had come under his notice hastings says    to those who have never been accustomed to the separation of   the mind from the notices of the senses it may not be easy to   conceive by what means such a power is to be attained since   even the most studious men of our hemisphere will find it   difficult so to restrain their attention but that it will   wander to some object of present sense or recollection and   even the buzzing of a fly will sometimes have the power to   disturb it  but if we are told that there have been men who   were successively for ages past in the daily habit of   abstracted contemplation begun in the earliest period of   youth and continued in many to the maturity of age each   adding some portion of knowledge to the store accumulated by   his predecessors it is not assuming too much to conclude that   as the mind ever gathers strength like the body by exercise   so in such an exercise it may in each have acquired the faculty   to which they aspired and that their collective studies may   have led them to the discovery of new tracts and combinations   of sentiment totally different from the doctrines with which   the learned of other nations are acquainted doctrines which   however speculative and subtle still as they possess the   advantage of being derived from a source so free from every   adventitious mixture may be equally founded in truth with the   most simple of our own  the forsaking of works was taught by kreeshna to the most ancient of men and handed down from age to age    until at length in the course of time the mighty art was lost    in wisdom is to be found every work without exception says   kreeshna    although thou wert the greatest of all offenders thou shalt   be able to cross the gulf of sin with the bark of wisdom    there is not anything in this world to be compared with wisdom   for purity    the action stands at a distance inferior to the application of   wisdom    the wisdom of a moonee is confirmed when like the tortoise   he can draw in all his members and restrain them from their   wonted purposes    children only and not the learned speak of the speculative   and the practical doctrines as two  they are but one  for   both obtain the selfsame end and the place which is gained by   the followers of the one is gained by the followers of the   other    the man enjoyeth not freedom from action from the   noncommencement of that which he hath to do nor doth he   obtain happiness from a total inactivity  no one ever resteth   a moment inactive  every man is involuntarily urged to act by   those principles which are inherent in his nature  the man who   restraineth his active faculties and sitteth down with his   mind attentive to the objects of his senses is called one of   an astrayed soul and the practiser of deceit  so the man is   praised who having subdued all his passions performeth with   his active faculties all the functions of life unconcerned   about the event    let the motive be in the deed and not in the event  be not   one whose motive for action is the hope of reward  let not thy   life be spent in inaction    for the man who doeth that which he hath to do without   affection obtaineth the supreme    he who may behold as it were inaction in action and action   in inaction is wise amongst mankind  he is a perfect   performer of all duty    wise men call him a pandeet whose every undertaking is free   from the idea of desire and whose actions are consumed by the   fire of wisdom  he abandoneth the desire of a reward of his   actions he is always contented and independent and although   he may be engaged in a work he as it were doeth nothing    he is both a yogee and a sannyasee who performeth that which   he hath to do independent of the fruit thereof not he who   liveth without the sacrificial fire and without action    he who enjoyeth but the amreeta which is left of his   offerings obtaineth the eternal spirit of brahm the supreme   what after all does the practicalness of life amount to  the things immediate to be done are very trivial  i could postpone them all to hear this locust sing  the most glorious fact in my experience is not anything that i have done or may hope to do but a transient thought or vision or dream which i have had i would give all the wealth of the world and all the deeds of all the heroes for one true vision  but how can i communicate with the gods who am a pencilmaker on the earth and not be insane    i am the same to all mankind says kreeshna there is not   one who is worthy of my love or hatred  this teaching is not practical in the sense in which the new testament is  it is not always sound sense inpractice  the brahman never proposes courageously to assault evil but patiently to starve it out  his active faculties are paralyzed by the idea of cast of impassable limits of destiny and the tyranny of time  kreeshnas argument it must be allowed is defective  no sufficient reason is given why arjoon should fight  arjoon may be convinced but the reader is not for his judgment is not formed upon the speculative doctrines of the sankhya sastra  seek an asylum in wisdom alone but what is wisdom to a western mind  the duty of which he speaks is an arbitrary one  when was it established  the brahmans virtue consists in doing not right but arbitrary things  what is that which a man hath to do  what is action  what are the settled functions  what is a mans own religion which is so much better than anothers  what is a mans own particular calling  what are the duties which are appointed by ones birth  it is a defence of the institution of casts of what is called the natural duty of the kshetree or soldier to attach himself to the discipline not to flee from the field and the like  but they who are unconcerned about the consequences of their actions are not therefore unconcerned about their actions  behold the difference between the oriental and the occidental the former has nothing to do in this world the latter is full of activity  the one looks in the sun till his eyes are put out the other follows him prone in his westward course  there is such a thing as caste even in the west but it is comparatively faint it is conservatism here  it says forsake not your calling outrage no institution use no violence rend no bonds the state is thy parent  its virtue or manhood is wholly filial there is a struggle between the oriental and occidental in every nation some who would be forever contemplating the sun and some who are hastening toward the sunset  the former class says to the latter when you have reached the sunset you will be no nearer to the sun  to which the latter replies but we so prolong the day  the former walketh but in that night when all things go to rest the night of time  the contemplative moonee sleepeth but in the day of time when all things wake  to conclude these extracts i can say in the words of sanjay as o mighty prince  i recollect again and again this holy and wonderful dialogue of kreeshna and arjoon i continue more and more to rejoice and as i recall to my memory the more than miraculous form of haree my astonishment is great and i marvel and rejoice again and again  wherever kreeshna the god of devotion may be wherever arjoon the mighty bowman may be there too without doubt are fortune riches victory and good conduct  this is my firm belief  i would say to the readers of scriptures if they wish for a good book read the bhagvatgeeta an episode to the mahabharat said to have been written by kreeshna dwypayen veiasknown to have been written by more than four thousand years agoit matters not whether three or four or whentranslated by charles wilkins  it deserves to be read with reverence even by yankees as a part of the sacred writings of a devout people and the intelligent hebrew will rejoice to find in it a moral grandeur and sublimity akin to those of his own scriptures  to an american reader who by the advantage of his position can see over that strip of atlantic coast to asia and the pacific who as it were sees the shore slope upward over the alps to the himmaleh mountains the comparatively recent literature of europe often appears partial and clannish and notwithstanding the limited range of his own sympathies and studies the european writer who presumes that he is speaking for the world is perceived by him to speak only for that corner of it which he inhabits  one of the rarest of englands scholars and critics in his classification of the worthies of the world betrays the narrowness of his european culture and the exclusiveness of his reading  none of her children has done justice to the poets and philosophers of persia or of india  they have even been better known to her merchant scholars than to her poets and thinkers by profession  you may look in vain through english poetry for a single memorable verse inspired by these themes  nor is germany to be excepted though her philological industry is indirectly serving the cause of philosophy and poetry  even goethe wanted that universality of genius which could have appreciated the philosophy of india if he had more nearly approached it  his genius was more practical dwelling much more in the regions of the understanding and was less native to contemplation than the genius of those sages  it is remarkable that homer and a few hebrews are the most oriental names which modern europe whose literature has taken its rise since the decline of the persian has admitted into her list of worthies and perhaps the worthiest of mankind and the fathers of modern thinkingfor the contemplations of those indian sages have influenced and still influence the intellectual development of mankindwhose works even yet survive in wonderful completeness are for the most part not recognized as ever having existed  if the lions had been the painters it would have been otherwise  in every ones youthful dreams philosophy is still vaguely but inseparably and with singular truth associated with the east nor do after years discover its local habitation in the western world  in comparison with the philosophers of the east we may say that modern europe has yet given birth to none  beside the vast and cosmogonal philosophy of the bhagvatgeeta even our shakespeare seems sometimes youthfully green and practical merely  some of these sublime sentences as the chaldaean oracles of zoroaster still surviving after a thousand revolutions and translations alone make us doubt if the poetic form and dress are not transitory and not essential to the most effective and enduring expression of thought  ex oriente lux may still be the motto of scholars for the western world has not yet derived from the east all the light which it is destined to receive thence  it would be worthy of the age to print together the collected scriptures or sacred writings of the several nations the chinese the hindoos the persians the hebrews and others as the scripture of mankind  the new testament is still perhaps too much on the lips and in the hearts of men to be called a scripture in this sense  such a juxtaposition and comparison might help to liberalize the faith of men  this is a work which time will surely edit reserved to crown the labors of the printingpress  this would be the bible or book of books which let the missionaries carry to the uttermost parts of the earth   while engaged in these reflections thinking ourselves the only navigators of these waters suddenly a canalboat with its sail set glided round a point before us like some huge river beast and changed the scene in an instant and then another and another glided into sight and we found ourselves in the current of commerce once more  so we threw our rinds in the water for the fishes to nibble and added our breath to the life of living men little did we think in the distant garden in which we had planted the seed and reared this fruit where it would be eaten our melons lay at home on the sandy bottom of the merrimack and our potatoes in the sun and water at the bottom of the boat looked like a fruit of the country  soon however we were delivered from this fleet of junks and possessed the river in solitude once more rowing steadily upward through the noon between the territories of nashua on the one hand and hudson once nottingham on the other  from time to time we scared up a kingfisher or a summer duck the former flying rather by vigorous impulses than by steady and patient steering with that short rudder of his sounding his rattle along the fluvial street  erelong another scow hove in sight creeping down the river and hailing it we attached ourselves to its side and floated back in company chatting with the boatmen and obtaining a draught of cooler water from their jug  they appeared to be green hands from far among the hills who had taken this means to get to the seaboard and see the world and would possibly visit the falkland isles and the china seas before they again saw the waters of the merrimack or perchance they would not return this way forever  they had already embarked the private interests of the landsman in the larger venture of the race and were ready to mess with mankind reserving only the till of a chest to themselves  but they too were soon lost behind a point and we went croaking on our way alone  what grievance has its root among the new hampshire hills we asked what is wanting to human life here that these men should make such haste to the antipodes  we prayed that their bright anticipations might not be rudely disappointed       though all the fates should prove unkind      leave not your native land behind      the ship becalmed at length stands still      the steed must rest beneath the hill      but swiftly still our fortunes pace      to find us out in every place       the vessel though her masts be firm      beneath her copper bears a worm      around the cape across the line      till fields of ice her course confine      it matters not how smooth the breeze      how shallow or how deep the seas      whether she bears manilla twine      or in her hold madeira wine      or china teas or spanish hides      in port or quarantine she rides      far from new englands blustering shore      new englands worm her hulk shall bore      and sink her in the indian seas      twine wine and hides and china teas  we passed a small desert here on the east bank between tyngsborough and hudson which was interesting and even refreshing to our eyes in the midst of the almost universal greenness  this sand was indeed somewhat impressive and beautiful to us  a very old inhabitant who was at work in a field on the nashua side told us that he remembered when corn and grain grew there and it was a cultivated field  but at length the fishermen for this was a fishing place pulled up the bushes on the shore for greater convenience in hauling their seines and when the bank was thus broken the wind began to blow up the sand from the shore until at length it had covered about fifteen acres several feet deep  we saw near the river where the sand was blown off down to some ancient surface the foundation of an indian wigwam exposed a perfect circle of burnt stones four or five feet in diameter mingled with fine charcoal and the bones of small animals which had been preserved in the sand  the surrounding sand was sprinkled with other burnt stones on which their fires had been built as well as with flakes of arrowhead stone and we found one perfect arrowhead in one place we noticed where an indian had sat to manufacture arrowheads out of quartz and the sand was sprinkled with a quart of small glasslike chips about as big as a fourpence which he had broken off in his work  here then the indians must have fished before the whites arrived  there was another similar sandy tract about half a mile above this   still the noon prevailed and we turned the prow aside to bathe and recline ourselves under some buttonwoods by a ledge of rocks in a retired pasture sloping to the waters edge and skirted with pines and hazels in the town of hudson  still had india and that old noontide philosophy the better part of our thoughts  it is always singular but encouraging to meet with common sense in very old books as the heetopades of veeshnoo sarma a playful wisdom which has eyes behind as well as before and oversees itself  it asserts their health and independence of the experience of later times  this pledge of sanity cannot be spared in a book that it sometimes pleasantly reflect upon itself  the story and fabulous portion of this book winds loosely from sentence to sentence as so many oases in a desert and is as indistinct as a camels track between mourzouk and darfour  it is a comment on the flow and freshet of modern books  the reader leaps from sentence to sentence as from one steppingstone to another while the stream of the story rushes past unregarded  the bhagvatgeeta is less sententious and poetic perhaps but still more wonderfully sustained and developed  its sanity and sublimity have impressed the minds even of soldiers and merchants  it is the characteristic of great poems that they will yield of their sense in due proportion to the hasty and the deliberate reader  to the practical they will be common sense and to the wise wisdom as either the traveller may wet his lips or an army may fill its watercasks at a full stream  one of the most attractive of those ancient books that i have met with is the laws of menu  according to sir william jones vyasa the son of parasara has decided that the veda with its angas or the six compositions deduced from it the revealed system of medicine the puranas or sacred histories and the code of menu were four works of supreme authority which ought never to be shaken by arguments merely human the last is believed by the hindoos to have been promulged in the beginning of time by menu son or grandson of brahma and first of created beings and brahma is said to have taught his laws to menu in a hundred thousand verses which menu explained to the primitive world in the very words of the book now translated others affirm that they have undergone successive abridgments for the convenience of mortals while the gods of the lower heaven and the band of celestial musicians are engaged in studying the primary codea number of glosses or comments on menu were composed by the munis or old philosophers whose treatises together with that before us constitute the dherma sastra in a collective sense or body of law culluca bhatta was one of the more modern of these  every sacred book successively has been accepted in the faith that it was to be the final restingplace of the sojourning soul but after all it was but a caravansary which supplied refreshment to the traveller and directed him farther on his way to isphahan or bagdat  thank god no hindoo tyranny prevailed at the framing of the world but we are freemen of the universe and not sentenced to any caste  i know of no book which has come down to us with grander pretensions than this and it is so impersonal and sincere that it is never offensive nor ridiculous  compare the modes in which modern literature is advertised with the prospectus of this book and think what a reading public it addresses what criticism it expects  it seems to have been uttered from some eastern summit with a sober morning prescience in the dawn of time and you cannot read a sentence without being elevated as upon the tableland of the ghauts  it has such a rhythm as the winds of the desert such a tide as the ganges and is as superior to criticism as the himmaleh mountains  its tone is of such unrelaxed fibre that even at this late day unworn by time it wears the english and the sanscrit dress indifferently and its fixed sentences keep up their distant fires still like the stars by whose dissipated rays this lower world is illumined the whole book by noble gestures and inclinations renders many words unnecessary  english sense has toiled but hindoo wisdom never perspired  though the sentences open as we read them unexpensively and at first almost unmeaningly as the petals of a flower they sometimes startle us with that rare kind of wisdom which could only have been learned from the most trivial experience but it comes to us as refined as the porcelain earth which subsides to the bottom of the ocean  they are clean and dry as fossil truths which have been exposed to the elements for thousands of years so impersonally and scientifically true that they are the ornament of the parlor and the cabinet  any moral philosophy is exceedingly rare  this of menu addresses our privacy more than most  it is a more private and familiar and at the same time a more public and universal word than is spoken in parlor or pulpit nowadays  as our domestic fowls are said to have their original in the wild pheasant of india so our domestic thoughts have their prototypes in the thoughts of her philosophers  we are dabbling in the very elements of our present conventional and actual life as if it were the primeval conventicle where how to eat and to drink and to sleep and maintain life with adequate dignity and sincerity were the questions to be decided  it is later and more intimate with us even than the advice of our nearest friends  and yet it is true for the widest horizon and read out of doors has relation to the dim mountain line and is native and aboriginal there  most books belong to the house and street only and in the fields their leaves feel very thin  they are bare and obvious and have no halo nor haze about them  nature lies far and fair behind them all  but this as it proceeds from so it addresses what is deepest and most abiding in man  it belongs to the noontide of the day the midsummer of the year and after the snows have melted and the waters evaporated in the spring still its truth speaks freshly to our experience  it helps the sun to shine and his rays fall on its page to illustrate it  it spends the mornings and the evenings and makes such an impression on us overnight as to awaken us before dawn and its influence lingers around us like a fragrance late into the day  it conveys a new gloss to the meadows and the depths of the wood and its spirit like a more subtile ether sweeps along with the prevailing winds of a country  the very locusts and crickets of a summer day are but later or earlier glosses on the dherma sastra of the hindoos a continuation of the sacred code  as we have said there is an orientalism in the most restless pioneer and the farthest west is but the farthest east  while we are reading these sentences this fair modern world seems only a reprint of the laws of menu with the gloss of culluca  tried by a new england eye or the mere practical wisdom of modern times they are the oracles of a race already in its dotage but held up to the sky which is the only impartial and incorruptible ordeal they are of a piece with its depth and serenity and i am assured that they will have a place and significance as long as there is a sky to test them by  give me a sentence which no intelligence can understand  there must be a kind of life and palpitation to it and under its words a kind of blood must circulate forever  it is wonderful that this sound should have come down to us from so far when the voice of man can be heard so little way and we are not now within earshot of any contemporary  the woodcutters have here felled an ancient pine forest and brought to light to these distant hills a fair lake in the southwest and now in an instant it is distinctly shown to these woods as if its image had travelled hither from eternity  perhaps these old stumps upon the knoll remember when anciently this lake gleamed in the horizon  one wonders if the bare earth itself did not experience emotion at beholding again so fair a prospect  that fair water lies there in the sun thus revealed so much the prouder and fairer because its beauty needed not to be seen  it seems yet lonely sufficient to itself and superior to observationso are these old sentences like serene lakes in the southwest at length revealed to us which have so long been reflecting our own sky in their bosom  the great plain of india lies as in a cup between the himmaleh and the ocean on the north and south and the brahmapootra and indus on the east and west wherein the primeval race was received we will not dispute the story  we are pleased to read in the natural history of the country of the pine larch spruce and silver fir which cover the southern face of the himmaleh range of the gooseberry raspberry strawberry which from an imminent temperate zone overlook the torrid plains  so did this active modern life have even then a foothold and lurkingplace in the midst of the stateliness and contemplativeness of those eastern plains  in another era the lily of the valley cowslip dandelion were to work their way down into the plain and bloom in a level zone of their own reaching round the earth  already has the era of the temperate zone arrived the era of the pine and the oak for the palm and the banian do not supply the wants of this age  the lichens on the summits of the rocks will perchance find their level erelong  as for the tenets of the brahmans we are not so much concerned to know what doctrines they held as that they were held by any we can tolerate all philosophies atomists pneumatologists atheists theistsplato aristotle leucippus democritus pythagoras zoroaster and confucius  it is the attitude of these men more than any communication which they make that attracts us  between them and their commentators it is true there is an endless dispute  but if it comes to this that you compare notes then you are all wrong  as it is each takes us up into the serene heavens whither the smallest bubble rises as surely as the largest and paints earth and sky for us  any sincere thought is irresistible  the very austerity of the brahmans is tempting to the devotional soul as a more refined and nobler luxury  wants so easily and gracefully satisfied seem like a more refined pleasure  their conception of creation is peaceful as a dream  when that power awakes then has this world its full expansion but when he slumbers with a tranquil spirit then the whole system fades away  in the very indistinctness of their theogony a sublime truth is implied  it hardly allows the reader to rest in any supreme first cause but directly it hints at a supremer still which created the last and the creator is still behind increate  nor will we disturb the antiquity of this scripture from fire from air and from the sun it was milked out one might as well investigate the chronology of light and heat  let the sun shine  menu understood this matter best when he said those best know the divisions of days and nights who understand that the day of brahma which endures to the end of a thousand such ages infinite ages nevertheless according to mortal reckoning gives rise to virtuous exertions and that his night endures as long as his day indeed the mussulman and tartar dynasties are beyond all dating  methinks i have lived under them myself  in every mans brain is the sanscrit  the vedas and their angas are not so ancient as serene contemplation  why will we be imposed on by antiquity  is the babe young  when i behold it it seems more venerable than the oldest man it is more ancient than nestor or the sibyls and bears the wrinkles of father saturn himself  and do we live but in the present  how broad a line is that  i sit now on a stump whose rings number centuries of growth  if i look around i see that the soil is composed of the remains of just such stumps ancestors to this the earth is covered with mould  i thrust this stick many aeons deep into its surface and with my heel make a deeper furrow than the elements have ploughed here for a thousand years  if i listen i hear the peep of frogs which is older than the slime of egypt and the distant drumming of a partridge on a log as if it were the pulsebeat of the summer air  i raise my fairest and freshest flowers in the old mould  why what we would fain call new is not skin deep the earth is not yet stained by it  it is not the fertile ground which we walk on but the leaves which flutter over our heads  the newest is but the oldest made visible to our senses  when we dig up the soil from a thousand feet below the surface we call it new and the plants which spring from it and when our vision pierces deeper into space and detects a remoter star we call that new also  the place where we sit is called hudsononce it was nottinghamonce    we should read history as little critically as we consider the landscape and be more interested by the atmospheric tints and various lights and shades which the intervening spaces create than by its groundwork and composition  it is the morning now turned evening and seen in the westthe same sun but a new light and atmosphere  its beauty is like the sunset not a fresco painting on a wall flat and bounded but atmospheric and roving or free  in reality history fluctuates as the face of the landscape from morning to evening  what is of moment is its hue and color  time hides no treasures we want not its then but its now  we do not complain that the mountains in the horizon are blue and indistinct they are the more like the heavens  of what moment are facts that can be lostwhich need to be commemorated  the monument of death will outlast the memory of the dead  the pyramids do not tell the tale which was confided to them the living fact commemorates itself  why look in the dark for light  strictly speaking the historical societies have not recovered one fact from oblivion but are themselves instead of the fact that is lost  the researcher is more memorable than the researched  the crowd stood admiring the mist and the dim outlines of the trees seen through it when one of their number advanced to explore the phenomenon and with fresh admiration all eyes were turned on his dimly retreating figure  it is astonishing with how little cooperation of the societies the past is remembered its story has indeed had another muse than has been assigned it there is a good instance of the manner in which all history began in alwakidis arabian chronicle i was informed by ahmed almatin aljorhami who had it from rephaa ebn kais alamiri who had it from saiph ebn fabalah alchatquarmi who had it from thabet ebn alkamah who said he was present at the action these fathers of history were not anxious to preserve but to learn the fact and hence it was not forgotten  critical acumen is exerted in vain to uncover the past the past cannot be presented we cannot know what we are not  but one veil hangs over past present and future and it is the province of the historian to find out not what was but what is  where a battle has been fought you will find nothing but the bones of men and beasts where a battle is being fought there are hearts beating we will sit on a mound and muse and not try to make these skeletons stand on their legs again  does nature remember think you that they were men or not rather that they are bones  ancient history has an air of antiquity  it should be more modern  it is written as if the spectator should be thinking of the backside of the picture on the wall or as if the author expected that the dead would be his readers and wished to detail to them their own experience  men seem anxious to accomplish an orderly retreat through the centuries earnestly rebuilding the works behind as they are battered down by the encroachments of time but while they loiter they and their works both fall a prey to the arch enemy  history has neither the venerableness of antiquity nor the freshness of the modern  it does as if it would go to the beginning of things which natural history might with reason assume to do but consider the universal history and then tell uswhen did burdock and plantain sprout first  it has been so written for the most part that the times it describes are with remarkable propriety called dark ages  they are dark as one has observed because we are so in the dark about them  the sun rarely shines in history what with the dust and confusion and when we meet with any cheering fact which implies the presence of this luminary we excerpt and modernize it  as when we read in the history of the saxons that edwin of northumbria caused stakes to be fixed in the highways where he had seen a clear spring and brazen dishes were chained to them to refresh the weary sojourner whose fatigues edwin had himself experienced  this is worth all arthurs twelve battles     through the shadow of the world we sweep into the younger day     better fifty years of europe than a cycle of cathay     than fifty years of europe better one new england ray  biography too is liable to the same objection it should be autobiography  let us not as the germans advise endeavor to go abroad and vex our bowels that we may be somebody else to explain him  if i am not i who will be  but it is fit that the past should be dark though the darkness is not so much a quality of the past as of tradition  it is not a distance of time but a distance of relation which makes thus dusky its memorials  what is near to the heart of this generation is fair and bright still  greece lies outspread fair and sunshiny in floods of light for there is the sun and daylight in her literature and art  homer does not allow us to forget that the sun shonenor phidias nor the parthenon  yet no era has been wholly dark nor will we too hastily submit to the historian and congratulate ourselves on a blaze of light if we could pierce the obscurity of those remote years we should find it light enough only there is not our day  some creatures are made to see in the dark  there has always been the same amount of light in the world  the new and missing stars the comets and eclipses do not affect the general illumination for only our glasses appreciate them  the eyes of the oldest fossil remains they tell us indicate that the same laws of light prevailed then as now  always the laws of light are the same but the modes and degrees of seeing vary  the gods are partial to no era but steadily shines their light in the heavens while the eye of the beholder is turned to stone  there was but the sun and the eye from the first  the ages have not added a new ray to the one nor altered a fibre of the other  if we will admit time into our thoughts at all the mythologies those vestiges of ancient poems wrecks of poems so to speak the worlds inheritance still reflecting some of their original splendor like the fragments of clouds tinted by the rays of the departed sun reaching into the latest summer day and allying this hour to the morning of creation as the poet sings       fragments of the lofty strain        float down the tide of years      as buoyant on the stormy main        a parted wreck appears  these are the materials and hints for a history of the rise and progress of the race how from the condition of ants it arrived at the condition of men and arts were gradually invented  let a thousand surmises shed some light on this story  we will not be confined by historical even geological periods which would allow us to doubt of a progress in human affairs  if we rise above this wisdom for the day we shall expect that this morning of the race in which it has been supplied with the simplest necessaries with corn and wine and honey and oil and fire and articulate speech and agricultural and other arts reared up by degrees from the condition of ants to men will be succeeded by a day of equally progressive splendor that in the lapse of the divine periods other divine agents and godlike men will assist to elevate the race as much above its present condition  but we do not know much about it   thus did one voyageur waking dream while his companion slumbered on the bank  suddenly a boatmans horn was heard echoing from shore to shore to give notice of his approach to the farmers wife with whom he was to take his dinner though in that place only muskrats and kingfishers seemed to hear  the current of our reflections and our slumbers being thus disturbed we weighed anchor once more  as we proceeded on our way in the afternoon the western bank became lower or receded farther from the channel in some places leaving a few trees only to fringe the waters edge while the eastern rose abruptly here and there into wooded hills fifty or sixty feet high  the bass tilia americana also called the lime or linden which was a new tree to us overhung the water with its broad and rounded leaf interspersed with clusters of small hard berries now nearly ripe and made an agreeable shade for us sailors  the inner bark of this genus is the bast the material of the fishermans matting and the ropes and peasants shoes of which the russians make so much use and also of nets and a coarse cloth in some places  according to poets this was once philyra one of the oceanides  the ancients are said to have used its bark for the roofs of cottages for baskets and for a kind of paper called philyra  they also made bucklers of its wood on account of its flexibility lightness and resiliency  it was once much used for carving and is still in demand for soundingboards of pianofortes and panels of carriages and for various uses for which toughness and flexibility are required  baskets and cradles are made of the twigs  its sap affords sugar and the honey made from its flowers is said to be preferred to any other  its leaves are in some countries given to cattle a kind of chocolate has been made of its fruit a medicine has been prepared from an infusion of its flowers and finally the charcoal made of its wood is greatly valued for gunpowder  the sight of this tree reminded us that we had reached a strange land to us  as we sailed under this canopy of leaves we saw the sky through its chinks and as it were the meaning and idea of the tree stamped in a thousand hieroglyphics on the heavens  the universe is so aptly fitted to our organization that the eye wanders and reposes at the same time  on every side there is something to soothe and refresh this sense  look up at the treetops and see how finely nature finishes off her work there see how the pines spire without end higher and higher and make a graceful fringe to the earth  and who shall count the finer cobwebs that soar and float away from their utmost tops and the myriad insects that dodge between them  leaves are of more various forms than the alphabets of all languages put together of the oaks alone there are hardly two alike and each expresses its own character  in all her products nature only develops her simplest germs  one would say that it was no great stretch of invention to create birds  the hawk which now takes his flight over the top of the wood was at first perchance only a leaf which fluttered in its aisles  from rustling leaves she came in the course of ages to the loftier flight and clear carol of the bird  salmon brook comes in from the west under the railroad a mile and a half below the village of nashua  we rowed up far enough into the meadows which border it to learn its piscatorial history from a haymaker on its banks  he told us that the silver eel was formerly abundant here and pointed to some sunken creels at its mouth  this mans memory and imagination were fertile in fishermens tales of floating isles in bottomless ponds and of lakes mysteriously stocked with fishes and would have kept us till nightfall to listen but we could not afford to loiter in this roadstead and so stood out to our sea again  though we never trod in those meadows but only touched their margin with our hands we still retain a pleasant memory of them  salmon brook whose name is said to be a translation from the indian was a favorite haunt of the aborigines  here too the first white settlers of nashua planted and some dents in the earth where their houses stood and the wrecks of ancient appletrees are still visible  about one mile up this stream stood the house of old john lovewell who was an ensign in the army of oliver cromwell and the father of famous captain lovewell  he settled here before 1690 and died about 1754 at the age of one hundred and twenty years  he is thought to have been engaged in the famous narragansett swamp fight which took place in 1675 before he came here  the indians are said to have spared him in succeeding wars on account of his kindness to them even in 1700 he was so old and grayheaded that his scalp was worth nothing since the french governor offered no bounty for such  i have stood in the dent of his cellar on the bank of the brook and talked there with one whose grandfather had whose father might have talked with lovewell  here also he had a mill in his old age and kept a small store  he was remembered by some who were recently living as a hale old man who drove the boys out of his orchard with his cane  consider the triumphs of the mortal man and what poor trophies it would have to show to withe cobbled shoes without glasses at a hundred and cut a handsome swath at a hundred and five  lovewells house is said to have been the first which mrs  dustan reached on her escape from the indians  here probably the hero of pequawket was born and bred  close by may be seen the cellar and the gravestone of joseph hassell who as is elsewhere recorded with his wife anna and son benjamin and mary marks were slain by our indian enemies on september 2d 1691 in the evening as gookin observed on a previous occasion the indian rod upon the english backs had not yet done gods errand salmon brook near its mouth is still a solitary stream meandering through woods and meadows while the then uninhabited mouth of the nashua now resounds with the din of a manufacturing town  a stream from otternic pond in hudson comes in just above salmon brook on the opposite side  there was a good view of uncannunuc the most conspicuous mountain in these parts from the bank here seen rising over the west end of the bridge above  we soon after passed the village of nashua on the river of the same name where there is a covered bridge over the merrimack  the nashua which is one of the largest tributaries flows from wachusett mountain through lancaster groton and other towns where it has formed wellknown elmshaded meadows but near its mouth it is obstructed by falls and factories and did not tempt us to explore it  far away from here in lancaster with another companion i have crossed the broad valley of the nashua over which we had so long looked westward from the concord hills without seeing it to the blue mountains in the horizon  so many streams so many meadows and woods and quiet dwellings of men had lain concealed between us and those delectable mountainsfrom yonder hill on the road to tyngsborough you may get a good view of them  there where it seemed uninterrupted forest to our youthful eyes between two neighboring pines in the horizon lay the valley of the nashua and this very stream was even then winding at its bottom and then as now it was here silently mingling its waters with the merrimack  the clouds which floated over its meadows and were born there seen far in the west gilded by the rays of the setting sun had adorned a thousand evening skies for us  but as it were by a turf wall this valley was concealed and in our journey to those hills it was first gradually revealed to us summer and winter our eyes had rested on the dim outline of the mountains to which distance and indistinctness lent a grandeur not their own so that they served to interpret all the allusions of poets and travellers  standing on the concord cliffs we thus spoke our mind to them       with frontier strength ye stand your ground      with grand content ye circle round      tumultuous silence for all sound      ye distant nursery of rills      monadnock and the peterborough hills      firm argument that never stirs      outcircling the philosophers      like some vast fleet      sailing through rain and sleet      through winters cold and summers heat      still holding on upon your high emprise      until ye find a shore amid the skies      not skulking close to land      with cargo contraband      for they who sent a venture out by ye      have set the sun to see      their honesty      ships of the line each one      ye westward run      convoying clouds      which cluster in your shrouds      always before the gale      under a press of sail      with weight of metal all untold      i seem to feel ye in my firm seat here      immeasurable depth of hold      and breadth of beam and length of running gear       methinks ye take luxurious pleasure      in your novel western leisure      so cool your brows and freshly blue      as time had naught for ye to do      for  ye lie at your length      an unappropriated strength      unhewn primeval timber      for knees so stiff for masts so limber      the stock of which new earths are made      one day to be our western trade      fit for the stanchions of a world      which through the seas of space is hurled       while we enjoy a lingering ray      ye still oertop the western day      reposing yonder on gods croft      like solid stacks of hay      so bold a line as neer was writ      on any page by human wit      the forest glows as if      an enemys campfires shone      along the horizon      or the days funeral pyre      were lighted there      edged with silver and with gold      the clouds hang oer in damask fold      and with such depth of amber light      the west is dight      where still a few rays slant      that even heaven seems extravagant      watatic hill      lies on the horizons sill      like a childs toy left overnight      and other duds to left and right      on the earths edge mountains and trees      stand as they were on air graven      or as the vessels in a haven      await the morning breeze      i fancy even      through your defiles windeth the way to heaven      and yonder still in spite of historys page      linger the golden and the silver age      upon the laboring gale      the news of future centuries is brought      and of new dynasties of thought      from your remotest vale       but special i remember thee      wachusett who like me      standest alone without society      thy far blue eye      a remnant of the sky      seen through the clearing or the gorge      or from the windows of the forge      doth leaven all it passes by      nothing is true      but stands tween me and you      thou western pioneer      who knowst not shame nor fear      by venturous spirit driven      under the eaves of heaven      and canst expand thee there      and breathe enough of air      even beyond the west      thou migratest      into unclouded tracts      without a pilgrims axe      cleaving thy road on high      with thy welltempered brow      and makst thyself a clearing in the sky      upholding heaven holding down earth      thy pastime from thy birth      not steadied by the one nor leaning on the other      may i approve myself thy worthy brother  at length like rasselas and other inhabitants of happy valleys we had resolved to scale the blue wall which bounded the western horizon though not without misgivings that thereafter no visible fairyland would exist for us  but it would be long to tell of our adventures and we have no time this afternoon transporting ourselves in imagination up this hazy nashua valley to go over again that pilgrimage  we have since made many similar excursions to the principal mountains of new england and new york and even far in the wilderness and have passed a night on the summit of many of them  and now when we look again westward from our native hills wachusett and monadnock have retreated once more among the blue and fabulous mountains in the horizon though our eyes rest on the very rocks on both of them where we have pitched our tent for a night and boiled our hastypudding amid the clouds   as late as 1724 there was no house on the north side of the nashua but only scattered wigwams and grisly forests between this frontier and canada  in september of that year two men who were engaged in making turpentine on that side for such were the first enterprises in the wilderness were taken captive and carried to canada by a party of thirty indians  ten of the inhabitants of dunstable going to look for them found the hoops of their barrel cut and the turpentine spread on the ground  i have been told by an inhabitant of tyngsborough who had the story from his ancestors that one of these captives when the indians were about to upset his barrel of turpentine seized a pine knot and flourishing it swore so resolutely that he would kill the first who touched it that they refrained and when at length he returned from canada he found it still standing perhaps there was more than one barrel  however this may have been the scouts knew by marks on the trees made with coal mixed with grease that the men were not killed but taken prisoners one of the company named farwell perceiving that the turpentine had not done spreading concluded that the indians had been gone but a short time and they accordingly went in instant pursuit contrary to the advice of farwell following directly on their trail up the merrimack they fell into an ambuscade near thorntons ferry in the present town of merrimack and nine were killed only one farwell escaping after a vigorous pursuit the men of dunstable went out and picked up their bodies and carried them all down to dunstable and buried them  it is almost word for word as in the robin hood ballad       they carried these foresters into fair nottingham        as many there did know      they digged them graves in their churchyard        and they buried them all arow  nottingham is only the other side of the river and they were not exactly all arow  you may read in the churchyard at dunstable under the memento mori and the name of one of them how they departed this life and        this man with seven more that lies in       this grave was slew all in a day by                     the indians  the stones of some others of the company stand around the common grave with their separate inscriptions  eight were buried here but nine were killed according to the best authorities       gentle river gentle river        lo thy streams are stained with gore      many a brave and noble captain        floats along thy willowed shore       all beside thy limpid waters        all beside thy sands so bright      indian chiefs and christian warriors        joined in fierce and mortal fight  it is related in the history of dunstable that on the return of farwell the indians were engaged by a fresh party which they compelled to retreat and pursued as far as the nashua where they fought across the stream at its mouth  after the departure of the indians the figure of an indians head was found carved by them on a large tree by the shore which circumstance has given its name to this part of the village of nashvillethe indian head  it was observed by some judicious says gookin referring to philips war that at the beginning of the war the english soldiers made a nothing of the indians and many spake words to this effect that one englishman was sufficient to chase ten indians many reckoned it was no other but veni vidi vici but we may conclude that the judicious would by this time have made a different observation  farwell appears to have been the only one who had studied his profession and understood the business of hunting indians  he lived to fight another day for the next year he was lovewells lieutenant at pequawket but that time as we have related he left his bones in the wilderness  his name still reminds us of twilight days and forest scouts on indian trails with an uneasy scalpan indispensable hero to new england  as the more recent poet of lovewells fight has sung halting a little but bravely still       then did the crimson streams that flowed        seem like the waters of the brook      that brightly shine that loudly dash        far down the cliffs of agiochook  these battles sound incredible to us  i think that posterity will doubt if such things ever were if our bold ancestors who settled this land were not struggling rather with the forest shadows and not with a coppercolored race of men  they were vapors fever and ague of the unsettled woods  now only a few arrowheads are turned up by the plough  in the pelasgic the etruscan or the british story there is nothing so shadowy and unreal  it is a wild and antiquated looking graveyard overgrown with bushes on the highroad about a quarter of a mile from and overlooking the merrimack with a deserted millstream bounding it on one side where lie the earthly remains of the ancient inhabitants of dunstable  we passed it three or four miles below here  you may read there the names of lovewell farwell and many others whose families were distinguished in indian warfare we noticed there two large masses of granite more than a foot thick and rudely squared lying flat on the ground over the remains of the first pastor and his wife   it is remarkable that the dead lie everywhere under stones       strata jacent passim suo quseque sub lapide  corpora we might say if the measure allowed  when the stone is a slight one it does not oppress the spirits of the traveller to meditate by it but these did seem a little heathenish to us and so are all large monuments over mens bodies from the pyramids down  a monument should at least be starypointing to indicate whither the spirit is gone and not prostrate like the body it has deserted  there have been some nations who could do nothing but construct tombs and these are the only traces which they have left  they are the heathen  but why these stones so upright and emphatic like exclamationpoints  what was there so remarkable that lived  why should the monument be so much more enduring than the fame which it is designed to perpetuatea stone to a bone  here lieshere lieswhy do they not sometimes write there rises  is it a monument to the body only that is intended  having reached the term of his natural lifewould it not be truer to say having reached the term of his unnatural life  the rarest quality in an epitaph is truth  if any character is given it should be as severely true as the decision of the three judges below and not the partial testimony of friends  friends and contemporaries should supply only the name and date and leave it to posterity to write the epitaph                 here lies an honest man                rearadmiral van                                         faith then ye have                two in one grave                for in his favor                here too lies the engraver  fame itself is but an epitaph as late as false as true  but they only are the true epitaphs which old mortality retouches  a man might well pray that he may not taboo or curse any portion of nature by being buried in it  for the most part the best mans spirit makes a fearful sprite to haunt his grave and it is therefore much to the credit of little john the famous follower of robin hood and reflecting favorably on his character that his grave was long celebrous for the yielding of excellent whetstones  i confess that i have but little love for such collections as they have at the catacombs pere la chaise mount auburn and even this dunstable graveyard  at any rate nothing but great antiquity can make graveyards interesting to me  i have no friends there  it may be that i am not competent to write the poetry of the grave  the farmer who has skimmed his farm might perchance leave his body to nature to be ploughed in and in some measure restore its fertility  we should not retard but forward her economies  soon the village of nashua was out of sight and the woods were gained again and we rowed slowly on before sunset looking for a solitary place in which to spend the night  a few evening clouds began to be reflected in the water and the surface was dimpled only here and there by a muskrat crossing the stream  we camped at length near penichook brook on the confines of what is now nashville by a deep ravine under the skirts of a pine wood where the dead pineleaves were our carpet and their tawny boughs stretched overhead  but fire and smoke soon tamed the scene the rocks consented to be our walls and the pines our roof  a woodside was already the fittest locality for us  the wilderness is near as well as dear to every man  even the oldest villages are indebted to the border of wild wood which surrounds them more than to the gardens of men  there is something indescribably inspiriting and beautiful in the aspect of the forest skirting and occasionally jutting into the midst of new towns which like the sandheaps of fresh foxburrows have sprung up in their midst  the very uprightness of the pines and maples asserts the ancient rectitude and vigor of nature  our lives need the relief of such a background where the pine flourishes and the jay still screams  we had found a safe harbor for our boat and as the sun was setting carried up our furniture and soon arranged our house upon the bank and while the kettle steamed at the tent door we chatted of distant friends and of the sights which we were to behold and wondered which way the towns lay from us  our cocoa was soon boiled and supper set upon our chest and we lengthened out this meal like old voyageurs with our talk  meanwhile we spread the map on the ground and read in the gazetteer when the first settlers came here and got a township granted  then when supper was done and we had written the journal of our voyage we wrapped our buffaloes about us and lay down with our heads pillowed on our arms listening awhile to the distant baying of a dog or the murmurs of the river or to the wind which had not gone to rest       the western wind came lumbering in      bearing a faint pacific din      our evening mail swift at the call      of its postmaster general      laden with news from californ      whateer transpired hath since morn      how wags the world by brier and brake      from hence to athabasca lake  or half awake and half asleep dreaming of a star which glimmered through our cotton roof  perhaps at midnight one was awakened by a cricket shrilly singing on his shoulder or by a hunting spider in his eye and was lulled asleep again by some streamlet purling its way along at the bottom of a wooded and rocky ravine in our neighborhood  it was pleasant to lie with our heads so low in the grass and hear what a tinkling everbusy laboratory it was a thousand little artisans beat on their anvils all night long  far in the night as we were falling asleep on the bank of the merrimack we heard some tyro beating a drum incessantly in preparation for a country muster as we learned and we thought of the line       when the drum beat at dead of night  we could have assured him that his beat would be answered and the forces be mustered  fear not thou drummer of the night we too will be there  and still he drummed on in the silence and the dark  this stray sound from a faroff sphere came to our ears from time to time far sweet and significant and we listened with such an unprejudiced sense as if for the first time we heard at all  no doubt he was an insignificant drummer enough but his music afforded us a prime and leisure hour and we felt that we were in season wholly  these simple sounds related us to the stars  ay there was a logic in them so convincing that the combined sense of mankind could never make me doubt their conclusions  i stop my habitual thinking as if the plough had suddenly run deeper in its furrow through the crust of the world  how can i go on who have just stepped over such a bottomless skylight in the bog of my life  suddenly old time winked at meah you know me you rogueand news had come that it was well  that ancient universe is in such capital health i think undoubtedly it will never die  heal yourselves doctors by god i live                  then idle time ran gadding by                 and left me with eternity alone             i hear beyond the range of sound             i see beyond the verge of sight  i see smell taste hear feel that everlasting something to which we are allied at once our maker our abode our destiny our very selves the one historic truth the most remarkable fact which can become the distinct and uninvited subject of our thought the actual glory of the universe the only fact which a human being cannot avoid recognizing or in some way forget or dispense with             it doth expand my privacies        to all and leave me single in the crowd  i have seen how the foundations of the world are laid and i have not the least doubt that it will stand a good while           now chiefly is my natal hour          and only now my prime of life          i will not doubt the love untold          which not my worth nor want hath bought          which wooed me young and wooes me old          and to this evening hath me brought  what are ears what is time that this particular series of sounds called a strain of music an invisible and fairy troop which never brushed the dew from any mead can be wafted down through the centuries from homer to me and he have been conversant with that same aerial and mysterious charm which now so tingles my ears  what a fine communication from age to age of the fairest and noblest thoughts the aspirations of ancient men even such as were never communicated by speech is music it is the flower of language thought colored and curved fluent and flexible its crystal fountain tinged with the suns rays and its purling ripples reflecting the grass and the clouds  a strain of music reminds me of a passage of the vedas and i associate with it the idea of infinite remoteness as well as of beauty and serenity for to the senses that is farthest from us which addresses the greatest depth within us  it teaches us again and again to trust the remotest and finest as the divinest instinct and makes a dream our only real experience  we feel a sad cheer when we hear it perchance because we that hear are not one with that which is heard          therefore a torrent of sadness deep         through the strains of thy triumph is heard to sweep  the sadness is ours  the indian poet calidas says in the sacontala perhaps the sadness of men on seeing beautiful forms and hearing sweet music arises from some faint remembrance of past joys and the traces of connections in a former state of existence as polishing expresses the vein in marble and grain in wood so music brings out what of heroic lurks anywhere  the hero is the sole patron of music  that harmony which exists naturally between the heros moods and the universe the soldier would fain imitate with drum and trumpet  when we are in health all sounds fife and drum for us we hear the notes of music in the air or catch its echoes dying away when we awake in the dawn  marching is when the pulse of the hero beats in unison with the pulse of nature and he steps to the measure of the universe then there is true courage and invincible strength  plutarch says that plato thinks the gods never gave men music the science of melody and harmony for mere delectation or to tickle the ear but that the discordant parts of the circulations and beauteous fabric of the soul and that of it that roves about the body and many times for want of tune and air breaks forth into many extravagances and excesses might be sweetly recalled and artfully wound up to their former consent and agreement  music is the sound of the universal laws promulgated  it is the only assured tone  there are in it such strains as far surpass any mans faith in the loftiness of his destiny  things are to be learned which it will be worth the while to learn  formerly i heard these           rumors from an aeolian harp        there is a vale which none hath seen       where foot of man has never been       such as here lives with toil and strife       an anxious and a sinful life       there every virtue has its birth      ere it descends upon the earth      and thither every deed returns      which in the generous bosom burns       there love is warm and youth is young      and poetry is yet unsung      for virtue still adventures there      and freely breathes her native air       and ever if you hearken well      you still may hear its vesper bell      and tread of highsouled men go by      their thoughts conversing with the sky  according to jamblichus pythagoras did not procure for himself a thing of this kind through instruments or the voice but employing a certain ineffable divinity and which it is difficult to apprehend he extended his ears and fixed his intellect in the sublime symphonies of the world he alone hearing and understanding as it appears the universal harmony and consonance of the spheres and the stars that are moved through them and which produce a fuller and more intense melody than anything effected by mortal sounds  travelling on foot very early one morning due east from here about twenty miles from caleb harrimans tavern in hampstead toward haverhill when i reached the railroad in plaistow i heard at some distance a faint music in the air like an aeolian harp which i immediately suspected to proceed from the cord of the telegraph vibrating in the just awakening morning wind and applying my ear to one of the posts i was convinced that it was so  it was the telegraph harp singing its message through the country its message sent not by men but by gods  perchance like the statue of memnon it resounds only in the morning when the first rays of the sun fall on it  it was like the first lyre or shell heard on the seashorethat vibrating cord high in the air over the shores of earth  so have all things their higher and their lower uses  i heard a fairer news than the journals ever print  it told of things worthy to hear and worthy of the electric fluid to carry the news of not of the price of cotton and flour but it hinted at the price of the world itself and of things which are priceless of absolute truth and beauty  still the drum rolled on and stirred our blood to fresh extravagance that night  the clarion sound and clang of corselet and buckler were heard from many a hamlet of the soul and many a knight was arming for the fight behind the encamped stars                                  before each van          prick forth the aery knights and couch their spears          till thickest legions close with feats of arms          from either end of heaven the welkin burns                                     away away away away              ye have not kept your secret well            i will abide that other day              those other lands ye tell             has time no leisure left for these              the acts that ye rehearse            is not eternity a lease              for better deeds than verse             t is sweet to hear of heroes dead              to know them still alive            but sweeter if we earn their bread               and in us they survive             our life should feed the springs of fame               with a perennial wave            as ocean feeds the babbling founts               which find in it their grave            ye skies drop gently round my breast             and be my corselet blue           ye earth receive my lance in rest             my faithful charger you            ye stars my spearheads in the sky             my arrowtips ye are           i see the routed foemen fly             my bright spears fixed are            give me an angel for a foe             fix now the place and time           and straight to meet him i will go             above the starry chime            and with our clashing bucklers clang             the heavenly spheres shall ring           while bright the northern lights shall hang             beside our tourneying            and if she lose her champion true             tell heaven not despair           for i will be her champion new             her fame i will repair  there was a high wind this night which we afterwards learned had been still more violent elsewhere and had done much injury to the cornfields far and near but we only heard it sigh from time to time as if it had no license to shake the foundations of our tent the pines murmured the water rippled and the tent rocked a little but we only laid our ears closer to the ground while the blast swept on to alarm other men and long before sunrise we were ready to pursue our voyage as usual     page                          tuesday               on either side the river lie              long fields of barley and of rye              that clothe the wold and meet the sky              and through the fields the road runs by                           to manytowered camelot                                             tennyson   page                           tuesday                             long before daylight we ranged abroad hatchet in hand in search of fuel and made the yet slumbering and dreaming wood resound with our blows  then with our fire we burned up a portion of the loitering night while the kettle sang its homely strain to the morning star  we tramped about the shore waked all the muskrats and scared up the bittern and birds that were asleep upon their roosts we hauled up and upset our boat and washed it and rinsed out the clay talking aloud as if it were broad day until at length by three oclock we had completed our preparations and were ready to pursue our voyage as usual so shaking the clay from our feet we pushed into the fog  though we were enveloped in mist as usual we trusted that there was a bright day behind it       ply the oars away away      in each dewdrop of the morning      lies the promise of a day       rivers from the sunrise flow      springing with the dewy morn      voyageurs gainst time do row      idle noon nor sunset know      ever even with the dawn  belknap the historian of this state says that in the neighborhood of fresh rivers and ponds a whitish fog in the morning lying over the water is a sure indication of fair weather for that day and when no fog is seen rain is expected before night that which seemed to us to invest the world was only a narrow and shallow wreath of vapor stretched over the channel of the merrimack from the seaboard to the mountains  more extensive fogs however have their own limits  i once saw the day break from the top of saddleback mountain in massachusetts above the clouds  as we cannot distinguish objects through this dense fog let me tell this story more at length   i had come over the hills on foot and alone in serene summer days plucking the raspberries by the wayside and occasionally buying a loaf of bread at a farmers house with a knapsack on my back which held a few travellers books and a change of clothing and a staff in my hand  i had that morning looked down from the hoosack mountain where the road crosses it on the village of north adams in the valley three miles away under my feet showing how uneven the earth may sometimes be and making it seem an accident that it should ever be level and convenient for the feet of man  putting a little rice and sugar and a tin cup into my knapsack at this village i began in the afternoon to ascend the mountain whose summit is three thousand six hundred feet above the level of the sea and was seven or eight miles distant by the path  my route lay up a long and spacious valley called the bellows because the winds rush up or down it with violence in storms sloping up to the very clouds between the principal range and a lower mountain  there were a few farms scattered along at different elevations each commanding a fine prospect of the mountains to the north and a stream ran down the middle of the valley on which near the head there was a mill  it seemed a road for the pilgrim to enter upon who would climb to the gates of heaven  now i crossed a hayfield and now over the brook on a slight bridge still gradually ascending all the while with a sort of awe and filled with indefinite expectations as to what kind of inhabitants and what kind of nature i should come to at last  it now seemed some advantage that the earth was uneven for one could not imagine a more noble position for a farmhouse than this vale afforded farther from or nearer to its head from a glenlike seclusion overlooking the country at a great elevation between these two mountain walls  it reminded me of the homesteads of the huguenots on staten island off the coast of new jersey  the hills in the interior of this island though comparatively low are penetrated in various directions by similar sloping valleys on a humble scale gradually narrowing and rising to the centre and at the head of these the huguenots who were the first settlers placed their houses quite within the land in rural and sheltered places in leafy recesses where the breeze played with the poplar and the gumtree from which with equal security in calm and storm they looked out through a widening vista over miles of forest and stretching salt marsh to the huguenots tree an old elm on the shore at whose root they had landed and across the spacious outer bay of new york to sandy hook and the highlands of neversink and thence over leagues of the atlantic perchance to some faint vessel in the horizon almost a days sail on her voyage to that europe whence they had come  when walking in the interior there in the midst of rural scenery where there was as little to remind me of the ocean as amid the new hampshire hills i have suddenly through a gap a cleft or clove road as the dutch settlers called it caught sight of a ship under full sail over a field of corn twenty or thirty miles at sea  the effect was similar since i had no means of measuring distances to seeing a painted ship passed backwards and forwards through a magiclantern  but to return to the mountain  it seemed as if he must be the most singular and heavenly minded man whose dwelling stood highest up the valley  the thunder had rumbled at my heels all the way but the shower passed off in another direction though if it had not i half believed that i should get above it  i at length reached the last house but one where the path to the summit diverged to the right while the summit itself rose directly in front  but i determined to follow up the valley to its head and then find my own route up the steep as the shorter and more adventurous way  i had thoughts of returning to this house which was well kept and so nobly placed the next day and perhaps remaining a week there if i could have entertainment its mistress was a frank and hospitable young woman who stood before me in a dishabille busily and unconcernedly combing her long black hair while she talked giving her head the necessary toss with each sweep of the comb with lively sparkling eyes and full of interest in that lower world from which i had come talking all the while as familiarly as if she had known me for years and reminding me of a cousin of mine  she at first had taken me for a student from williamstown for they went by in parties she said either riding or walking almost every pleasant day and were a pretty wild set of fellows but they never went by the way i was going  as i passed the last house a man called out to know what i had to sell for seeing my knapsack he thought that i might be a pedler who was taking this unusual route over the ridge of the valley into south adams  he told me that it was still four or five miles to the summit by the path which i had left though not more than two in a straight line from where i was but that nobody ever went this way there was no path and i should find it as steep as the roof of a house  but i knew that i was more used to woods and mountains than he and went along through his cowyard while he looking at the sun shouted after me that i should not get to the top that night  i soon reached the head of the valley but as i could not see the summit from this point i ascended a low mountain on the opposite side and took its bearing with my compass  i at once entered the woods and began to climb the steep side of the mountain in a diagonal direction taking the bearing of a tree every dozen rods  the ascent was by no means difficult or unpleasant and occupied much less time than it would have taken to follow the path  even country people i have observed magnify the difficulty of travelling in the forest and especially among mountains  they seem to lack their usual common sense in this  i have climbed several higher mountains without guide or path and have found as might be expected that it takes only more time and patience commonly than to travel the smoothest highway  it is very rare that you meet with obstacles in this world which the humblest man has not faculties to surmount  it is true we may come to a perpendicular precipice but we need not jump off nor run our heads against it  a man may jump down his own cellar stairs or dash his brains out against his chimney if he is mad  so far as my experience goes travellers generally exaggerate the difficulties of the way like most evil the difficulty is imaginary for whats the hurry  if a person lost would conclude that after all he is not lost he is not beside himself but standing in his own old shoes on the very spot where he is and that for the time being he will live there but the places that have known him they are losthow much anxiety and danger would vanish  i am not alone if i stand by myself  who knows where in space this globe is rolling  yet we will not give ourselves up for lost let it go where it will  i made my way steadily upward in a straight line through a dense undergrowth of mountain laurel until the trees began to have a scraggy and infernal look as if contending with frost goblins and at length i reached the summit just as the sun was setting several acres here had been cleared and were covered with rocks and stumps and there was a rude observatory in the middle which overlooked the woods  i had one fair view of the country before the sun went down but i was too thirsty to waste any light in viewing the prospect and set out directly to find water  first going down a wellbeaten path for half a mile through the low scrubby wood till i came to where the water stood in the tracks of the horses which had carried travellers up i lay down flat and drank these dry one after another a pure cold springlike water but yet i could not fill my dipper though i contrived little siphons of grassstems and ingenious aqueducts on a small scale it was too slow a process  then remembering that i had passed a moist place near the top on my way up i returned to find it again and here with sharp stones and my hands in the twilight i made a well about two feet deep which was soon filled with pure cold water and the birds too came and drank at it  so i filled my dipper and making my way back to the observatory collected some dry sticks and made a fire on some flat stones which had been placed on the floor for that purpose and so i soon cooked my supper of rice having already whittled a wooden spoon to eat it with  i sat up during the evening reading by the light of the fire the scraps of newspapers in which some party had wrapped their luncheon the prices current in new york and boston the advertisements and the singular editorials which some had seen fit to publish not foreseeing under what critical circumstances they would be read  i read these things at a vast advantage there and it seemed to me that the advertisements or what is called the business part of a paper were greatly the best the most useful natural and respectable  almost all the opinions and sentiments expressed were so little considered so shallow and flimsy that i thought the very texture of the paper must be weaker in that part and tear the more easily  the advertisements and the prices current were more closely allied to nature and were respectable in some measure as tide and meteorological tables are but the readingmatter which i remembered was most prized down below unless it was some humble record of science or an extract from some old classic struck me as strangely whimsical and crude and oneidead like a schoolboys theme such as youths write and after burn  the opinions were of that kind that are doomed to wear a different aspect tomorrow like last years fashions as if mankind were very green indeed and would be ashamed of themselves in a few years when they had outgrown this verdant period  there was moreover a singular disposition to wit and humor but rarely the slightest real success and the apparent success was a terrible satire on the attempt the evil genius of man laughed the loudest at his best jokes  the advertisements as i have said such as were serious and not of the modern quack kind suggested pleasing and poetic thoughts for commerce is really as interesting as nature  the very names of the commodities were poetic and as suggestive as if they had been inserted in a pleasing poemlumber cotton sugar hides guano logwood  some sober private and original thought would have been grateful to read there and as much in harmony with the circumstances as if it had been written on a mountaintop for it is of a fashion which never changes and as respectable as hides and logwood or any natural product  what an inestimable companion such a scrap of paper would have been containing some fruit of a mature life  what a relic  what a recipe  it seemed a divine invention by which not mere shining coin but shining and current thoughts could be brought up and left there  as it was cold i collected quite a pile of wood and lay down on a board against the side of the building not having any blanket to cover me with my head to the fire that i might look after it which is not the indian rule  but as it grew colder towards midnight i at length encased myself completely in boards managing even to put a board on top of me with a large stone on it to keep it down and so slept comfortably  i was reminded it is true of the irish children who inquired what their neighbors did who had no door to put over them in winter nights as they had but i am convinced that there was nothing very strange in the inquiry  those who have never tried it can have no idea how far a door which keeps the single blanket down may go toward making one comfortable  we are constituted a good deal like chickens which taken from the hen and put in a basket of cotton in the chimneycorner will often peep till they die nevertheless but if you put in a book or anything heavy which will press down the cotton and feel like the hen they go to sleep directly  my only companions were the mice which came to pick up the crumbs that had been left in those scraps of paper still as everywhere pensioners on man and not unwisely improving this elevated tract for their habitation  they nibbled what was for them i nibbled what was for me  once or twice in the night when i looked up i saw a white cloud drifting through the windows and filling the whole upper story  this observatory was a building of considerable size erected by the students of williamstown college whose buildings might be seen by daylight gleaming far down in the valley  it would be no small advantage if every college were thus located at the base of a mountain as good at least as one wellendowed professorship it were as well to be educated in the shadow of a mountain as in more classical shades  some will remember no doubt not only that they went to the college but that they went to the mountain  every visit to its summit would as it were generalize the particular information gained below and subject it to more catholic tests  i was up early and perched upon the top of this tower to see the daybreak for some time reading the names that had been engraved there before i could distinguish more distant objects  an untamable fly buzzed at my elbow with the same nonchalance as on a molasses hogshead at the end of long wharf  even there i must attend to his stale humdrum  but now i come to the pith of this long digressionas the light increased i discovered around me an ocean of mist which by chance reached up exactly to the base of the tower and shut out every vestige of the earth while i was left floating on this fragment of the wreck of a world on my carved plank in cloudland a situation which required no aid from the imagination to render it impressive  as the light in the east steadily increased it revealed to me more clearly the new world into which i had risen in the night the new terra firma perchance of my future life  there was not a crevice left through which the trivial places we name massachusetts or vermont or new york could be seen while i still inhaled the clear atmosphere of a july morningif it were july there  all around beneath me was spread for a hundred miles on every side as far as the eye could reach an undulating country of clouds answering in the varied swell of its surface to the terrestrial world it veiled  it was such a country as we might see in dreams with all the delights of paradise  there were immense snowy pastures apparently smoothshaven and firm and shady vales between the vaporous mountains and far in the horizon i could see where some luxurious misty timber jutted into the prairie and trace the windings of a watercourse some unimagined amazon or orinoko by the misty trees on its brink as there was wanting the symbol so there was not the substance of impurity no spot nor stain  it was a favor for which to be forever silent to be shown this vision  the earth beneath had become such a flitting thing of lights and shadows as the clouds had been before  it was not merely veiled to me but it had passed away like the phantom of a shadow skias onar and this new platform was gained  as i had climbed above storm and cloud so by successive days journeys i might reach the region of eternal day beyond the tapering shadow of the earth ay               heaven itself shall slide         and roll away like melting stars that glide         along their oily threads  but when its own sun began to rise on this pure world i found myself a dweller in the dazzling halls of aurora into which poets have had but a partial glance over the eastern hills drifting amid the saffroncolored clouds and playing with the rosy fingers of the dawn in the very path of the suns chariot and sprinkled with its dewy dust enjoying the benignant smile and near at hand the fardarting glances of the god  the inhabitants of earth behold commonly but the dark and shadowy underside of heavens pavement it is only when seen at a favorable angle in the horizon morning or evening that some faint streaks of the rich lining of the clouds are revealed  but my muse would fail to convey an impression of the gorgeous tapestry by which i was surrounded such as men see faintly reflected afar off in the chambers of the east  here as on earth i saw the gracious god          flatter the mountaintops with sovereign eye                                                       gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy  but never here did heavens sun stain himself  but alas owing as i think to some unworthiness in myself my private sun did stain himself and               anon permit the basest clouds to ride               with ugly wrack on his celestial face  for before the god had reached the zenith the heavenly pavement rose and embraced my wavering virtue or rather i sank down again into that forlorn world from which the celestial sun had hid his visage        how may a worm that crawls along the dust        clamber the azure mountains thrown so high        and fetch from thence thy fair idea just        that in those sunny courts doth hidden lie        clothed with such light as blinds the angels eye           how may weak mortal ever hope to file           his unsmooth tongue and his deprostrate style        o raise thou from his corse thy now entombed exile  in the preceding evening i had seen the summits of new and yet higher mountains the catskills by which i might hope to climb to heaven again and had set my compass for a fair lake in the southwest which lay in my way for which i now steered descending the mountain by my own route on the side opposite to that by which i had ascended and soon found myself in the region of cloud and drizzling rain and the inhabitants affirmed that it had been a cloudy and drizzling day wholly  but now we must make haste back before the fog disperses to the blithe merrimack water        since that first away away            many a lengthy reach weve rowed       still the sparrow on the spray       hastes to usher in the day            with her simple stanzad ode  we passed a canalboat before sunrise groping its way to the seaboard and though we could not see it on account of the fog the few dull thumping stertorous sounds which we heard impressed us with a sense of weight and irresistible motion  one little rill of commerce already awake on this distant new hampshire river  the fog as it required more skill in the steering enhanced the interest of our early voyage and made the river seem indefinitely broad  a slight mist through which objects are faintly visible has the effect of expanding even ordinary streams by a singular mirage into arms of the sea or inland lakes  in the present instance it was even fragrant and invigorating and we enjoyed it as a sort of earlier sunshine or dewy and embryo light           lowanchored cloud          newfoundland air          fountainhead and source of rivers          dewcloth dream drapery          and napkin spread by fays          drifting meadow of the air          where bloom the daisied banks and violets          and in whose fenny labyrinth          the bittern booms and heron wades          spirit of lakes and seas and rivers          bear only perfumes and the scent          of healing herbs to just mens fields  the same pleasant and observant historian whom we quoted above says that in the mountainous parts of the country the ascent of vapors and their formation into clouds is a curious and entertaining object  the vapors are seen rising in small columns like smoke from many chimneys  when risen to a certain height they spread meet condense and are attracted to the mountains where they either distil in gentle dews and replenish the springs or descend in showers accompanied with thunder  after short intermissions the process is repeated many times in the course of a summer day affording to travellers a lively illustration of what is observed in the book of job they are wet with the showers of the mountains  fogs and clouds which conceal the overshadowing mountains lend the breadth of the plains to mountain vales  even a smallfeatured country acquires some grandeur in stormy weather when clouds are seen drifting between the beholder and the neighboring hills  when in travelling toward haverhill through hampstead in this state on the height of land between the merrimack and the piscataqua or the sea you commence the descent eastward the view toward the coast is so distant and unexpected though the sea is invisible that you at first suppose the unobstructed atmosphere to be a fog in the lowlands concealing hills of corresponding elevation to that you are upon but it is the mist of prejudice alone which the winds will not disperse the most stupendous scenery ceases to be sublime when it becomes distinct or in other words limited and the imagination is no longer encouraged to exaggerate it  the actual height and breadth of a mountain or a waterfall are always ridiculously small they are the imagined only that content us  nature is not made after such a fashion as we would have her  we piously exaggerate her wonders as the scenery around our home  such was the heaviness of the dews along this river that we were generally obliged to leave our tent spread over the bows of the boat till the sun had dried it to avoid mildew  we passed the mouth of penichook brook a wild salmonstream in the fog without seeing it  at length the suns rays struggled through the mist and showed us the pines on shore dripping with dew and springs trickling from the moist banks        and now the taller sons whom titan warms        of unshorn mountains blown with easy winds        dandle the mornings childhood in their arms        and if they chanced to slip the prouder pines        the under corylets did catch their shines        to gild their leaves  we rowed for some hours between glistening banks before the sun had dried the grass and leaves or the day had established its character  its serenity at last seemed the more profound and secure for the denseness of the mornings fog  the river became swifter and the scenery more pleasing than before  the banks were steep and clayey for the most part and trickling with water and where a spring oozed out a few feet above the river the boatmen had cut a trough out of a slab with their axes and placed it so as to receive the water and fill their jugs conveniently  sometimes this purer and cooler water bursting out from under a pine or a rock was collected into a basin close to the edge of and level with the river a fountainhead of the merrimack  so near along lifes stream are the fountains of innocence and youth making fertile its sandy margin and the voyageur will do well to replenish his vessels often at these uncontaminated sources  some youthful spring perchance still empties with tinkling music into the oldest river even when it is falling into the sea and we imagine that its music is distinguished by the rivergods from the general lapse of the stream and falls sweeter on their ears in proportion as it is nearer to the ocean  as the evaporations of the river feed thus these unsuspected springs which filter through its banks so perchance our aspirations fall back again in springs on the margin of lifes stream to refresh and purify it  the yellow and tepid river may float his scow and cheer his eye with its reflections and its ripples but the boatman quenches his thirst at this small rill alone  it is this purer and cooler element that chiefly sustains his life  the race will long survive that is thus discreet  our course this morning lay between the territories of merrimack on the west and litchfield once called brentons farm on the east which townships were anciently the indian naticook brenton was a furtrader among the indians and these lands were granted to him in 1656  the latter township contains about five hundred inhabitants of whom however we saw none and but few of their dwellings  being on the river whose banks are always high and generally conceal the few houses the country appeared much more wild and primitive than to the traveller on the neighboring roads  the river is by far the most attractive highway and those boatmen who have spent twenty or twentyfive years on it must have had a much fairer more wild and memorable experience than the dusty and jarring one of the teamster who has driven during the same time on the roads which run parallel with the stream  as one ascends the merrimack he rarely sees a village but for the most part alternate wood and pasture lands and sometimes a field of corn or potatoes of rye or oats or english grass with a few straggling appletrees and at still longer intervals a farmers house  the soil excepting the best of the interval is commonly as light and sandy as a patriot could desire  sometimes this forenoon the country appeared in its primitive state and as if the indian still inhabited it and again as if many free new settlers occupied it their slight fences straggling down to the waters edge and the barking of dogs and even the prattle of children were heard and smoke was seen to go up from some hearthstone and the banks were divided into patches of pasture mowing tillage and woodland  but when the river spread out broader with an uninhabited islet or a long low sandy shore which ran on single and devious not answering to its opposite but far off as if it were seashore or single coast and the land no longer nursed the river in its bosom but they conversed as equals the rustling leaves with rippling waves and few fences were seen but high oak woods on one side and large herds of cattle and all tracks seemed a point to one centre behind some statelier grovewe imagined that the river flowed through an extensive manor and that the few inhabitants were retainers to a lord and a feudal state of things prevailed  when there was a suitable reach we caught sight of the goffstown mountain the indian uncannunuc rising before us on the west side  it was a calm and beautiful day with only a slight zephyr to ripple the surface of the water and rustle the woods on shore and just warmth enough to prove the kindly disposition of nature to her children  with buoyant spirits and vigorous impulses we tossed our boat rapidly along into the very middle of this forenoon  the fishhawk sailed and screamed overhead  the chipping or striped squirrel sciurus striatus tamias lysteri aud sat upon the end of some virginia fence or rider reaching over the stream twirling a green nut with one paw as in a lathe while the other held it fast against its incisors as chisels  like an independent russet leaf with a will of its own rustling whither it could now under the fence now over it now peeping at the voyageurs through a crack with only its tail visible now at its lunch deep in the toothsome kernel and now a rod off playing at hideandseek with the nut stowed away in its chops where were half a dozen more besides extending its cheeks to a ludicrous breadthas if it were devising through what safe valve of frisk or somerset to let its superfluous life escape the stream passing harmlessly off even while it sits in constant electric flashes through its tail  and now with a chuckling squeak it dives into the root of a hazel and we see no more of it  or the larger red squirrel or chickaree sometimes called the hudson bay squirrel scriurus hudsonius gave warning of our approach by that peculiar alarum of his like the winding up of some strong clock in the top of a pinetree and dodged behind its stem or leaped from tree to tree with such caution and adroitness as if much depended on the fidelity of his scout running along the whitepine boughs sometimes twenty rods by our side with such speed and by such unerring routes as if it were some wellworn familiar path to him and presently when we have passed he returns to his work of cutting off the pinecones and letting them fall to the ground  we passed cromwells falls the first we met with on this river this forenoon by means of locks without using our wheels these falls are the nesenkeag of the indians  great nesenkeag stream comes in on the right just above and little nesenkeag some distance below both in litchfield  we read in the gazetteer under the head of merrimack that the first house in this town was erected on the margin of the river soon after 1665 for a house of traffic with the indians  for some time one cromwell carried on a lucrative trade with them weighing their furs with his foot till enraged at his supposed or real deception they formed the resolution to murder him  this intention being communicated to cromwell he buried his wealth and made his escape  within a few hours after his flight a party of the penacook tribe arrived and not finding the object of their resentment burnt his habitation upon the top of the high bank here close to the river was still to be seen his cellar now overgrown with trees  it was a convenient spot for such a traffic at the foot of the first falls above the settlements and commanding a pleasant view up the river where he could see the indians coming down with their furs  the lockman told us that his shovel and tongs had been ploughed up here and also a stone with his name on it  but we will not vouch for the truth of this story  in the new hampshire historical collections for 1815 it says some time after pewter was found in the well and an iron pot and trammel in the sand the latter are preserved  these were the traces of the white trader  on the opposite bank where it jutted over the stream capewise we picked up four arrowheads and a small indian tool made of stone as soon as we had climbed it where plainly there had once stood a wigwam of the indians with whom cromwell traded and who fished and hunted here before he came  as usual the gossips have not been silent respecting cromwells buried wealth and it is said that some years ago a farmers plough not far from here slid over a flat stone which emitted a hollow sound and on its being raised a small hole six inches in diameter was discovered stoned about from which a sum of money was taken  the lockman told us another similar story about a farmer in a neighboring town who had been a poor man but who suddenly bought a good farm and was well to do in the world and when he was questioned did not give a satisfactory account of the matter how few alas could  this caused his hired man to remember that one day as they were ploughing together the plough struck something and his employer going back to look concluded not to go round again saying that the sky looked rather lowering and so put up his team  the like urgency has caused many things to be remembered which never transpired  the truth is there is money buried everywhere and you have only to go to work to find it  not far from these falls stands an oaktree on the interval about a quarter of a mile from the river on the farm of a mr lund which was pointed out to us as the spot where french the leader of the party which went in pursuit of the indians from dunstable was killed  farwell dodged them in the thick woods near  it did not look as if men had ever had to run for their lives on this now open and peaceful interval  here too was another extensive desert by the side of the road in litchfield visible from the bank of the river  the sand was blown off in some places to the depth of ten or twelve feet leaving small grotesque hillocks of that height where there was a clump of bushes firmly rooted  thirty or forty years ago as we were told it was a sheeppasture but the sheep being worried by the fleas began to paw the ground till they broke the sod and so the sand began to blow till now it had extended over forty or fifty acres  this evil might easily have been remedied at first by spreading birches with their leaves on over the sand and fastening them down with stakes to break the wind  the fleas bit the sheep and the sheep bit the ground and the sore had spread to this extent  it is astonishing what a great sore a little scratch breedeth  who knows but sahara where caravans and cities are buried began with the bite of an african flea  this poor globe how it must itch in many places will no god be kind enough to spread a salve of birches over its sores  here too we noticed where the indians had gathered a heap of stones perhaps for their councilfire which by their weight having prevented the sand under them from blowing away were left on the summit of a mound  they told us that arrowheads and also bullets of lead and iron had been found here  we noticed several other sandy tracts in our voyage and the course of the merrimack can be traced from the nearest mountain by its yellow sandbanks though the river itself is for the most part invisible lawsuits as we hear have in some cases grown out of these causes railroads have been made through certain irritable districts breaking their sod and so have set the sand to blowing till it has converted fertile farms into deserts and the company has had to pay the damages  this sand seemed to us the connecting link between land and water  it was a kind of water on which you could walk and you could see the ripplemarks on its surface produced by the winds precisely like those at the bottom of a brook or lake  we had read that mussulmen are permitted by the koran to perform their ablutions in sand when they cannot get water a necessary indulgence in arabia and we now understood the propriety of this provision  plum island at the mouth of this river to whose formation perhaps these very banks have sent their contribution is a similar desert of drifting sand of various colors blown into graceful curves by the wind  it is a mere sandbar exposed stretching nine miles parallel to the coast and exclusive of the marsh on the inside rarely more than half a mile wide there are but half a dozen houses on it and it is almost without a tree or a sod or any green thing with which a countryman is familiar  the thin vegetation stands half buried in sand as in drifting snow  the only shrub the beachplum which gives the island its name grows but a few feet high but this is so abundant that parties of a hundred at once come from the mainland and down the merrimack in september pitch their tents and gather the plums which are good to eat raw and to preserve  the graceful and delicate beachpea too grows abundantly amid the sand and several strange mosslike and succulent plants  the island for its whole length is scalloped into low hills not more than twenty feet high by the wind and excepting a faint trail on the edge of the marsh is as trackless as sahara  there are dreary bluffs of sand and valleys ploughed by the wind where you might expect to discover the bones of a caravan  schooners come from boston to load with the sand for masons uses and in a few hours the wind obliterates all traces of their work  yet you have only to dig a foot or two anywhere to come to fresh water and you are surprised to learn that woodchucks abound here and foxes are found though you see not where they can burrow or hide themselves  i have walked down the whole length of its broad beach at low tide at which time alone you can find a firm ground to walk on and probably massachusetts does not furnish a more grand and dreary walk  on the seaside there are only a distant sail and a few coots to break the grand monotony  a solitary stake stuck up or a sharper sandhill than usual is remarkable as a landmark for miles while for music you hear only the ceaseless sound of the surf and the dreary peep of the beachbirds   there were several canalboats at cromwells falls passing through the locks for which we waited  in the forward part of one stood a brawny new hampshire man leaning on his pole bareheaded and in shirt and trousers only a rude apollo of a man coming down from that vast uplandish country to the main of nameless age with flaxen hair and vigorous weatherbleached countenance in whose wrinkles the sun still lodged as little touched by the heats and frosts and withering cares of life as a maple of the mountain an undressed unkempt uncivil man with whom we parleyed awhile and parted not without a sincere interest in one another  his humanity was genuine and instinctive and his rudeness only a manner  he inquired just as we were passing out of earshot if we had killed anything and we shouted after him that we had shot a buoy and could see him for a long while scratching his head in vain to know if he had heard aright  there is reason in the distinction of civil and uncivil  the manners are sometimes so rough a rind that we doubt whether they cover any core or sapwood at all  we sometimes meet uncivil men children of amazons who dwell by mountain paths and are said to be inhospitable to strangers whose salutation is as rude as the grasp of their brawny hands and who deal with men as unceremoniously as they are wont to deal with the elements  they need only to extend their clearings and let in more sunlight to seek out the southern slopes of the hills from which they may look down on the civil plain or ocean and temper their diet duly with the cereal fruits consuming less wild meat and acorns to become like the inhabitants of cities  a true politeness does not result from any hasty and artificial polishing it is true but grows naturally in characters of the right grain and quality through a long fronting of men and events and rubbing on good and bad fortune  perhaps i can tell a tale to the purpose while the lock is fillingfor our voyage this forenoon furnishes but few incidents of importance   early one summer morning i had left the shores of the connecticut and for the livelong day travelled up the bank of a river which came in from the west now looking down on the stream foaming and rippling through the forest a mile off from the hills over which the road led and now sitting on its rocky brink and dipping my feet in its rapids or bathing adventurously in midchannel  the hills grew more and more frequent and gradually swelled into mountains as i advanced hemming in the course of the river so that at last i could not see where it came from and was at liberty to imagine the most wonderful meanderings and descents  at noon i slept on the grass in the shade of a maple where the river had found a broader channel than usual and was spread out shallow with frequent sandbars exposed  in the names of the towns i recognized some which i had long ago read on teamsters wagons that had come from far up country quiet uplandish towns of mountainous fame  i walked along musing and enchanted by rows of sugarmaples through the small and uninquisitive villages and sometimes was pleased with the sight of a boat drawn up on a sandbar where there appeared no inhabitants to use it  it seemed however as essential to the river as a fish and to lend a certain dignity to it  it was like the trout of mountain streams to the fishes of the sea or like the young of the landcrab born far in the interior who have never yet heard the sound of the oceans surf  the hills approached nearer and nearer to the stream until at last they closed behind me and i found myself just before nightfall in a romantic and retired valley about half a mile in length and barely wide enough for the stream at its bottom  i thought that there could be no finer site for a cottage among mountains  you could anywhere run across the stream on the rocks and its constant murmuring would quiet the passions of mankind forever suddenly the road which seemed aiming for the mountainside turned short to the left and another valley opened concealing the former and of the same character with it  it was the most remarkable and pleasing scenery i had ever seen  i found here a few mild and hospitable inhabitants who as the day was not quite spent and i was anxious to improve the light directed me four or five miles farther on my way to the dwelling of a man whose name was rice who occupied the last and highest of the valleys that lay in my path and who they said was a rather rude and uncivil man  but what is a foreign country to those who have science  who is a stranger to those who have the habit of speaking kindly  at length as the sun was setting behind the mountains in a still darker and more solitary vale i reached the dwelling of this man  except for the narrowness of the plain and that the stones were solid granite it was the counterpart of that retreat to which belphoebe bore the wounded timias                          in a pleasant glade      with mountains round about environed      and mighty woods which did the valley shade      and like a stately theatre it made      spreading itself into a spacious plain      and in the midst a little river played      amongst the pumy stones which seemed to plain      with gentle murmur that his course they did restrain  i observed as i drew near that he was not so rude as i had anticipated for he kept many cattle and dogs to watch them and i saw where he had made maplesugar on the sides of the mountains and above all distinguished the voices of children mingling with the murmur of the torrent before the door  as i passed his stable i met one whom i supposed to be a hired man attending to his cattle and i inquired if they entertained travellers at that house  sometimes we do he answered gruffly and immediately went to the farthest stall from me and i perceived that it was rice himself whom i had addressed  but pardoning this incivility to the wildness of the scenery i bent my steps to the house  there was no signpost before it nor any of the usual invitations to the traveller though i saw by the road that many went and came there but the owners name only was fastened to the outside a sort of implied and sullen invitation as i thought  i passed from room to room without meeting any one till i came to what seemed the guests apartment which was neat and even had an air of refinement about it and i was glad to find a map against the wall which would direct me on my journey on the morrow  at length i heard a step in a distant apartment which was the first i had entered and went to see if the landlord had come in but it proved to be only a child one of those whose voices i had heard probably his son and between him and me stood in the doorway a large watchdog which growled at me and looked as if he would presently spring but the boy did not speak to him and when i asked for a glass of water he briefly said it runs in the corner so i took a mug from the counter and went out of doors and searched round the corner of the house but could find neither well nor spring nor any water but the stream which ran all along the front  i came back therefore and setting down the mug asked the child if the stream was good to drink whereupon he seized the mug and going to the corner of the room where a cool spring which issued from the mountain behind trickled through a pipe into the apartment filled it and drank and gave it to me empty again and calling to the dog rushed out of doors  erelong some of the hired men made their appearance and drank at the spring and lazily washed themselves and combed their hair in silence and some sat down as if weary and fell asleep in their seats  but all the while i saw no women though i sometimes heard a bustle in that part of the house from which the spring came  at length rice himself came in for it was now dark with an oxwhip in his hand breathing hard and he too soon settled down into his seat not far from me as if now that his days work was done he had no farther to travel but only to digest his supper at his leisure  when i asked him if he could give me a bed he said there was one ready in such a tone as implied that i ought to have known it and the less said about that the better  so far so good  and yet he continued to look at me as if he would fain have me say something further like a traveller  i remarked that it was a wild and rugged country he inhabited and worth coming many miles to see  not so very rough neither said he and appealed to his men to bear witness to the breadth and smoothness of his fields which consisted in all of one small interval and to the size of his crops and if we have some hills added he theres no better pasturage anywhere i then asked if this place was the one i had heard of calling it by a name i had seen on the map or if it was a certain other and he answered gruffly that it was neither the one nor the other that he had settled it and cultivated it and made it what it was and i could know nothing about it  observing some guns and other implements of hunting hanging on brackets around the room and his hounds now sleeping on the floor i took occasion to change the discourse and inquired if there was much game in that country and he answered this question more graciously having some glimmering of my drift but when i inquired if there were any bears he answered impatiently that he was no more in danger of losing his sheep than his neighbors he had tamed and civilized that region  after a pause thinking of my journey on the morrow and the few hours of daylight in that hollow and mountainous country which would require me to be on my way betimes i remarked that the day must be shorter by an hour there than on the neighboring plains at which he gruffly asked what i knew about it and affirmed that he had as much daylight as his neighbors he ventured to say the days were longer there than where i lived as i should find if i stayed that in some way i could not be expected to understand how the sun came over the mountains half an hour earlier and stayed half an hour later there than on the neighboring plains  and more of like sort he said  he was indeed as rude as a fabled satyr  but i suffered him to pass for what he wasfor why should i quarrel with natureand was even pleased at the discovery of such a singular natural phenomenon  i dealt with him as if to me all manners were indifferent and he had a sweet wild way with him  i would not question nature and i would rather have him as he was than as i would have him  for i had come up here not for sympathy or kindness or society but for novelty and adventure and to see what nature had produced here  i therefore did not repel his rudeness but quite innocently welcomed it all and knew how to appreciate it as if i were reading in an old drama a part well sustained  he was indeed a coarse and sensual man and as i have said uncivil but he had his just quarrel with nature and mankind i have no doubt only he had no artificial covering to his illhumors  he was earthy enough but yet there was good soil in him and even a longsuffering saxon probity at bottom if you could represent the case to him he would not let the race die out in him like a red indian  at length i told him that he was a fortunate man and i trusted that he was grateful for so much light and rising said i would take a lamp and that i would pay him then for my lodging for i expected to recommence my journey even as early as the sun rose in his country but he answered in haste and this time civilly that i should not fail to find some of his household stirring however early for they were no sluggards and i could take my breakfast with them before i started if i chose and as he lighted the lamp i detected a gleam of true hospitality and ancient civility a beam of pure and even gentle humanity from his bleared and moist eyes  it was a look more intimate with me and more explanatory than any words of his could have been if he had tried to his dying day  it was more significant than any rice of those parts could even comprehend and long anticipated this mans culturea glance of his pure genius which did not much enlighten him but did impress and rule him for the moment and faintly constrain his voice and manner  he cheerfully led the way to my apartment stepping over the limbs of his men who were asleep on the floor in an intervening chamber and showed me a clean and comfortable bed  for many pleasant hours after the household was asleep i sat at the open window for it was a sultry night and heard the little river     amongst the pumy stones which seemed to plain      with gentle murmur that his course they did restrain  but i arose as usual by starlight the next morning before my host or his men or even his dogs were awake and having left a ninepence on the counter was already halfway over the mountain with the sun before they had broken their fast  before i had left the country of my host while the first rays of the sun slanted over the mountains as i stopped by the wayside to gather some raspberries a very old man not far from a hundred came along with a milkingpail in his hand and turning aside began to pluck the berries near me            his reverend locks      in comelye curles did wave      and on his aged temples grew         the blossoms of the grave  but when i inquired the way he answered in a low rough voice without looking up or seeming to regard my presence which i imputed to his years and presently muttering to himself he proceeded to collect his cows in a neighboring pasture and when he had again returned near to the wayside he suddenly stopped while his cows went on before and uncovering his head prayed aloud in the cool morning air as if he had forgotten this exercise before for his daily bread and also that he who letteth his rain fall on the just and on the unjust and without whom not a sparrow falleth to the ground would not neglect the stranger meaning me and with even more direct and personal applications though mainly according to the longestablished formula common to lowlanders and the inhabitants of mountains when he had done praying i made bold to ask him if he had any cheese in his hut which he would sell me but he answered without looking up and in the same low and repulsive voice as before that they did not make any and went to milking  it is written the stranger who turneth away from a house with disappointed hopes leaveth there his own offences and departeth taking with him all the good actions of the owner   being now fairly in the stream of this weeks commerce we began to meet with boats more frequently and hailed them from time to time with the freedom of sailors  the boatmen appeared to lead an easy and contented life and we thought that we should prefer their employment ourselves to many professions which are much more sought after  they suggested how few circumstances are necessary to the wellbeing and serenity of man how indifferent all employments are and that any may seem noble and poetic to the eyes of men if pursued with sufficient buoyancy and freedom with liberty and pleasant weather the simplest occupation any unquestioned country mode of life which detains us in the open air is alluring  the man who picks peas steadily for a living is more than respectable he is even envied by his shopworn neighbors  we are as happy as the birds when our good genius permits us to pursue any outdoor work without a sense of dissipation  our penknife glitters in the sun our voice is echoed by yonder wood if an oar drops we are fain to let it drop again  the canalboat is of very simple construction requiring but little shiptimber and as we were told costs about two hundred dollars  they are managed by two men  in ascending the stream they use poles fourteen or fifteen feet long pointed with iron walking about one third the length of the boat from the forward end  going down they commonly keep in the middle of the stream using an oar at each end or if the wind is favorable they raise their broad sail and have only to steer  they commonly carry down wood or bricksfifteen or sixteen cords of wood and as many thousand bricks at a timeand bring back stores for the country consuming two or three days each way between concord and charlestown  they sometimes pile the wood so as to leave a shelter in one part where they may retire from the rain  one can hardly imagine a more healthful employment or one more favorable to contemplation and the observation of nature  unlike the mariner they have the constantly varying panorama of the shore to relieve the monotony of their labor and it seemed to us that as they thus glided noiselessly from town to town with all their furniture about them for their very homestead is a movable they could comment on the character of the inhabitants with greater advantage and security to themselves than the traveller in a coach who would be unable to indulge in such broadsides of wit and humor in so small a vessel for fear of the recoil  they are not subject to great exposure like the lumberers of maine in any weather but inhale the healthfullest breezes being slightly encumbered with clothing frequently with the head and feet bare when we met them at noon as they were leisurely descending the stream their busy commerce did not look like toil but rather like some ancient oriental game still played on a large scale as the game of chess for instance handed down to this generation from morning till night unless the wind is so fair that his single sail will suffice without other labor than steering the boatman walks backwards and forwards on the side of his boat now stooping with his shoulder to the pole then drawing it back slowly to set it again meanwhile moving steadily forward through an endless valley and an everchanging scenery now distinguishing his course for a mile or two and now shut in by a sudden turn of the river in a small woodland lake  all the phenomena which surround him are simple and grand and there is something impressive even majestic in the very motion he causes which will naturally be communicated to his own character and he feels the slow irresistible movement under him with pride as if it were his own energy  the news spread like wildfire among us youths when formerly once in a year or two one of these boats came up the concord river and was seen stealing mysteriously through the meadows and past the village  it came and departed as silently as a cloud without noise or dust and was witnessed by few  one summer day this huge traveller might be seen moored at some meadows wharf and another summer day it was not there  where precisely it came from or who these men were who knew the rocks and soundings better than we who bathed there we could never tell  we knew some rivers bay only but they took rivers from end to end they were a sort of fabulous rivermen to us  it was inconceivable by what sort of mediation any mere landsman could hold communication with them  would they heave to to gratify his wishes  no it was favor enough to know faintly of their destination or the time of their possible return  i have seen them in the summer when the stream ran low mowing the weeds in midchannel and with hayers jests cutting broad swaths in three feet of water that they might make a passage for their scow while the grass in long windrows was carried down the stream undried by the rarest hayweather  we admired unweariedly how their vessel would float like a huge chip sustaining so many casks of lime and thousands of bricks and such heaps of iron ore with wheelbarrows aboard and that when we stepped on it it did not yield to the pressure of our feet  it gave us confidence in the prevalence of the law of buoyancy and we imagined to what infinite uses it might be put  the men appeared to lead a kind of life on it and it was whispered that they slept aboard  some affirmed that it carried sail and that such winds blew here as filled the sails of vessels on the ocean which again others much doubted  they had been seen to sail across our fair haven bay by lucky fishers who were out but unfortunately others were not there to see  we might then say that our river was navigablewhy not  in afteryears i read in print with no little satisfaction that it was thought by some that with a little expense in removing rocks and deepening the channel there might be a profitable inland navigation i then lived somewhere to tell of  such is commerce which shakes the cocoanut and breadfruit tree in the remotest isle and sooner or later dawns on the duskiest and most simpleminded savage  if we may be pardoned the digression who can help being affected at the thought of the very fine and slight but positive relation in which the savage inhabitants of some remote isle stand to the mysterious white mariner the child of the sunas if we were to have dealings with an animal higher in the scale of being than ourselves  it is a barely recognized fact to the natives that he exists and has his home far away somewhere and is glad to buy their fresh fruits with his superfluous commodities  under the same catholic sun glances his white ship over pacific waves into their smooth bays and the poor savages paddle gleams in the air       mans little acts are grand      beheld from land to land      there as they lie in time      within their native clime           ships with the noontide weigh           and glide before its ray           to some retired bay           their haunt           whence under tropic sun           again they run           bearing gum senegal and tragicant      for this was ocean meant      for this the sun was sent      and moon was lent      and winds in distant caverns pent  since our voyage the railroad on the bank has been extended and there is now but little boating on the merrimack  all kinds of produce and stores were formerly conveyed by water but now nothing is carried up the stream and almost wood and bricks alone are carried down and these are also carried on the railroad  the locks are fast wearing out and will soon be impassable since the tolls will not pay the expense of repairing them and so in a few years there will be an end of boating on this river  the boating at present is principally between merrimack and lowell or hooksett and manchester  they make two or three trips in a week according to wind and weather from merrimack to lowell and back about twentyfive miles each way the boatman comes singing in to shore late at night and moors his empty boat and gets his supper and lodging in some house near at hand and again early in the morning by starlight perhaps he pushes away up stream and by a shout or the fragment of a song gives notice of his approach to the lockman with whom he is to take his breakfast  if he gets up to his woodpile before noon he proceeds to load his boat with the help of his single hand and is on his way down again before night when he gets to lowell he unloads his boat and gets his receipt for his cargo and having heard the news at the public house at middlesex or elsewhere goes back with his empty boat and his receipt in his pocket to the owner and to get a new load  we were frequently advertised of their approach by some faint sound behind us and looking round saw them a mile off creeping stealthily up the side of the stream like alligators  it was pleasant to hail these sailors of the merrimack from time to time and learn the news which circulated with them  we imagined that the sun shining on their bare heads had stamped a liberal and public character on their most private thoughts  the open and sunny interval still stretched away from the river sometimes by two or more terraces to the distant hillcountry and when we climbed the bank we commonly found an irregular copsewood skirting the river the primitive having floated downstream long ago tothe kings navy sometimes we saw the riverroad a quarter or half a mile distant and the particolored concord stage with its cloud of dust its van of earnest travelling faces and its rear of dusty trunks reminding us that the country had its places of rendezvous for restless yankee men  there dwelt along at considerable distances on this interval a quiet agricultural and pastoral people with every house its well as we sometimes proved and every household though never so still and remote it appeared in the noontide its dinner about these times  there they lived on those new england people farmer lives father and grandfather and greatgrandfather on and on without noise keeping up tradition and expecting beside fair weather and abundant harvests we did not learn what they were contented to live since it was so contrived for them and where their lines had fallen       our uninquiring corpses lie more low      than our lifes curiosity doth go  yet these men had no need to travel to be as wise as solomon in all his glory so similar are the lives of men in all countries and fraught with the same homely experiences  one half the world knows how the other half lives  about noon we passed a small village in merrimack at thorntons ferry and tasted of the waters of naticook brook on the same side where french and his companions whose grave we saw in dunstable were ambuscaded by the indians  the humble village of litchfield with its steepleless meetinghouse stood on the opposite or east bank near where a dense grove of willows backed by maples skirted the shore  there also we noticed some shagbarktrees which as they do not grow in concord were as strange a sight to us as the palm would be whose fruit only we have seen  our course now curved gracefully to the north leaving a low flat shore on the merrimack side which forms a sort of harbor for canalboats  we observed some fair elms and particularly large and handsome whitemaples standing conspicuously on this interval and the opposite shore a quarter of a mile below was covered with young elms and maples six inches high which had probably sprung from the seeds which had been washed across  some carpenters were at work here mending a scow on the green and sloping bank  the strokes of their mallets echoed from shore to shore and up and down the river and their tools gleamed in the sun a quarter of a mile from us and we realized that boatbuilding was as ancient and honorable an art as agriculture and that there might be a naval as well as a pastoral life  the whole history of commerce was made manifest in that scow turned bottom upward on the shore  thus did men begin to go down upon the sea in ships quaeque diu steterant in montibus altis fluctibus ignotis insultavere carinae and keels which had long stood on high mountains careered insultingly insultavere over unknown waves ovid met  i 133 we thought that it would be well for the traveller to build his boat on the bank of a stream instead of finding a ferry or a bridge  in the adventures of henry the furtrader it is pleasant to read that when with his indians he reached the shore of ontario they consumed two days in making two canoes of the bark of the elmtree in which to transport themselves to fort niagara  it is a worthy incident in a journey a delay as good as much rapid travelling  a good share of our interest in xenophons story of his retreat is in the manoeuvres to get the army safely over the rivers whether on rafts of logs or fagots or sheepskins blown up  and where could they better afford to tarry meanwhile than on the banks of a river  as we glided past at a distance these outdoor workmen appeared to have added some dignity to their labor by its very publicness it was a part of the industry of nature like the work of hornets and mudwasps        the waves slowly beat       just to keep the noon sweet       and no sound is floated oer       save the mallet on shore       which echoing on high       seems acalking the sky  the haze the suns dust of travel had a lethean influence on the land and its inhabitants and all creatures resigned themselves to float upon the inappreciable tides of nature       woof of the sun ethereal gauze      woven of natures richest stuffs      visible heat airwater and dry sea      last conquest of the eye      toil of the day

that which has conquered and prevailed commends itself to us by its very antiquity and apparent solidity and necessity  our weakness needs it and our strength uses it  we cannot draw on our boots without bracing ourselves against it  if there were but one erect and solid standing tree in the woods all creatures would go to rub against it and make sure of their footing  during the many hours which we spend in this waking sleep the hand stands still on the face of the clock and we grow like corn in the night  men are as busy as the brooks or bees and postpone everything to their business as carpenters discuss politics between the strokes of the hammer while they are shingling a roof   this noontide was a fit occasion to make some pleasant harbor and there read the journal of some voyageur like ourselves not too moral nor inquisitive and which would not disturb the noon or else some old classic the very flower of all reading which we had postponed to such a season       of syrian peace immortal leisure  but alas our chest like the cabin of a coaster contained only its wellthumbed navigator for all literature and we were obliged to draw on our memory for these things  we naturally remembered alexander henrys adventures here as a sort of classic among books of american travel  it contains scenery and rough sketching of men and incidents enough to inspire poets for many years and to my fancy is as full of sounding names as any page of historylake winnipeg hudson bay ottaway and portages innumerable chipeways gens de terres les pilleurs the weepers with reminiscences of hearnes journey and the like an immense and shaggy but sincere country summer and winter adorned with chains of lakes and rivers covered with snows with hemlocks and firtrees  there is a naturalness an unpretending and cold life in this traveller as in a canadian winter what life was preserved through low temperatures and frontier dangers by furs within a stout heart he has truth and moderation worthy of the father of history which belong only to an intimate experience and he does not defer too much to literature  the unlearned traveller may quote his single line from the poets with as good right as the scholar he too may speak of the stars for he sees them shoot perhaps when the astronomer does not  the good sense of this author is very conspicuous  he is a traveller who does not exaggerate but writes for the information of his readers for science and for history  his story is told with as much good faith and directness as if it were a report to his brother traders or the directors of the hudson bay company and is fitly dedicated to sir joseph banks  it reads like the argument to a great poem on the primitive state of the country and its inhabitants and the reader imagines what in each case with the invocation of the muse might be sung and leaves off with suspended interest as if the full account were to follow  in what school was this furtrader educated  he seems to travel the immense snowy country with such purpose only as the reader who accompanies him and to the latters imagination it is as it were momentarily created to be the scene of his adventures  what is most interesting and valuable in it however is not the materials for the history of pontiac or braddock or the northwest which it furnishes not the annals of the country but the natural facts or perennials which are ever without date  when out of history the truth shall be extracted it will have shed its dates like withered leaves   the souhegan or crooked river as some translate it comes in from the west about a mile and a half above thorntons ferry babboosuck brook empties into it near its mouth  there are said to be some of the finest water privileges in the country still unimproved

memorial of an interview between two ancient tribes of men one of which is now extinct while the other though it is still represented by a miserable remnant has long since disappeared from its ancient huntinggrounds  a mr james parker at mr hinchmannes farme ner meremack wrote thus to the honred governer and council at bostown hast post hast    sagamore wanalancet come this morning to informe me and then   went to mr tyngs to informe him that his son being on ye   other sid of meremack river over against souhegan upon the 22   day of this instant about tene of the clock in the morning he   discovered 15 indians on this sid the river which he soposed   to be mohokes by ther spech  he called to them they answered   but he could not understand ther spech and he having a conow   ther in the river he went to breck his conow that they might   not have ani ues of it  in the mean time they shot about   thirty guns at him and he being much frighted fled and come   home forthwith to nahamcock pawtucket falls or lowell wher   ther wigowames now stand  penacooks and mohawks ubique gentium sunt in the year 1670 a mohawk warrior scalped a naamkeak or else a wamesit indian maiden near where lowell now stands  she however recovered  even as late as 1685 john hogkins a penacook indian who describes his grandfather as having lived at place called malamake rever other name chef natukkog and panukkog that one rever great many names wrote thus to the governor                                                   may 15th 1685    honor governor my friend    you my friend i desire your worship and your power because i   hope you can do som great matters this one  i am poor and   naked and i have no men at my place because i afraid allwayes   mohogs he will kill me every day and night  if your worship   when please pray help me you no let mohogs kill me at my place   at malamake river called pannukkog and natukkog i will submit   your worship and your power  and now i want pouder and such   alminishon shatt and guns because i have forth at my hom and i   plant theare    this all indian hand but pray you do consider your humble   servant                                                  john hogkins    signed also by simon detogkom king hary sam linis mr jorge   rodunnonukgus john owamosimmin and nine other indians with   their marks against their names  but now one hundred and fiftyfour years having elapsed since the date of this letter we went unalarmed on our way without brecking our conow reading the new england gazetteer and seeing no traces of mohogs on the banks  the souhegan though a rapid river seemed today to have borrowed its character from the noon       where gleaming fields of haze      meet the voyageurs gaze      and above the heated air      seems to make a river there      the pines stand up with pride      by the souhegans side      and the hemlock and the larch      with their triumphal arch      are waving oer its march         to the sea      no wind stirs its waves      but the spirits of the braves         hovring oer      whose antiquated graves      its still water laves         on the shore      with an indians stealthy tread      it goes sleeping in its bed      without joy or grief      or the rustle of a leaf      without a ripple or a billow      or the sigh of a willow      from the lyndeboro hills      to the merrimack mills      with a louder din      did its current begin      when melted the snow      on the far mountains brow      and the drops came together      in that rainy weather      experienced river      hast thou flowed forever      souhegan soundeth old      but the half is not told      what names hast thou borne      in the ages far gone      when the xanthus and meander      commenced to wander      ere the black bear haunted         thy red forestfloor      or nature had planted         the pines by thy shore  during the heat of the day we rested on a large island a mile above the mouth of this river pastured by a herd of cattle with steep banks and scattered elms and oaks and a sufficient channel for canalboats on each side  when we made a fire to boil some rice for our dinner the flames spreading amid the dry grass and the smoke curling silently upward and casting grotesque shadows on the ground seemed phenomena of the noon and we fancied that we progressed up the stream without effort and as naturally as the wind and tide went down not outraging the calm days by unworthy bustle or impatience  the woods on the neighboring shore were alive with pigeons which were moving south looking for mast but now like ourselves spending their noon in the shade  we could hear the slight wiry winnowing sound of their wings as they changed their roosts from time to time and their gentle and tremulous cooing  they sojourned with us during the noontide greater travellers far than we  you may frequently discover a single pair sitting upon the lower branches of the whitepine in the depths of the wood at this hour of the day so silent and solitary and with such a hermitlike appearance as if they had never strayed beyond its skirts while the acorn which was gathered in the forests of maine is still undigested in their crops  we obtained one of these handsome birds which lingered too long upon its perch and plucked and broiled it here with some other game to be carried along for our supper for beside the provisions which we carried with us we depended mainly on the river and forest for our supply  it is true it did not seem to be putting this bird to its right use to pluck off its feathers and extract its entrails and broil its carcass on the coals but we heroically persevered nevertheless waiting for further information  the same regard for nature which excited our sympathy for her creatures nerved our hands to carry through what we had begun  for we would be honorable to the party we deserted we would fulfil fate and so at length perhaps detect the secret innocence of these incessant tragedies which heaven allows       too quick resolves do resolution wrong      what part so soon to be divorced so long      things to be done are long to be debated      heaven is not dayd repentance is not dated  we are doubleedged blades and every time we whet our virtue the return stroke straps our vice  where is the skilful swordsman who can give clean wounds and not rip up his work with the other edge  nature herself has not provided the most graceful end for her creatures  what becomes of all these birds that people the air and forest for our solacement  the sparrows seem always chipper never infirm  we do not see their bodies lie about yet there is a tragedy at the end of each one of their lives they must perish miserably not one of them is translated  true not a sparrow falleth to the ground without our heavenly fathers knowledge but they do fall nevertheless  the carcasses of some poor squirrels however the same that frisked so merrily in the morning which we had skinned and embowelled for our dinner we abandoned in disgust with tardy humanity as too wretched a resource for any but starving men it was to perpetuate the practice of a barbarous era  if they had been larger our crime had been less  their small red bodies little bundles of red tissue mere gobbets of venison would not have fattened fire with a sudden impulse we threw them away and washed our hands and boiled some rice for our dinner  behold the difference between the one who eateth flesh and him to whom it belonged  the first hath a momentary enjoyment whilst the latter is deprived of existence who would commit so great a crime against a poor animal who is fed only by the herbs which grow wild in the woods and whose belly is burnt up with hunger we remembered a picture of mankind in the hunter age chasing hares down the mountains o me miserable yet sheep and oxen are but larger squirrels whose hides are saved and meat is salted whose souls perchance are not so large in proportion to their bodies  there should always be some flowering and maturing of the fruits of nature in the cooking process  some simple dishes recommend themselves to our imaginations as well as palates  in parched corn for instance there is a manifest sympathy between the bursting seed and the more perfect developments of vegetable life  it is a perfect flower with its petals like the houstonia or anemone  on my warm hearth these cerealian blossoms expanded here is the bank whereon they grew  perhaps some such visible blessing would always attend the simple and wholesome repast  here was that pleasant harbor which we had sighed for where the weary voyageur could read the journal of some other sailor whose bark had ploughed perchance more famous and classic seas at the tables of the gods after feasting follow music and song we will recline now under these island trees and for our minstrel call on                              anacreon       nor has he ceased his charming song for still that lyre      though he is dead sleeps not in hades                                 simonides epigram on anacreon  i lately met with an old volume from a london bookshop containing the greek minor poets and it was a pleasure to read once more only the words orpheus linus musaeusthose faint poetic sounds and echoes of a name dying away on the ears of us modern men and those hardly more substantial sounds mimnermus ibycus alcaeus stesichorus menander  they lived not in vain  we can converse with these bodiless fames without reserve or personality  i know of no studies so composing as those of the classical scholar  when we have sat down to them life seems as still and serene as if it were very far off and i believe it is not habitually seen from any common platform so truly and unexaggerated as in the light of literature  in serene hours we contemplate the tour of the greek and latin authors with more pleasure than the traveller does the fairest scenery of greece or italy  where shall we find a more refined society  that highway down from homer and hesiod to horace and juvenal is more attractive than the appian  reading the classics or conversing with those old greeks and latins in their surviving works is like walking amid the stars and constellations a high and by way serene to travel  indeed the true scholar will be not a little of an astronomer in his habits  distracting cares will not be allowed to obstruct the field of his vision for the higher regions of literature like astronomy are above storm and darkness  but passing by these rumors of bards let us pause for a moment at the teian poet  there is something strangely modern about him  he is very easily turned into english  is it that our lyric poets have resounded but that lyre which would sound only light subjects and which simonides tells us does not sleep in hades  his odes are like gems of pure ivory  they possess an ethereal and evanescent beauty like summer evenings ho chre se noein noou antheiwhich you must perceive with the flower of the mindand show how slight a beauty could be expressed  you have to consider them as the stars of lesser magnitude with the side of the eye and look aside from them to behold them  they charm us by their serenity and freedom from exaggeration and passion and by a certain flowerlike beauty which does not propose itself but must be approached and studied like a natural object  but perhaps their chief merit consists in the lightness and yet security of their tread       the young and tender stalk      neer bends when they do walk  true our nerves are never strung by them it is too constantly the sound of the lyre and never the note of the trumpet but they are not gross as has been presumed but always elevated above the sensual  these are some of the best that have come down to us        on his lyre       i wish to sing the atridae      and cadmus i wish to sing      but my lyre sounds      only love with its chords      lately i changed the strings      and all the lyre      and i began to sing the labors      of hercules but my lyre      resounded loves      farewell henceforth for me      heroes for my lyre      sings only loves       to a swallow       thou indeed dear swallow      yearly going and coming      in summer weavest thy nest      and in winter gost disappearing      either to nile or to memphis      but love always weaveth      his nest in my heart       on a silver cup       turning the silver      vulcan make for me      not indeed a panoply      for what are battles to me      but a hollow cup      as deep as thou canst      and make for me in it      neither stars nor wagons      nor sad orion      what are the pleiades to me      what the shining bootes      make vines for me      and clusters of grapes in it      and of gold love and bathyllus      treading the grapes      with the fair lyaeus       on himself       thou singst the affairs of thebes      and he the battles of troy      but i of my own defeats      no horse have wasted me      nor foot nor ships      but a new and different host      from eyes smiting me        to a dove       lovely dove      whence whence dost thou fly      whence running on air      dost thou waft and diffuse      so many sweet ointments      who art what thy errand      anacreon sent me      to a boy to bathyllus      who lately is ruler and tyrant of all      cythere has sold me      for one little song      and im doing this service      for anacreon      and now as you see      i bear letters from him      and he says that directly      hell make me free      but though he release me      his slave i will tarry with him      for why should i fly      over mountains and fields      and perch upon trees      eating some wild thing      now indeed i eat bread      plucking it from the hands      of anacreon himself      and he gives me to drink      the wine which he tastes      and drinking i dance      and shadow my masters      face with my wings      and going to rest      on the lyre itself i sleep      that is all get thee gone      thou hast made me more talkative      man than a crow       on love       love walking swiftly      with hyacinthine staff      bade me to take a run with him      and hastening through swift torrents      and woody places and over precipices      a watersnake stung me      and my heart leaped up to      my mouth and i should have fainted      but love fanning my brows      with his soft wings said      surely thou art not able to love       on women       nature has given horns      to bulls and hoofs to horses      swiftness to hares      to lions yawning teeth      to fishes swimming      to birds flight      to men wisdom      for woman she had nothing beside      what then does she give beauty      instead of all sheilds      instead of all  spears      and she conquers even iron      and fire who is beautiful       on lovers       horses have the mark      of fire on their sides      and some have distinguished      the parthian men by their crests      so i seeing lovers      know them at once      for they have a certain slight      brand on their hearts       to a swallow       what dost thou wish me to do to thee      what thou loquacious swallow      dost thou wish me taking thee      thy light pinions to clip      or rather to pluck out      thy tongue from within      as that tereus did      why with thy notes in the dawn      hast thou plundered bathyllus      from my beautiful dreams       to a colt       thracian colt why at me      looking aslant with thy eyes      dost thou cruelly flee      and think that i know nothing wise      know i could well      put the bridle on thee      and holding the reins turn      round the bounds of the course      but now thou browsest the meads      and gambolling lightly dost play      for thou hast no skilful horseman      mounted upon thy back       cupid wounded       love once among roses      saw not      a sleeping bee but was stung      and being wounded in the finger      of his hand cried for pain      running as well as flying      to the beautiful venus      i am killed mother said he      i am killed and i die      a little serpent has stung me      winged which they call      a beethe husbandmen      and she said if the sting      of a bee afflicts you      how think you are they afflicted      love whom you smite                  late in the afternoon for we had lingered long on the island we raised our sail for the first time and for a short hour the southwest wind was our ally but it did not please heaven to abet us along  with one sail raised we swept slowly up the eastern side of the stream steering clear of the rocks while from the top of a hill which formed the opposite bank some lumberers were rolling down timber to be rafted down the stream  we could see their axes and levers gleaming in the sun and the logs came down with a dust and a rumbling sound which was reverberated through the woods beyond us on our side like the roar of artillery  but zephyr soon took us out of sight and hearing of this commerce having passed reads ferry and another island called mcgaws island we reached some rapids called moores falls and entered on that section of the river nine miles in extent converted by law into the union canal comprehending in that space six distinct falls at each of which and at several intermediate places work has been done  after passing moores falls by means of locks we again had recourse to our oars and went merrily on our way driving the small sandpiper from rock to rock before us and sometimes rowing near enough to a cottage on the bank though they were few and far between to see the sunflowers and the seed vessels of the poppy like small goblets filled with the water of lethe before the door but without disturbing the sluggish household behind  thus we held on sailing or dipping our way along with the paddle up this broad river smooth and placid flowing over concealed rocks where we could see the pickerel lying low in the transparent water eager to double some distant cape to make some great bend as in the life of man and see what new perspective would open looking far into a new country broad and serene the cottages of settlers seen afar for the first time yet with the moss of a century on their roofs and the third or fourth generation in their shadows  strange was it to consider how the sun and the summer the buds of spring and the seared leaves of autumn were related to these cabins along the shore how all the rays which paint the landscape radiate from them and the flight of the crow and the gyrations of the hawk have reference to their roofs  still the ever rich and fertile shores accompanied us fringed with vines and alive with small birds and frisking squirrels the edge of some farmers field or widows woodlot or wilder perchance where the muskrat the little medicine of the river drags itself along stealthily over the alderleaves and muscleshells and man and the memory of man are banished far  at length the unwearied neversinking shore still holding on without break with its cool copses and serene pasturegrounds tempted us to disembark and we adventurously landed on this remote coast to survey it without the knowledge of any human inhabitant probably to this day  but we still remember the gnarled and hospitable oaks which grew even there for our entertainment and were no strangers to us the lonely horse in his pasture and the patient cows whose path to the river so judiciously chosen to overcome the difficulties of the way we followed and disturbed their ruminations in the shade and above all the cool free aspect of the wild appletrees generously proffering their fruit to us though still green and crudethe hard round glossy fruit which if not ripe still was not poison but newenglish too brought hither its ancestors by ours once  these gentler trees imparted a halfcivilized and twilight aspect to the otherwise barbarian land  still farther on we scrambled up the rocky channel of a brook which had long served nature for a sluice there leaping like it from rock to rock through tangled woods at the bottom of a ravine which grew darker and darker and more and more hoarse the murmurs of the stream until we reached the ruins of a mill where now the ivy grew and the trout glanced through the crumbling flume and there we imagined what had been the dreams and speculations of some early settler  but the waning day compelled us to embark once more and redeem this wasted time with long and vigorous sweeps over the rippling stream  it was still wild and solitary except that at intervals of a mile or two the roof of a cottage might be seen over the bank this region as we read was once famous for the manufacture of straw bonnets of the leghorn kind of which it claims the invention in these parts and occasionally some industrious damsel tripped down to the waters edge to put her straw asoak as it appeared and stood awhile to watch the retreating voyageurs and catch the fragment of a boatsong which we had made wafted over the water     thus perchance the indian hunter      many a lagging year agone    gliding oer thy rippling waters      lowly hummed a natural song     now the suns behind the willows      now he gleams along the waves    faintly oer the wearied billows      come the spirits of the braves  just before sundown we reached some more falls in the town of bedford where some stonemasons were employed repairing the locks in a solitary part of the river  they were interested in our adventure especially one young man of our own age who inquired at first if we were bound up to skeag and when he had heard our story and examined our outfit asked us other questions but temperately still and always turning to his work again though as if it were become his duty  it was plain that he would like to go with us and as he looked up the river many a distant cape and wooded shore were reflected in his eye as well as in his thoughts  when we were ready he left his work and helped us through the locks with a sort of quiet enthusiasm telling us that we were at coos falls and we could still distinguish the strokes of his chisel for many sweeps after we had left him  we wished to camp this night on a large rock in the middle of the stream just above these falls but the want of fuel and the difficulty of fixing our tent firmly prevented us so we made our bed on the mainland opposite on the west bank in the town of bedford in a retired place as we supposed there being no house in sight     page                         wednesday                man is mans foe and destiny                                        cotton    page                         wednesday                             early this morning as we were rolling up our buffaloes and loading our boat amid the dew while our embers were still smoking the masons who worked at the locks and whom we had seen crossing the river in their boat the evening before while we were examining the rock came upon us as they were going to their work and we found that we had pitched our tent directly in the path to their boat  this was the only time that we were observed on our campingground  thus far from the beaten highways and the dust and din of travel we beheld the country privately yet freely and at our leisure  other roads do some violence to nature and bring the traveller to stare at her but the river steals into the scenery it traverses without intrusion silently creating and adorning it and is as free to come and go as the zephyr  as we shoved away from this rocky coast before sunrise the smaller bittern the genius of the shore was moping along its edge or stood probing the mud for its food with ever an eye on us though so demurely at work or else he ran along over the wet stones like a wrecker in his stormcoat looking out for wrecks of snails and cockles  now away he goes with a limping flight uncertain where he will alight until a rod of clear sand amid the alders invites his feet and now our steady approach compels him to seek a new retreat  it is a bird of the oldest thalesian school and no doubt believes in the priority of water to the other elements the relic of a twilight antediluvian age which yet inhabits these bright american rivers with us yankees  there is something venerable in this melancholy and contemplative race of birds which may have trodden the earth while it was yet in a slimy and imperfect state  perchance their tracks too are still visible on the stones  it still lingers into our glaring summers bravely supporting its fate without sympathy from man as if it looked forward to some second advent of which he has no assurance  one wonders if by its patient study by rocks and sandy capes it has wrested the whole of her secret from nature yet  what a rich experience it must have gained standing on one leg and looking out from its dull eye so long on sunshine and rain moon and stars  what could it tell of stagnant pools and reeds and dank nightfogs  it would be worth the while to look closely into the eye which has been open and seeing at such hours and in such solitudes its dull yellowish greenish eye methinks my own soul must be a bright invisible green  i have seen these birds stand by the halfdozen together in the shallower water along the shore with their bills thrust into the mud at the bottom probing for food the whole head being concealed while the neck and body formed an arch above the water  cohass brook the outlet of massabesic pondwhich last is five or six miles distant and contains fifteen hundred acres being the largest body of fresh water in rockingham countycomes in near here from the east  rowing between manchester and bedford we passed at an early hour a ferry and some falls called goffs falls the indian cohasset where there is a small village and a handsome green islet in the middle of the stream from bedford and merrimack have been boated the bricks of which lowell is made  about twenty years before as they told us one moore of bedford having clay on his farm contracted to furnish eight millions of bricks to the founders of that city within two years  he fulfilled his contract in one year and since then bricks have been the principal export from these towns  the farmers found thus a market for their wood and when they had brought a load to the kilns they could cart a load of bricks to the shore and so make a profitable days work of it  thus all parties were benefited  it was worth the while to see the place where lowell was dug out  so likewise manchester is being built of bricks made still higher up the river at hooksett  there might be seen here on the bank of the merrimack near goffs falls in what is now the town of bedford famous for hops and for its fine domestic manufactures some graves of the aborigines  the land still bears this scar here and time is slowly crumbling the bones of a race  yet without fail every spring since they first fished and hunted here the brown thrasher has heralded the morning from a birch or alder spray and the undying race of reedbirds still rustles through the withering grass  but these bones rustle not  these mouldering elements are slowly preparing for another metamorphosis to serve new masters and what was the indians will erelong be the white mans sinew  we learned that bedford was not so famous for hops as formerly since the price is fluctuating and poles are now scarce  yet if the traveller goes back a few miles from the river the hopkilns will still excite his curiosity  there were few incidents in our voyage this forenoon though the river was now more rocky and the falls more frequent than before it was a pleasant change after rowing incessantly for many hours to lock ourselves through in some retired placefor commonly there was no lockman at handone sitting in the boat while the other sometimes with no little labor and heaveyoing opened and shut the gates waiting patiently to see the locks fill  we did not once use the wheels which we had provided taking advantage of the eddy we were sometimes floated up to the locks almost in the face of the falls and by the same cause any floating timber was carried round in a circle and repeatedly drawn into the rapids before it finally went down the stream these old gray structures with their quiet arms stretched over the river in the sun appeared like natural objects in the scenery and the kingfisher and sandpiper alighted on them as readily as on stakes or rocks  we rowed leisurely up the stream for several hours until the sun had got high in the sky our thoughts monotonously beating time to our oars  for outward variety there was only the river and the receding shores a vista continually opening behind and closing before us as we sat with our backs upstream and for inward such thoughts as the muses grudgingly lent us  we were always passing some low inviting shore or some overhanging bank on which however we never landed       such near aspects had we      of our lifes scenery  it might be seen by what tenure men held the earth  the smallest stream is mediterranean sea a smaller ocean creek within the land where men may steer by their farmbounds and cottagelights for my own part but for the geographers i should hardly have known how large a portion of our globe is water my life has chiefly passed within so deep a cove  yet i have sometimes ventured as far as to the mouth of my snug harbor  from an old ruined fort on staten island i have loved to watch all day some vessel whose name i had read in the morning through the telegraphglass when she first came upon the coast and her hull heaved up and glistened in the sun from the moment when the pilot and most adventurous newsboats met her past the hook and up the narrow channel of the wide outer bay till she was boarded by the healthofficer and took her station at quarantine or held on her unquestioned course to the wharves of new york  it was interesting too to watch the less adventurous newsman who made his assault as the vessel swept through the narrows defying plague and quarantine law and fastening his little cockboat to her huge side clambered up and disappeared in the cabin  and then i could imagine what momentous news was being imparted by the captain which no american ear had ever heard that asia africa europewere all sunk for which at length he pays the price and is seen descending the ships side with his bundle of newspapers but not where he first got up for these arrivers do not stand still to gossip and he hastes away with steady sweeps to dispose of his wares to the highest bidder and we shall erelong read something startlingby the latest arrivalby the good ship on sunday i beheld from some interior hill the long procession of vessels getting to sea reaching from the city wharves through the narrows and past the hook quite to the ocean stream far as the eye could reach with stately march and silken sails all counting on lucky voyages but each time some of the number no doubt destined to go to davys locker and never come on this coast again  and again in the evening of a pleasant day it was my amusement to count the sails in sight but as the setting sun continually brought more and more to light still farther in the horizon the last count always had the advantage till by the time the last rays streamed over the sea i had doubled and trebled my first number though i could no longer class them all under the several heads of ships barks brigs schooners and sloops but most were faint generic vessels only  and then the temperate twilight light perchance revealed the floating home of some sailor whose thoughts were already alienated from this american coast and directed towards the europe of our dreams  i have stood upon the same hilltop when a thundershower rolling down from the catskills and highlands passed over the island deluging the land and when it had suddenly left us in sunshine have seen it overtake successively with its huge shadow and dark descending wall of rain the vessels in the bay  their bright sails were suddenly drooping and dark like the sides of barns and they seemed to shrink before the storm while still far beyond them on the sea through this dark veil gleamed the sunny sails of those vessels which the storm had not yet reached  and at midnight when all around and overhead was darkness i have seen a field of trembling silvery light far out on the sea the reflection of the moonlight from the ocean as if beyond the precincts of our night where the moon traversed a cloudless heavenand sometimes a dark speck in its midst where some fortunate vessel was pursuing its happy voyage by night  but to us river sailors the sun never rose out of ocean waves but from some green coppice and went down behind some dark mountain line  we too were but dwellers on the shore like the bittern of the morning and our pursuit the wrecks of snails and cockles  nevertheless we were contented to know the better one fair particular shore        my life is like a stroll upon the beach           as near the oceans edge as i can go       my tardy steps its waves sometimes oerreach           sometimes i stay to let them overflow        my sole employment t is and scrupulous care           to place my gains beyond the reach of tides       each smoother pebble and each shell more rare           which ocean kindly to my hand confides        i have but few companions on the shore           they scorn the strand who sail upon the sea       yet oft i think the ocean theyve sailed oer           is deeper known upon the strand to me        the middle sea contains no crimson dulse           its deeper waves cast up no pearls to view       along the shore my hand is on its pulse           and i converse with many a shipwrecked crew  the small houses which were scattered along the river at intervals of a mile or more were commonly out of sight to us but sometimes when we rowed near the shore we heard the peevish note of a hen or some slight domestic sound which betrayed them  the lockmens houses were particularly well placed retired and high always at falls or rapids and commanding the pleasantest reaches of the riverfor it is generally wider and more lakelike just above a falland there they wait for boats these humble dwellings homely and sincere in which a hearth was still the essential part were more pleasing to our eyes than palaces or castles would have been  in the noon of these days as we have said we occasionally climbed the banks and approached these houses to get a glass of water and make acquaintance with their inhabitants  high in the leafy bank surrounded commonly by a small patch of corn and beans squashes and melons with sometimes a graceful hopyard on one side and some running vine over the windows they appeared like beehives set to gather honey for a summer  i have not read of any arcadian life which surpasses the actual luxury and serenity of these new england dwellings  for the outward gilding at least the age is golden enough  as you approach the sunny doorway awakening the echoes by your steps still no sound from these barracks of repose and you fear that the gentlest knock may seem rude to the oriental dreamers  the door is opened perchance by some yankeehindoo woman whose smallvoiced but sincere hospitality out of the bottomless depths of a quiet nature has travelled quite round to the opposite side and fears only to obtrude its kindness  you step over the whitescoured floor to the bright dresser lightly as if afraid to disturb the devotions of the householdfor oriental dynasties appear to have passed away since the dinnertable was last spread hereand thence to the frequented curb where you see your longforgotten unshaven face at the bottom in juxtaposition with newmade butter and the trout in the well  perhaps you would like some molasses and ginger suggests the faint noon voice  sometimes there sits the brother who follows the sea their representative man who knows only how far it is to the nearest port no more distances all the rest is sea and distant capespatting the dog or dandling the kitten in arms that were stretched by the cable and the oar pulling against boreas or the tradewinds  he looks up at the stranger half pleased half astonished with a mariners eye as if he were a dolphin within cast  if men will believe it sua si bona norint there are no more quiet tempes nor more poetic and arcadian lives than may be lived in these new england dwellings  we thought that the employment of their inhabitants by day would be to tend the flowers and herds and at night like the shepherds of old to cluster and give names to the stars from the river banks  we passed a large and densely wooded island this forenoon between shorts and griffiths falls the fairest which we had met with with a handsome grove of elms at its head  if it had been evening we should have been glad to camp there  not long after one or two more were passed  the boatmen told us that the current had recently made important changes here  an island always pleases my imagination even the smallest as a small continent and integral portion of the globe  i have a fancy for building my hut on one  even a bare grassy isle which i can see entirely over at a glance has some undefined and mysterious charm for me  there is commonly such a one at the junction of two rivers whose currents bring down and deposit their respective sands in the eddy at their confluence as it were the womb of a continent  by what a delicate and farstretched contribution every island is made  what an enterprise of nature thus to lay the foundations of and to build up the future continent of golden and silver sands and the ruins of forests with antlike industry  pindar gives the following account of the origin of thera whence in after times libyan cyrene was settled by battus  triton in the form of eurypylus presents a clod to euphemus one of the argonauts as they are about to return home                          he knew of our haste      and immediately seizing a clod      with his right hand strove to give it      as a chance strangers gift      nor did the hero disregard him but leaping on the shore      stretching hand to hand      received the mystic clod      but i hear it sinking from the deck      go with the sea brine      at evening accompanying the watery sea      often indeed i urged the careless      menials to guard it but their minds forgot      and now in this island the imperishable seed of spacious libya      is spilled before its hour  it is a beautiful fable also related by pindar how helius or the sun looked down into the sea one daywhen perchance his rays were first reflected from some increasing glittering sandbarand saw the fair and fruitful island of rhodes                  springing up from the bottom      capable of feeding many men and suitable for flocks  and at the nod of zeus               the island sprang from the watery      sea and the genial father of penetrating beams      ruler of firebreathing horses has it  the shifting islands who would not be willing that his house should be undermined by such a foe  the inhabitant of an island can tell what currents formed the land which he cultivates and his earth is still being created or destroyed  there before his door perchance still empties the stream which brought down the material of his farm ages before and is still bringing it down or washing it awaythe graceful gentle robber  not long after this we saw the piscataquoag or sparkling water emptying in on our left and heard the falls of amoskeag above large quantities of lumber as we read in the gazetteer were still annually floated down the piscataquoag to the merrimack and there are many fine mill privileges on it  just above the mouth of this river we passed the artificial falls where the canals of the manchester manufacturing company discharge themselves into the merrimack  they are striking enough to have a name and with the scenery of a bashpish would be visited from far and near  the water falls thirty or forty feet over seven or eight steep and narrow terraces of stone probably to break its force and is converted into one mass of foam  this canalwater did not seem to be the worse for the wear but foamed and fumed as purely and boomed as savagely and impressively as a mountain torrent and though it came from under a factory we saw a rainbow here  these are now the amoskeag falls removed a mile downstream  but we did not tarry to examine them minutely making haste to get past the village here collected and out of hearing of the hammer which was laying the foundation of another lowell on the banks  at the time of our voyage manchester was a village of about two thousand inhabitants where we landed for a moment to get some cool water and where an inhabitant told us that he was accustomed to go across the river into goffstown for his water  but now as i have been told and indeed have witnessed it contains fourteen thousand inhabitants  from a hill on the road between goffstown and hooksett four miles distant i have seen a thundershower pass over and the sun break out and shine on a city there where i had landed nine years before in the fields and there was waving the flag of its museum where the only perfect skeleton of a greenland or river whale in the united states was to be seen and i also read in its directory of a manchester athenaeum and gallery of the fine arts  according to the gazetteer the descent of amoskeag falls which are the most considerable in the merrimack is fiftyfour feet in half a mile  we locked ourselves through here with much ado surmounting the successive watery steps of this rivers staircase in the midst of a crowd of villagers jumping into the canal to their amusement to save our boat from upsetting and consuming much riverwater in our service  amoskeag or namaskeak is said to mean great fishingplace it was hereabouts that the sachem wannalancet resided  tradition says that his tribe when at war with the mohawks concealed their provisions in the cavities of the rocks in the upper part of these falls  the indians who hid their provisions in these holes and affirmed that god had cut them out for that purpose understood their origin and use better than the royal society who in their transactions in the last century speaking of these very holes declare that they seem plainly to be artificial  similar potholes may be seen at the stone flume on this river on the ottaway at bellows falls on the connecticut and in the limestone rock at shelburne falls on deerfield river in massachusetts and more or less generally about all falls  perhaps the most remarkable curiosity of this kind in new england is the wellknown basin on the pemigewasset one of the headwaters of this river twenty by thirty feet in extent and proportionably deep with a smooth and rounded brim and filled with a cold pellucid and greenish water  at amoskeag the river is divided into many separate torrents and trickling rills by the rocks and its volume is so much reduced by the drain of the canals that it does not fill its bed  there are many potholes here on a rocky island which the river washes over in high freshets  as at shelburne falls where i first observed them they are from one foot to four or five in diameter and as many in depth perfectly round and regular with smooth and gracefully curved brims like goblets  their origin is apparent to the most careless observer  a stone which the current has washed down meeting with obstacles revolves as on a pivot where it lies gradually sinking in the course of centuries deeper and deeper into the rock and in new freshets receiving the aid of fresh stones which are drawn into this trap and doomed to revolve there for an indefinite period doing sisyphuslike penance for stony sins until they either wear out or wear through the bottom of their prison or else are released by some revolution of nature  there lie the stones of various sizes from a pebble to a foot or two in diameter some of which have rested from their labor only since the spring and some higher up which have lain still and dry for ageswe noticed some here at least sixteen feet above the present level of the waterwhile others are still revolving and enjoy no respite at any season  in one instance at shelburne falls they have worn quite through the rock so that a portion of the river leaks through in anticipation of the fall  some of these potholes at amoskeag in a very hard brownstone had an oblong cylindrical stone of the same material loosely fitting them  one as much as fifteen feet deep and seven or eight in diameter which was worn quite through to the water had a huge rock of the same material smooth but of irregular form lodged in it  everywhere there were the rudiments or the wrecks of a dimple in the rock the rocky shells of whirlpools  as if by force of example and sympathy after so many lessons the rocks the hardest material had been endeavoring to whirl or flow into the forms of the most fluid  the finest workers in stone are not copper or steel tools but the gentle touches of air and water working at their leisure with a liberal allowance of time  not only have some of these basins been forming for countless ages but others exist which must have been completed in a former geological period  in deepening the pawtucket canal in 1822 the workmen came to ledges with potholes in them where probably was once the bed of the river and there are some we are told in the town of canaan in this state with the stones still in them on the height of land between the merrimack and connecticut and nearly a thousand feet above these rivers proving that the mountains and the rivers have changed places there lie the stones which completed their revolutions perhaps before thoughts began to revolve in the brain of man  the periods of hindoo and chinese history though they reach back to the time when the race of mortals is confounded with the race of gods are as nothing compared with the periods which these stones have inscribed  that which commenced a rock when time was young shall conclude a pebble in the unequal contest  with such expense of time and natural forces are our very pavingstones produced  they teach us lessons these dumb workers verily there are sermons in stones and books in the running streams in these very holes the indians hid their provisions but now there is no bread but only its old neighbor stones at the bottom  who knows how many races they have served thus  by as simple a law some accidental bylaw perchance our system itself was made ready for its inhabitants  these and such as these must be our antiquities for lack of human vestiges  the monuments of heroes and the temples of the gods which may once have stood on the banks of this river are now at any rate returned to dust and primitive soil  the murmur of unchronicled nations has died away along these shores and once more lowell and manchester are on the trail of the indian  the fact that romans once inhabited her reflects no little dignity on nature herself that from some particular hill the roman once looked out on the sea  she need not be ashamed of the vestiges of her children  how gladly the antiquary informs us that their vessels penetrated into this frith or up that river of some remote isle  their military monuments still remain on the hills and under the sod of the valleys  the oftrepeated roman story is written in still legible characters in every quarter of the old world and but today perchance a new coin is dug up whose inscription repeats and confirms their fame some judaea capta with a woman mourning under a palmtree with silent argument and demonstration confirms the pages of history     rome living was the worlds sole ornament     and dead is now the worlds sole monument                                           with her own weight down pressed now she lies     and by her heaps her hugeness testifies  if one doubts whether grecian valor and patriotism are not a fiction of the poets he may go to athens and see still upon the walls of the temple of minerva the circular marks made by the shields taken from the enemy in the persian war which were suspended there  we have not far to seek for living and unquestionable evidence  the very dust takes shape and confirms some story which we had read  as fuller said commenting on the zeal of camden a broken urn is a whole evidence or an old gate still surviving out of which the city is run out  when solon endeavored to prove that salamis had formerly belonged to the athenians and not to the megareans he caused the tombs to be opened and showed that the inhabitants of salamis turned the faces of their dead to the same side with the athenians but the megareans to the opposite side  there they were to be interrogated  some minds are as little logical or argumentative as nature they can offer no reason or guess but they exhibit the solemn and incontrovertible fact  if a historical question arises they cause the tombs to be opened  their silent and practical logic convinces the reason and the understanding at the same time  of such sort is always the only pertinent question and the only satisfactory reply  our own country furnishes antiquities as ancient and durable and as useful as any rocks at least as well covered with lichens and a soil which if it is virgin is but virgin mould the very dust of nature  what if we cannot read rome or greece etruria or carthage or egypt or babylon on these are our cliffs bare the lichen on the rocks is a rude and simple shield which beginning and imperfect nature suspended there  still hangs her wrinkled trophy  and here too the poets eye may still detect the brazen nails which fastened times inscriptions and if he has the gift decipher them by this clew  the walls that fence our fields as well as modern rome and not less the parthenon itself are all built of ruins  here may be heard the din of rivers and ancient winds which have long since lost their names sough through our woodsthe first faint sounds of spring older than the summer of athenian glory the titmouse lisping in the wood the jays scream and bluebirds warble and the hum of       bees that fly      about the laughing blossoms of sallowy  here is the gray dawn for antiquity and our tomorrows future should be at least paulopost to theirs which we have put behind us  there are the redmaple and birchen leaves old runes which are not yet deciphered catkins pinecones vines oakleaves and acorns the very things themselves and not their forms in stoneso much the more ancient and venerable  and even to the current summer there has come down tradition of a hoaryheaded master of all art who once filled every field and grove with statues and godlike architecture of every design which greece has lately copied whose ruins are now mingled with the dust and not one block remains upon another  the century sun and unwearied rain have wasted them till not one fragment from that quarry now exists and poets perchance will feign that gods sent down the material from heaven  what though the traveller tell us of the ruins of egypt are we so sick or idle that we must sacrifice our america and today to some mans illremembered and indolent story  carnac and luxor are but names or if their skeletons remain still more desert sand and at length a wave of the mediterranean sea are needed to wash away the filth that attaches to their grandeur  carnac carnac here is carnac for me  i behold the columns of a larger and purer temple       this is my carnac whose unmeasured dome      shelters the measuring art and measurers home      behold these flowers let us be up with time      not dreaming of three thousand years ago      erect ourselves and let those columns lie      not stoop to raise a foil against the sky      where is the spirit of that time but in      this present day perchance the present line      three thousand years ago are not agone      they are still lingering in this summer morn      and memnons mother sprightly greets us now      wearing her youthful radiance on her brow      if carnacs columns still stand on the plain      to enjoy our opportunities they remain  in these parts dwelt the famous sachem pasaconaway who was seen by gookin at pawtucket when he was about one hundred and twenty years old  he was reputed a wise man and a powwow and restrained his people from going to war with the english  they believed that he could make water burn rocks move and trees dance and metamorphose himself into a flaming man that in winter he could raise a green leaf out of the ashes of a dry one and produce a living snake from the skin of a dead one and many similar miracles in 1660 according to gookin at a great feast and dance he made his farewell speech to his people in which he said that as he was not likely to see them met together again he would leave them this word of advice to take heed how they quarrelled with their english neighbors for though they might do them much mischief at first it would prove the means of their own destruction  he himself he said had been as much an enemy to the english at their first coming as any and had used all his arts to destroy them or at least to prevent their settlement but could by no means effect it  gookin thought that he possibly might have such a kind of spirit upon him as was upon balaam who in xxiii  numbers 23 said surely there is no enchantment against jacob neither is there any divination against israel  his son wannalancet carefully followed his advice and when philips war broke out he withdrew his followers to penacook now concord in new hampshire from the scene of the war  on his return afterwards he visited the minister of chelmsford and as is stated in the history of that town wished to know whether chelmsford had suffered much during the war and being informed that it had not and that god should be thanked for it wannalancet replied me next  manchester was the residence of john stark a hero of two wars and survivor of a third and at his death the last but one of the american generals of the revolution  he was born in the adjoining town of londonderry then nutfield in 1728  as early as 1752 he was taken prisoner by the indians while hunting in the wilderness near bakers river he performed notable service as a captain of rangers in the french war commanded a regiment of the new hampshire militia at the battle of bunker hill and fought and won the battle of bennington in 1777  he was past service in the last war and died here in 1822 at the age of 94 his monument stands upon the second bank of the river about a mile and a half above the falls and commands a prospect several miles up and down the merrimack  it suggested how much more impressive in the landscape is the tomb of a hero than the dwellings of the inglorious living  who is most deada hero by whose monument you stand or his descendants of whom you have never heard  the graves of pasaconaway and wannalancet are marked by no monument on the bank of their native river  every town which we passed if we may believe the gazetteer had been the residence of some great man  but though we knocked at many doors and even made particular inquiries we could not find that there were any now living  under the head of litchfield we read    the hon  wyseman clagett closed his life in this town   according to another he was a classical scholar a good   lawyer a wit and a poet we saw his old gray house just   below great nesenkeag brookunder the head of merrimack   hon  mathew thornton one of the signers of the declaration   of american independence resided many years in this town his   house too we saw from the riverdr  jonathan gove a man   distinguished for his urbanity his talents and professional   skill resided in this town goffstown  he was one of the   oldest practitioners of medicine in the county  he was many   years an active member of the legislaturehon  robert   means who died jan 24 1823 at the age of 80 was for a long   period a resident in amherst  he was a native of ireland  in   1764 he came to this country where by his industry and   application to business he acquired a large property and   great respectwilliam stinson one of the first settlers of   dunbarton born in ireland came to londonderry with his   father  he was much respected and was a useful man  james   rogers was from ireland and father to major robert rogers  he   was shot in the woods being mistaken for a bearrev   matthew clark second minister of londonderry was a native of   ireland who had in early life been an officer in the army and   distinguished himself in the defence of the city of   londonderry when besieged by the army of king james ii  a   d  16889  he afterwards relinquished a military life for the   clerical profession  he possessed a strong mind marked by a   considerable degree of eccentricity  he died jan 25 1735   and was borne to the grave at his particular request by his   former companions in arms of whom there were a considerable   number among the early settlers of this town several of them   had been made free from taxes throughout the british dominions   by king william for their bravery in that memorable   siegecol  george reid and capt david mclary also   citizens of londonderry were distinguished and brave   officersmajor andrew mclary a native of this town   epsom fell at the battle of breeds hill many of these   heroes like the illustrious roman were ploughing when the   news of the massacre at lexington arrived and straightway left   their ploughs in the furrow and repaired to the scene of   action  some miles from where we now were there once stood a   guidepost on which were the words 3 miles to squire   macgaws  but generally speaking the land is now at any rate very barren of men and we doubt if there are as many hundreds as we read of  it may be that we stood too near  uncannunuc mountain in goffstown was visible from amoskeag five or six miles westward  it is the northeasternmost in the horizon which we see from our native town but seen from there is too ethereally blue to be the same which the like of us have ever climbed  its name is said to mean the two breasts there being two eminences some distance apart  the highest which is about fourteen hundred feet above the sea probably affords a more extensive view of the merrimack valley and the adjacent country than any other hill though it is somewhat obstructed by woods  only a few short reaches of the river are visible but you can trace its course far down stream by the sandy tracts on its banks  a little south of uncannunuc about sixty years ago as the story goes an old woman who went out to gather pennyroyal tript her foot in the bail of a small brass kettle in the dead grass and bushes  some say that flints and charcoal and some traces of a camp were also found  this kettle holding about four quarts is still preserved and used to dye thread in  it is supposed to have belonged to some old french or indian hunter who was killed in one of his hunting or scouting excursions and so never returned to look after his kettle  but we were most interested to hear of the pennyroyal it is soothing to be reminded that wild nature produces anything ready for the use of man  men know that something is good  one says that it is yellowdock another that it is bittersweet another that it is slipperyelm bark burdock catnip calamint elicampane thoroughwort or pennyroyal  a man may esteem himself happy when that which is his food is also his medicine there is no kind of herb but somebody or other says that it is good  i am very glad to hear it  it reminds me of the first chapter of genesis  but how should they know that it is good that is the mystery to me  i am always agreeably disappointed it is incredible that they should have found it out  since all things are good men fail at last to distinguish which is the bane and which the antidote  there are sure to be two prescriptions diametrically opposite  stuff a cold and starve a cold are but two ways  they are the two practices both always in full blast  yet you must take advice of the one school as if there was no other  in respect to religion and the healing art all nations are still in a state of barbarism  in the most civilized countries the priest is still but a powwow and the physician a great medicine  consider the deference which is everywhere paid to a doctors opinion  nothing more strikingly betrays the credulity of mankind than medicine  quackery is a thing universal and universally successful  in this case it becomes literally true that no imposition is too great for the credulity of men  priests and physicians should never look one another in the face  they have no common ground nor is there any to mediate between them  when the one comes the other goes they could not come together without laughter or a significant silence for the ones profession is a satire on the others and eithers success would be the others failure  it is wonderful that the physician should ever die and that the priest should ever live  why is it that the priest is never called to consult with the physician  is it because men believe practically that matter is independent of spirit  but what is quackery  it is commonly an attempt to cure the diseases of a man by addressing his body alone  there is need of a physician who shall minister to both soul and body at once that is to man  now he falls between two souls  after passing through the locks we had poled ourselves through the canal here about half a mile in length to the boatable part of the river  above amoskeag the river spreads out into a lake reaching a mile or two without a bend  there were many canalboats here bound up to hooksett about eight miles and as they were going up empty with a fair wind one boatman offered to take us in tow if we would wait  but when we came alongside we found that they meant to take us on board since otherwise we should clog their motions too much but as our boat was too heavy to be lifted aboard we pursued our way up the stream as before while the boatmen were at their dinner and came to anchor at length under some alders on the opposite shore where we could take our lunch  though far on one side every sound was wafted over to us from the opposite bank and from the harbor of the canal and we could see everything that passed  by and by came several canalboats at intervals of a quarter of a mile standing up to hooksett with a light breeze and one by one disappeared round a point above  with their broad sails set they moved slowly up the stream in the sluggish and fitful breeze like onewinged antediluvian birds and as if impelled by some mysterious countercurrent  it was a grand motion so slow and stately this standing out as the phrase is expressing the gradual and steady progress of a vessel as if it were by mere rectitude and disposition without shuffling  their sails which stood so still were like chips cast into the current of the air to show which way it set  at length the boat which we had spoken came along keeping the middle of the stream and when within speaking distance the steersman called out ironically to say that if we would come alongside now he would take us in tow but not heeding his taunt we still loitered in the shade till we had finished our lunch and when the last boat had disappeared round the point with flapping sail for the breeze had now sunk to a zephyr with our own sails set and plying our oars we shot rapidly up the stream in pursuit and as we glided close alongside while they were vainly invoking aeolus to their aid we returned their compliment by proposing if they would throw us a rope to take them in tow to which these merrimack sailors had no suitable answer ready  thus we gradually overtook and passed each boat in succession until we had the river to ourselves again  our course this afternoon was between manchester and goffstown                                 while we float here far from that tributary stream on whose banks our friends and kindred dwell our thoughts like the stars come out of their horizon still for there circulates a finer blood than lavoisier has discovered the laws ofthe blood not of kindred merely but of kindness whose pulse still beats at any distance and forever       true kindness is a pure divine affinity      not founded upon human consanguinity      it is a spirit not a blood relation      superior to family and station  after years of vain familiarity some distant gesture or unconscious behavior which we remember speaks to us with more emphasis than the wisest or kindest words  we are sometimes made aware of a kindness long passed and realize that there have been times when our friends thoughts of us were of so pure and lofty a character that they passed over us like the winds of heaven unnoticed when they treated us not as what we were but as what we aspired to be  there has just reached us it may be the nobleness of some such silent behavior not to be forgotten not to be remembered and we shudder to think how it fell on us cold though in some true but tardy hour we endeavor to wipe off these scores  in my experience persons when they are made the subject of conversation though with a friend are commonly the most prosaic and trivial of facts  the universe seems bankrupt as soon as we begin to discuss the character of individuals  our discourse all runs to slander and our limits grow narrower as we advance  how is it that we are impelled to treat our old friends so ill when we obtain new ones  the housekeeper says i never had any new crockery in my life but i began to break the old  i say let us speak of mushrooms and forest trees rather  yet we can sometimes afford to remember them in private       lately alas i knew a gentle boy      whose features all were cast in virtues mould      as one she had designed for beautys toy      but after manned him for her own stronghold       on every side he open was as day      that you might see no lack of strength within      for walls and ports do only serve alway      for a pretence to feebleness and sin       say not that caesar was victorious      with toil and strife who stormed the house of fame      in other sense this youth was glorious      himself a kingdom wheresoeer he came       no strength went out to get him victory      when all was income of its own accord      for where he went none other was to see      but all were parcel of their noble lord       he forayed like the subtile haze of summer      that stilly shows fresh landscapes to our eyes      and revolutions works without a murmur      or rustling of a leaf beneath the skies       so was i taken unawares by this      i quite forgot my homage to confess      yet now am forced to know though hard it is      i might have loved him had i loved him less       each moment as we nearer drew to each      a stern respect withheld us farther yet      so that we seemed beyond each others reach      and less acquainted than when first we met       we two were one while we did sympathize      so could we not the simplest bargain drive      and what avails it now that we are wise      if absence doth this doubleness contrive       eternity may not the chance repeat      but i must tread my single way alone      in sad remembrance that we once did meet      and know that bliss irrevocably gone       the spheres henceforth my elegy shall sing      for elegy has other subject none      each strain of music in my ears shall ring      knell of departure from that other one       make haste and celebrate my tragedy      with fitting strain resound ye woods and fields      sorrow is dearer in such case to me      than all the joys other occasion yields                               ist then too late the damage to repair      distance forsooth from my weak grasp hath reft      the empty husk and clutched the useless tare      but in my hands the wheat and kernel left       if i but love that virtue which he is      though it be scented in the morning air      still shall we be truest acquaintances      nor mortals know a sympathy more rare  friendship is evanescent in every mans experience and remembered like heat lightning in past summers  fair and flitting like a summer cloudthere is always some vapor in the air no matter how long the drought there are even april showers  surely from time to time for its vestiges never depart it floats through our atmosphere  it takes place like vegetation in so many materials because there is such a law but always without permanent form though ancient and familiar as the sun and moon and as sure to come again  the heart is forever inexperienced  they silently gather as by magic these never failing never quite deceiving visions like the bright and fleecy clouds in the calmest and clearest days  the friend is some fair floating isle of palms eluding the mariner in pacific seas  many are the dangers to be encountered equinoctial gales and coral reefs ere he may sail before the constant trades  but who would not sail through mutiny and storm even over atlantic waves to reach the fabulous retreating shores of some continent man  the imagination still clings to the faintest tradition of                    the atlantides       the smothered streams of love which flow      more bright than phlegethon more low      island us ever like the sea      in an atlantic mystery      our fabled shores none ever reach      no mariner has found our beach      scarcely our mirage now is seen      and neighboring waves with floating green      yet still the oldest charts contain      some dotted outline of our main      in ancient times midsummer days      unto the western islands gaze      to teneriffe and the azores      have shown our faint and cloudlike shores       but sink not yet ye desolate isles      anon your coast with commerce smiles      and richer freights yell furnish far      than africa or malabar      be fair be fertile evermore      ye rumored but untrodden shore      princes and monarchs will contend      who first unto your land shall send      and pawn the jewels of the crown      to call your distant soil their own  columbus has sailed westward of these isles by the mariners compass but neither he nor his successors have found them  we are no nearer than plato was  the earnest seeker and hopeful discoverer of this new world always haunts the outskirts of his time and walks through the densest crowd uninterrupted and as it were in a straight line        sea and land are but his neighbors       and companions in his labors       who on the oceans verge and firm lands end       doth long and truly seek his friend       many men dwell far inland       but he alone sits on the strand       whether he ponders men or books       always still he seaward looks       marine news he ever reads       and the slightest glances heeds       feels the sea breeze on his cheek       at each word the landsmen speak       in every companions eye       a sailing vessel doth descry       in the oceans sullen roar       from some distant port he hears       of wrecks upon a distant shore       and the ventures of past years  who does not walk on the plain as amid the columns of tadmore of the desert  there is on the earth no institution which friendship has established it is not taught by any religion no scripture contains its maxims  it has no temple nor even a solitary column  there goes a rumor that the earth is inhabited but the shipwrecked mariner has not seen a footprint on the shore  the hunter has found only fragments of pottery and the monuments of inhabitants  however our fates at least are social  our courses do not diverge but as the web of destiny is woven it is fulled and we are cast more and more into the centre  men naturally though feebly seek this alliance and their actions faintly foretell it  we are inclined to lay the chief stress on likeness and not on difference and in foreign bodies we admit that there are many degrees of warmth below blood heat but none of cold above it  mencius says if one loses a fowl or a dog he knows well how to seek them again if one loses the sentiments of his heart he does not know how to seek them again        the duties of practical philosophy consist only in seeking after those sentiments of the heart which we have lost that is all   one or two persons come to my house from time to time there being proposed to them the faint possibility of intercourse they are as full as they are silent and wait for my plectrum to stir the strings of their lyre  if they could ever come to the length of a sentence or hear one on that ground they are dreaming of  they speak faintly and do not obtrude themselves they have heard some news which none not even they themselves can impart  it is a wealth they can bear about them which can be expended in various ways  what came they out to seek  no word is oftener on the lips of men than friendship and indeed no thought is more familiar to their aspirations  all men are dreaming of it and its drama which is always a tragedy is enacted daily  it is the secret of the universe  you may thread the town you may wander the country and none shall ever speak of it yet thought is everywhere busy about it and the idea of what is possible in this respect affects our behavior toward all new men and women and a great many old ones  nevertheless i can remember only two or three essays on this subject in all literature  no wonder that the mythology and arabian nights and shakespeare and scotts novels entertain uswe are poets and fablers and dramatists and novelists ourselves  we are continually acting a part in a more interesting drama than any written  we are dreaming that our friends are our friends  and that we are our friends friends  our actual friends are but distant relations of those to whom we are pledged  we never exchange more than three words with a friend in our lives on that level to which our thoughts and feelings almost habitually rise one goes forth prepared to say sweet friends and the salutation is damn your eyes  but never mind faint heart never won true friend  o my friend may it come to pass once that when you are my friend i may be yours  of what use the friendliest dispositions even if there are no hours given to friendship if it is forever postponed to unimportant duties and relations  friendship is first friendship last  but it is equally impossible to forget our friends and to make them answer to our ideal  when they say farewell then indeed we begin to keep them company  how often we find ourselves turning our backs on our actual friends that we may go and meet their ideal cousins  i would that i were worthy to be any mans friend  what is commonly honored with the name of friendship is no very profound or powerful instinct  men do not after all love their friends greatly  i do not often see the farmers made seers and wise to the verge of insanity by their friendship for one another  they are not often transfigured and translated by love in each others presence  i do not observe them purified refined and elevated by the love of a man  if one abates a little the price of his wood or gives a neighbor his vote at townmeeting or a barrel of apples or lends him his wagon frequently it is esteemed a rare instance of friendship  nor do the farmers wives lead lives consecrated to friendship  i do not see the pair of farmer friends of either sex prepared to stand against the world  there are only two or three couples in history  to say that a man is your friend means commonly no more than this that he is not your enemy  most contemplate only what would be the accidental and trifling advantages of friendship as that the friend can assist in time of need by his substance or his influence or his counsel but he who foresees such advantages in this relation proves himself blind to its real advantage or indeed wholly inexperienced in the relation itself such services are particular and menial compared with the perpetual and allembracing service which it is  even the utmost goodwill and harmony and practical kindness are not sufficient for friendship for friends do not live in harmony merely as some say but in melody  we do not wish for friends to feed and clothe our bodiesneighbors are kind enough for thatbut to do the like office to our spirits  for this few are rich enough however well disposed they may be  for the most part we stupidly confound one man with another  the dull distinguish only races or nations or at most classes but the wise man individuals to his friend a mans peculiar character appears in every feature and in every action and it is thus drawn out and improved by him  think of the importance of friendship in the education of men       he that hath love and judgment too      sees more than any other doe  it will make a man honest it will make him a hero it will make him a saint  it is the state of the just dealing with the just the magnanimous with the magnanimous the sincere with the sincere man with man  and it is well said by another poet       why love among the virtues is not known      is that love is them all contract in one  all the abuses which are the object of reform with the philanthropist  the statesman and the housekeeper are unconsciously amended in the intercourse of friends  a friend is one who incessantly pays us the compliment of expecting from us all the virtues and who can appreciate them in us  it takes two to speak the truthone to speak and another to hear  how can one treat with magnanimity mere wood and stone  if we dealt only with the false and dishonest we should at last forget how to speak truth  only lovers know the value and magnanimity of truth while traders prize a cheap honesty and neighbors and acquaintance a cheap civility  in our daily intercourse with men our nobler faculties are dormant and suffered to rust  none will pay us the compliment to expect nobleness from us  though we have gold to give they demand only copper  we ask our neighbor to suffer himself to be dealt with truly sincerely nobly but he answers no by his deafness  he does not even hear this prayer  he says practically i will be content if you treat me as no better than i should be as deceitful mean dishonest and selfish  for the most part we are contented so to deal and to be dealt with and we do not think that for the mass of men there is any truer and nobler relation possible  a man may have good neighbors so called and acquaintances and even companions wife parents brothers sisters children who meet himself and one another on this ground only  the state does not demand justice of its members but thinks that it succeeds very well with the least degree of it hardly more than rogues practise and so do the neighborhood and the family  what is commonly called friendship even is only a little more honor among rogues  but sometimes we are said to love another that is to stand in a true relation to him so that we give the best to and receive the best from him  between whom there is hearty truth there is love and in proportion to our truthfulness and confidence in one another our lives are divine and miraculous and answer to our ideal  there are passages of affection in our intercourse with mortal men and women such as no prophecy had taught us to expect which transcend our earthly life and anticipate heaven for us  what is this love that may come right into the middle of a prosaic goffstown day equal to any of the gods that discovers a new world fair and fresh and eternal occupying the place of the old one when to the common eye a dust has settled on the universe which world cannot else be reached and does not exist what other words we may almost ask are memorable and worthy to be repeated than those which love has inspired  it is wonderful that they were ever uttered  they are few and rare indeed but like a strain of music they are incessantly repeated and modulated by the memory  all other words crumble off with the stucco which overlies the heart  we should not dare to repeat these now aloud  we are not competent to hear them at all times  the books for young people say a great deal about the selection of friends it is because they really have nothing to say about friends  they mean associates and confidants merely  know that the contrariety of foe and friend proceeds from god friendship takes place between those who have an affinity for one another and is a perfectly natural and inevitable result  no professions nor advances will avail  even speech at first necessarily has nothing to do with it but it follows after silence as the buds in the graft do not put forth into leaves till long after the graft has taken  it is a drama in which the parties have no part to act  we are all mussulmen and fatalists in this respect  impatient and uncertain lovers think that they must say or do something kind whenever they meet they must never be cold  but they who are friends do not do what they think they must but what they must  even their friendship is to some extent but a sublime phenomenon to them  the true and not despairing friend will address his friend in some such terms as these  i never asked thy leave to let me love theei have a right  i love thee not as something private and personal which is your own but as something universal and worthy of love which i have found  o how i think of you  you are purely good you are infinitely good  i can trust you forever  i did not think that humanity was so rich  give me an opportunity to live  you are the fact in a fictionyou are the truth more strange and admirable than fiction  consent only to be what you are  i alone will never stand in your way  this is what i would liketo be as intimate with you as our spirits are intimaterespecting you as i respect my ideal never to profane one another by word or action even by a thought  between us if necessary let there be no acquaintance  i have discovered you how can you be concealed from me   the friend asks no return but that his friend will religiously accept and wear and not disgrace his apotheosis of him  they cherish each others hopes  they are kind to each others dreams  though the poet says tis the preeminence of friendship to impute excellence yet we can never praise our friend nor esteem him praiseworthy nor let him think that he can please us by any behavior or ever treat us well enough  that kindness which has so good a reputation elsewhere can least of all consist with this relation and no such affront can be offered to a friend as a conscious goodwill a friendliness which is not a necessity of the friends nature  the sexes are naturally most strongly attracted to one another by constant constitutional differences and are most commonly and surely the complements of each other  how natural and easy it is for man to secure the attention of woman to what interests himself  men and women of equal culture thrown together are sure to be of a certain value to one another more than men to men  there exists already a natural disinterestedness and liberality in such society and i think that any man will more confidently carry his favorite books to read to some circle of intelligent women than to one of his own sex  the visit of man to man is wont to be an interruption but the sexes naturally expect one another  yet friendship is no respecter of sex and perhaps it is more rare between the sexes than between two of the same sex  friendship is at any rate a relation of perfect equality  it cannot well spare any outward sign of equal obligation and advantage  the nobleman can never have a friend among his retainers nor the king among his subjects  not that the parties to it are in all respects equal but they are equal in all that respects or affects their friendship  the ones love is exactly balanced and represented by the others  persons are only the vessels which contain the nectar and the hydrostatic paradox is the symbol of loves law  it finds its level and rises to its fountainhead in all breasts and its slenderest column balances the ocean       and love as well the shepherd can      as can the mighty nobleman  the one sex is not in this respect more tender than the other a heros love is as delicate as a maidens  confucius said never contract friendship with a man who is not better than thyself it is the merit and preservation of friendship that it takes place on a level higher than the actual characters of the parties would seem to warrant  the rays of light come to us in such a curve that every man whom we meet appears to be taller than he actually is  such foundation has civility  my friend is that one whom i can associate with my choicest thought  i always assign to him a nobler employment in my absence than i ever find him engaged in and i imagine that the hours which he devotes to me were snatched from a higher society  the sorest insult which i ever received from a friend was when he behaved with the license which only long and cheap acquaintance allows to ones faults in my presence without shame and still addressed me in friendly accents  beware lest thy friend learn at last to tolerate one frailty of thine and so an obstacle be raised to the progress of thy love  there are times when we have had enough even of our friends when we begin inevitably to profane one another and must withdraw religiously into solitude and silence the better to prepare ourselves for a loftier intimacy  silence is the ambrosial night in the intercourse of friends in which their sincerity is recruited and takes deeper root  friendship is never established as an understood relation  do you demand that i be less your friend that you may know it  yet what right have i to think that another cherishes so rare a sentiment for me  it is a miracle which requires constant proofs  it is an exercise of the purest imagination and the rarest faith  it says by a silent but eloquent behaviori will be so related to thee as thou canst imagine even so thou mayest believe  i will spend truthall my wealth on theeand the friend responds silently through his nature and life and treats his friend with the same divine courtesy  he knows us literally through thick and thin  he never asks for a sign of love but can distinguish it by the features which it naturally wears  we never need to stand upon ceremony with him with regard to his visits  wait not till i invite thee but observe that i am glad to see thee when thou comest  it would be paying too dear for thy visit to ask for it  where my friend lives there are all riches and every attraction and no slight obstacle can keep me from him  let me never have to tell thee what i have not to tell  let our intercourse be wholly above ourselves and draw us up to it  the language of friendship is not words but meanings  it is an intelligence above language  one imagines endless conversations with his friend in which the tongue shall be loosed and thoughts be spoken without hesitancy or end but the experience is commonly far otherwise  acquaintances may come and go and have a word ready for every occasion but what puny word shall he utter whose very breath is thought and meaning  suppose you go to bid farewell to your friend who is setting out on a journey what other outward sign do you know than to shake his hand  have you any palaver ready for him then any box of salve to commit to his pocket  any particular message to send by him  any statement which you had forgotten to makeas if you could forget anythingno it is much that you take his hand and say farewell that you could easily omit so far custom has prevailed  it is even painful if he is to go that he should linger so long  if he must go let him go quickly  have you any last words  alas it is only the word of words which you have so long sought and found not you have not a first word yet there are few even whom i should venture to call earnestly by their most proper names  a name pronounced is the recognition of the individual to whom it belongs  he who can pronounce my name aright he can call me and is entitled to my love and service yet reserve is the freedom and abandonment of lovers  it is the reserve of what is hostile or indifferent in their natures to give place to what is kindred and harmonious  the violence of love is as much to be dreaded as that of hate when it is durable it is serene and equable  even its famous pains begin only with the ebb of love for few are indeed lovers though all would fain be  it is one proof of a mans fitness for friendship that he is able to do without that which is cheap and passionate  a true friendship is as wise as it is tender  the parties to it yield implicitly to the guidance of their love and know no other law nor kindness  it is not extravagant and insane but what it says is something established henceforth and will bear to be stereotyped  it is a truer truth it is better and fairer news and no time will ever shame it or prove it false  this is a plant which thrives best in a temperate zone where summer and winter alternate with one another  the friend is a necessarius and meets his friend on homely ground not on carpets and cushions but on the ground and on rocks they will sit obeying the natural and primitive laws  they will meet without any outcry and part without loud sorrow  their relation implies such qualities as the warrior prizes for it takes a valor to open the hearts of men as well as the gates of castles it is not an idle sympathy and mutual consolation merely but a heroic sympathy of aspiration and endeavor       when manhood shall be matched so        that fear can take no place      then weary works make warriors        each other to embrace  the friendship which wawatam testified for henry the furtrader as described in the latters adventures so almost bare and leafless yet not blossomless nor fruitless is remembered with satisfaction and security  the stern imperturbable warrior after fasting solitude and mortification of body comes to the white mans lodge and affirms that he is the white brother whom he saw in his dream and adopts him henceforth  he buries the hatchet as it regards his friend and they hunt and feast and make maplesugar together  metals unite from fluxility birds and beasts from motives of convenience fools from fear and stupidity and just men at sight  if wawatam would taste the white mans milk with his tribe or take his bowl of human broth made of the traders fellowcountrymen he first finds a place of safety for his friend whom he has rescued from a similar fate  at length after a long winter of undisturbed and happy intercourse in the family of the chieftain in the wilderness hunting and fishing they return in the spring to michilimackinac to dispose of their furs and it becomes necessary for wawatam to take leave of his friend at the isle aux outardes when the latter to avoid his enemies proceeded to the sault de sainte marie supposing that they were to be separated for a short time only  we now exchanged farewells says henry with an emotion entirely reciprocal  i did not quit the lodge without the most grateful sense of the many acts of goodness which i had experienced in it nor without the sincerest respect for the virtues which i had witnessed among its members  all the family accompanied me to the beach and the canoe had no sooner put off than wawatam commenced an address to the kichi manito beseeching him to take care of me his brother till we should next meet  we had proceeded to too great a distance to allow of our hearing his voice before wawatam had ceased to offer up his prayers we never hear of him again  friendship is not so kind as is imagined it has not much human blood in it but consists with a certain disregard for men and their erections the christian duties and humanities while it purifies the air like electricity  there may be the sternest tragedy in the relation of two more than usually innocent and true to their highest instincts  we may call it an essentially heathenish intercourse free and irresponsible in its nature and practising all the virtues gratuitously  it is not the highest sympathy merely but a pure and lofty society a fragmentary and godlike intercourse of ancient date still kept up at intervals which remembering itself does not hesitate to disregard the humbler rights and duties of humanity  it requires immaculate and godlike qualities fullgrown and exists at all only by condescension and anticipation of the remotest future  we love nothing which is merely good and not fair if such a thing is possible  nature puts some kind of blossom before every fruit not simply a calyx behind it  when the friend comes out of his heathenism and superstition and breaks his idols being converted by the precepts of a newer testament when he forgets his mythology and treats his friend like a christian or as he can afford then friendship ceases to be friendship and becomes charity that principle which established the almshouse is now beginning with its charity at home and establishing an almshouse and pauper relations there  as for the number which this society admits it is at any rate to be begun with one the noblest and greatest that we know and whether the world will ever carry it further whether as chaucer affirms       there be mo sterres in the skie than a pair  remains to be proved       and certaine he is well begone      among a thousand that findeth one  we shall not surrender ourselves heartily to any while we are conscious that another is more deserving of our love  yet friendship does not stand for numbers the friend does not count his friends on his fingers they are not numerable  the more there are included by this bond if they are indeed included the rarer and diviner the quality of the love that binds them  i am ready to believe that as private and intimate a relation may exist by which three are embraced as between two  indeed we cannot have too many friends the virtue which we appreciate we to some extent appropriate so that thus we are made at last more fit for every relation of life  a base friendship is of a narrowing and exclusive tendency but a noble one is not exclusive its very superfluity and dispersed love is the humanity which sweetens society and sympathizes with foreign nations for though its foundations are private it is in effect a public affair and a public advantage and the friend more than the father of a family deserves well of the state  the only danger in friendship is that it will end  it is a delicate plant though a native  the least unworthiness even if it be unknown to ones self vitiates it  let the friend know that those faults which he observes in his friend his own faults attract  there is no rule more invariable than that we are paid for our suspicions by finding what we suspected  by our narrowness and prejudices we say i will have so much and such of you my friend no more  perhaps there are none charitable none disinterested none wise noble and heroic enough for a true and lasting friendship  i sometimes hear my friends complain finely that i do not appreciate their fineness  i shall not tell them whether i do or not  as if they expected a vote of thanks for every fine thing which they uttered or did  who knows but it was finely appreciated  it may be that your silence was the finest thing of the two  there are some things which a man never speaks of which are much finer kept silent about  to the highest communications we only lend a silent ear  our finest relations are not simply kept silent about but buried under a positive depth of silence never to be revealed  it may be that we are not even yet acquainted  in human intercourse the tragedy begins not when there is misunderstanding about words but when silence is not understood  then there can never be an explanation  what avails it that another loves you if he does not understand you such love is a curse  what sort of companions are they who are presuming always that their silence is more expressive than yours  how foolish and inconsiderate and unjust to conduct as if you were the only party aggrieved  has not your friend always equal ground of complaint  no doubt my friends sometimes speak to me in vain but they do not know what things i hear which they are not aware that they have spoken  i know that i have frequently disappointed them by not giving them words when they expected them or such as they expected  whenever i see my friend i speak to him but the expecter the man with the ears is not he  they will complain too that you are hard  o ye that would have the cocoanut wrong side outwards when next i weep i will let you know  they ask for words and deeds when a true relation is word and deed  if they know not of these things how can they be informed  we often forbear to confess our feelings not from pride but for fear that we could not continue to love the one who required us to give such proof of our affection   i know a woman who possesses a restless and intelligent mind interested in her own culture and earnest to enjoy the highest possible advantages and i meet her with pleasure as a natural person who not a little provokes me and i suppose is stimulated in turn by myself  yet our acquaintance plainly does not attain to that degree of confidence and sentiment which women which all in fact covet  i am glad to help her as i am helped by her i like very well to know her with a sort of strangers privilege and hesitate to visit her often like her other friends  my nature pauses here i do not well know why  perhaps she does not make the highest demand on me a religious demand some with whose prejudices or peculiar bias i have no sympathy yet inspire me with confidence and i trust that they confide in me also as a religious heathen at leasta good greek  i too have principles as well founded as their own  if this person could conceive that without wilfulness i associate with her as far as our destinies are coincident as far as our good geniuses permit and still value such intercourse it would be a grateful assurance to me  i feel as if i appeared careless indifferent and without principle to her not expecting more and yet not content with less  if she could know that i make an infinite demand on myself as well as on all others she would see that this true though incomplete intercourse is infinitely better than a more unreserved but falsely grounded one without the principle of growth in it  for a companion i require one who will make an equal demand on me with my own genius  such a one will always be rightly tolerant  it is suicide and corrupts good manners to welcome any less than this  i value and trust those who love and praise my aspiration rather than my performance  if you would not stop to look at me but look whither i am looking and farther then my education could not dispense with your company       my love must be as free         as is the eagles wing      hovering oer land and sea         and everything       i must not dim my eye         in thy saloon      i must not leave my sky         and nightly moon       be not the fowlers net         which stays my flight      and craftily is set         tallure the sight       but be the favoring gale         that bears me on      and still doth fill my sail         when thou art gone       i cannot leave my sky         for thy caprice      true love would soar as high         as heaven is       the eagle would not brook         her mate thus won      who trained his eye to look         beneath the sun  few things are more difficult than to help a friend in matters which do not require the aid of friendship but only a cheap and trivial service if your friendship wants the basis of a thorough practical acquaintance  i stand in the friendliest relation on social and spiritual grounds to one who does not perceive what practical skill i have but when he seeks my assistance in such matters is wholly ignorant of that one with whom he deals does not use my skill which in such matters is much greater than his but only my hands  i know another who on the contrary is remarkable for his discrimination in this respect who knows how to make use of the talents of others when he does not possess the same knows when not to look after or oversee and stops short at his man  it is a rare pleasure to serve him which all laborers know  i am not a little pained by the other kind of treatment it is as if after the friendliest and most ennobling intercourse your friend should use you as a hammer and drive a nail with your head all in good faith notwithstanding that you are a tolerable carpenter as well as his good friend and would use a hammer cheerfully in his service  this want of perception is a defect which all the virtues of the heart cannot supply       the good how can we trust      only the wise are just      the good we use      the wise we cannot choose      these there are none above      the good they know and love      but are not known again      by those of lesser ken      they do not charm us with their eyes      but they transfix with their advice      no partial sympathy they feel      with private woe or private weal      but with the universe joy and sigh      whose knowledge is their sympathy  confucius said to contract ties of friendship with any one is to contract friendship with his virtue  there ought not to be any other motive in friendship  but men wish us to contract friendship with their vice also  i have a friend who wishes me to see that to be right which i know to be wrong  but if friendship is to rob me of my eyes if it is to darken the day i will have none of it  it should be expansive and inconceivably liberalizing in its effects  true friendship can afford true knowledge  it does not depend on darkness and ignorance  a want of discernment cannot be an ingredient in it  if i can see my friends virtues more distinctly than anothers his faults too are made more conspicuous by contrast  we have not so good a right to hate any as our friend  faults are not the less faults because they are invariably balanced by corresponding virtues and for a fault there is no excuse though it may appear greater than it is in many ways  i have never known one who could bear criticism who could not be flattered who would not bribe his judge or was content that the truth should be loved always better than himself  if two travellers would go their way harmoniously together the one must take as true and just a view of things as the other else their path will not be strewn with roses  yet you can travel profitably and pleasantly even with a blind man if he practises common courtesy and when you converse about the scenery will remember that he is blind but that you can see and you will not forget that his sense of hearing is probably quickened by his want of sight  otherwise you will not long keep company  a blind man and a man in whose eyes there was no defect were walking together when they came to the edge of a precipice  take care  my friend said the latter here is a steep precipice go no farther this wayi know better said the other and stepped off  it is impossible to say all that we think even to our truest friend  we may bid him farewell forever sooner than complain for our complaint is too well grounded to be uttered  there is not so good an understanding between any two but the exposure by the one of a serious fault in the other will produce a misunderstanding in proportion to its heinousness  the constitutional differences which always exist and are obstacles to a perfect friendship are forever a forbidden theme to the lips of friends  they advise by their whole behavior  nothing can reconcile them but love  they are fatally late when they undertake to explain and treat with one another like foes  who will take an apology for a friend  they must apologize like dew and frost which are off again with the sun and which all men know in their hearts to be beneficent  the necessity itself for explanationwhat explanation will atone for that  true love does not quarrel for slight reasons such mistakes as mutual acquaintances can explain away but alas however slight the apparent cause only for adequate and fatal and everlasting reasons which can never be set aside  its quarrel if there is any is ever recurring notwithstanding the beams of affection which invariably come to gild its tears as the rainbow however beautiful and unerring a sign does not promise fair weather forever but only for a season  i have known two or three persons pretty well and yet i have never known advice to be of use but in trivial and transient matters  one may know what another does not but the utmost kindness cannot impart what is requisite to make the advice useful  we must accept or refuse one another as we are  i could tame a hyena more easily than my friend  he is a material which no tool of mine will work  a naked savage will fell an oak with a firebrand and wear a hatchet out of a rock by friction but i cannot hew the smallest chip out of the character of my friend either to beautify or deform it  the lover learns at last that there is no person quite transparent and trustworthy but every one has a devil in him that is capable of any crime in the long run  yet as an oriental philosopher has said although friendship between good men is interrupted their principles remain unaltered  the stalk of the lotus may be broken and the fibres remain connected   ignorance and bungling with love are better than wisdom and skill without  there may be courtesy there may be even temper and wit and talent and sparkling conversation there may be goodwill evenand yet the humanest and divinest faculties pine for exercise  our life without love is like coke and ashes  men may be pure as alabaster and parian marble elegant as a tuscan villa sublime as niagara and yet if there is no milk mingled with the wine at their entertainments better is the hospitality of goths and vandals  my friend is not of some other race or family of men but flesh of my flesh bone of my bone  he is my real brother  i see his nature groping yonder so like mine  we do not live far apart have not the fates associated us in many ways  it says in the vishnu purana seven paces together is sufficient for the friendship of the virtuous but thou and i have dwelt together is it of no significance that we have so long partaken of the same loaf drank at the same fountain breathed the same air summer and winter felt the same heat and cold that the same fruits have been pleased to refresh us both and we have never had a thought of different fibre the one from the other        nature doth have her dawn each day       but mine are far between       content i cry for sooth to say       mine brightest are i ween        for when my sun doth deign to rise       though it be her noontide       her fairest field in shadow lies       nor can my light abide        sometimes i bask me in her day       conversing with my mate       but if we interchange one ray       forthwith her heats abate        through his discourse i climb and see       as from some eastern hill       a brighter morrow rise to me       than lieth in her skill        as t were two summer days in one       two sundays come together       our rays united make one sun       with fairest summer weather  as surely as the sunset in my latest november shall translate me to the ethereal world and remind me of the ruddy morning of youth as surely as the last strain of music which falls on my decaying ear shall make age to be forgotten or in short the manifold influences of nature survive during the term of our natural life so surely my friend shall forever be my friend and reflect a ray of god to me and time shall foster and adorn and consecrate our friendship no less than the ruins of temples  as i love nature as i love singing birds and gleaming stubble and flowing rivers and morning and evening and summer and winter i love thee my friend   but all that can be said of friendship is like botany to flowers  how can the understanding take account of its friendliness  even the death of friends will inspire us as much as their lives they will leave consolation to the mourners as the rich leave money to defray the expenses of their funerals and their memories will be incrusted over with sublime and pleasing thoughts as monuments of other men are overgrown with moss for our friends have no place in the graveyard  this to our cisalpine and cisatlantic friends   also this other word of entreaty and advice to the large and respectable nation of acquaintances beyond the mountainsgreeting  my most serene and irresponsible neighbors let us see that we have the whole advantage of each other we will be useful at least if not admirable to one another  i know that the mountains which separate us are high and covered with perpetual snow but despair not  improve the serene winter weather to scale them  if need be soften the rocks with vinegar  for here lie the verdant plains of italy ready to receive you  nor shall i be slow on my side to penetrate to your provence  strike then boldly at head or heart or any vital part  depend upon it the timber is well seasoned and tough and will bear rough usage and if it should crack there is plenty more where it came from  i am no piece of crockery that cannot be jostled against my neighbor without danger of being broken by the collision and must needs ring false and jarringly to the end of my days when once i am cracked but rather one of the oldfashioned wooden trenchers which one while stands at the head of the table and at another is a milkingstool and at another a seat for children and finally goes down to its grave not unadorned with honorable scars and does not die till it is worn out  nothing can shock a brave man but dulness  think how many rebuffs every man has experienced in his day perhaps has fallen into a horsepond eaten freshwater clams or worn one shirt for a week without washing  indeed you cannot receive a shock unless you have an electric affinity for that which shocks you  use me then for i am useful in my way and stand as one of many petitioners from toadstool and henbane up to dahlia and violet supplicating to be put to my use if by any means ye may find me serviceable whether for a medicated drink or bath as balm and lavender or for fragrance as verbena and geranium or for sight as cactus or for thoughts as pansy  these humbler at least if not those higher uses  ah my dear strangers and enemies i would not forget you  i can well afford to welcome you  let me subscribe myself yours ever and trulyyour much obliged servant  we have nothing to fear from our foes god keeps a standing army for that service but we have no ally against our friends those ruthless vandals   once more to one and all       friends romans countrymen and lovers       let such pure hate still underprop      our love that we may be      each others conscience      and have our sympathy      mainly from thence       well one another treat like gods      and all the faith we have      in virtue and in truth bestow      on either and suspicion leave      to gods below       two solitary stars      unmeasured systems far      between us roll      but by our conscious light we are      determined to one pole       what need confound the sphere      love can afford to wait      for it no hours too late      that witnesseth one dutys end      or to another doth beginning lend       it will subserve no use      more than the tints of flowers      only the independent guest      frequents its bowers      inherits its bequest       no speech though kind has it      but kinder silence doles      unto its mates      by night consoles      by day congratulates       what saith the tongue to tongue      what heareth ear of ear      by the decrees of fate      from year to year      does it communicate       pathless the gulf of feeling yawns      no trivial bridge of words      or arch of boldest span      can leap the moat that girds      the sincere man       no show of bolts and bars      can keep the foeman out      or scape his secret mine      who entered with the doubt      that drew the line       no warder at the gate      can let the friendly in      but like the sun oer all      he will the castle win      and shine along the wall       theres nothing in the world i know      that can escape from love      for every depth it goes below      and every height above       it waits as waits the sky      until the clouds go by      yet shines serenely on      with an eternal day      alike when they are gone      and when they stay       implacable is love      foes may be bought or teased      from their hostile intent      but he goes unappeased      who is on kindness bent  having rowed five or six miles above amoskeag before sunset and reached a pleasant part of the river one of us landed to look for a farmhouse where we might replenish our stores while the other remained cruising about the stream and exploring the opposite shores to find a suitable harbor for the night  in the mean while the canalboats began to come round a point in our rear poling their way along close to the shore the breeze having quite died away  this time there was no offer of assistance but one of the boatmen only called out to say as the truest revenge for having been the losers in the race that he had seen a woodduck which we had scared up sitting on a tall whitepine half a mile down stream and he repeated the assertion several times and seemed really chagrined at the apparent suspicion with which this information was received  but there sat the summer duck still undisturbed by us  by and by the other voyageur returned from his inland expedition bringing one of the natives with him a little flaxenheaded boy with some tradition or small edition of robinson crusoe in his head who had been charmed by the account of our adventures and asked his fathers leave to join us  he examined at first from the top of the bank our boat and furniture with sparkling eyes and wished himself already his own man  he was a lively and interesting boy and we should have been glad to ship him but nathan was still his fathers boy and had not come to years of discretion  we had got a loaf of homemade bread and musk and water melons for dessert  for this farmer a clever and welldisposed man cultivated a large patch of melons for the hooksett and concord markets  he hospitably entertained us the next day exhibiting his hopfields and kiln and melonpatch warning us to step over the tight rope which surrounded the latter at a foot from the ground while he pointed to a little bower at one corner where it connected with the lock of a gun ranging with the line and where as he informed us he sometimes sat in pleasant nights to defend his premises against thieves  we stepped high over the line and sympathized with our hosts on the whole quite human if not humane interest in the success of his experiment  that night especially thieves were to be expected from rumors in the atmosphere and the priming was not wet  he was a methodist man who had his dwelling between the river and uncannunuc mountain who there belonged and stayed at home there and by the encouragement of distant political organizations and by his own tenacity held a property in his melons and continued to plant we suggested melonseeds of new varieties and fruit of foreign flavor to be added to his stock  we had come away up here among the hills to learn the impartial and unbribable beneficence of nature  strawberries and melons grow as well in one mans garden as anothers and the sun lodges as kindly under his hillsidewhen we had imagined that she inclined rather to some few earnest and faithful souls whom we know  we found a convenient harbor for our boat on the opposite or east shore still in hooksett at the mouth of a small brook which emptied into the merrimack where it would be out of the way of any passing boat in the nightfor they commonly hug the shore if bound up stream either to avoid the current or touch the bottom with their polesand where it would be accessible without stepping on the clayey shore  we set one of our largest melons to cool in the still water among the alders at the mouth of this creek but when our tent was pitched and ready and we went to get it it had floated out into the stream and was nowhere to be seen  so taking the boat in the twilight we went in pursuit of this property and at length after long straining of the eyes its green disk was discovered far down the river gently floating seaward with many twigs and leaves from the mountains that evening and so perfectly balanced that it had not keeled at all and no water had run in at the tap which had been taken out to hasten its cooling  as we sat on the bank eating our supper the clear light of the western sky fell on the eastern trees and was reflected in the water and we enjoyed so serene an evening as left nothing to describe  for the most part we think that there are few degrees of sublimity and that the highest is but little higher than that which we now behold but we are always deceived  sublimer visions appear and the former pale and fade away  we are grateful when we are reminded by interior evidence of the permanence of universal laws for our faith is but faintly remembered indeed is not a remembered assurance but a use and enjoyment of knowledge  it is when we do not have to believe but come into actual contact with truth and are related to her in the most direct and intimate way  waves of serener life pass over us from time to time like flakes of sunlight over the fields in cloudy weather  in some happier moment when more sap flows in the withered stalk of our life syria and india stretch away from our present as they do in history  all the events which make the annals of the nations are but the shadows of our private experiences  suddenly and silently the eras which we call history awake and glimmer in us and there is room for alexander and hannibal to march and conquer  in short the history which we read is only a fainter memory of events which have happened in our own experience  tradition is a more interrupted and feebler memory  this world is but canvas to our imaginations  i see men with infinite pains endeavoring to realize to their bodies what i with at least equal pains would realize to my imaginationits capacities for certainly there is a life of the mind above the wants of the body and independent of it  often the body is warmed but the imagination is torpid the body is fat but the imagination is lean and shrunk  but what avails all other wealth if this is wanting  imagination is the air of mind in which it lives and breathes  all things are as i am  where is the house of change  the past is only so heroic as we see it it is the canvas on which our idea of heroism is painted and so in one sense the dim prospectus of our future field  our circumstances answer to our expectations and the demand of our natures  i have noticed that if a man thinks that he needs a thousand dollars and cannot be convinced that he does not he will commonly be found to have them if he lives and thinks a thousand dollars will be forthcoming though it be to buy shoestrings with  a thousand mills will be just as slow to come to one who finds it equally hard to convince himself that he needs them       men are by birth equal in this that given themselves and      their condition they are even  i am astonished at the singular pertinacity and endurance of our lives  the miracle is that what is is when it is so difficult if not impossible for anything else to be that we walk on in our particular paths so far before we fall on death and fate merely because we must walk in some path that every man can get a living and so few can do anything more  so much only can i accomplish ere health and strength are gone and yet this suffices  the bird now sits just out of gunshot  i am never rich in money and i am never meanly poor  if debts are incurred why debts are in the course of events cancelled as it were by the same law by which they were incurred  i heard that an engagement was entered into between a certain youth and a maiden and then i heard that it was broken off but i did not know the reason in either case  we are hedged about we think by accident and circumstance now we creep as in a dream and now again we run as if there were a fate in it and all things thwarted or assisted  i cannot change my clothes but when i do and yet i do change them and soil the new ones  it is wonderful that this gets done when some admirable deeds which i could mention do not get done  our particular lives seem of such fortune and confident strength and durability as piers of solid rock thrown forward into the tide of circumstance  when every other path would fail with singular and unerring confidence we advance on our particular course  what risks we run famine and fire and pestilence and the thousand forms of a cruel fateand yet every man lives till hedies  how did he manage that  is there no immediate danger  we wonder superfluously when we hear of a somnambulist walking a plank securelywe have walked a plank all our lives up to this particular stringpiece where we are  my life will wait for nobody but is being matured still without delay while i go about the streets and chaffer with this man and that to secure it a living  it is as indifferent and easy meanwhile as a poor mans dog and making acquaintance with its kind  it will cut its own channel like a mountain stream and by the longest ridge is not kept from the sea at last  i have found all things thus far persons and inanimate matter elements and seasons strangely adapted to my resources no matter what imprudent haste in my career i am permitted to be rash  gulfs are bridged in a twinkling as if some unseen baggagetrain carried pontoons for my convenience and while from the heights i scan the tempting but unexplored pacific ocean of futurity the ship is being carried over the mountains piecemeal on the backs of mules and lamas whose keel shall plough its waves and bear me to the indies  day would not dawn if it were not for       the inward morning       packed in my mind lie all the clothes      which outward nature wears      and in its fashions hourly change      it all things else repairs       in vain i look for change abroad      and can no difference find      till some new ray of peace uncalled      illumes my inmost mind       what is it gilds the trees and clouds      and paints the heavens so gay      but yonder fastabiding light      with its unchanging ray       lo when the sun streams through the wood      upon a winters morn      whereer his silent beams intrude      the murky night is gone       how could the patient pine have known        the morning breeze would come      or humble flowers anticipate        the insects noonday hum       till the new light with morning cheer        from far streamed through the aisles      and nimbly told the forest trees        for many stretching miles       ive heard within my inmost soul        such cheerful morning news      in the horizon of my mind        have seen such orient hues       as in the twilight of the dawn        when the first birds awake      are heard within some silent wood        where they the small twigs break       or in the eastern skies are seen        before the sun appears      the harbingers of summer heats         which from afar he bears  whole weeks and months of my summer life slide away in thin volumes like mist and smoke till at length some warm morning perchance i see a sheet of mist blown down the brook to the swamp and i float as high above the fields with it  i can recall to mind the stillest summer hours in which the grasshopper sings over the mulleins and there is a valor in that time the bare memory of which is armor that can laugh at any blow of fortune for our lifetime the strains of a harp are heard to swell and die alternately and death is but the pause when the blast is recollecting itself   we lay awake a long while listening to the murmurs of the brook in the angle formed by whose bank with the river our tent was pitched and there was a sort of human interest in its story which ceases not in freshet or in drought the livelong summer and the profounder lapse of the river was quite drowned by its din  but the rill whose       silver sands and pebbles sing      eternal ditties with the spring  is silenced by the first frosts of winter while mightier streams on whose bottom the sun never shines clogged with sunken rocks and the ruins of forests from whose surface comes up no murmur are strangers to the icy fetters which bind fast a thousand contributary rills  i dreamed this night of an event which had occurred long before it was a difference with a friend which had not ceased to give me pain though i had no cause to blame myself  but in my dream ideal justice was at length done me for his suspicions and i received that compensation which i had never obtained in my waking hours  i was unspeakably soothed and rejoiced even after i awoke because in dreams we never deceive ourselves nor are deceived and this seemed to have the authority of a final judgment  we bless and curse ourselves  some dreams are divine as well as some waking thoughts  donne sings of one       who dreamt devoutlier than most use to pray  dreams are the touchstones of our characters  we are scarcely less afflicted when we remember some unworthiness in our conduct in a dream than if it had been actual and the intensity of our grief which is our atonement measures the degree by which this is separated from an actual unworthiness  for in dreams we but act a part which must have been learned and rehearsed in our waking hours and no doubt could discover some waking consent thereto  if this meanness had not its foundation in us why are we grieved at it  in dreams we see ourselves naked and acting out our real characters even more clearly than we see others awake  but an unwavering and commanding virtue would compel even its most fantastic and faintest dreams to respect its everwakeful authority as we are accustomed to say carelessly we should never have dreamed of such a thing  our truest life is when we are in dreams awake       and more to lulle him in his slumber

cotton roof  the rain had pattered all night and now the whole country wept the drops falling in the river and on the alders and in the pastures and instead of any bow in the heavens there was the trill of the hairbird all the morning  the cheery faith of this little bird atoned for the silence of the whole woodland choir beside  when we first stepped abroad a flock of sheep led by their rams came rushing down a ravine in our rear with heedless haste and unreserved frisking as if unobserved by man from some higher pasture where they had spent the night to taste the herbage by the riverside but when their leaders caught sight of our white tent through the mist struck with sudden astonishment with their forefeet braced they sustained the rushing torrent in their rear and the whole flock stood stockstill endeavoring to solve the mystery in their sheepish brains  at length concluding that it boded no mischief to them they spread themselves out quietly over the field  we learned afterward that we had pitched our tent on the very spot which a few summers before had been occupied by a party of penobscots  we could see rising before us through the mist a dark conical eminence called hooksett pinnacle a landmark to boatmen and also uncannunuc mountain broad off on the west side of the river  this was the limit of our voyage for a few hours more in the rain would have taken us to the last of the locks and our boat was too heavy to be dragged around the long and numerous rapids which would occur  on foot however we continued up along the bank feeling our way with a stick through the showery and foggy day and climbing over the slippery logs in our path with as much pleasure and buoyancy as in brightest sunshine scenting the fragrance of the pines and the wet clay under our feet and cheered by the tones of invisible waterfalls with visions of toadstools and wandering frogs and festoons of moss hanging from the sprucetrees and thrushes flitting silent under the leaves our road still holding together through that wettest of weather like faith while we confidently followed its lead  we managed to keep our thoughts dry however and only our clothes were wet  it was altogether a cloudy and drizzling day with occasional brightenings in the mist when the trill of the treesparrow seemed to be ushering in sunny hours  nothing that naturally happens to man can hurt him earthquakes and thunderstorms not excepted said a man of genius who at this time lived a few miles farther on our road when compelled by a shower to take shelter under a tree we may improve that opportunity for a more minute inspection of some of natures works  i have stood under a tree in the woods half a day at a time during a heavy rain in the summer and yet employed myself happily and profitably there prying with microscopic eye into the crevices of the bark or the leaves or the fungi at my feet  riches are the attendants of the miser and the heavens rain plenteously upon the mountains i can fancy that it would be a luxury to stand up to ones chin in some retired swamp a whole summer day scenting the wild honeysuckle and bilberry blows and lulled by the minstrelsy of gnats and mosquitoes  a day passed in the society of those greek sages such as described in the banquet of xenophon would not be comparable with the dry wit of decayed cranberry vines and the fresh attic salt of the mossbeds  say twelve hours of genial and familiar converse with the leopard frog the sun to rise behind alder and dogwood and climb buoyantly to his meridian of two hands breadth and finally sink to rest behind some bold western hummock  to hear the evening chant of the mosquito from a thousand green chapels and the bittern begin to boom from some concealed fort like a sunset gunsurely one may as profitably be soaked in the juices of a swamp for one day as pick his way dryshod over sand  cold and dampare they not as rich experience as warmth and dryness  at present the drops come trickling down the stubble while we lie drenched on a bed of withered wild oats by the side of a bushy hill and the gathering in of the clouds with the last rush and dying breath of the wind and then the regular dripping of twigs and leaves the country over enhance the sense of inward comfort and sociableness  the birds draw closer and are more familiar under the thick foliage seemingly composing new strains upon their roosts against the sunshine  what were the amusements of the drawingroom and the library in comparison if we had them here  we should still sing as of old       my books id fain cast off i cannot read      twixt every page my thoughts go stray at large      down in the meadow where is richer feed      and will not mind to hit their proper targe       plutarch was good and so was homer too      our shakespeares life were rich to live again      what plutarch read that was not good nor true      nor shakespeares books unless his books were men

leisure hour      for now ive business with this drop of dew      and see you not the clouds prepare a shower      ill meet him shortly when the sky is blue       this bed of herdsgrass and wild oats was spread      last year with nicer skill than monarchs use      a clover tuft is pillow for my head      and violets quite overtop my shoes       and now the cordial clouds have shut all in      and gently swells the wind to say alls well      the scattered drops are falling fast and thin      some in the pool some in the flowerbell       i am well drenched upon my bed of oats      but see that globe come rolling down its stem      now like a lonely planet there it floats      and now it sinks into my garments hem       drip drip the trees for all the country round      and richness rare distils from every bough      the wind alone it is makes every sound      shaking down crystals on the leaves below       for shame the sun will never show himself      who could not with his beams eer melt me so      my dripping locksthey would become an elf      who in a beaded coat does gayly go  the pinnacle is a small wooded hill which rises very abruptly to the height of about two hundred feet near the shore at hooksett falls  as uncannunuc mountain is perhaps the best point from which to view the valley of the merrimack so this hill affords the best view of the river itself  i have sat upon its summit a precipitous rock only a few rods long in fairer weather when the sun was setting and filling the river valley with a flood of light  you can see up and down the merrimack several miles each way  the broad and straight river full of light and life with its sparkling and foaming falls the islet which divides the stream the village of hooksett on the shore almost directly under your feet so near that you can converse with its inhabitants or throw a stone into its yards the woodland lake at its western base and the mountains in the north and northeast make a scene of rare beauty and completeness which the traveller should take pains to behold  we were hospitably entertained in concord new hampshire which we persisted in calling new concord as we had been wont to distinguish it from our native town from which we had been told that it was named and in part originally settled  this would have been the proper place to conclude our voyage uniting concord with concord by these meandering rivers but our boat was moored some miles below its port  the richness of the intervals at penacook now concord new hampshire had been observed by explorers and according to the historian of haverhill in the    year 1726 considerable progress was made in the settlement   and a road was cut through the wilderness from haverhill to   penacook  in the fall of 1727 the first family that of   captain ebenezer eastman moved into the place  his team was   driven by jacob shute who was by birth a frenchman and he is   said to have been the first person who drove a team through the   wilderness  soon after says tradition one ayer a lad of 18   drove a team consisting of ten yoke of oxen to penacook swam   the river and ploughed a portion of the interval  he is   supposed to have been the first person who ploughed land in   that place  after he had completed his work he started on his   return at sunrise drowned a yoke of oxen while recrossing the   river and arrived at haverhill about midnight  the crank of   the first sawmill was manufactured in haverhill and carried   to penacook on a horse  but we found that the frontiers were not this way any longer this generation has come into the world fatally late for some enterprises  go where we will on the surface of things men have been there before us  we cannot now have the pleasure of erecting the last house that was long ago set up in the suburbs of astoria city and our boundaries have literally been run to the south sea according to the old patents  but the lives of men though more extended laterally in their range are still as shallow as ever  undoubtedly as a western orator said men generally live over about the same surface some live long and narrow and others live broad and short but it is all superficial living  a worm is as good a traveller as a grasshopper or a cricket and a much wiser settler  with all their activity these do not hop away from drought nor forward to summer  we do not avoid evil by fleeing before it but by rising above or diving below its plane as the worm escapes drought and frost by boring a few inches deeper  the frontiers are not east or west north or south but wherever a man fronts a fact though that fact be his neighbor there is an unsettled wilderness between him and canada between him and the setting sun or farther still between him and it  let him build himself a loghouse with the bark on where he is fronting it and wage there an old french war for seven or seventy years with indians and rangers or whatever else may come between him and the reality and save his scalp if he can   we now no longer sailed or floated on the river but trod the unyielding land like pilgrims  sadi tells who may travel among others a common mechanic who can earn a subsistence by the industry of his hand and shall not have to stake his reputation for every morsel of bread as philosophers have said he may travel who can subsist on the wild fruits and game of the most cultivated country  a man may travel fast enough and earn his living on the road  i have at times been applied to to do work when on a journey to do tinkering and repair clocks when i had a knapsack on my back  a man once applied to me to go into a factory stating conditions and wages observing that i succeeded in shutting the window of a railroad car in which we were travelling when the other passengers had failed  hast thou not heard of a sufi who was hammering some nails into the sole of his sandal an officer of cavalry took him by the sleeve saying come along and shoe my horse  farmers have asked me to assist them in haying when i was passing their fields  a man once applied to me to mend his umbrella taking me for an umbrellamender because being on a journey i carried an umbrella in my hand while the sun shone  another wished to buy a tin cup of me observing that i had one strapped to my belt and a saucepan on my back  the cheapest way to travel and the way to travel the farthest in the shortest distance is to go afoot carrying a dipper a spoon and a fishline some indian meal some salt and some sugar  when you come to a brook or pond you can catch fish and cook them or you can boil a hastypudding or you can buy a loaf of bread at a farmers house for fourpence moisten it in the next brook that crosses the road and dip into it your sugarthis alone will last you a whole dayor if you are accustomed to heartier living you can buy a quart of milk for two cents crumb your bread or cold pudding into it and eat it with your own spoon out of your own dish  any one of these things i mean not all together  i have travelled thus some hundreds of miles without taking any meal in a house sleeping on the ground when convenient and found it cheaper and in many respects more profitable than staying at home  so that some have inquired why it would not be best to travel always  but i never thought of travelling simply as a means of getting a livelihood  a simple woman down in tyngsborough at whose house i once stopped to get a draught of water when i said recognizing the bucket that i had stopped there nine years before for the same purpose asked if i was not a traveller supposing that i had been travelling ever since and had now come round again that travelling was one of the professions more or less productive which her husband did not follow  but continued travelling is far from productive  it begins with wearing away the soles of the shoes and making the feet sore and erelong it will wear a man clean up after making his heart sore into the bargain  i have observed that the afterlife of those who have travelled much is very pathetic  true and sincere travelling is no pastime but it is as serious as the grave or any part of the human journey and it requires a long probation to be broken into it  i do not speak of those that travel sitting the sedentary travellers whose legs hang dangling the while mere idle symbols of the fact any more than when we speak of sitting hens we mean those that sit standing but i mean those to whom travelling is life for the legs and death too at last  the traveller must be born again on the road and earn a passport from the elements the principal powers that be for him  he shall experience at last that old threat of his mother fulfilled that he shall be skinned alive  his sores shall gradually deepen themselves that they may heal inwardly while he gives no rest to the sole of his foot and at night weariness must be his pillow that so he may acquire experience against his rainy daysso was it with us  sometimes we lodged at an inn in the woods where troutfishers from distant cities had arrived before us and where to our astonishment the settlers dropped in at nightfall to have a chat and hear the news though there was but one road and no other house was visibleas if they had come out of the earth  there we sometimes read old newspapers who never before read new ones and in the rustle of their leaves heard the dashing of the surf along the atlantic shore instead of the sough of the wind among the pines  but then walking had given us an appetite even for the least palatable and nutritious food  some hard and dry book in a dead language which you have found it impossible to read at home but for which you have still a lingering regard is the best to carry with you on a journey  at a country inn in the barren society of ostlers and travellers i could undertake the writers of the silver or the brazen age with confidence  almost the last regular service which i performed in the cause of literature was to read the works of                aulus persius flaccus  if you have imagined what a divine work is spread out for the poet and approach this author too in the hope of finding the field at length fairly entered on you will hardly dissent from the words of the prologue       ipse semipaganus      ad sacra vatum carmen affero nostrum       i half pagan      bring my verses to the shrine of the poets  here is none of the interior dignity of virgil nor the elegance and vivacity of horace nor will any sibyl be needed to remind you that from those older greek poets there is a sad descent to persius  you can scarcely distinguish one harmonious sound amid this unmusical bickering with the follies of men  one sees that music has its place in thought but hardly as yet in language  when the muse arrives we wait for her to remould language and impart to it her own rhythm  hitherto the verse groans and labors with its load and goes not forward blithely singing by the way  the best ode may be parodied indeed is itself a parody and has a poor and trivial sound like a man stepping on the rounds of a ladder  homer and shakespeare and milton and marvell and wordsworth are but the rustling of leaves and crackling of twigs in the forest and there is not yet the sound of any bird  the muse has never lifted up her voice to sing  most of all satire will not be sung  a juvenal or persius do not marry music to their verse but are measured faultfinders at best stand but just outside the faults they condemn and so are concerned rather about the monster which they have escaped than the fair prospect before them  let them live on an age and they will have travelled out of his shadow and reach and found other objects to ponder  as long as there is satire the poet is as it were particeps criminis  one sees not but he had best let bad take care of itself and have to do only with what is beyond suspicion  if you light on the least vestige of truth and it is the weight of the whole body still which stamps the faintest trace an eternity will not suffice to extol it while no evil is so huge but you grudge to bestow on it a moment of hate  truth never turns to rebuke falsehood her own straightforwardness is the severest correction  horace would not have written satire so well if he had not been inspired by it as by a passion and fondly cherished his vein  in his odes the love always exceeds the hate so that the severest satire still sings itself and the poet is satisfied though the folly be not corrected  a sort of necessary order in the development of genius is first complaint second plaint third love  complaint which is the condition of persius lies not in the province of poetry  erelong the enjoyment of a superior good would have changed his disgust into regret  we can never have much sympathy with the complainer for after searching nature through we conclude that he must be both plaintiff and defendant too and so had best come to a settlement without a hearing  he who receives an injury is to some extent an accomplice of the wrongdoer  perhaps it would be truer to say that the highest strain of the muse is essentially plaintive  the saints are still tears of joy  who has ever heard the innocent sing  but the divinest poem or the life of a great man is the severest satire as impersonal as nature herself and like the sighs of her winds in the woods which convey ever a slight reproof to the hearer  the greater the genius the keener the edge of the satire  hence we have to do only with the rare and fragmentary traits which least belong to persius or shall we say are the properest utterances of his muse since that which he says best at any time is what he can best say at all times  the spectators and ramblers have not failed to cull some quotable sentences from this garden too so pleasant is it to meet even the most familiar truth in a new dress when if our neighbor had said it we should have passed it by as hackneyed  out of these six satires you may perhaps select some twenty lines which fit so well as many thoughts that they will recur to the scholar almost as readily as a natural image though when translated into familiar language they lose that insular emphasis which fitted them for quotation  such lines as the following translation cannot render commonplace  contrasting the man of true religion with those who with jealous privacy would fain carry on a secret commerce with the gods he says       haud cuivis promptum est murmurque humilesque susurros      tollere de templis et aperto vivere voto       it is not easy for every one to take murmurs and low      whispers out of the temples and live with open vow   to the virtuous man the universe is the only sanctum sanctorum and the penetralia of the temple are the broad noon of his existence  why should he betake himself to a subterranean crypt as if it were the only holy ground in all the world which he had left unprofaned  the obedient soul would only the more discover and familiarize things and escape more and more into light and air as having henceforth done with secrecy so that the universe shall not seem open enough for it  at length it is neglectful even of that silence which is consistent with true modesty but by its independence of all confidence in its disclosures makes that which it imparts so private to the hearer that it becomes the care of the whole world that modesty be not infringed  to the man who cherishes a secret in his breast there is a still greater secret unexplored  our most indifferent acts may be matter for secrecy but whatever we do with the utmost truthfulness and integrity by virtue of its pureness must be transparent as light  in the third satire he asks       est aliquid quo tendis et in quod dirigis arcum      an passim sequeris corvos testave lutove      securus quo pes ferat atque ex tempore vivis     is there anything to which thou tendest and against which thou        directest thy bow    or dost thou pursue crows at random with pottery or clay    careless whither thy feet bear thee and live ex tempore  the bad sense is always a secondary one  language does not appear to have justice done it but is obviously cramped and narrowed in its significance when any meanness is described the truest construction is not put upon it  what may readily be fashioned into a rule of wisdom is here thrown in the teeth of the sluggard and constitutes the front of his offence universally the innocent man will come forth from the sharpest inquisition and lecturing the combined din of reproof and commendation with a faint sound of eulogy in his ears  our vices always lie in the direction of our virtues and in their best estate are but plausible imitations of the latter falsehood never attains to the dignity of entire falseness but is only an inferior sort of truth if it were more thoroughly false it would incur danger of becoming true       securus quo pes ferat atque ex tempore vivit  is then the motto of a wise man  for first as the subtle discernment of the language would have taught us with all his negligence he is still secure but the sluggard notwithstanding his heedlessness is insecure  the life of a wise man is most of all extemporaneous for he lives out of an eternity which includes all time  the cunning mind travels further back than zoroaster each instant and comes quite down to the present with its revelation  the utmost thrift and industry of thinking give no man any stock in life his credit with the inner world is no better his capital no larger he must try his fortune again today as yesterday  all questions rely on the present for their solution  time measures nothing but itself  the word that is written may be postponed but not that on the lip  if this is what the occasion says let the occasion say it  all the world is forward to prompt him who gets up to live without his creed in his pocket  in the fifth satire which is the best i find       stat contra ratio et secretam garrit in aurem      ne liceat facere id quod quis vitiabit agendo     reason opposes and whispers in the secret ear    that it is not lawful to do that which one will spoil by doing  only they who do not see how anything might be better done are forward to try their hand on it  even the master workman must be encouraged by the reflection that his awkwardness will be incompetent to do that thing harm to which his skill may fail to do justice  here is no apology for neglecting to do many things from a sense of our incapacityfor what deed does not fall maimed and imperfect from our handsbut only a warning to bungle less  the satires of persius are the furthest possible from inspired evidently a chosen not imposed subject  perhaps i have given him credit for more earnestness than is apparent but it is certain that that which alone we can call persius which is forever independent and consistent was in earnest and so sanctions the sober consideration of all  the artist and his work are not to be separated  the most wilfully foolish man cannot stand aloof from his folly but the deed and the doer together make ever one sober fact  there is but one stage for the peasant and the actor  the buffoon cannot bribe you to laugh always at his grimaces they shall sculpture themselves in egyptian granite to stand heavy as the pyramids on the ground of his character                                suns rose and set and found us still on the dank forest path which meanders up the pemigewasset now more like an otters or a martens trail or where a beaver had dragged his trap than where the wheels of travel raise a dust where towns begin to serve as gores only to hold the earth together  the wild pigeon sat secure above our heads high on the dead limbs of naval pines reduced to a robins size  the very yards of our hostelries inclined upon the skirts of mountains and as we passed we looked up at a steep angle at the stems of maples waving in the clouds  far up in the countryfor we would be faithful to our experiencein thornton perhaps we met a soldier lad in the woods going to muster in full regimentals and holding the middle of the road deep in the forest with shouldered musket and military step and thoughts of war and glory all to himself it was a sore trial to the youth tougher than many a battle to get by us creditably and with soldierlike bearing  poor man  he actually shivered like a reed in his thin military pants and by the time we had got up with him all the sternness that becomes the soldier had forsaken his face and he skulked past as if he were driving his fathers sheep under a swordproof helmet  it was too much for him to carry any extra armor then who could not easily dispose of his natural arms  and for his legs they were like heavy artillery in boggy places better to cut the traces and forsake them  his greaves chafed and wrestled one with another for want of other foes  but he did get by and get off with all his munitions and lived to fight another day and i do not record this as casting any suspicion on his honor and real bravery in the field  wandering on through notches which the streams had made by the side and over the brows of hoar hills and mountains across the stumpy rocky forested and bepastured country we at length crossed on prostrate trees over the amonoosuck and breathed the free air of unappropriated land  thus in fair days as well as foul we had traced up the river to which our native stream is a tributary until from merrimack it became the pemigewasset that leaped by our side and when we had passed its fountainhead the wild amonoosuck whose puny channel was crossed at a stride guiding us toward its distant source among the mountains and at length without its guidance we were enabled to reach the summit of agiocochook                              sweet days so cool so calm so bright      the bridal of the earth and sky      sweet dews shall weep thy fall tonight                          for thou must die                                      herbert  when we returned to hooksett a week afterward the melon man in whose cornbarn we had hung our tent and buffaloes and other things to dry was already picking his hops with many women and children to help him  we bought one watermelon the largest in his patch to carry with us for ballast  it was nathans which he might sell if he wished having been conveyed to him in the green state and owned daily by his eyes  after due consultation with father the bargain was concludedwe to buy it at a venture on the vine green or ripe our risk and pay what the gentlemen pleased it proved to be ripe for we had had honest experience in selecting this fruit  finding our boat safe in its harbor under uncannunuc mountain with a fair wind and the current in our favor we commenced our return voyage at noon sitting at our ease and conversing or in silence watching for the last trace of each reach in the river as a bend concealed it from our view  as the season was further advanced the wind now blew steadily from the north and with our sail set we could occasionally lie on our oars without loss of time  the lumbermen throwing down wood from the top of the high bank thirty or forty feet above the water that it might be sent down stream paused in their work to watch our retreating sail by this time indeed we were well known to the boatmen and were hailed as the revenue cutter of the stream  as we sailed rapidly down the river shut in between two mounds of earth the sounds of this timber rolled down the bank enhanced the silence and vastness of the noon and we fancied that only the primeval echoes were awakened  the vision of a distant scow just heaving in sight round a headland also increased by contrast the solitude  through the din and desultoriness of noon even in the most oriental city is seen the fresh and primitive and savage nature in which scythians and ethiopians and indians dwell  what is echo what are light and shade day and night ocean and stars earthquake and eclipse there  the works of man are everywhere swallowed up in the immensity of nature  the aegean sea is but lake huron still to the indian  also there is all the refinement of civilized life in the woods under a sylvan garb  the wildest scenes have an air of domesticity and homeliness even to the citizen and when the flickers cackle is heard in the clearing he is reminded that civilization has wrought but little change there  science is welcome to the deepest recesses of the forest for there too nature obeys the same old civil laws  the little red bug on the stump of a pinefor it the wind shifts and the sun breaks through the clouds  in the wildest nature there is not only the material of the most cultivated life and a sort of anticipation of the last result but a greater refinement already than is ever attained by man  there is papyrus by the riverside and rushes for light and the goose only flies overhead ages before the studious are born or letters invented and that literature which the former suggest and even from the first have rudely served it may be man does not yet use them to express nature is prepared to welcome into her scenery the finest work of human art for she is herself an art so cunning that the artist never appears in his work  art is not tame and nature is not wild in the ordinary sense a perfect work of mans art would also be wild or natural in a good sense  man tames nature only that he may at last make her more free even than he found her though he may never yet have succeeded   with this propitious breeze and the help of our oars we soon reached the falls of amoskeag and the mouth of the piscataquoag and recognized as we swept rapidly by many a fair bank and islet on which our eyes had rested in the upward passage  our boat was like that which chaucer describes in his dream in which the knight took his departure from the island       to journey for his marriage      and return with such an host      that wedded might be least and most          which barge was as a mans thought      after his pleasure to him brought      the queene herself accustomed aye      in the same barge to play      it needed neither mast ne rother      i have not heard of such another      no master for the governance      hie sayled by thought and pleasaunce      without labor east and west      all was one calme or tempest  so we sailed this afternoon thinking of the saying of pythagoras though we had no peculiar right to remember it it is beautiful when prosperity is present with intellect and when sailing as it were with a prosperous wind actions are performed looking to virtue just as a pilot looks to the motions of the stars all the world reposes in beauty to him who preserves equipoise in his life and moves serenely on his path without secret violence as he who sails down a stream he has only to steer keeping his bark in the middle and carry it round the falls  the ripples curled away in our wake like ringlets from the head of a child while we steadily held on our course and under the bows we watched                              the swaying soft      made by the delicate wave parted in front      as through the gentle element we move      like shadows gliding through untroubled dreams  the forms of beauty fall naturally around the path of him who is in the performance of his proper work as the curled shavings drop from the plane and borings cluster round the auger undulation is the gentlest and most ideal of motions produced by one fluid falling on another  rippling is a more graceful flight  from a hilltop you may detect in it the wings of birds endlessly repeated  the two waving lines which represent the flight of birds appear to have been copied from the ripple  the trees made an admirable fence to the landscape skirting the horizon on every side  the single trees and the groves left standing on the interval appeared naturally disposed though the farmer had consulted only his convenience for he too falls into the scheme of nature  art can never match the luxury and superfluity of nature  in the former all is seen it cannot afford concealed wealth and is niggardly in comparison but nature even when she is scant and thin outwardly satisfies us still by the assurance of a certain generosity at the roots  in swamps where there is only here and there an evergreen tree amid the quaking moss and cranberry beds the bareness does not suggest poverty  the singlespruce which i had hardly noticed in gardens attracts me in such places and now first i understand why men try to make them grow about their houses  but though there may be very perfect specimens in frontyard plots their beauty is for the most part ineffectual there for there is no such assurance of kindred wealth beneath and around them to make them show to advantage  as we have said nature is a greater and more perfect art the art of god though referred to herself she is genius and there is a similarity between her operations and mans art even in the details and trifles  when the overhanging pine drops into the water by the sun and water and the wind rubbing it against the shore its boughs are worn into fantastic shapes and white and smooth as if turned in a lathe  mans art has wisely imitated those forms into which all matter is most inclined to run as foliage and fruit  a hammock swung in a grove assumes the exact form of a canoe broader or narrower and higher or lower at the ends as more or fewer persons are in it and it rolls in the air with the motion of the body like a canoe in the water  our art leaves its shavings and its dust about her art exhibits itself even in the shavings and the dust which we make  she has perfected herself by an eternity of practice  the world is well kept no rubbish accumulates the morning air is clear even at this day and no dust has settled on the grass  behold how the evening now steals over the fields the shadows of the trees creeping farther and farther into the meadow and erelong the stars will come to bathe in these retired waters  her undertakings are secure and never fail  if i were awakened from a deep sleep i should know which side of the meridian the sun might be by the aspect of nature and by the chirp of the crickets and yet no painter can paint this difference  the landscape contains a thousand dials which indicate the natural divisions of time the shadows of a thousand styles point to the hour       not only oer the dials face        this silent phantom day by day      with slow unseen unceasing pace        steals moments months and years away      from hoary rock and aged tree        from proud palmyras mouldering walls      from teneriffe towering oer the sea        from every blade of grass it falls  it is almost the only game which the trees play at this titfortat now this side in the sun now that the drama of the day  in deep ravines under the eastern sides of cliffs night forwardly plants her foot even at noonday and as day retreats she steps into his trenches skulking from tree to tree from fence to fence until at last she sits in his citadel and draws out her forces into the plain  it may be that the forenoon is brighter than the afternoon not only because of the greater transparency of its atmosphere but because we naturally look most into the west as forward into the day and so in the forenoon see the sunny side of things but in the afternoon the shadow of every tree  the afternoon is now far advanced and a fresh and leisurely wind is blowing over the river making long reaches of bright ripples the river has done its stint and appears not to flow but lie at its length reflecting the light and the haze over the woods is like the inaudible panting or rather the gentle perspiration of resting nature rising from a myriad of pores into the attenuated atmosphere   on the thirtyfirst day of march one hundred and fortytwo years before this probably about this time in the afternoon there were hurriedly paddling down this part of the river between the pine woods which then fringed these banks two white women and a boy who had left an island at the mouth of the contoocook before daybreak  they were slightly clad for the season in the english fashion and handled their paddles unskilfully but with nervous energy and determination and at the bottom of their canoe lay the still bleeding scalps of ten of the aborigines  they were hannah dustan and her nurse mary neff both of haverhill eighteen miles from the mouth of this river and an english boy named samuel lennardson escaping from captivity among the indians  on the 15th of march previous hannah dustan had been compelled to rise from childbed and half dressed with one foot bare accompanied by her nurse commence an uncertain march in still inclement weather through the snow and the wilderness she had seen her seven elder children flee with their father but knew not of their fate  she had seen her infants brains dashed out against an appletree and had left her own and her neighbors dwellings in ashes  when she reached the wigwam of her captor situated on an island in the merrimack more than twenty miles above where we now are she had been told that she and her nurse were soon to be taken to a distant indian settlement and there made to run the gauntlet naked  the family of this indian consisted of two men three women and seven children beside an english boy whom she found a prisoner among them  having determined to attempt her escape she instructed the boy to inquire of one of the men how he should despatch an enemy in the quickest manner and take his scalp  strike em there said he placing his finger on his temple and he also showed him how to take off the scalp  on the morning of the 31st she arose before daybreak and awoke her nurse and the boy and taking the indians tomahawks they killed them all in their sleep excepting one favorite boy and one squaw who fled wounded with him to the woods  the english boy struck the indian who had given him the information on the temple as he had been directed  they then collected all the provision they could find and took their masters tomahawk and gun and scuttling all the canoes but one commenced their flight to haverhill distant about sixty miles by the river  but after having proceeded a short distance fearing that her story would not be believed if she should escape to tell it they returned to the silent wigwam and taking off the scalps of the dead put them into a bag as proofs of what they had done and then retracing their steps to the shore in the twilight recommenced their voyage  early this morning this deed was performed and now perchance these tired women and this boy their clothes stained with blood and their minds racked with alternate resolution and fear are making a hasty meal of parched corn and moosemeat while their canoe glides under these pine roots whose stumps are still standing on the bank  they are thinking of the dead whom they have left behind on that solitary isle far up the stream and of the relentless living warriors who are in pursuit  every withered leaf which the winter has left seems to know their story and in its rustling to repeat it and betray them  an indian lurks behind every rock and pine and their nerves cannot bear the tapping of a woodpecker  or they forget their own dangers and their deeds in conjecturing the fate of their kindred and whether if they escape the indians they shall find the former still alive  they do not stop to cook their meals upon the bank nor land except to carry their canoe about the falls  the stolen birch forgets its master and does them good service and the swollen current bears them swiftly along with little need of the paddle except to steer and keep them warm by exercise  for ice is floating in the river the spring is opening the muskrat and the beaver are driven out of their holes by the flood deer gaze at them from the bank a few faintsinging forest birds perchance fly across the river to the northernmost shore the fishhawk sails and screams overhead and geese fly over with a startling clangor but they do not observe these things or they speedily forget them  they do not smile or chat all day  sometimes they pass an indian grave surrounded by its paling on the bank or the frame of a wigwam with a few coals left behind or the withered stalks still rustling in the indians solitary cornfield on the interval  the birch stripped of its bark or the charred stump where a tree has been burned down to be made into a canoe these are the only traces of mana fabulous wild man to us  on either side the primeval forest stretches away uninterrupted to canada or to the south sea to the white man a drear and howling wilderness but to the indian a home adapted to his nature and cheerful as the smile of the great spirit  while we loiter here this autumn evening looking for a spot retired enough where we shall quietly rest tonight they thus in that chilly march evening one hundred and fortytwo years before us with wind and current favoring have already glided out of sight not to camp as we shall at night but while two sleep one will manage the canoe and the swift stream bear them onward to the settlements it may be even to old john lovewells house on salmon brook tonight  according to the historian they escaped as by a miracle all roving bands of indians and reached their homes in safety with their trophies for which the general court paid them fifty pounds  the family of hannah dustan all assembled alive once more except the infant whose brains were dashed out against the appletree and there have been many who in later times have lived to say that they had eaten of the fruit of that appletree   this seems a long while ago and yet it happened since milton wrote his paradise lost  but its antiquity is not the less great for that for we do not regulate our historical time by the english standard nor did the english by the roman nor the roman by the greek  we must look a long way back says raleigh to find the romans giving laws to nations and their consuls bringing kings and princes bound in chains to rome in triumph to see men go to greece for wisdom or ophir for gold when now nothing remains but a poor paper remembrance of their former condition and yet in one sense not so far back as to find the penacooks and pawtuckets using bows and arrows and hatchets of stone on the banks of the merrimack  from this september afternoon and from between these now cultivated shores those times seemed more remote than the dark ages  on beholding an old picture of concord as it appeared but seventyfive years ago with a fair open prospect and a light on trees and river as if it were broad noon i find that i had not thought the sun shone in those days or that men lived in broad daylight then  still less do we imagine the sun shining on hill and valley during philips war on the warpath of church or philip or later of lovewell or paugus with serene summer weather but they must have lived and fought in a dim twilight or night  the age of the world is great enough for our imaginations even according to the mosaic account without borrowing any years from the geologist  from adam and eve at one leap sheer down to the deluge and then through the ancient monarchies through babylon and thebes brahma and abraham to greece and the argonauts whence we might start again with orpheus and the trojan war the pyramids and the olympic games and homer and athens for our stages and after a breathing space at the building of rome continue our journey down through odin and christ toamerica it is a wearisome while  and yet the lives of but sixty old women such as live under the hill say of a century each strung together are sufficient to reach over the whole ground  taking hold of hands they would span the interval from eve to my own mother  a respectable teaparty merelywhose gossip would be universal history  the fourth old woman from myself suckled columbusthe ninth was nurse to the norman conquerorthe nineteenth was the virgin marythe twentyfourth the cumaean sibylthe thirtieth was at the trojan war and helen her namethe thirtyeighth was queen semiramisthe sixtieth was eve the mother of mankind  so much for the       old woman that lives under the hill      and if shes not gone she lives there still  it will not take a very greatgranddaughter of hers to be in at the death of time  we can never safely exceed the actual facts in our narratives of pure invention such as some suppose there is no instance to write a true work of fiction even is only to take leisure and liberty to describe some things more exactly as they are  a true account of the actual is the rarest poetry for common sense always takes a hasty and superficial view  though i am not much acquainted with the works of goethe i should say that it was one of his chief excellences as a writer that he was satisfied with giving an exact description of things as they appeared to him and their effect upon him  most travellers have not selfrespect enough to do this simply and make objects and events stand around them as the centre but still imagine more favorable positions and relations than the actual ones and so we get no valuable report from them at all  in his italian travels goethe jogs along at a snails pace but always mindful that the earth is beneath and the heavens are above him  his italy is not merely the fatherland of lazzaroni and virtuosi and scene of splendid ruins but a solid turfclad soil daily shined on by the sun and nightly by the moon  even the few showers are faithfully recorded  he speaks as an unconcerned spectator whose object is faithfully to describe what he sees and that for the most part in the order in which he sees it  even his reflections do not interfere with his descriptions  in one place he speaks of himself as giving so glowing and truthful a description of an old tower to the peasants who had gathered around him that they who had been born and brought up in the neighborhood must needs look over their shoulders that to use his own words they might behold with their eyes what i had praised to their earsand i added nothing not even the ivy which for centuries had decorated the walls it would thus be possible for inferior minds to produce invaluable books if this very moderation were not the evidence of superiority for the wise are not so much wiser than others as respecters of their own wisdom  some poor in spirit record plaintively only what has happened to them but others how they have happened to the universe and the judgment which they have awarded to circumstances  above all he possessed a hearty goodwill to all men and never wrote a cross or even careless word  on one occasion the postboy snivelling signor perdonate questa e la mia patria he confesses that to me poor northerner came something tearlike into the eyes  goethes whole education and life were those of the artist  he lacks the unconsciousness of the poet  in his autobiography he describes accurately the life of the author of wilhelm meister for as there is in that book mingled with a rare and serene wisdom a certain pettiness or exaggeration of trifles wisdom applied to produce a constrained and partial and merely wellbred mana magnifying of the theatre till life itself is turned into a stage for which it is our duty to study our parts well and conduct with propriety and precisionso in the autobiography the fault of his education is so to speak its merely artistic completeness  nature is hindered though she prevails at last in making an unusually catholic impression on the boy  it is the life of a city boy whose toys are pictures and works of art whose wonders are the theatre and kingly processions and crownings  as the youth studied minutely the order and the degrees in the imperial procession and suffered none of its effect to be lost on him so the man aimed to secure a rank in society which would satisfy his notion of fitness and respectability  he was defrauded of much which the savage boy enjoys  indeed he himself has occasion to say in this very autobiography when at last he escapes into the woods without the gates thus much is certain that only the undefinable wideexpanding feelings of youth and of uncultivated nations are adapted to the sublime which whenever it may be excited in us through external objects since it is either formless or else moulded into forms which are incomprehensible must surround us with a grandeur which we find above our reach he further says of himself i had lived among painters from my childhood and had accustomed myself to look at objects as they did with reference to art  and this was his practice to the last  he was even too wellbred to be thoroughly bred  he says that he had had no intercourse with the lowest class of his townsboys the child should have the advantage of ignorance as well as of knowledge and is fortunate if he gets his share of neglect and exposure       the laws of nature break the rules of art  the man of genius may at the same time be indeed is commonly an artist but the two are not to be confounded  the man of genius referred to mankind is an originator an inspired or demonic man who produces a perfect work in obedience to laws yet unexplored  the artist is he who detects and applies the law from observation of the works of genius whether of man or nature  the artisan is he who merely applies the rules which others have detected  there has been no man of pure genius as there has been none wholly destitute of genius  poetry is the mysticism of mankind  the expressions of the poet cannot be analyzed his sentence is one word whose syllables are words  there are indeed no words quite worthy to be set to his music  but what matter if we do not hear the words always if we hear the music  much verse fails of being poetry because it was not written exactly at the right crisis though it may have been inconceivably near to it  it is only by a miracle that poetry is written at all  it is not recoverable thought but a hue caught from a vaster receding thought  a poem is one undivided unimpeded expression fallen ripe into literature and it is undividedly and unimpededly received by those for whom it was matured  if you can speak what you will never hear if you can write what you will never read you have done rare things       the work we choose should be our own      god lets alone  the unconsciousness of man is the consciousness of god  deep are the foundations of sincerity  even stone walls have their foundation below the frost  what is produced by a free stroke charms us like the forms of lichens and leaves  there is a certain perfection in accident which we never consciously attain  draw a blunt quill filled with ink over a sheet of paper and fold the paper before the ink is dry transversely to this line and a delicately shaded and regular figure will be

my life had grown more outward when i can express it   on his journey from brenner to verona goethe writes  the tees flows now more gently and makes in many places broad sands  on the land near to the water upon the hillsides everything is so closely planted one to another that you think they must choke one anothervineyards maize mulberrytrees apples pears quinces and nuts  the dwarf elder throws itself vigorously over the walls  ivy grows with strong stems up the rocks and spreads itself wide over them the lizard glides through the intervals and everything that wanders to and fro reminds one of the loveliest pictures of art  the womens tufts of hair bound up the mens bare breasts and light jackets the excellent oxen which they drive home from market the little asses with their loadseverything forms a living animated heinrich roos  and now that it is evening in the mild air a few clouds rest upon the mountains in the heavens more stand still than move and immediately after sunset the chirping of crickets begins to grow more loud then one feels for once at home in the world and not as concealed or in exile  i am contented as though i had been born and brought up here and were now returning from a greenland or whaling voyage  even the dust of my fatherland which is often whirled about the wagon and which for so long a time i had not seen is greeted  the clockandbell jingling of the crickets is altogether lovely penetrating and agreeable  it sounds bravely when roguish boys whistle in emulation of a field of such songstresses  one fancies that they really enhance one another  also the evening is perfectly mild as the day  if one who dwelt in the south and came hither from the south should hear of my rapture hereupon he would deem me very childish  alas  what i here express i have long known while i suffered under an unpropitious heaven and now may i joyful feel this joy as an exception which we should enjoy everforth as an eternal necessity of our nature   thus we sayled by thought and pleasaunce as chaucer says and all things seemed with us to flow the shore itself and the distant cliffs were dissolved by the undiluted air  the hardest material seemed to obey the same law with the most fluid and so indeed in the long run it does  trees were but rivers of sap and woody fibre flowing from the atmosphere and emptying into the earth by their trunks as their roots flowed upward to the surface  and in the heavens there were rivers of stars and milkyways already beginning to gleam and ripple over our heads there were rivers of rock on the surface of the earth and rivers of ore in its bowels and our thoughts flowed and circulated and this portion of time was but the current hour  let us wander where we will the universe is built round about us and we are central still  if we look into the heavens they are concave and if we were to look into a gulf as bottomless it would be concave also  the sky is curved downward to the earth in the horizon because we stand on the plain  i draw down its skirts  the stars so low there seem loath to depart but by a circuitous path to be remembering me and returning on their steps  we had already passed by broad daylight the scene of our encampment at coos falls and at length we pitched our camp on the west bank in the northern part of merrimack nearly opposite to the large island on which we had spent the noon in our way up the river  there we went to bed that summer evening on a sloping shelf in the bank a couple of rods from our boat which was drawn up on the sand and just behind a thin fringe of oaks which bordered the river without having disturbed any inhabitants but the spiders in the grass which came out by the light of our lamp and crawled over our buffaloes  when we looked out from under the tent the trees were seen dimly through the mist and a cool dew hung upon the grass which seemed to rejoice in the night and with the damp air we inhaled a solid fragrance  having eaten our supper of hot cocoa and bread and watermelon we soon grew weary of conversing and writing in our journals and putting out the lantern which hung from the tentpole fell asleep  unfortunately many things have been omitted which should have been recorded in our journal for though we made it a rule to set down all our experiences therein yet such a resolution is very hard to keep for the important experience rarely allows us to remember such obligations and so indifferent things get recorded while that is frequently neglected  it is not easy to write in a journal what interests us at any time because to write it is not what interests us  whenever we awoke in the night still eking out our dreams with halfawakened thoughts it was not till after an interval when the wind breathed harder than usual flapping the curtains of the tent and causing its cords to vibrate that we remembered that we lay on the bank of the merrimack and not in our chamber at home  with our heads so low in the grass we heard the river whirling and sucking and lapsing downward kissing the shore as it went sometimes rippling louder than usual and again its mighty current making only a slight limpid trickling sound as if our waterpail had sprung a leak and the water were flowing into the grass by our side  the wind rustling the oaks and hazels impressed us like a wakeful and inconsiderate person up at midnight moving about and putting things to rights occasionally stirring up whole drawers full of leaves at a puff there seemed to be a great haste and preparation throughout nature as for a distinguished visitor all her aisles had to be swept in the night by a thousand handmaidens and a thousand pots to be boiled for the next days feastingsuch a whispering bustle as if ten thousand fairies made their fingers fly silently sewing at the new carpet with which the earth was to be clothed and the new drapery which was to adorn the trees  and then the wind would lull and die away and we like it fell asleep again     page                               friday                                  the boteman strayt      held on his course with stayed stedfastnesse      ne ever shroncke

long before daybreak listening to the rippling of the river and the rustling of the leaves in suspense whether the wind blew up or down the stream was favorable or unfavorable to our voyage we already suspected that there was a change in the weather from a freshness as of autumn in these sounds  the wind in the woods sounded like an incessant waterfall dashing and roaring amid rocks and we even felt encouraged by the unusual activity of the elements  he who hears the rippling of rivers in these degenerate days will not utterly despair  that night was the turningpoint in the season  we had gone to bed in summer and we awoke in autumn for summer passes into autumn in some unimaginable point of time like the turning of a leaf  we found our boat in the dawn just as we had left it and as if waiting for us there on the shore in autumn all cool and dripping with dew and our tracks still fresh in the wet sand around it the fairies all gone or concealed  before five oclock we pushed it into the fog and leaping in at one shove were out of sight of the shores and began to sweep downward with the rushing river keeping a sharp lookout for rocks  we could see only the yellow gurgling water and a solid bank of fog on every side forming a small yard around us  we soon passed the mouth of the souhegan and the village of merrimack and as the mist gradually rolled away and we were relieved from the trouble of watching for rocks we saw by the flitting clouds by the first russet tinge on the hills by the rushing river the cottages on shore and the shore itself so coolly fresh and shining with dew and later in the day by the hue of the grapevine the goldfinch on the willow the flickers flying in flocks and when we passed near enough to the shore as we fancied by the faces of men that the fall had commenced  the cottages looked more snug and comfortable and their inhabitants were seen only for a moment and then went quietly in and shut the door retreating inward to the haunts of summer       and now the cold autumnal dews are seen      to cobweb evry green      and by the lowshorn rowens doth appear      the fastdeclining year  we heard the sigh of the first autumnal wind and even the water had acquired a grayer hue  the sumach grape and maple were already changed and the milkweed had turned to a deep rich yellow  in all woods the leaves were fast ripening for their fall for their full veins and lively gloss mark the ripe leaf and not the sered one of the poets and we knew that the maples stripped of their leaves among the earliest would soon stand like a wreath of smoke along the edge of the meadow  already the cattle were heard to low wildly in the pastures and along the highways restlessly running to and fro as if in apprehension of the withering of the grass and of the approach of winter  our thoughts too began to rustle  as i pass along the streets of our village of concord on the day of our annual cattleshow when it usually happens that the leaves of the elms and buttonwoods begin first to strew the ground under the breath of the october wind the lively spirits in their sap seem to mount as high as any ploughboys let loose that day and they lead my thoughts away to the rustling woods where the trees are preparing for their winter campaign  this autumnal festival when men are gathered in crowds in the streets as regularly and by as natural a law as the leaves cluster and rustle by the wayside is naturally associated in my mind with the fall of the year  the low of cattle in the streets sounds like a hoarse symphony or running bass to the rustling of the leaves  the wind goes hurrying down the country gleaning every loose straw that is left in the fields while every farmer lad too appears to scud before ithaving donned his best peajacket and pepperandsalt waistcoat his unbent trousers outstanding rigging of duck or kerseymere or corduroy and his furry hat withalto country fairs and cattleshows to that rome among the villages where the treasures of the year are gathered  all the land over they go leaping the fences with their tough idle palms which have never learned to hang by their sides amid the low of calves and the bleating of sheepamos abner elnathan elbridge       from steep pinebearing mountains to the plain  i love these sons of earth every mothers son of them with their great hearty hearts rushing tumultuously in herds from spectacle to spectacle as if fearful lest there should not be time between sun and sun to see them all and the sun does not wait more than in hayingtime       wise natures darlings they live in the world      perplexing not themselves how it is hurled  running hither and thither with appetite for the coarse pastimes of the day now with boisterous speed at the heels of the inspired negro from whose larynx the melodies of all congo and guinea coast have broke loose into our streets now to see the procession of a hundred yoke of oxen all as august and grave as osiris or the droves of neat cattle and milch cows as unspotted as isis or io  such as had no love for nature                                      at all        came lovers home from this great festival  they may bring their fattest cattle and richest fruits to the fair but they are all eclipsed by the show of men  these are stirring autumn days when men sweep by in crowds amid the rustle of leaves like migrating finches this is the true harvest of the year when the air is but the breath of men and the rustling of leaves is as the trampling of the crowd  we read nowadays of the ancient festivals games and processions of the greeks and etruscans with a little incredulity or at least with little sympathy but how natural and irrepressible in every people is some hearty and palpable greeting of nature  the corybantes the bacchantes the rude primitive tragedians with their procession and goatsong and the whole paraphernalia of the panathenaea which appear so antiquated and peculiar have their parallel now  the husbandman is always a better greek than the scholar is prepared to appreciate and the old custom still survives while antiquarians and scholars grow gray in commemorating it  the farmers crowd to the fair today in obedience to the same ancient law which solon or lycurgus did not enact as naturally as bees swarm and follow their queen  it is worth the while to see the countrys people how they pour into the town the sober farmer folk now all agog their very shirt and coatcollars pointing forwardcollars so broad as if they had put their shirts on wrong end upward for the fashions always tend to superfluityand with an unusual springiness in their gait jabbering earnestly to one another  the more supple vagabond too is sure to appear on the least rumor of such a gathering and the next day to disappear and go into his hole like the seventeenyear locust in an evershabby coat though finer than the farmers best yet never dressed come to see the sport and have a hand in what is goingto know whats the row if there is any to be where some men are drunk some horses race some cockerels fight anxious to be shaking props under a table and above all to see the striped pig he especially is the creature of the occasion  he empties both his pockets and his character into the stream and swims in such a day  he dearly loves the social slush  there is no reserve of soberness in him  i love to see the herd of men feeding heartily on coarse and succulent pleasures as cattle on the husks and stalks of vegetables  though there are many crooked and crabbled specimens of humanity among them run all to thorn and rind and crowded out of shape by adverse circumstances like the third chestnut in the burr so that you wonder to see some heads wear a whole hat yet fear not that the race will fail or waver in them like the crabs which grow in hedges they furnish the stocks of sweet and thrifty fruits still  thus is nature recruited from age to age while the fair and palatable varieties die out and have their period  this is that mankind  how cheap must be the material of which so many men are made   the wind blew steadily down the stream so that we kept our sails set and lost not a moment of the forenoon by delays but from early morning until noon were continually dropping downward with our hands on the steeringpaddle which was thrust deep into the river or bending to the oar which indeed we rarely relinquished we felt each palpitation in the veins of our steed and each impulse of the wings which drew us above  the current of our thoughts made as sudden bends as the river which was continually opening new prospects to the east or south but we are aware that rivers flow most rapidly and shallowest at these points  the steadfast shores never once turned aside for us but still trended as they were made why then should we always turn aside for them  a man cannot wheedle nor overawe his genius  it requires to be conciliated by nobler conduct than the world demands or can appreciate  these winged thoughts are like birds and will not be handled even hens will not let you touch them like quadrupeds  nothing was ever so unfamiliar and startling to a man as his own thoughts  to the rarest genius it is the most expensive to succumb and conform to the ways of the world  genius is the worst of lumber if the poet would float upon the breeze of popularity  the bird of paradise is obliged constantly to fly against the wind lest its gay trappings pressing close to its body impede its free movements  he is the best sailor who can steer within the fewest points of the wind and extract a motive power out of the greatest obstacles  most begin to veer and tack as soon as the wind changes from aft and as within the tropics it does not blow from all points of the compass there are some harbors which they can never reach  the poet is no tender slip of fairy stock who requires peculiar institutions and edicts for his defence but the toughest son of earth and of heaven and by his greater strength and endurance his fainting companions will recognize the god in him  it is the worshippers of beauty after all who have done the real pioneer work of the world  the poet will prevail to be popular in spite of his faults and in spite of his beauties too  he will hit the nail on the head and we shall not know the shape of his hammer  he makes us free of his hearth and heart which is greater than to offer one the freedom of a city  great men unknown to their generation have their fame among the great who have preceded them and all true worldly fame subsides from their high estimate beyond the stars  orpheus does not hear the strains which issue from his lyre but only those which are breathed into it for the original strain precedes the sound by as much as the echo follows after  the rest is the perquisite of the rocks and trees and beasts  when i stand in a library where is all the recorded wit of the world but none of the recording a mere accumulated and not truly cumulative treasure where immortal works stand side by side with anthologies which did not survive their month and cobweb and mildew have already spread from these to the binding of those and happily i am reminded of what poetry isi perceive that shakespeare and milton did not foresee into what company they were to fall  alas that so soon the work of a true poet should be swept into such a dusthole  the poet will write for his peers alone  he will remember only that he saw truth and beauty from his position and expect the time when a vision as broad shall overlook the same field as freely  we are often prompted to speak our thoughts to our neighbors or the single travellers whom we meet on the road but poetry is a communication from our home and solitude addressed to all intelligence  it never whispers in a private ear  knowing this we may understand those sonnets said to be addressed to particular persons or to a mistresss eyebrow let none feel flattered by them  for poetry write love and it will be equally true  no doubt it is an important difference between men of genius or poets and men not of genius that the latter are unable to grasp and confront the thought which visits them  but it is because it is too faint for expression or even conscious impression  what merely quickens or retards the blood in their veins and fills their afternoons with pleasure they know not whence conveys a distinct assurance to the finer organization of the poet  we talk of genius as if it were a mere knack and the poet could only express what other men conceived  but in comparison with his task the poet is the least talented of any the writer of prose has more skill  see what talent the smith has  his material is pliant in his hands  when the poet is most inspired is stimulated by an aura which never even colors the afternoons of common men then his talent is all gone and he is no longer a poet  the gods do not grant him any skill more than another they never put their gifts into his hands but they encompass and sustain him with their breath  to say that god has given a man many and great talents frequently means that he has brought his heavens down within reach of his hands  when the poetic frenzy seizes us we run and scratch with our pen intent only on worms calling our mates around us like the cock and delighting in the dust we make but do not detect where the jewel lies which perhaps we have in the mean time cast to a distance or quite covered up again  the poets body even is not fed like other mens but he sometimes tastes the genuine nectar and ambrosia of the gods and lives a divine life  by the healthful and invigorating thrills of inspiration his life is preserved to a serene old age  some poems are for holidays only  they are polished and sweet but it is the sweetness of sugar and not such as toil gives to sour bread  the breath with which the poet utters his verse must be that by which he lives  great prose of equal elevation commands our respect more than great verse since it implies a more permanent and level height a life more pervaded with the grandeur of the thought  the poet often only makes an irruption like a parthian and is off again shooting while he retreats but the prose writer has conquered like a roman and settled colonies  the true poem is not that which the public read  there is always a poem not printed on paper coincident with the production of this stereotyped in the poets life  it is what he has become through his work  not how is the idea expressed in stone or on canvas or paper is the question but how far it has obtained form and expression in the life of the artist  his true work will not stand in any princes gallery     my life has been the poem i would have writ    but i could not both live and utter it               the poets delay       in vain i see the morning rise        in vain observe the western blaze      who idly look to other skies        expecting life by other ways       amidst such boundless wealth without        i only still am poor within      the birds have sung their summer out        but still my spring does not begin       shall i then wait the autumn wind        compelled to seek a milder day      and leave no curious nest behind        no woods still echoing to my lay  this raw and gusty day and the creaking of the oaks and pines on shore reminded us of more northern climes than greece and more wintry seas than the aegean  the genuine remains of ossian or those ancient poems which bear his name though of less fame and extent are in many respects of the same stamp with the iliad itself  he asserts the dignity of the bard no less than homer and in his era we hear of no other priest than he  it will not avail to call him a heathen because he personifies the sun and addresses it and what if his heroes did worship the ghosts of their fathers their thin airy and unsubstantial forms we worship but the ghosts of our fathers in more substantial forms  we cannot but respect the vigorous faith of those heathen who sternly believed somewhat and are inclined to say to the critics who are offended by their superstitious ritesdont interrupt these mens prayers  as if we knew more about human life and a god than the heathen and ancients  does english theology contain the recent discoveries  ossian reminds us of the most refined and rudest eras of homer pindar isaiah and the american indian  in his poetry as in homers only the simplest and most enduring features of humanity are seen such essential parts of a man as stonehenge exhibits of a temple we see the circles of stone and the upright shaft alone  the phenomena of life acquire almost an unreal and gigantic size seen through his mists  like all older and grander poetry it is distinguished by the few elements in the lives of its heroes  they stand on the heath between the stars and the earth shrunk to the bones and sinews  the earth is a boundless plain for their deeds  they lead such a simple dry and everlasting life as hardly needs depart with the flesh but is transmitted entire from age to age  there are but few objects to distract their sight and their life is as unencumbered as the course of the stars they gaze at       the wrathful kings on cairns apart      look forward from behind their shields      and mark the wandering stars      that brilliant westward move  it does not cost much for these heroes to live they do not want much furniture  they are such forms of men only as can be seen afar through the mist and have no costume nor dialect but for language there is the tongue itself and for costume there are always the skins of beasts and the bark of trees to be had  they live out their years by the vigor of their constitutions  they survive storms and the spears of their foes and perform a few heroic deeds and then       mounds will answer questions of them      for many future years  blind and infirm they spend the remnant of their days listening to the lays of the bards and feeling the weapons which laid their enemies low and when at length they die by a convulsion of nature the bard allows us a short and misty glance into futurity yet as clear perchance as their lives had been  when macroine was slain       his soul departed to his warlike sires      to follow misty forms of boars      in tempestuous islands bleak  the heros cairn is erected and the bard sings a brief significant strain which will suffice for epitaph and biography       the weak will find his bow in the dwelling      the feeble will attempt to bend it  compared with this simple fibrous life our civilized history appears the chronicle of debility of fashion and the arts of luxury  but the civilized man misses no real refinement in the poetry of the rudest era  it reminds him that civilization does but dress men  it makes shoes but it does not toughen the soles of the feet  it makes cloth of finer texture but it does not touch the skin  inside the civilized man stand the savage still in the place of honor  we are those blueeyed yellowhaired saxons those slender darkhaired normans  the profession of the bard attracted more respect in those days from the importance attached to fame  it was his province to record the deeds of heroes  when ossian hears the traditions of inferior bards he exclaims       i straightway seize the unfutile tales      and send them down in faithful verse  his philosophy of life is expressed in the opening of the third duan of calodin       whence have sprung the things that are      and whither roll the passing years      where does time conceal its two heads      in dense impenetrable gloom      its surface marked with heroes deeds alone      i view the generations gone      the past appears but dim      as objects by the moons faint beams      reflected from a distant lake      i see indeed the thunderbolts of war      but there the unmighty joyless dwell      all those who send not down their deeds      to far succeeding times  the ignoble warriors die and are forgotten       strangers come to build a tower      and throw their ashes overhand      some rusted swords appear in dust      one bending forward says      the arms belonged to heroes gone      we never heard their praise in song  the grandeur of the similes is another feature which characterizes great poetry  ossian seems to speak a gigantic and universal language  the images and pictures occupy even much space in the landscape as if they could be seen only from the sides of mountains and plains with a wide horizon or across arms of the sea  the machinery is so massive that it cannot be less than natural  oivana says to the spirit of her father grayhaired torkil of torne seen in the skies       thou glidest away like receding ships  so when the hosts of fingal and starne approach to battle       with murmurs loud like rivers far      the race of torne hither moved  and when compelled to retire       dragging his spear behind      cudulin sank in the distant wood      like a fire upblazing ere it dies  nor did fingal want a proper audience when he spoke       a thousand orators inclined      to hear the lay of fingal  the threats too would have deterred a man  vengeance and terror were real  trenmore threatens the young warrior whom he meets on a foreign strand       thy mother shall find thee pale on the shore      while lessening on the waves she spies      the sails of him who slew her son  if ossians heroes weep it is from excess of strength and not from weakness a sacrifice or libation of fertile natures like the perspiration of stone in summers heat  we hardly know that tears have been shed and it seems as if weeping were proper only for babes and heroes  their joy and their sorrow are made of one stuff like rain and snow the rainbow and the mist  when fillan was worsted in fight and ashamed in the presence of fingal       he strode away forthwith      and bent in grief above a stream      his cheeks bedewed with tears      from time to time the thistles gray      he lopped with his inverted lance  crodar blind and old receives ossian son of fingal who comes to aid him in war       my eyes have failed says he crodar is blind      is thy strength like that of thy fathers      stretch ossian thine arm to the hoaryhaired         i gave my arm to the king      the aged hero seized my hand      he heaved a heavy sigh      tears flowed incessant down his cheek      strong art thou son of the mighty      though not so dreadful as morvens prince       let my feast be spread in the hall      let every sweetvoiced minstrel sing      great is he who is within my walls      sons of waveechoing croma  even ossian himself the herobard pays tribute to the superior strength of his father fingal       how beauteous mighty man was thy mind      why succeeded ossian without its strength                          while we sailed fleetly before the wind with the river gurgling under our stern the thoughts of autumn coursed as steadily through our minds and we observed less what was passing on the shore than the dateless associations and impressions which the season awakened anticipating in some measure the progress of the year       i hearing get who had but ears        and sight who had but eyes before      i moments live who lived but years        and truth discern who knew but learnings lore   sitting with our faces now up stream we studied the landscape by degrees as one unrolls a map rock tree house hill and meadow assuming new and varying positions as wind and water shifted the scene and there was variety enough for our entertainment in the metamorphoses of the simplest objects viewed from this side the scenery appeared new to us  the most familiar sheet of water viewed from a new hilltop yields a novel and unexpected pleasure  when we have travelled a few miles we do not recognize the profiles even of the hills which overlook our native village and perhaps no man is quite familiar with the horizon as seen from the hill nearest to his house and can recall its outline distinctly when in the valley we do not commonly know beyond a short distance which way the hills range which take in our houses and farms in their sweep as if our birth had at first sundered things and we had been thrust up through into nature like a wedge and not till the wound heals and the scar disappears do we begin to discover where we are and that nature is one and continuous everywhere it is an important epoch when a man who has always lived on the east side of a mountain and seen it in the west travels round and sees it in the east  yet the universe is a sphere whose centre is wherever there is intelligence  the sun is not so central as a man  upon an isolated hilltop in an open country we seem to ourselves to be standing on the boss of an immense shield the immediate landscape being apparently depressed below the more remote and rising gradually to the horizon which is the rim of the shield villas steeples forests mountains one above another till they are swallowed up in the heavens  the most distant mountains in the horizon appear to rise directly from the shore of that lake in the woods by which we chance to be standing while from the mountaintop not only this but a thousand nearer and larger lakes are equally unobserved  seen through this clear atmosphere the works of the farmer his ploughing and reaping had a beauty to our eyes which he never saw  how fortunate were we who did not own an acre of these shores who had not renounced our title to the whole  one who knew how to appropriate the true value of this world would be the poorest man in it  the poor rich man all he has is what he has bought  what i see is mine  i am a large owner in the merrimack intervals       men dig and dive but cannot my wealth spend        who yet no partial store appropriate      who no armed ship into the indies send        to rob me of my orient estate  he is the rich man and enjoys the fruits of riches who summer and winter forever can find delight in his own thoughts  buy a farm what have i to pay for a farm which a farmer will take  when i visit again some haunt of my youth i am glad to find that nature wears so well  the landscape is indeed something real and solid and sincere and i have not put my foot through it yet  there is a pleasant tract on the bank of the concord called conantum which i have in my mindthe old deserted farmhouse the desolate pasture with its bleak cliff the open wood the riverreach the green meadow in the midst and the mossgrown wildapple orchardplaces where one may have many thoughts and not decide anything  it is a scene which i can not only remember as i might a vision but when i will can bodily revisit and find it even so unaccountable yet unpretending in its pleasant dreariness  when my thoughts are sensible of change i love to see and sit on rocks which i have known and pry into their moss and see unchangeableness so established  i not yet gray on rocks forever gray i no longer green under the evergreens  there is something even in the lapse of time by which time recovers itself  as we have said it proved a cool as well as breezy day and by the time we reached penichook brook we were obliged to sit muffled in our cloaks while the wind and current carried us along  we bounded swiftly over the rippling surface far by many cultivated lands and the ends of fences which divided innumerable farms with hardly a thought for the various lives which they separated now by long rows of alders or groves of pines or oaks and now by some homestead where the women and children stood outside to gaze at us till we had swept out of their sight and beyond the limit of their longest saturday ramble  we glided past the mouth of the nashua and not long after of salmon brook without more pause than the wind       salmon brook      penichook      ye sweet waters of my brain      when shall i look      or cast the hook      in your waves again       silver eels      wooden creels      these the baits that still allure      and dragonfly      that floated by      may they still endure  the shadows chased one another swiftly over wood and meadow and their alternation harmonized with our mood  we could distinguish the clouds which cast each one though never so high in the heavens  when a shadow flits across the landscape of the soul where is the substance  probably if we were wise enough we should see to what virtue we are indebted for any happier moment we enjoy  no doubt we have earned it at some time for the gifts of heaven are never quite gratuitous  the constant abrasion and decay of our lives makes the soil of our future growth  the wood which we now mature when it becomes virgin mould determines the character of our second growth whether that be oaks or pines every man casts a shadow not his body only but his imperfectly mingled spirit  this is his grief  let him turn which way he will it falls opposite to the sun short at noon long at eve did you never see itbut referred to the sun it is widest at its base which is no greater than his own opacity  the divine light is diffused almost entirely around us and by means of the refraction of light or else by a certain selfluminousness or as some will have it transparency if we preserve ourselves untarnished we are able to enlighten our shaded side  at any rate our darkest grief has that bronze color of the moon eclipsed  there is no ill which may not be dissipated like the dark if you let in a stronger light upon it  shadows referred to the source of light are pyramids whose bases are never greater than those of the substances which cast them but light is a spherical congeries of pyramids whose very apexes are the sun itself and hence the system shines with uninterrupted light but if the light we use is but a paltry and narrow taper most objects will cast a shadow wider than themselves  the places where we had stopped or spent the night in our way up the river had already acquired a slight historical interest for us for many upward days voyaging were unravelled in this rapid downward passage  when one landed to stretch his limbs by walking he soon found himself falling behind his companion and was obliged to take advantage of the curves and ford the brooks and ravines in haste to recover his ground  already the banks and the distant meadows wore a sober and deepened tinge for the september air had shorn them of their summers pride       and whats a life  the flourishing array      of the proud summer meadow which today      wears her green plush and is tomorrow hay  the air was really the fine element which the poets describe it had a finer and sharper grain seen against the russet pastures and meadows than before as if cleansed of the summers impurities  having passed the new hampshire line and reached the horseshoe interval in tyngsborough where there is a high and regular second bank we climbed up this in haste to get a nearer sight of the autumnal flowers asters goldenrod and yarrow and bluecurls trichostema dichotoma humble roadside blossoms and lingering still the harebell and the rhexia virginica the last growing in patches of lively pink flowers on the edge of the meadows had almost too gay an appearance for the rest of the landscape like a pink ribbon on the bonnet of a puritan woman  asters and goldenrods were the livery which nature wore at present  the latter alone expressed all the ripeness of the season and shed their mellow lustre over the fields as if the now declining summers sun had bequeathed its hues to them  it is the floral solstice a little after midsummer when the particles of golden light the sundust have as it were fallen like seeds on the earth and produced these blossoms  on every hillside and in every valley stood countless asters coreopses tansies goldenrods and the whole race of yellow flowers like brahminical devotees turning steadily with their luminary from morning till night       i see the goldenrod shine bright        as sunshowers at the birth of day      a golden plume of yellow light       that robs the daygods splendid ray       the asters violet rays divide        the bank with many stars for me      and yarrow in blanch tints is dyed        as moonlight floats across the sea       i see the emerald woods prepare        to shed their vestiture once more      and distant elmtrees spot the air        with yellow pictures softly oer                                 no more the waterlilys pride        in milkwhite circles swims content      no more the blueweeds clusters ride        and mock the heavens element                                 autumn thy wreath and mine are blent        with the same colors for to me      a richer sky than all is lent        while fades my dreamlike company       our skies glow purple but the wind        sobs chill through green trees and bright graas      today shines fair and lurk behind        the times that into winter pass       so fair we seem so cold we are        so fast we hasten to decay      yet through our night glows many a star        that still shall claim its sunny day  so sang a concord poet once  there is a peculiar interest belonging to the still later flowers which abide with us the approach of winter  there is something witchlike in the appearance of the witchhazel which blossoms late in october and in november with its irregular and angular spray and petals like furies hair or small ribbon streamers  its blossoming too at this irregular period when other shrubs have lost their leaves as well as blossoms looks like witches craft  certainly it blooms in no garden of mans there is a whole fairyland on the hillside where it grows  some have thought that the gales do not at present waft to the voyager the natural and original fragrance of the land such as the early navigators described and that the loss of many odoriferous native plants sweetscented grasses and medicinal herbs which formerly sweetened the atmosphere and rendered it salubriousby the grazing of cattle and the rooting of swine is the source of many diseases which now prevail the earth say they having been long subjected to extremely artificial and luxurious modes of cultivation to gratify the appetite converted into a stye and hotbed where men for profit increase the ordinary decay of nature   according to the record of an old inhabitant of tyngsborough now dead whose farm we were now gliding past one of the greatest freshets on this river took place in october 1785 and its height was marked by a nail driven into an appletree behind his house  one of his descendants has shown this to me and i judged it to be at least seventeen or eighteen feet above the level of the river at the time  according to barber the river rose twentyone feet above the common highwater mark at bradford in the year 1818  before the lowell and nashua railroad was built the engineer made inquiries of the inhabitants along the banks as to how high they had known the river to rise  when he came to this house he was conducted to the appletree and as the nail was not then visible the lady of the house placed her hand on the trunk where she said that she remembered the nail to have been from her childhood  in the mean while the old man put his arm inside the tree which was hollow and felt the point of the nail sticking through and it was exactly opposite to her hand the spot is now plainly marked by a notch in the bark  but as no one else remembered the river to have risen so high as this the engineer disregarded this statement and i learn that there has since been a freshet which rose within nine inches of the rails at biscuit brook and such a freshet as that of 1785 would have covered the railroad two feet deep  the revolutions of nature tell as fine tales and make as interesting revelations on this rivers banks as on the euphrates or the nile  this appletree which stands within a few rods of the river is called elishas appletree from a friendly indian who was anciently in the service of jonathan tyng and with one other man was killed here by his own race in one of the indian warsthe particulars of which affair were told us on the spot  he was buried close by no one knew exactly where but in the flood of 1785 so great a weight of water standing over the grave caused the earth to settle where it had once been disturbed and when the flood went down a sunken spot exactly of the form and size of the grave revealed its locality but this was now lost again and no future flood can detect it yet no doubt nature will know how to point it out in due time if it be necessary by methods yet more searching and unexpected thus there is not only the crisis when the spirit ceases to inspire and expand the body marked by a fresh mound in the churchyard but there is also a crisis when the body ceases to take up room as such in nature marked by a fainter depression in the earth  we sat awhile to rest us here upon the brink of the western bank surrounded by the glossy leaves of the red variety of the mountain laurel just above the head of wicasuck island where we could observe some scows which were loading with clay from the opposite shore and also overlook the grounds of the farmer of whom i have spoken who once hospitably entertained us for a night  he had on his pleasant farm besides an abundance of the beachplum or prunus littoralis which grew wild the canada plum under cultivation fine porter apples some peaches and large patches of musk and water melons which he cultivated for the lowell market  elishas appletree too bore a native fruit which was prized by the family  he raised the blood peach which as he showed us with satisfaction was more like the oak in the color of its bark and in the setting of its branches and was less liable to break down under the weight of the fruit or the snow than other varieties  it was of slower growth and its branches strong and tough  there also was his nursery of native appletrees thickly set upon the bank which cost but little care and which he sold to the neighboring farmers when they were five or six years old  to see a single peach upon its stem makes an impression of paradisaical fertility and luxury  this reminded us even of an old roman farm as described by varrocaesar vopiscus aedilicius when he pleaded before the censors said that the grounds of rosea were the garden sumen the tidbit of italy in which a pole being left would not be visible the day after on account of the growth of the herbage  this soil may not have been remarkably fertile yet at this distance we thought that this anecdote might be told of the tyngsborough farm  when we passed wicasuck island there was a pleasureboat containing a youth and a maiden on the island brook which we were pleased to see since it proved that there were some hereabouts to whom our excursion would not be wholly strange before this a canalboatman of whom we made some inquiries respecting wicasuck island and who told us that it was disputed property suspected that we had a claim upon it and though we assured him that all this was news to us and explained as well as we could why we had come to see it he believed not a word of it and seriously offered us one hundred dollars for our title the only other small boats which we met with were used to pick up driftwood  some of the poorer class along the stream collect in this way all the fuel which they require  while one of us landed not far from this island to forage for provisions among the farmhouses whose roofs we saw for our supply was now exhausted the other sitting in the boat which was moored to the shore was left alone to his reflections  if there is nothing new on the earth still the traveller always has a resource in the skies  they are constantly turning a new page to view  the wind sets the types on this blue ground and the inquiring may always read a new truth there  there are things there written with such fine and subtile tinctures paler than the juice of limes that to the diurnal eye they leave no trace and only the chemistry of night reveals them  every mans daylight firmament answers in his mind to the brightness of the vision in his starriest hour  these continents and hemispheres are soon run over but an always unexplored and infinite region makes off on every side from the mind further than to sunset and we can make no highway or beaten track into it but the grass immediately springs up in the path for we travel there chiefly with our wings  sometimes we see objects as through a thin haze in their eternal relations and they stand like palenque and the pyramids and we wonder who set them up and for what purpose  if we see the reality in things of what moment is the superficial and apparent longer  what are the earth and all its interests beside the deep surmise which pierces and scatters them  while i sit here listening to the waves which ripple and break on this shore i am absolved from all obligation to the past and the council of nations may reconsider its votes  the grating of a pebble annuls them  still occasionally in my dreams i remember that rippling water       oft as i turn me on my pillow oer      i hear the lapse of waves upon the shore      distinct as if it were at broad noonday      and i were drifting down from nashua  with a bending sail we glided rapidly by tyngsborough and chelmsford each holding in one hand half of a tart country applepie which we had purchased to celebrate our return and in the other a fragment of the newspaper in which it was wrapped devouring these with divided relish and learning the news which had transpired since we sailed  the river here opened into a broad and straight reach of great length which we bounded merrily over before a smacking breeze with a devilmaycare look in our faces and our boat a white bone in its mouth and a speed which greatly astonished some scow boatmen whom we met  the wind in the horizon rolled like a flood over valley and plain and every tree bent to the blast and the mountains like schoolboys turned their cheeks to it  they were great and current motions the flowing sail the running stream the waving tree the roving wind  the northwind stepped readily into the harness which we had provided and pulled us along with good will  sometimes we sailed as gently and steadily as the clouds overhead watching the receding shores and the motions of our sail the play of its pulse so like our own lives so thin and yet so full of life so noiseless when it labored hardest so noisy and impatient when least effective now bending to some generous impulse of the breeze and then fluttering and flapping with a kind of human suspense  it was the scale on which the varying temperature of distant atmospheres was graduated and it was some attraction for us that the breeze it played with had been out of doors so long thus we sailed not being able to fly but as next best making a long furrow in the fields of the merrimack toward our home with our wings spread but never lifting our heel from the watery trench gracefully ploughing homeward with our brisk and willing team wind and stream pulling together the former yet a wild steer yoked to his more sedate fellow  it was very near flying as when the duck rushes through the water with an impulse of her wings throwing the spray about her before she can rise  how we had stuck fast if drawn up but a few feet on the shore  when we reached the great bend just above middlesex where the river runs east thirtyfive miles to the sea we at length lost the aid of this propitious wind though we contrived to make one long and judicious tack carry us nearly to the locks of the canal  we were here locked through at noon by our old friend the lover of the higher mathematics who seemed glad to see us safe back again through so many locks but we did not stop to consider any of his problems though we could cheerfully have spent a whole autumn in this way another time and never have asked what his religion was  it is so rare to meet with a man outdoors who cherishes a worthy thought in his mind which is independent of the labor of his hands  behind every mans busyness there should be a level of undisturbed serenity and industry as within the reef encircling a coral isle there is always an expanse of still water where the depositions are going on which will finally raise it above the surface   the eye which can appreciate the naked and absolute beauty of a scientific truth is far more rare than that which is attracted by a moral one  few detect the morality in the former or the science in the latter  aristotle defined art to be logos tou ergou aneu hyles the principle of the work without the wood but most men prefer to have some of the wood along with the principle they demand that the truth be clothed in flesh and blood and the warm colors of life  they prefer the partial statement because it fits and measures them and their commodities best  but science still exists everywhere as the sealer of weights and measures at least  we have heard much about the poetry of mathematics but very little of it has yet been sung  the ancients had a juster notion of their poetic value than we  the most distinct and beautiful statement of any truth must take at last the mathematical form we might so simplify the rules of moral philosophy as well as of arithmetic that one formula would express them both  all the moral laws are readily translated into natural philosophy for often we have only to restore the primitive meaning of the words by which they are expressed or to attend to their literal instead of their metaphorical sense  they are already supernatural philosophy  the whole body of what is now called moral or ethical truth existed in the golden age as abstract science  or if we prefer we may say that the laws of nature are the purest morality  the tree of knowledge is a tree of knowledge of good and evil  he is not a true man of science who does not bring some sympathy to his studies and expect to learn something by behavior as well as by application  it is childish to rest in the discovery of mere coincidences or of partial and extraneous laws  the study of geometry is a petty and idle exercise of the mind if it is applied to no larger system than the starry one  mathematics should be mixed not only with physics but with ethics that is mixed mathematics  the fact which interests us most is the life of the naturalist  the purest science is still biographical  nothing will dignify and elevate science while it is sundered so wholly from the moral life of its devotee and he professes another religion than it teaches and worships at a foreign shrine  anciently the faith of a philosopher was identical with his system or in other words his view of the universe  my friends mistake when they communicate facts to me with so much pains  their presence even their exaggerations and loose statements are equally good facts for me  i have no respect for facts even except when i would use them and for the most part i am independent of those which i hear and can afford to be inaccurate or in other words to substitute more present and pressing facts in their place  the poet uses the results of science and philosophy and generalizes their widest deductions  the process of discovery is very simple  an unwearied and systematic application of known laws to nature causes the unknown to reveal themselves  almost any mode of observation will be successful at last for what is most wanted is method only let something be determined and fixed around which observation may rally  how many new relations a footrule alone will reveal and to how many things still this has not been applied  what wonderful discoveries have been and may still be made with a plumbline a level a surveyors compass a thermometer or a barometer  where there is an observatory and a telescope we expect that any eyes will see new worlds at once i should say that the most prominent scientific men of our country and perhaps of this age are either serving the arts and not pure science or are performing faithful but quite subordinate labors in particular departments  they make no steady and systematic approaches to the central fact  a discovery is made and at once the attention of all observers is distracted to that and it draws many analogous discoveries in its train as if their work were not already laid out for them but they had been lying on their oars  there is wanting constant and accurate observation with enough of theory to direct and discipline it  but above all there is wanting genius  our books of science as they improve in accuracy are in danger of losing the freshness and vigor and readiness to appreciate the real laws of nature which is a marked merit in the ofttimes false theories of the ancients  i am attracted by the slight pride and satisfaction the emphatic and even exaggerated style in which some of the older naturalists speak of the operations of nature though they are better qualified to appreciate than to discriminate the facts  their assertions are not without value when disproved if they are not facts they are suggestions for nature herself to act upon  the greeks says gesner had a common proverb lagos katheudon a sleeping hare for a dissembler or counterfeit because the hare sees when she sleeps for this is an admirable and rare work of nature that all the residue of her bodily parts take their rest but the eye standeth continually sentinel  observation is so wide awake and facts are being so rapidly added to the sum of human experience that it appears as if the theorizer would always be in arrears and were doomed forever to arrive at imperfect conclusions but the power to perceive a law is equally rare in all ages of the world and depends but little on the number of facts observed  the senses of the savage will furnish him with facts enough to set him up as a philosopher the ancients can still speak to us with authority even on the themes of geology and chemistry though these studies are thought to have had their birth in modern times  much is said about the progress of science in these centuries  i should say that the useful results of science had accumulated but that there had been no accumulation of knowledge strictly speaking for posterity for knowledge is to be acquired only by a corresponding experience  how can we know what we are told merely  each man can interpret anothers experience only by his own  we read that newton discovered the law of gravitation but how many who have heard of his famous discovery have recognized the same truth that he did  it may be not one  the revelation which was then made to him has not been superseded by the revelation made to any successor       we see the planet fall      and that is all  in a review of sir james clark rosss antarctic voyage of discovery there is a passage which shows how far a body of men are commonly impressed by an object of sublimity and which is also a good instance of the step from the sublime to the ridiculous  after describing the discovery of the antarctic continent at first seen a hundred miles distant over fields of icestupendous ranges of mountains from seven and eight to twelve and fourteen thousand feet high covered with eternal snow and ice in solitary and inaccessible grandeur at one time the weather being beautifully clear and the sun shining on the icy landscape a continent whose islands only are accessible and these exhibited not the smallest trace of vegetation only in a few places the rocks protruding through their icy covering to convince the beholder that land formed the nucleus and that it was not an icebergthe practical british reviewer proceeds thus sticking to his last on the 22d of january afternoon the expedition made the latitude of 74 degrees 20 and by 7h pm having ground ground where did they get ground to believe that they were then in a higher southern latitude than had been attained by that enterprising seaman the late captain james weddel and therefore higher than all their predecessors an extra allowance of grog was issued to the crews as a reward for their perseverance  let not us sailors of late centuries take upon ourselves any airs on account of our newtons and our cuviers we deserve an extra allowance of grog only   we endeavored in vain to persuade the wind to blow through the long corridor of the canal which is here cut straight through the woods and were obliged to resort to our old expedient of drawing by a cord  when we reached the concord we were forced to row once more in good earnest with neither wind nor current in our favor but by this time the rawness of the day had disappeared and we experienced the warmth of a summer afternoon this change in the weather was favorable to our contemplative mood and disposed us to dream yet deeper at our oars while we floated in imagination farther down the stream of time as we had floated down the stream of the merrimack to poets of a milder period than had engaged us in the morning  chelmsford and billerica appeared like old english towns compared with merrimack and nashua and many generations of civil poets might have lived and sung here  what a contrast between the stern and desolate poetry of ossian and that of chaucer and even of shakespeare and milton much more of dryden and pope and gray  our summer of english poetry like the greek and latin before it seems well advanced toward its fall and laden with the fruit and foliage of the season with bright autumnal tints but soon the winter will scatter its myriad clustering and shading leaves and leave only a few desolate and fibrous boughs to sustain the snow and rime and creak in the blasts of ages  we cannot escape the impression that the muse has stooped a little in her flight when we come to the literature of civilized eras  now first we hear of various ages and styles of poetry it is pastoral and lyric and narrative and didactic but the poetry of runic monuments is of one style and for every age  the bard has in a great measure lost the dignity and sacredness of his office  formerly he was called a seer but now it is thought that one man sees as much as another  he has no longer the bardic rage and only conceives the deed which he formerly stood ready to perform  hosts of warriors earnest for battle could not mistake nor dispense with the ancient bard  his lays were heard in the pauses of the fight  there was no danger of his being overlooked by his contemporaries  but now the hero and the bard are of different professions  when we come to the pleasant english verse the storms have all cleared away and it will never thunder and lighten more  the poet has come within doors and exchanged the forest and crag for the fireside the hut of the gael and stonehenge with its circles of stones for the house of the englishman  no hero stands at the door prepared to break forth into song or heroic action but a homely englishman who cultivates the art of poetry  we see the comfortable fireside and hear the crackling fagots in all the verse  notwithstanding the broad humanity of chaucer and the many social and domestic comforts which we meet with in his verse we have to narrow our vision somewhat to consider him as if he occupied less space in the landscape and did not stretch over hill and valley as ossian does  yet seen from the side of posterity as the father of english poetry preceded by a long silence or confusion in history unenlivened by any strain of pure melody we easily come to reverence him  passing over the earlier continental poets since we are bound to the pleasant archipelago of english poetry chaucers is the first name after that misty weather in which ossian lived which can detain us long  indeed though he represents so different a culture and society he may be regarded as in many respects the homer of the english poets  perhaps he is the youthfullest of them all  we return to him as to the purest well the fountain farthest removed from the highway of desultory life  he is so natural and cheerful compared with later poets that we might almost regard him as a personification of spring  to the faithful reader his muse has even given an aspect to his times and when he is fresh from perusing him they seem related to the golden age  it is still the poetry of youth and life rather than of thought and though the moral vein is obvious and constant it has not yet banished the sun and daylight from his verse  the loftiest strains of the muse are for the most part sublimely plaintive and not a carol as free as natures  the content which the sun shines to celebrate from morning to evening is unsung  the muse solaces herself and is not ravished but consoled  there is a catastrophe implied and a tragic element in all our verse and less of the lark and morning dews than of the nightingale and evening shades  but in homer and chaucer there is more of the innocence and serenity of youth than in the more modern and moral poets  the iliad is not sabbath but morning reading and men cling to this old song because they still have moments of unbaptized and uncommitted life which give them an appetite for more  to the innocent there are neither cherubim nor angels  at rare intervals we rise above the necessity of virtue into an unchangeable morning light in which we have only to live right on and breathe the ambrosial air  the iliad represents no creed nor opinion and we read it with a rare sense of freedom and irresponsibility as if we trod on native ground and were autochthones of the soil  chaucer had eminently the habits of a literary man and a scholar there were never any times so stirring that there were not to be found some sedentary still  he was surrounded by the din of arms  the battles of hallidon hill and nevilles cross and the still more memorable battles of cressy and poictiers were fought in his youth but these did not concern our poet much wickliffe and his reform much more  he regarded himself always as one privileged to sit and converse with books  he helped to establish the literary class  his character as one of the fathers of the english language would alone make his works important even those which have little poetical merit  he was as simple as wordsworth in preferring his homely but vigorous saxon tongue when it was neglected by the court and had not yet attained to the dignity of a literature and rendered a similar service to his country to that which dante rendered to italy  if greek sufficeth for greek and arabic for arabian and hebrew for jew and latin for latin then english shall suffice for him for any of these will serve to teach truth right as divers pathes leaden divers folke the right waye to rome in the testament of love he writes let then clerkes enditen in latin for they have the propertie of science and the knowinge in that facultie and lette frenchmen in their frenche also enditen their queinte termes for it is kyndely to their mouthes and let us shewe our fantasies in soche wordes as we lerneden of our dames tonge  he will know how to appreciate chaucer best who has come down to him the natural way through the meagre pastures of saxon and antechaucerian poetry and yet so human and wise he appears after such diet that we are liable to misjudge him still  in the saxon poetry extant in the earliest english and the contemporary scottish poetry there is less to remind the reader of the rudeness and vigor of youth than of the feebleness of a declining age  it is for the most part translation of imitation merely with only an occasional and slight tinge of poetry oftentimes the falsehood and exaggeration of fable without its imagination to redeem it and we look in vain to find antiquity restored humanized and made blithe again by some natural sympathy between it and the present  but chaucer is fresh and modern still and no dust settles on his true passages  it lightens along the line and we are reminded that flowers have bloomed and birds sung and hearts beaten in england  before the earnest gaze of the reader the rust and moss of time gradually drop off and the original green life is revealed  he was a homely and domestic man and did breathe quite as modern men do  there is no wisdom that can take place of humanity and we find that in chaucer  we can expand at last in his breadth and we think that we could have been that mans acquaintance  he was worthy to be a citizen of england while petrarch and boccacio lived in italy and tell and tamerlane in switzerland and in asia and bruce in scotland and wickliffe and gower and edward the third and john of gaunt and the black prince were his own countrymen as well as contemporaries all stout and stirring names  the fame of roger bacon came down from the preceding century and the name of dante still possessed the influence of a living presence  on the whole chaucer impresses us as greater than his reputation and not a little like homer and shakespeare for he would have held up his head in their company  among early english poets he is the landlord and host and has the authority of such  the affectionate mention which succeeding early poets make of him coupling him with homer and virgil is to be taken into the account in estimating his character and influence  king james and dunbar of scotland speak of him with more love and reverence than any modern author of his predecessors of the last century  the same childlike relation is without a parallel now for the most part we read him without criticism for he does not plead his own cause but speaks for his readers and has that greatness of trust and reliance which compels popularity  he confides in the reader and speaks privily with him keeping nothing back  and in return the reader has great confidence in him that he tells no lies and reads his story with indulgence as if it were the circumlocution of a child but often discovers afterwards that he has spoken with more directness and economy of words than a sage  he is never heartless       for first the thing is thought within the hart      er any word out from the mouth astart  and so new was all his theme in those days that he did not have to invent but only to tell  we admire chaucer for his sturdy english wit  the easy height he speaks from in his prologue to the canterbury tales as if he were equal to any of the company there assembled is as good as any particular excellence in it  but though it is full of good sense and humanity it is not transcendent poetry  for picturesque description of persons it is perhaps without a parallel in english poetry yet it is essentially humorous as the loftiest genius never is  humor however broad and genial takes a narrower view than enthusiasm  to his own finer vein he added all the common wit and wisdom of his time and everywhere in his works his remarkable knowledge of the world and nice perception of character his rare common sense and proverbial wisdom are apparent  his genius does not soar like miltons but is genial and familiar  it shows great tenderness and delicacy but not the heroic sentiment  it is only a greater portion of humanity with all its weakness  he is not heroic as raleigh nor pious as herbert nor philosophical as shakespeare but he is the child of the english muse that child which is the father of the man  the charm of his poetry consists often only in an exceeding naturalness perfect sincerity with the behavior of a child rather than of a man  gentleness and delicacy of character are everywhere apparent in his verse  the simplest and humblest words come readily to his lips  no one can read the prioresss tale understanding the spirit in which it was written and in which the child sings o alma redemptoris mater or the account of the departure of constance with her child upon the sea in the man of lawes tale without feeling the native innocence and refinement of the author  nor can we be mistaken respecting the essential purity of his character disregarding the apology of the manners of the age  a simple pathos and feminine gentleness which wordsworth only occasionally approaches but does not equal are peculiar to him  we are tempted to say that his genius was feminine not masculine  it was such a feminineness however as is rarest to find in woman though not the appreciation of it perhaps it is not to be found at all in woman but is only the feminine in man  such pure and genuine and childlike love of nature is hardly to be found in any poet  chaucers remarkably trustful and affectionate character appears in his familiar yet innocent and reverent manner of speaking of his god  he comes into his thought without any false reverence and with no more parade than the zephyr to his ear  if nature is our mother then god is our father  there is less love and simple practical trust in shakespeare and milton  how rarely in our english tongue do we find expressed any affection for god certainly there is no sentiment so rare as the love of god herbert almost alone expresses it ah my dear god our poet uses similar words with propriety and whenever he sees a beautiful person or other object prides himself on the maistry of his god  he even recommends dido to be his bride       if that god that heaven and yearth made      would have a love for beauty and goodnesse      and womanhede trouth and semeliness  but in justification of our praise we must refer to his works themselves to the prologue to the canterbury tales the account of gentilesse the flower and the leaf the stories of griselda virginia ariadne and blanche the dutchesse and much more of less distinguished merit  there are many poets of more taste and better manners who knew how to leave out their dulness but such negative genius cannot detain us long we shall return to chaucer still with love  some natures which are really rude and illdeveloped have yet a higher standard of perfection than others which are refined and well balanced  even the clown has taste whose dictates though he disregards them are higher and purer than those which the artist obeys  if we have to wander through many dull and prosaic passages in chaucer we have at least the satisfaction of knowing that it is not an artificial dulness but too easily matched by many passages in life  we confess that we feel a disposition commonly to concentrate sweets and accumulate pleasures but the poet may be presumed always to speak as a traveller who leads us through a varied scenery from one eminence to another and it is perhaps more pleasing after all to meet with a fine thought in its natural setting  surely fate has enshrined it in these circumstances for some end  nature strews her nuts and flowers broadcast and never collects them into heaps  this was the soil it grew in and this the hour it bloomed in if sun wind and rain came here to cherish and expand the flower shall not we come here to pluck it   a true poem is distinguished not so much by a felicitous expression or any thought it suggests as by the atmosphere which surrounds it  most have beauty of outline merely and are striking as the form and bearing of a stranger but true verses come toward us indistinctly as the very breath of all friendliness and envelop us in their spirit and fragrance  much of our poetry has the very best manners but no character  it is only an unusual precision and elasticity of speech as if its author had taken not an intoxicating draught but an electuary it has the distinct outline of sculpture and chronicles an early hour  under the influence of passion all men speak thus distinctly but wrath is not always divine  there are two classes of men called poets  the one cultivates life the other artone seeks food for nutriment the other for flavor one satisfies hunger the other gratifies the palate there are two kinds of writing both great and rare one that of genius or the inspired the other of intellect and taste in the intervals of inspiration  the former is above criticism always correct giving the law to criticism  it vibrates and pulsates with life forever  it is sacred and to be read with reverence as the works of nature are studied  there are few instances of a sustained style of this kind perhaps every man has spoken words but the speaker is then careless of the record  such a style removes us out of personal relations with its author we do not take his words on our lips but his sense into our hearts  it is the stream of inspiration which bubbles out now here now there now in this man now in that  it matters not through what icecrystals it is seen now a fountain now the ocean stream running under ground  it is in shakespeare alpheus in burns arethuse but ever the same  the other is selfpossessed and wise  it is reverent of genius and greedy of inspiration  it is conscious in the highest and the least degree  it consists with the most perfect command of the faculties  it dwells in a repose as of the desert and objects are as distinct in it as oases or palms in the horizon of sand  the train of thought moves with subdued and measured step like a caravan  but the pen is only an instrument in its hand and not instinct with life like a longer arm  it leaves a thin varnish or glaze over all its work  the works of goethe furnish remarkable instances of the latter  there is no just and serene criticism as yet  nothing is considered simply as it lies in the lap of eternal beauty but our thoughts as well as our bodies must be dressed after the latest fashions  our taste is too delicate and particular  it says nay to the poets work but never yea to his hope  it invites him to adorn his deformities and not to cast them off by expansion as the tree its bark  we are a people who live in a bright light in houses of pearl and porcelain and drink only light wines whose teeth are easily set on edge by the least natural sour  if we had been consulted the backbone of the earth would have been made not of granite but of bristol spar a modern author would have died in infancy in a ruder age  but the poet is something more than a scald a smoother and polisher of language he is a cincinnatus in literature and occupies no west end of the world  like the sun he will indifferently select his rhymes and with a liberal taste weave into his verse the planet and the stubble  in these old books the stucco has long since crumbled away and we read what was sculptured in the granite  they are rude and massive in their proportions rather than smooth and delicate in their finish  the workers in stone polish only their chimney ornaments but their pyramids are roughly done  there is a soberness in a rough aspect as of unhewn granite which addresses a depth in us but a polished surface hits only the ball of the eye  the true finish is the work of time and the use to which a thing is put  the elements are still polishing the pyramids  art may varnish and gild but it can do no more a work of genius is roughhewn from the first because it anticipates the lapse of time and has an ingrained polish which still appears when fragments are broken off an essential quality of its substance  its beauty is at the same time its strength and it breaks with a lustre  the great poem must have the stamp of greatness as well as its essence  the reader easily goes within the shallowest contemporary poetry and informs it with all the life and promise of the day as the pilgrim goes within the temple and hears the faintest strains of the worshippers but it will have to speak to posterity traversing these deserts through the ruins of its outmost walls by the grandeur and beauty of its proportions     but here on the stream of the concord where we have all the while been bodily nature who is superior to all styles and ages is now with pensive face composing her poem autumn with which no work of man will bear to be compared  in summer we live out of doors and have only impulses and feelings which are all for action and must wait commonly for the stillness and longer nights of autumn and winter before any thought will subside we are sensible that behind the rustling leaves and the stacks of grain and the bare clusters of the grape there is the field of a wholly new life which no man has lived that even this earth was made for more mysterious and nobler inhabitants than men and women  in the hues of october sunsets we see the portals to other mansions than those which we occupy not far off geographically       there is a place beyond that flaming hill      from whence the stars their thin appearance shed      a place beyond all place where never ill      nor impure thought was ever harbored  sometimes a mortal feels in himself nature not his father but his mother stirs within him and he becomes immortal with her immortality  from time to time she claims kindredship with us and some globule from her veins steals up into our own       i am the autumnal sun      with autumn gales my race is run      when will the hazel put forth its flowers      or the grape ripen under my bowers      when will the harvest or the hunters moon      turn my midnight into midnoon      i am all sere and yellow      and to my core mellow      the mast is dropping within my woods      the winter is lurking within my moods      and the rustling of the withered leaf      is the constant music of my grief  to an unskilful rhymer the muse thus spoke in prose  the moon no longer reflects the day but rises to her absolute rule and the husbandman and hunter acknowledge her for their mistress  asters and goldenrods reign along the way and the lifeeverlasting withers not  the fields are reaped and shorn of their pride but an inward verdure still crowns them  the thistle scatters its down on the pool and yellow leaves clothe the vine and naught disturbs the serious life of men  but behind the sheaves and under the sod there lurks a ripe fruit which the reapers have not gathered the true harvest of the year which it bears forever annually watering and maturing it and man never severs the stalk which bears this palatable fruit   men nowhere east or west live yet a natural life round which the vine clings and which the elm willingly shadows  man would desecrate it by his touch and so the beauty of the world remains veiled to him  he needs not only to be spiritualized but naturalized on the soil of earth  who shall conceive what kind of roof the heavens might extend over him what seasons minister to him and what employment dignify his life  only the convalescent raise the veil of nature  an immortality in his life would confer immortality on his abode  the winds should be his breath the seasons his moods and he should impart of his serenity to nature herself  but such as we know him he is ephemeral like the scenery which surrounds him and does not aspire to an enduring existence  when we come down into the distant village visible from the mountaintop the nobler inhabitants with whom we peopled it have departed and left only vermin in its desolate streets  it is the imagination of poets which puts those brave speeches into the mouths of their heroes they may feign that catos last words were       the earth the air and seas i know and all      the joys and horrors of their peace and wars      and now will view the gods state and the stars  but such are not the thoughts nor the destiny of common men what is this heaven which they expect if it is no better than they expect  are they prepared for a better than they can now imagine  where is the heaven of him who dies on a stage in a theatre  here or nowhere is our heaven       although we see celestial bodies move      above the earth the earth we till and love  we can conceive of nothing more fair than something which we have experienced  the remembrance of youth is a sigh we linger in manhood to tell the dreams of our childhood and they are half forgotten ere we have learned the language  we have need to be earthborn as well as heavenborn gegeneis as was said of the titans of old or in a better sense than they  there have been heroes for whom this world seemed expressly prepared as if creation had at last succeeded whose daily life was the stuff of which our dreams are made and whose presence enhanced the beauty and ampleness of nature herself  where they walked       largior hic campos aether et lumine vestit      purpureo solemque suum sua sidera norunt  here a more copious air invests the fields and clothes with purple light and they know their own sun and their own stars we love to hear some men speak though we hear not what they say the very air they breathe is rich and perfumed and the sound of their voices falls on the ear like the rustling of leaves or the crackling of the fire  they stand many deep  they have the heavens for their abettors as those who have never stood from under them and they look at the stars with an answering ray their eyes are like glowworms and their motions graceful and flowing as if a place were already found for them like rivers flowing through valleys  the distinctions of morality of right and wrong sense and nonsense are petty and have lost their significance beside these pure primeval natures  when i consider the clouds stretched in stupendous masses across the sky frowning with darkness or glowing with downy light or gilded with the rays of the setting sun like the battlements of a city in the heavens their grandeur appears thrown away on the meanness of my employment the drapery is altogether too rich for such poor acting  i am hardly worthy to be a suburban dweller outside those walls               unless above himself he can      erect himself how poor a thing is man  with our music we would fain challenge transiently another and finer sort of intercourse than our daily toil permits  the strains come back to us amended in the echo as when a friend reads our verse  why have they so painted the fruits and freighted them with such fragrance as to satisfy a more than animal appetite       i asked the schoolman his advice was free      but scored me out too intricate a way  these things imply perchance that we live on the verge of another and purer realm from which these odors and sounds are wafted over to us  the borders of our plot are set with flowers whose seeds were blown from more elysian fields adjacent  they are the potherbs of the gods  some fairer fruits and sweeter fragrances wafted over to us betray another realms vicinity there too does echo dwell and there is the abutment of the rainbows arch       a finer race and finer fed      feast and revel oer our head      and we titmen are only able      to catch the fragments from their table      theirs is the fragrance of the fruits      while we consume the pulp and roots      what are the moments that we stand      astonished on the olympian land  we need pray for no higher heaven than the pure senses can furnish a purely sensuous life  our present senses are but the rudiments of what they are destined to become  we are comparatively deaf and dumb and blind and without smell or taste or feeling  every generation makes the discovery that its divine vigor has been dissipated and each sense and faculty misapplied and debauched  the ears were made not for such trivial uses as men are wont to suppose but to hear celestial sounds  the eyes were not made for such grovelling uses as they are now put to and worn out by but to behold beauty now invisible  may we not see god  are we to be put off and amused in this life as it were with a mere allegory  is not nature rightly read that of which she is commonly taken to be the symbol merely  when the common man looks into the sky which he has not so much profaned he thinks it less gross than the earth and with reverence speaks of the heavens but the seer will in the same sense speak of the earths and his father who is in them  did not he that made that which is within make that which is without also what is it then to educate but to develop these divine germs called the senses for individuals and states to deal magnanimously with the rising generation leading it not into temptationnot teach the eye to squint nor attune the ear to profanity  but where is the instructed teacher  where are the normal schools  a hindoo sage said as a dancer having exhibited herself to the spectator desists from the dance so does nature desist having manifested herself to soul  nothing in my opinion is more gentle than nature once aware of having been seen she does not again expose herself to the gaze of soul   it is easier to discover another such a new world as columbus did than to go within one fold of this which we appear to know so well the land is lost sight of the compass varies and mankind mutiny and still history accumulates like rubbish before the portals of nature  but there is only necessary a moments sanity and sound senses to teach us that there is a nature behind the ordinary in which we have only some vague preemption right and western reserve as yet  we live on the outskirts of that region  carved wood and floating boughs and sunset skies are all that we know of it  we are not to be imposed on by the longest spell of weather  let us not my friends be wheedled and cheated into good behavior to earn the salt of our eternal porridge whoever they are that attempt it  let us wait a little and not purchase any clearing here trusting that richer bottoms will soon be put up  it is but thin soil where we stand i have felt my roots in a richer ere this  i have seen a bunch of violets in a glass vase tied loosely with a straw which reminded me of myself       i am a parcel of vain strivings tied          by a chance bond together        dangling this way and that their links          were made so loose and wide                         methinks               for milder weather       a bunch of violets without their roots          and sorrel intermixed        encircled by a wisp of straw          once coiled about their shoots                         the law               by which im fixed       a nosegay which time clutched from out           those fair elysian fields        with weeds and broken stems in haste           doth make the rabble rout                         that waste               the day he yields       and here i bloom for a short hour unseen           drinking my juices up        with no root in the land           to keep my branches green                          but stand               in a bare cup       some tender buds were left upon my stem          in mimicry of life        but ah the children will not know          till time has withered them                          the woe               with which theyre rife       but now i see i was not plucked for naught          and after in lifes vase        of glass set while i might survive          but by a kind hand brought                          alive                to a strange place       that stock thus thinned will soon redeem its hours          and by another year        such as god knows with freer air          more fruits and fairer flowers                        will bear                while i droop here  this world has many rings like saturn and we live now on the outmost of them all  none can say deliberately that he inhabits the same sphere or is contemporary with the flower which his hands have plucked and though his feet may seem to crush it inconceivable spaces and ages separate them and perchance there is no danger that he will hurt it  what do the botanists know our lives should go between the lichen and the bark  the eye may see for the hand but not for the mind  we are still being born and have as yet but a dim vision of sea and land sun moon and stars and shall not see clearly till after nine days at least that is a pathetic inquiry among travellers and geographers after the site of ancient troy  it is not near where they think it is when a thing is decayed and gone how indistinct must be the place it occupied  the anecdotes of modern astronomy affect me in the same way as do those faint revelations of the real which are vouchsafed to men from time to time or rather from eternity to eternity  when i remember the history of that faint light in our firmament which we call venus which ancient men regarded and which most modern men still regard as a bright spark attached to a hollow sphere revolving about our earth but which we have discovered to be another world in itselfhow copernicus reasoning long and patiently about the matter predicted confidently concerning it before yet the telescope had been invented that if ever men came to see it more clearly than they did then they would discover that it had phases like our moon and that within a century after his death the telescope was invented and that prediction verified by galileoi am not without hope that we may even here and now obtain some accurate information concerning that other world which the instinct of mankind has so long predicted indeed all that we call science as well as all that we call poetry is a particle of such information accurate as far as it goes though it be but to the confines of the truth  if we can reason so accurately and with such wonderful confirmation of our reasoning respecting socalled material objects and events infinitely removed beyond the range of our natural vision so that the mind hesitates to trust its calculations even when they are confirmed by observation why may not our speculations penetrate as far into the immaterial starry system of which the former is but the outward and visible type  surely we are provided with senses as well fitted to penetrate the spaces of the real the substantial the eternal as these outward are to penetrate the material universe  veias menu zoroaster socrates christ shakespeare swedenborgthese are some of our astronomers  there are perturbations in our orbits produced by the influence of outlying spheres and no astronomer has ever yet calculated the elements of that undiscovered world which produces them i perceive in the common train of my thoughts a natural and uninterrupted sequence each implying the next or if interruption  occurs it is occasioned by a new object being presented to my senses  but a steep and sudden and by these means unaccountable transition is that from a comparatively narrow and partial what is called common sense view of things to an infinitely expanded and liberating one from seeing things as men describe them to seeing them as men cannot describe them  this implies a sense which is not common but rare in the wisest mans experience which is sensible or sentient of more than common  in what enclosures does the astronomer loiter  his skies are shoal and imagination like a thirsty traveller pants to be through their desert  the roving mind impatiently bursts the fetters of astronomical orbits like cobwebs in a corner of its universe and launches itself to where distance fails to follow and law such as science has discovered grows weak and weary the mind knows a distance and a space of which all those sums combined do not make a unit of measurethe interval between that which appears and that which is  i know that there are many stars i know that they are far enough off bright enough steady enough in their orbitsbut what are they all worth they are more waste land in the weststar territoryto be made slave states perchance if we colonize them  i have interest but for six feet of star and that interest is transient  then farewell to all ye bodies such as i have known ye   every man if he is wise will stand on such bottom as will sustain him and if one gravitates downward more strongly than another he will not venture on those meads where the latter walks securely but rather leave the cranberries which grow there unraked by himself  perchance some spring a higher freshet will float them within his reach though they may be watery and frostbitten by that time  such shrivelled berries i have seen in many a poor mans garret ay in many a churchbin and statecoffer and with a little water and heat they swell again to their original size and fairness and added sugar enough stead mankind for sauce to this worlds dish  what is called common sense is excellent in its department and as invaluable as the virtue of conformity in the army and navyfor there must be subordinationbut uncommon sense that sense which is common only to the wisest is as much more excellent as it is more rare  some aspire to excellence in the subordinate department and may god speed them  what fuller says of masters of colleges is universally applicable that a little alloy of dulness in a master of a college makes him fitter to manage secular affairs

and amidst the gloom of night presented me with the water of immortality   in the life of sadi by dowlat shah occurs this sentence the eagle of the immaterial soul of shaikh sadi shook from his plumage the dust of his body   thus thoughtfully we were rowing homeward to find some autumnal work to do and help on the revolution of the seasons  perhaps nature would condescend to make use of us even without our knowledge as when we help to scatter her seeds in our walks and carry burrs and cockles on our clothes from field to field       all things are current found      on earthly ground      spirits and elements      have their descents       night and day year on year      high and low far and near      these are our own aspects      these are our own regrets       ye gods of the shore      who abide evermore      i see your far headland      stretching on either hand       i hear the sweet evening sounds      from your undecaying grounds      cheat me no more with time      take me to your clime  as it grew later in the afternoon and we rowed leisurely up the gentle stream shut in between fragrant and blooming banks where we had first pitched our tent and drew nearer to the fields where our lives had passed we seemed to detect the hues of our native sky in the southwest horizon  the sun was just setting behind the edge of a wooded hill so rich a sunset as would never have ended but for some reason unknown to men and to be marked with brighter colors than ordinary in the scroll of time  though the shadows of the hills were beginning to steal over the stream the whole river valley undulated with mild light purer and more memorable than the noon  for so day bids farewell even to solitary vales uninhabited by man  two herons ardea herodias with their long and slender limbs relieved against the sky were seen travelling high over our headstheir lofty and silent flight as they were wending their way at evening surely not to alight in any marsh on the earths surface but perchance on the other side of our atmosphere a symbol for the ages to study whether impressed upon the sky or sculptured amid the hieroglyphics of egypt  bound to some northern meadow they held on their stately stationary flight like the storks in the picture and disappeared at length behind the clouds  dense flocks of blackbirds were winging their way along the rivers course as if on a short evening pilgrimage to some shrine of theirs or to celebrate so fair a sunset       therefore as doth the pilgrim whom the night      hastes darkly to imprison on his way      think on thy home my soul and think aright      of whats yet left thee of lifes wasting day      thy sun posts westward passed is thy morn      and twice it is not given thee to be born  the sunsetting presumed all men at leisure and in a contemplative mood but the farmers boy only whistled the more thoughtfully as he drove his cows home from pasture and the teamster refrained from cracking his whip and guided his team with a subdued voice the last vestiges of daylight at length disappeared and as we rowed silently along with our backs toward home through the darkness only a few stars being visible we had little to say but sat absorbed in thought or in silence listened to the monotonous sound of our oars a sort of rudimental music suitable for the ear of night and the acoustics of her dimly lighted halls       pulsae referunt ad sidera valles  and the valleys echoed the sound to the stars  as we looked up in silence to those distant lights we were reminded that it was a rare imagination which first taught that the stars are worlds and had conferred a great benefit on mankind  it is recorded in the chronicle of bernaldez that in columbuss first voyage the natives pointed towards the heavens making signs that they believed that there was all power and holiness  we have reason to be grateful for celestial phenomena for they chiefly answer to the ideal in man  the stars are distant and unobtrusive but bright and enduring as our fairest and most memorable experiences  let the immortal depth of your soul lead you but earnestly extend your eyes upwards   as the truest society approaches always nearer to solitude so the most excellent speech finally falls into silence  silence is audible to all men at all times and in all places  she is when we hear inwardly sound when we hear outwardly  creation has not displaced her but is her visible framework and foil  all sounds are her servants and purveyors proclaiming not only that their mistress is but is a rare mistress and earnestly to be sought after  they are so far akin to silence that they are but bubbles on her surface which straightway burst an evidence of the strength and prolificness of the undercurrent a faint utterance of silence and then only agreeable to our auditory nerves when they contrast themselves with and relieve the former in proportion as they do this and are heighteners and intensifiers of the silence they are harmony and purest melody  silence is the universal refuge the sequel to all dull discourses and all foolish acts a balm to our every chagrin as welcome after satiety as after disappointment that background which the painter may not daub be he master or bungler and which however awkward a figure we may have made in the foreground remains ever our inviolable asylum where no indignity can assail no personality disturb us  the orator puts off his individuality and is then most eloquent when most silent  he listens while he speaks and is a hearer along with his audience  who has not hearkened to her infinite din  she is truths speakingtrumpet the sole oracle the true delphi and dodona which kings and courtiers would do well to consult nor will they be balked by an ambiguous answer  for through her all revelations have been made and just in proportion as men have consulted her oracle within they have obtained a clear insight and their age has been marked as an enlightened one  but as often as they have gone gadding abroad to a strange delphi and her mad priestess their age has been dark and leaden  such were garrulous and noisy eras which no longer yield any sound but the grecian or silent and melodious era is ever sounding and resounding in the ears of men  a good book is the plectrum with which our else silent lyres are struck  we not unfrequently refer the interest which belongs to our own unwritten sequel to the written and comparatively lifeless body of the work  of all books this sequel is the most indispensable part  it should be the authors aim to say once and emphatically he said ephe e  this is the most the bookmaker can attain to  if he make his volume a mole whereon the waves of silence may break it is well  it were vain for me to endeavor to interrupt the silence  she cannot be done into english  for six thousand years men have translated her with what fidelity belonged to each and still she is little better than a sealed book  a man may run on confidently for a time thinking he has her under his thumb and shall one day exhaust her but he too must at last be silent and men remark only how brave a beginning he made for when he at length dives into her so vast is the disproportion of the told to the untold that the former will seem but the bubble on the surface where he disappeared  nevertheless we will go on like those chinese cliff swallows feathering our nests with the froth which may one day be bread of life to such as dwell by the seashore   we had made about fifty miles this day with sail and oar and now far in the evening our boat was grating against the bulrushes of its native port and its keel recognized the concord mud where some semblance of its outline was still preserved in the flattened flags which had scarce yet erected themselves since our departure and we leaped gladly on shore drawing it up and fastening it to the wild appletree whose stem still bore the mark which its chain had worn in the chafing of the spring freshets                            the end    in the original text there were accented letters in a few lines as follows    sabr according to the french
