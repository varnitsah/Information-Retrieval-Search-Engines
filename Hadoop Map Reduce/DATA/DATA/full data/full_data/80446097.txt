quarters  you forget our mirth and talk at the tables the kine in the shed and the horse in the stables to pitch her sides and go over her cables  then you drive out where the stormclouds swallow and

  may repossess his blood  the men of my own stock   bitter bad they may be but at least they hear the things i hear   and see the things i see and whatever i think of them and their likes   they think of the likes of me  this was my fathers belief   and this is also mine let the corn be all one sheaf   and the grapes be all one vine ere our childrens teeth are set on edge   by bitter bread

rimini till the eagles flew from rimini and ive tramped britain and ive tramped gaul and the pontic shore where the snowflakes fall as white as the neck of lalage as cold as the heart of lalage and ive lost britain and ive lost gaul and ive lost rome and worst of all ive lost lalage  when you go by the via aurelia as thousands have travelled before remember the luck of the soldier who never saw rome any more oh dear was the sweetheart that kissed him and dear was the mother that bore but his shield was picked up in the heather and he never saw rome any more  and he left rome etc  when you go by the via aurelia that runs from the city to gaul remember the luck of the soldier who rose to be master of all he carried the sword and the buckler he mounted his guard on the wall till the legions elected him cæsar and he rose to be master of all  and he left rome etc  its twentyfive marches to narbo its fortyfive more up the rhone and the end may be death in the heather or life on an emperors throne  but whether the eagles obey us or we go to the ravensalone id sooner be lalages lover than sit on an emperors throne  weve all left rome for lalages sake etc     poor honest men  ad 1800   your jar of virginny will cost you a guinea which you reckon too much by five shillings or ten but light your churchwarden and judge it according when ive told you the troubles of poor honest men

we do it nor when but a light on each quarter low down on the water is well understanded by poor honest men  even then we have dangers from meddlesome strangers who spy on our business and are not content to take a smooth answer except with a handspike  and they  say they are murdered by poor honest men  to be drowned or be shot is our natural lot why should we moreover be hanged in the end

bleak houses by the shore seven summers by the shore   mid two hundred brothers  there we met with famous men   set in office oer us and they beat on us with rods faithfully with many rods daily beat on us with rods   for the love they bore us  out of egypt unto troy   over himalaya far and sure our bands have gone hybrasil or babylon islands of the southern run   and cities of cathaia  and we all praise famous men   ancients of the college for they taught us common sense tried to teach us common sense truth and gods own common sense   which is more than knowledge  each degree of latitude   strung about creation seeth one or more of us of one muster each of us diligent in that he does   keen in his vocation  this we learned from famous men   knowing not its uses when they showed in daily

of kings bearing gifts to divers kings   gifts of case and shrapnel  this we learned from famous men   teaching in our borders who declarèd it was best safest easiest and best expeditious wise and best   to obey your orders  some beneath the further stars   bear the greater burden set to serve the lands they rule save he serve no man may rule serve and love the lands they rule   seeking praise nor guerdon  this we learned from famous men   knowing not we learned it only as the years went by lonely as the years went by far from help as years went by   plainer we discerned it  wherefore praise we famous men   from whose bays we borrow they that put aside today all the joys of their today and with toil of their today   bought for us tomorrow  bless and praise we famous men   men of

hands are slow to toil his ears are deaf to reason his lips are loud in broil he knows no use for power except to show his might he gives no heed to judgment unless it prove him right  because he served a master before his kingship came and hid in all disaster behind his masters name so when his folly opens the unnecessary hells a servant when he reigneth throws the blame on some one else  his

appointed a man her prince and ruler to be  but after this was ordained the ancient legends tell there came dark israel for whom no river remained  then he whom the rivers obey said to him fling on the ground a handful of yellow clay and a fifth great river shall run mightier than these four in secret the earth around and her secret evermore shall be shown to thee and thy race so it was said and done and deep in the veins of earth and fed by a thousand springs that comfort the marketplace or sap the power of kings the fifth great river had birth even as it was foretold the secret river of gold  and israel laid down his sceptre and his crown to brood on that rivers bank where the waters flashed and sank and burrowed in earth and fell and bided a season below for reason that none might know save only israel  he is lord of the last the fifth most wonderful flood he hears her thunder past and her song is in his blood he can foresay she will fall for he knows which fountain dries behind which desertbelt a thousand leagues to the south  he can foresay she will rise he knows what far snows melt along what mountainwall a thousand leagues to the north he snuffs the coming drouth as he snuffs the coming rain he knows what each will bring forths and turns it to his gain  a ruler without a throne a prince without a sword israel follows his quest in every land a guest of many lands a lord in no land king is he but the fifth great river keeps the secret of her deeps for israel alone as it was ordered to be     the childrens song   land of our birth we pledge to thee our

    an astrologers song   to the heavens above us   o look and behold the planets that love us   all harnessed in gold what chariots what horses   against us shall bide while the stars in their courses   do fight on our side  all thought all desires   that are under the sun are one with their fires   as we also are one all matter all spirit   all fashion all frame receive and inherit   their strength from the same  oh man that deniest   all power save thine own their power in the highest   is mightily shown not less in the lowest   that power is made clear oh man if thou knowest   what treasure is here  earth quakes in her throes   and we wonder for why but the blind planet knows   when her ruler is nigh and attuned since creation   to perfect accord she thrills in her station   and yearns to her lord  the waters have risen   the springs are unbound the floods break their prison   and ravin around no rampart withstands em   their fury will last till the sign that commands em   sinks low or swings past  through abysses unproven   oer gulfs beyond thought our portion is woven   our burden is brought yet they that prepare it   whose nature we share make us who must bear it   well able to bear  though terrors oertake us   well not be afraid no power can unmake us   save that which has made nor yet beyond reason   or hope shall we fall all things have their season   and mercy crowns all  then doubt not ye fearful   the eternal is king up heart and be cheerful   and lustily sing what chariots what horses   against us shall bide while the stars in their courses   do fight on our side     the power of the dog   there is sorrow enough in the natural way from men and women to fill our day but when we are certain of sorrow in store why do we always arrange for more brothers and sisters i bid you beware of giving your heart to a dog to tear  buy a pup and your money will buy love unflinching that cannot lie perfect passion and worship fed by a kick in the ribs or a pat on the head nevertheless it is hardly fair to risk your heart for a dog to tear  when the fourteen years which nature permits are closing in asthma or tumour or fits and the vets unspoken prescription runs to lethal chambers or loaded guns then you will findits your own affair but  youve given your heart to a dog to tear  when the body that lived at your single will when the whimper of welcome is stilled how still when the spirit that answered your every mood is gonewherever it goesfor good you will discover how much you care and will give your heart to a dog to tear  weve sorrow enough in the natural way when it comes to burying christian clay our loves are not given but only lent at compound interest of cent per cent though it is not always the case i believe that the longer weve kept em the more do we grieve for when debts are payable right or wrong a shorttime loan is as bad as a long so why inheaven before we are there should we give our hearts to a dog to tear     the rabbis song   if thought can reach to heaven   on heaven let it dwell for fear thy thought be given   like power to reach to hell for fear the desolation   and darkness of thy mind perplex an habitation   which thou hast left behind  let nothing linger after   no whimpering ghost remain in wall or beam or rafter   of any hate or pain cleanse and call home thy spirit   deny her leave to cast on aught thy heirs inherit   the shadow of her past for think in all thy sadness   what road our griefs may take whose brain reflect our madness   or whom our terrors shake for think lest any languish   by cause of thy distress the arrows of our anguish   fly farther than we guess  our lives our tears as water   are spilled upon the ground god giveth no man quarter   yet god a means hath found though faith and hope have vanished   and even love grows dim a means whereby his banished   be not expelled from him     the bee boys song   bees bees hark to your bees hide from your neighbours as much as you please but all that has happened to us you must tell or else we will give you no honey to sell  a maiden in her glory   upon her weddingday must tell her bees the story   or else theyll fly away     fly awaydie away       dwindle down and leave you     but if you dont deceive your bees       your bees will not deceive you  marriage birth or buryin   news across the seas all youre sad or merry in   you must tell the bees     tell em coming in an out       where the fanners fan     cause the bees are just about       as curious as a man  dont you wait where trees are   when the lightnings play nor dont you hate where bees are   or else theyll pine away     pine awaydwine away       anything to leave you     but if you never grieve your bees       your beesll never grieve you     the return of the children   neither the harps nor the crowns amused nor the cherubs dovewinged races holding hands forlornly the children wandered beneath the dome plucking the

kneeled and caressed and made promise with kisses and drew them along to the gateway yea the alliron unbribeable door which peter must guard and none other straightway she took the keys from his keeping and opened and freed them straightway  then to her son who had seen and smiled she said on the night that i bore thee what didst thou care for a love beyond mine or a heaven that was not my arm didst thou push from the nipple o child to hear the angels adore thee when we two lay in the breath of the kine and he saidthou hast done no harm  so through the void the children ran homeward

their racial talks and such to barter beads for whitby jet   and tin for gay shell torques and such  but long and long before that time   when bison used to roam on it did taffy and her daddy climb

borders of britain the ancient poets sing between the cliff and the forest there ruled a saxon king stubborn all were his people from cottar to overlord not to be cowed by the cudgel scarce to be schooled by the sword quick to turn at their pleasure cruel to cross in their mood and set on paths of their choosing as the hogs of andreds wood laws they made in the witanthe laws of flaying and fine common loppage and pannage the theft and the track of kine statutes of tun and market for the fish and the malt and the meal the tax on the bramber packhorse and the tax on the hastings keel over the graves of the druids and under the wreck of rome rudely but surely they bedded the plinth of the days to come behind the feet of the legions and before the norsemans ire rudely but greatly begat they the framing of state and shire rudely but deeply they laboured and their labour stands till now if we trace on our ancient headlands the twist of their eightox plough there came a king from hamtun by bosenham he came he filled use with slaughter and lewes he gave to flame he smote while they sat in the witansudden he smote and sore that his fleet was gathered at selsea ere they mustered at cymens ore blithe went the saxons to battle by down and wood and mere but thrice the acorns ripened ere the western mark was clear thrice was the beechmast gathered and the beltane fires burned thrice and the beeves were salted thrice ere the host returned they drove that king from hamtun by bosenham oerthrown out of rugnor to wilton they made his land their own camps they builded at gilling at basing and alresford but wrath abode in the saxons from cottar to overlord wrath at the weary wargame at the foe that snapped and ran wolfwise feigning and flying and wolfwise snatching his man wrath for their spears unready their levies new to the blades shame for the helpless sieges and the scornful ambuscades at hearth and tavern and market wherever the tale was told shame and wrath had the saxons because of their boasts of old and some would drink and deny it and some would pray and atone but the most part after their anger avouched that the sin was their own wherefore girding together up to the witan they came and as they had shouldered their bucklers so did they shoulder their blame for that was the wont of the saxons the ancient poets sing and first they spoke in the witan and then they spoke to the king edward king of the saxons thou knowest from sire to son one is the king and his peoplein gain and ungain one count we the gain together with doubtings and spread dismays we have broken a foolish peoplebut after many days count we the loss together warlocks hampered our arms we were tricked as by magic we were turned as by charms we went down to the battle and the road was plain to keep but our angry eyes were holden and we struck as they strike in sleep men new shaken from slumber sweating with eyes astare little blows uncertain dealt on the useless air also a vision betrayed us and a lying tale made bold that we looked to hold what we had not and to have what we did not hold that a shield should give us shelterthat a sword should give us power a shield snatched up at a venture and a hilt scarce handled an hour that being rich in the open we should be strong in the close and the gods would sell us a cunning for the day that we met our foes this was the work of wizards but not with our foe they bide in our own camp we took them and their names are sloth and pride our pride was before the battle our sloth ere we lifted spear but hid in the heart of the people as the fever hides in the mere waiting only the wargame the heat of the strife to rise as the ague fumes round oxeney when the rotting reedbed dries but now we are purged of that fevercleansed by the letting of blood something leaner of bodysomething keener of mood and the men newfreed from the levies return to the fields again matching a hundred battles cottar and lord and thane and they talk aloud in the temples where the ancient wargods are they thumb and mock and belittle the holy harness of war they jest at the sacred chariots the robes and the gilded staff these things fill them with laughter they lean on their spears and laugh the men grown old in the wargame hither and thither they range and scorn and laughter together are sire and dam of change and

setting forth nor yet where he would go but only my lord of arundel and meanly did he show in an old jerkin and patched hose that no man might him mark with his frieze hood and cloak above he looked like any clerk  he was at hamull on the hoke about the hour of the tide and saw the mary haled into dock the winter to abide with all her tackle and habiliments which are the king his own but then ran on his false shipwrights and stripped her to the bone  they heaved the mainmast overboard that was of a trusty tree and they wrote down it was spent and lost by force of weather at sea but they sawen it into planks and strakes as far as it might go to maken beds for their own wives and little children also  there was a knave called slingawai he crope beneath the deck crying good felawes come and see the ship is nigh a wreck for the storm that took our tall mainmast it blew so fierce and fell alack it hath taken the kettles and pans and this brass pott as well  with that he set the pott on his head and hied him up the hatch while all the shipwrights ran below to find what they might snatch all except bob brygandyne and he was a yeoman good he caught slingawai round the waist and threw him on to the mud  i have taken plank and rope and nail without the king his leave after the custom of portesmouth but i will not suffer a thief nay never lift up thy hand at me theres no clean hands in

then came my lord of arundel pricking across the down and behind him the mayor and burgesses of merry suthampton town  they drew the naughty shipwrights up with the kettles in their hands and bound them round the forecastle to wait the kings commands but since ye have made your beds said the king ye needs must lie thereon for the sake of your wives and little onesfelawes get you gone  when they had beaten slingawai out of his own lips our king appointed brygandyne to be clerk of all his ships nay never lift up thy hands to metheres no clean hands in the trade but steal in measure said harry

keepers on their beds   and the keepers loosed the hounds  they had killed a hart they had killed a hind   ready to carry away when they heard a whimper down the wind   and they heard a bloodhound bay  they took and ran across the fern   their crossbows in their hand till they met a man with a green lantern   that called and bade em stand  what are ye doing o flesh and blood   and whats your foolish will that you must break into minepit wood   and wake the folk of the hill  oh weve broke into lord pelhams park   and killed lord pelhams deer and if ever you heard a little dog bark   youll know why we come here  we ask you let us go our way   as fast as we can flee for if ever you heard a bloodhound bay   youll know how pressed we be  oh lay your crossbows on the bank   and drop the knife from your hand and though the hounds are at your flank   ill save you where you stand  they laid their crossbows on the bank   they threw their knives in the wood and the ground before them opened and sank   and saved em where they stood  oh whats the roaring in our ears   that strikes us wellnigh dumb oh that is just how things appears   according as they come  what are the stars before our eyes   that strike us wellnigh blind oh that is just how things arise   according as you find  and whys our bed so hard to the bones   excepting where its cold oh thats because it is precious stones   excepting where tis gold  think it over as you stand   for i tell you without fail if you havent got into fairyland   youre not in lewes gaol  all night long they thought of it   and come the dawn they saw theyd tumbled into a great old pit   at the bottom of minepit shaw  and the keepers hound had followed em close   and broke her neck in the fall so they picked up their knives and their crossbows   and buried the dog thats all  but whether the man was a poacher too   or a phariseea so bold i reckon theres more things told than are true   and more things true than are told  footnote a
