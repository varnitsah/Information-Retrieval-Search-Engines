result of many years of personal observation in the woods and      fields they are studies of animals pure and simple not of      animals with human motives and imaginations       indeed it is hardly necessary for genuine interest to give human      traits to the beasts any animal is interesting enough as an      animal and has character enough of his own without borrowing      anything from manas one may easily find out by watching long      enough       most wild creatures have but small measure of gentleness in them      and that only by instinct and at short stated seasons hence i      have given both sides and both kinds the shadows and lights the      savagery as well as the gentleness of the wilderness creatures       it were pleasanter to be sure especially when you have been      deeply touched by some exquisite bit of animal devotion to let      it go at that and to carry with you henceforth an ideal      creature       but the whole truth is betterbetter for you better for      childrenelse personality becomes confused with mere animal      individuality and love turns to instinct and sentiment      vaporizes into sentimentality       this mother fox or fishhawk here this strong mother loon or      lynx that today brings the quick moisture to your eyes by her      utter devotion to the little helpless things which great mother      nature gave her to care for will tomorrow when they are grown      drive those same little ones with savage treatment into the world      to face its dangers alone and will turn away from their      sufferings thereafter with astounding indifference       it is well to remember this and to give proper weight to the      word when we speak of the love of animals for their little      ones       i met a bear oncebut this foolish thing is not to be      imitatedwith two small cubs following at her heels the mother      fled into the brush the cubs took to a tree after some timorous      watching i climbed after the cubs and shook them off and put      them into a bag and carried them to my canoe squealing and      appealing to the one thing in the woods that could easily have      helped them i was ready enough to quit all claims and to take to      the brush myself upon inducement but the mother had found a      blueberry patch and was stuffing herself industriously       and i have seen other mother bears since then and foxes and deer      and ducks and sparrows and almost all the wild creatures      between driving their own offspring savagely away generally      the young go of their own accord as early as possible knowing no      affection but only dependence and preferring liberty to      authority but more than once i have been touched by the sight of      a little one begging piteously to be fed or just to stay while      the mother drove him away impatiently moreover they all kill      their weaklings as a rule and the burdensome members of too      large a family this is not poetry or idealization but just      plain animal nature       as for the male animals little can be said truthfully for their      devotion father fox and wolf instead of caring for their mates      and their offspring as we fondly imagine live apart by      themselves in utter selfishness they do nothing whatever for the      support or instruction of the young and are never suffered by      the mothers to come into the den lest they destroy their own      little ones one need not go to the woods to see this his own      stable or kennel his own dog or cat will be likely to reveal the      startling brutality at the first good opportunity       an indiscriminate love for all animals likewise is not the best      sentiment to cultivate toward creation black snakes in a land of      birds sharks in the bluefish rips rabbits in australia and      weasels everywhere are out of place in the present economy of      nature big owls and hawks representing a yearly destruction of      thousands of good game birds and of untold innocent songsters      may also be profitably studied with a gun sometimes instead of      an operaglass a mink is good for nothing but his skin a red      squirreli hesitate to tell his true character lest i spoil too      many tender but false ideals about him all at once       the point is this that sympathy is too true a thing to be      aroused falsely and that a wise discrimination which recognizes      good and evil in the woods as everywhere else in the world and      which loves the one and hates the other is vastly better for      children young and old than the blind sentimentality aroused by      ideal animals with exquisite human propensities therefore i      wrote the story of kagax simply to show him as he is and so to      make you hate him       in this one chapter the story of kagax the weasel i have      gathered into a single animal the tricks and cruelties of a score      of vicious little brutes that i have caught redhanded at their      work in the other chapters i have for the most part again      searched my old notebooks and the records of wilderness camps      and put the individual animals down just as i found them                                                 wm j long        stamford september 1900                              contents     i megaleep the wanderer  ii killooleet little

indian names         i megaleep the wanderer  illustration megaleep   megaleep is the big woodland caribou of the northern wilderness his milicete name means the wandering one but it ought to mean the mysterious and the changeful as well if you hear that he is bold and fearless that is true and if you are told that he is shy and wary and inapproachable that is also true for he is never the same two days in succession at once shy and bold solitary and gregarious restless as a cloud yet clinging to his feeding grounds spite of wolves and hunters till he leaves them of his own free will wild as kakagos the raven but inquisitive as a blue jayhe is the most fascinating and the least known of all the deer  one thing is quite sure before you begin your study he is never where his tracks are nor anywhere near it and if after a seasons watching and following you catch one good glimpse of him that is a good beginning  i had always heard and read of megaleep as an awkward ungainly animal but almost my first glimpse of him scattered all that to the winds and set my nerves atingling in a way that they still remember it was on a great chain of barrens in the new brunswick wilderness i was following the trail of a herd of caribou one day when far ahead a strange clacking sound came ringing across the snow in the crisp winter air i ran ahead to a point of woods that cut off my view from a fivemile barren only to catch breath in astonishment and drop to cover behind a scrub spruce away up the barren my caribou a big herd of them were coming like an express train straight towards me at first i could make out only a great cloud of steam a whirl of flying snow and here and there the angry shake of wide antlers or the gleam of a black muzzle the loud clacking of their hoofs sweeping nearer and nearer gave a snap a tingle a wild exhilaration to their rush which made one want to shout and swing his hat presently i could make out the individual animals through the cloud of vapor that drove down the wind before them they were going at a splendid trot rocking easily from side to side like pacing colts power grace tirelessness in every stride their heads were high their muzzles up the antlers well back on heaving shoulders jets of steam burst from their nostrils at every bound for the thermometer was twenty below zero and the air snapping a cloud of snow whirled out and up behind them through it the antlers waved like bare oak boughs in the wind the sound of their hoofs was like the clicking of mighty castanetsoh for a sledge and bells i thought for santa claus never had such a team  so they came on swiftly magnificently straight on to the cover behind which i crouched with nerves thrilling as at a cavalry chargetill i sprang to my feet with a shout and swung my hat for as there was meat enough in camp i had small wish to use my rifle and no desire whatever to stand that rush at close quarters and be run down there was a moment of wild confusion out on the barren just in front of me the long swinging trot that caribou never change if they can help it was broken into an awkward jumping gallop the front rank reared plunged snorted a warning but were forced onward by the pressure behind then the leading bulls gave a few mighty bounds which brought them close up to me but left a clear space for the frightened crowding animals behind the swiftest shot ahead to the lead the great herd lengthened out from its compact mass swerved easily to the left as at a word of command crashed through the fringe of evergreen in which i had been hidingout into the open again with a wild plunge and a loud cracking of hoofs where they all settled into their wonderful trot again and kept on steadily across the barren below  that was the sight of a lifetime one who saw it could never again think of caribou as ungainly animals  megaleep belongs to the tribe of ishmael indeed his latin name as well as his indian one signifies the wanderer and if you watch him a little while you will understand perfectly why he is called so the first time i ever met him in summer in strong contrast to the winter herd made his name clear in a moment it was twilight on a wilderness lake i was sitting in my canoe by the inlet wondering what kind of bait to use for a big trout which lived in an eddy behind a rock and which disdained everything i offered him the swallows were busy skimming low and taking the young mosquitoes as they rose from the water one dipped to the surface near the eddy as he came down i saw a swift gleam in the depths below he touched the water there was a swirl a splashand the swallow was gone the trout had him  then a cow caribou came out of the woods onto the grassy point above me to drink first she wandered all over the point making it look afterwards as if a herd had passed then she took a sip of water by a rock crossed to my side of the point and took a sip there then to the end of the point and another sip then back to the first place a nibble of grass and she waded far out from shore to sip there then back with a nod to a lily pad and a sip nearer the brook finally she meandered a long way up the shore out of sight and when i picked up the paddle to go she came back again truly a wandergeist of the woods like the plover of the coast who never knows what he wants nor why he circles about so nor where he is going next  if you follow the herds over the barrens and through the forest in winter you find the same wandering unsatisfied creature and if you are a sportsman and a keen hunter with well established ways of trailing and stalking you will be driven to desperation a score of times before you get acquainted with megaleep he travels enormous distances without any known object his trail is everywhere he is himself nowhere you scour the country for a week crossing innumerable trails thinking the surrounding woods must be full of caribou then a man in a lumber camp where you are overtaken by night tells you that he saw the herd you are after way down on the renous barrens thirty miles below you go there and have the same experiencesigns everywhere old signs new signs but never a caribou and ten to one while you are there the caribou are sniffing your snowshoe track suspiciously back on the barrens that you have just left  even in feeding when you are hot on their trail and steal forward expecting to see them every moment it is the same exasperating story they dig a hole through four feet of packed snow to nibble the reindeer lichen that grows everywhere on the barrens before it is half eaten they wander off to the next barren and dig a larger hole then away to the woods for the graygreen hanging moss that grows on the spruces here is a fallen tree half covered with the rich food megaleep nibbles a bite or two then wanders away and away in search of another tree like the one he has just left  and when you find him at last the chances are still against you you are stealing forward cautiously when a fresh sign attracts attention you stop to examine it a moment something gray dim misty seems to drift like a cloud through the trees ahead you scarcely notice it till on your right a stir and another cloud and anotherthe caribou quick a score of them but before your rifle is up and you have found the sights the gray things melt into the gray woods and drift away and the stalk begins all over again  the reason for this restlessness is not far to seek megaleeps ancestors followed regular migrations in spring and autumn like the birds on the unwooded plains beyond the arctic circle megaleep never migrates but the old instinct is in him and will not let him rest so he wanders through the year and is never satisfied  fortunately nature has been kind to megaleep in providing him with means to gratify his wandering disposition in winter moose and red deer must gather into yards and stay there with the first heavy storm of december they gather in small bands here and there on the hardwood ridges and begin to make paths in the snowlong twisted crooked paths running for miles in every direction crossing and recrossing in a tangle utterly hopeless to any head save that of a deer or moose these paths they keep tramped down and more or less open all winter so as to feed on the twigs and bark growing on either side were it not for this curious provision a single severe winter would leave hardly a moose or a deer alive in the woods for their hoofs are sharp and sink deep and with six feet of snow on a level they can scarcely run half a mile outside their paths without becoming hopelessly stalled or exhausted  it is this great tangle of paths by the way which makes a deer or a moose yard and not the stupid hole in the snow which is pictured in the geographies and most natural history books  but megaleep the wanderer makes no such provision he depends upon mother nature to take care of him in summer he is brown like the great tree trunks among which he moves unseen then the frog of his foot expands and grows spongy so that he can cling to the mountainside like a goat or move silently over the dead leaves in winter he becomes a soft gray the better to fade into a snowstorm or to stand concealed in plain sight on the edges of the gray desolate barrens that he loves then the frog of his foot arches up out of the way the edges of his hoof grow sharp and shelllike so that he can travel over glare ice without slipping and cut the crust to dig down for the moss upon which he feeds the hoofs moreover are very large and deeply cleft so as to spread widely when his weight is on them when you first find his track in the snow you rub your eyes thinking that a huge ox must have passed that way the dewclaws are also large and the ankle joint so flexible that it lets them down upon the snow so megaleep has a kind of natural snowshoe with which he moves easily over the crust and except in very deep soft snows wanders at will while other deer are prisoners in their yards it is the snapping of these loose hoofs and ankle joints that makes the merry clacking sound as caribou run  sometimes however they overestimate their abilities and their wandering disposition brings them into trouble once i found a herd of seven up to their backs in soft snow and tired outa strange condition for a caribou to be in they were taking the affair philosophically resting till they should gather strength to flounder to some spruce tops where moss was plenty when i approached gently on snowshoes i had been hunting them diligently the week before to kill them but this put a different face on the matter they gave a bound or two then settled deep in the snow and turned their heads and said with their great soft eyes you have hunted us here we are at your mercy  they were very much frightened at first then i thought they grew a bit curious as i sat down peaceably in the snow to watch them onea doe more exhausted than the others and famishedeven nibbled a bit of moss that i pushed near her with a stick i had picked it with gloves so that the smell of my hand was not on it after an hour or so if i moved softly they let me approach quite up to them without shaking their antlers or renewing their desperate attempts to flounder away but i did not touch them that is a degradation which no wild creature will permit when he is free and i would not take advantage of their helplessness  did they starve in the snow you ask oh no i went to the place next day and found that they had gained the spruce tops ploughing through the snow in great bounds following the track of the strongest which went ahead to break the way there they fed and rested then went to some dense thickets where they passed the night in a day or two the snow settled and hardened and they took to their wandering again  later in hunting i crossed their tracks several times and once i saw them across a barren but i left them undisturbed to follow other trails we had eaten together they had fed from my hand and there is no older truce on earth than that not even in the unchanging east where it originated  megaleep in a storm is a most curious creature the nearest thing to a ghost to be found in the woods more than other animals he feels the falling barometer his movements at such times drive you to desperation if you are following him for he wanders unceasingly when the storm breaks he has a way of appearing suddenly as if he were seeking you when by his trail you thought him miles ahead and the way he disappearsjust melts into the thick driving flakes and the shrouded treesis most uncanny six or seven caribou once played hideandseek with me that way giving me vague glimpses here and there drawing near to get my scent yet keeping me looking up wind into the driving snow where i could see nothing distinctly and all the while they drifted about like so many huge flakes of the storm watching my every movement seeing me perfectly  at such times they fear little and even lay aside their usual caution i remember trailing a large herd one day from early morning keeping near them all the time and jumping them half a dozen times yet never getting a glimpse because of their extreme watchfulness for some reason they were unwilling to leave a small chain of barrens perhaps they knew the storm was coming when they would be safe and so instead of swinging off into a tenmile straightaway trot at the first alarm they kept dodging back and forth within a twomile circle at last late in the afternoon i followed the trail to the edge of dense evergreen thickets caribou generally rest in open woods or on the windward edge of a barren eyes for the open nose for the cover is their motto and i thought they know perfectly well i am following them and so have lain down in that tangle if i go in they will hear me a wood mouse could hardly keep quiet in such a place if i go round they will catch my scent if i wait so will they if i jump them the scrub will cover their retreat perfectly  as i sat down in the snow to think it over a heavy rush deep within the thicket told me that something not i certainly had again started them suddenly the air darkened and above the excitement of the hunt i felt the storm coming a storm in the woods is no joke when you are six miles from camp without axe or blanket i broke away from the trail and started for the head of the second barren on the run if i could make that i was safe for there was a stream near which led near to camp and one cannot very well lose a stream even in a snowstorm but before i was halfway the flakes were driving thick and soft in my face another halfmile and one could not see fifty feet in any direction still i kept on holding my course by the wind and my compass then at the foot of the second barren my snowshoes stumbled into great depressions in the snow and i found myself on the fresh trail of my caribou again if i am lost i will at least have a caribou steak and a skin to wrap me up in i said and plunged after them as i went the old mother goose rhyme of nursery days came back and set itself to hunting music    bye baby bunting   daddys gone a hunting   for to catch a rabbit skin   to wrap the baby bunting in  presently i began to sing it aloud it cheered one up in the storm and the lilt of it kept time to the leaping kind of gallop which is the easiest way to run on snowshoes bye baby bunting bye baby buntinghello  a dark mass loomed suddenly up before me on the open barren the storm lightened a bit before setting in heavier and there were the caribou just in front of me standing in a compact mass the weaker ones in the middle they had no thought nor fear of me apparently they showed no sign of anger or uneasiness indeed they barely moved aside as i snowshoed up in plain sight without any precaution whatever and these were the same animals that had fled upon my approach at daylight and that had escaped me all day with marvelous cunning  as with other deer the storm is megaleeps natural protector when it comes he thinks that he is safe that nobody can see him that the falling snow will fill his tracks and kill his scent and that whatever follows must speedily seek cover for itself so he gives up watching and lies down where he will so far as his natural enemies are concerned he is safe in this for lynx and wolf and panther seek shelter with a falling barometer they can neither see nor smell and they are all afraid i have often noticed that among all animals and birds from the least to the greatest there is always a truce when the storms are out  but the most curious thing i ever stumbled into was a caribou school that sounds queer but it is more common in the wilderness than one thinks all gregarious animals have perfectly well defined social regulations which the young must learn and respect to learn them they go to school in their own interesting way  the caribou i am speaking of now are all woodland cariboularger finer animals every way than the barrenground caribou of the desolate unwooded regions farther north in summer they live singly rearing their young in deep forest seclusions there each one does as he pleases so when you meet a caribou in summer he is a different creature and has more unknown and curious ways than when he runs with the herd in midwinter i remember a solitary old bull that lived on the mountainside opposite my camp one summer a most interesting mixture of fear and boldness of reserve and intense curiosity after i had hunted him a few times and he found that my purpose was wholly peaceable he took to hunting me in the same way just to find out who i was and what queer thing i was doing sometimes i would see him at sunset on a dizzy cliff across the lake watching for the curl of smoke or the coming of a canoe and when i dove in for a swim and went splashing dogpaddle way about the island where my tent was he would walk about in the greatest excitement and start a dozen times to come down but always he ran back for another look as if fascinated again he would come down on a burned point near the deep hole where i was fishing and hiding his body in the underbrush would push his horns up into the bare branches of a withered shrub so as to make them inconspicuous and stand watching me as long as he was quiet it was impossible to see him there but i could always make him start nervously by flashing a lookingglass or flopping a fish in the water or whistling a jolly irish jig and when i tied a bright tomato can to a string and set it whirling round my head or set my handkerchief for a flag on the end of my trout rod then he could not stand it another minute but came running down to the shore to stamp and fidget and stare nervously and scare himself with twenty alarms while trying to make up his mind to swim out and satisfy his burning desire to know all about it but i am forgetting the caribou schools  wherever there are barrenstreeless plains in the midst of dense forestthe caribou collect in small herds as winter comes on following the old gregarious instinct then each one cannot do as he pleases any more and it is for this winter and spring life together when laws must be known and the rights of the individual be laid aside for the good of the herd that the young are trained  one afternoon in late summer i was drifting down the toledi river casting for trout when a movement in the bushes ahead caught my attention a great swampy tract of ground covered with grass and low brush spread out on either side the stream from the canoe i made out two or three waving lines of bushes where some animals were making their way through the swamp towards a strip of big timber which formed a kind of island in the middle  pushing my canoe into the grass i made for a point just astern of the nearest quivering line of bushes a glance at a bit of soft ground showed me the trail of a mother caribou with her calf i followed cautiously the wind being ahead in my favor they were not hurrying and i took good pains not to alarm them  when i reached the timber and crept like a snake through the underbrush there were the caribou five or six mother animals and nearly twice as many little ones well grown which had evidently just come in from all directions they were gathered in a natural opening fairly clear of bushes with a fallen tree or two which served a good purpose later the sunlight fell across it in great golden bars making light and shadow to play in all around was the great marsh giving protection from enemies dense underbrush screened them from prying eyesand this was their schoolroom  the little ones were pushed out into the middle away from the mothers to whom they clung instinctively and were left to get acquainted with each other which they did very shyly at first like so many strange children it was all new and curious this meeting of their kind for till now they had lived in dense solitudes each one knowing no living creature save its own mother some were timid and backed away as far as possible into the shadow looking with wild wide eyes from one to another of the little caribou and bolting to their mothers sides at every unusual movement others were bold and took to butting at the first encounter but careful kindly eyes watched over them now and then a mother caribou would come from the shadows and push a little one gently from his retreat under a bush out into the company another would push her way between two heads that lowered at each other threateningly and say with a warning shake of her head that butting was no good way to get along together i had once thought watching a herd on the barrens through my glasses that they are the gentlest of animals with each other here in the little school in the heart of the swamp i found the explanation of things  for over an hour i lay there and watched my curiosity growing more eager every moment for most of what i saw i could not comprehend having no key nor understanding why certain youngsters who needed reproof according to my standards were let alone and others kept moving constantly and still others led aside often to be talked to by their mothers but at last came a lesson in which all joined and which could not be misunderstood not even by a man it was the jumping lesson  caribou are naturally poor jumpers beside a deer who often goes out of his way to jump a fallen tree just for the fun of it they have no show whatever though they can travel much farther in a day and much easier their gait is a swinging trot from which it is impossible to jump and if you frighten them out of their trot into a gallop and keep them at it they soon grow exhausted countless generations on the northern wastes where there is no need of jumping have bred this habit and modified their muscles accordingly but now a race of caribou has moved south into the woods where great trees lie fallen across the way and where if megaleep is in a hurry or there is anybody behind him jumping is a necessity still he doesnt like it and avoids it whenever possible the little ones left to themselves would always crawl under a tree or trot round it and this is another thing to overcome and another lesson to be taught in the caribou school  as i watched them the mothers all came out from the shadows and began trotting round the opening the little ones keeping close as possible each one to its mothers side then the old ones went faster the calves were left in a long line stringing out behind suddenly the leader veered in to the edge of the timber and went over a fallen tree with a jump the cows followed splendidly rising on one side falling gracefully on the other like gray waves racing past the end of a jetty but the first little one dropped his head obstinately at the tree and stopped short the next one did the same thing only he ran his head into the first ones legs and knocked them out from under him the others whirled with a baaaah and scampered round the tree and up to their mothers who had turned now and stood watching anxiously to see the effect of their lesson then it began over again  it was true kindergarten teaching for under guise of a frolic the calves were being taught a needful lessonnot only to jump but far more important than that to follow a leader and to go where he goes without question or hesitation for the leaders on the barrens are wise old bulls that make no mistakes most of the little caribou took to the sport very well and presently followed the mothers over the low hurdles but a few were timid and then came the most intensely interesting bit of the whole strange school when a little one would be led to a tree and butted from behind till he took the jump  there was no consent of the governed in that governing the mother knew and the calf didnt just what was good for him  it was this last lesson that broke up the school just in front of my hiding place a tree fell out into the opening a mother caribou brought her calf up to this unsuspectingly and leaped over expecting the little one to follow as she struck she whirled like a top and stood like a beautiful statue her head pointing in my direction her eyes were bright with fear the ears set forward the nostrils spread to catch every tainted atom from the air then she turned and glided silently away the little one close to her side looking up and touching her frequently as if to whisper what is it what is it but making no sound there was no signal given no alarm of any kind that i could understand yet the lesson stopped instantly the caribou glided away like shadows over across the opening a bush swayed here and there a leaf quivered as if something touched its branch then the schoolroom was empty and the woods all still  there is another curious habit of megaleep and this one i am utterly at a loss to account for when he is old and feeble and the tireless muscles will no longer carry him with the herd over the windswept barrens and he falls sick at last he goes to a spot far away in the woods where generations of his ancestors have preceded him and there lays him down to die it is the caribou burying ground and all the animals of a certain district or a certain herd i am unable to tell which will go there when sick or sore wounded if they have strength enough to reach the spot for it is far away from the scene of their summer homes and their winter wanderings  i know one such place and visited it twice from my summer camp it is in a dark tamarack swamp by a lonely lake at the head of the littlesouthwest miramichi river in new brunswick i found it one summer when trying to force my way from the big lake to a smaller one where trout were plenty in the midst of the swamp i stumbled upon a pair of caribou skeletons which surprised me for there were no hunters within a hundred miles and at that time the lake had lain for many years unvisited i thought of fights between bucks and bull moose how two bulls will sometimes lock horns in a rush and are too weakened to break the lock and so die together of exhaustion caribou are more peaceable they rarely fight that way and besides the horns here were not locked together but lying well apart as i searched about looking for the explanation of things thinking of wolves yet wondering why the bones were not gnawed i found another skeleton much older then four or five more some quite fresh others crumbling into mould bits of old bone and some splendid antlers were scattered here and there through the underbrush and when i scraped away the dead leaves and moss there were older bones and fragments mouldering beneath  i scarcely understood the meaning of it at the time but since then i have met men indians and hunters who have spent much time in the wilderness who speak of bone yards which they have discovered places where they can go at any time and be sure of finding a good set of caribou antlers and they say that the caribou go there to die  all animals when feeble with age or sickly or wounded have the habit of going away deep into the loneliest coverts and there lying down where the leaves shall presently cover them so that one rarely finds a dead bird or animal in the woods where thousands die yearly even your dog that was born and lived by your house often disappears when you thought him too feeble to walk death calls him gently the old wolf stirs deep within him and he goes away where the master he served will never find him and so with your cat which is only skindeep a domestic animal and so with your canary which in death alone would be free and beats his failing wings against the cage in which he lived so long content but these all go away singly each to his own place the caribou is the only animal i know that remembers when his separation comes the ties which bound him to the herd winter after winter through sun and storm in the forest where all was peace and plenty and on the lonely barrens where the gray wolf howled on his track so that he turns with his last strength from the herd he is leaving to the greater herd which has gone before himstill following his leaders remembering his first lesson to the end  sometimes i have wondered whether this also were taught in the caribou school whether once in his life megaleep were led to the spot and made to pass through it so that he should feel its meaning and remember that is not likely for the one thing which an animal cannot understand is death and there were no signs of living caribou anywhere near the place that i discovered though down at the other end of the lake their tracks were everywhere  there are other questions which one can only ask without answering is this silent gathering merely a tribute to the old law of the herd or does megaleep with his last strength still think to cheat his old enemy and go away where the wolf that followed him all his life shall not find him how was his resting place first selected and what leaders searched out the ground what sound or sign what murmur of wind in the pines or lap of ripples on the shore or song of the veery at twilight made them pause and say here is the place how does he know he whose thoughts are all of life and who never looked on death where the great silent herd is that no caribou ever sees but once and what strange instinct guides megaleep to the spot where all his wanderings end at last     ii killooleet little sweetvoice  illustration killooleet   the day was cold the woods were wet and the weather was beastly altogether when killooleet first came and sang on my ridgepole the fishing was poor down in the big lake and there were signs of civilization here and there in the shape of settlers cabins which we did not like so we had pushed up river simmo and i thirty miles in the rain to a favorite camping ground on a smaller lake where we had the wilderness all to ourselves  the rain was still falling and the lake whitecapped and the forest all misty and windblown when we ran our canoes ashore by the old cedar that marked our landing place first we built a big fire to dry some boughs to sleep upon then we built our houses simmo a bark commoosie and i a little tent and i was inside getting dry clothes out of a rubber bag when i heard a whitethroated sparrow calling cheerily his indian name o hear sweet killooleetlillooleetlillooleet and the sound was so sunny so good to hear in the steady drip of rain on the roof that i went out to see the little fellow who had bid us welcome to the wilderness  simmo had heard too he was on his hands and knees just his dark face peering by the corner stake of his commoosie so as to see better the little singer on my tenthave better weather and better luck now killooleet sing on ridgepole he said confidently then we spread some cracker crumbs for the guest and turned in to sleep till better times  that was the beginning of a long acquaintance it was also the first of many social calls from a whole colony of whitethroats tompeabody birds that lived on the mountainside just behind my tent and that came one by one to sing to us and to get acquainted and to share our crumbs sometimes too in rainy weather when the woods seemed wetter than the lake and simmo would be sleeping philosophically and i reading or tying trout flies in the tent i would hear a gentle stir and a rustle or two just outside under the tent fly then if i crept out quietly i would find killooleet exploring my goods to find where the crackers grew or just resting contentedly under the fly where it was dry and comfortable  it was good to live there among them with the mountain at our backs and the lake at our feet and peace breathing in every breeze or brooding silently over the place at twilight rain or shine day or night these whitethroated sparrows are the sunniest cheeriest folk to be found anywhere in the woods i grew to understand and love the milicete name killooleet little sweetvoice for its expressiveness hourbird the micmacs call him for they say he sings every hour and so tells the time all sames one white mans watch and indeed there is rarely an hour day or night in the northern woods when you cannot hear killooleet singing other birds grow silent after they have won their mates or they grow fat and lazy as summer advances or absorbed in the care of their young and have no time nor thought for singing but not so killooleet he is kinder to his mate after he has won her and never lets selfishness or the summer steal away his music for he knows that the woods are brighter for his singing  sometimes at night i would take a brand from the fire and follow a deer path that wound about the mountain or steal away into a dark thicket and strike a parlor match as the flame shot up lighting its little circle of waiting leaves there would be a stir beside me in the underbrush or overhead in the fir then tinkling out of the darkness like a brook under the snow would come the low clear strain of melody that always set my heart adancingim here sweet killooleetlillooleetlillooleet the goodnight song of my gentle neighbor then along the path a little way and another match and another song to make one better and his rest sweeter  by day i used to listen to them hours long at a stretch practicing to perfect their song these were the younger birds of course and for a long time they puzzled me those who know killooleets song will remember that it begins with three clear sweet notes but very few have observed the break between the second and third of these i noticed first of all that certain birds would start the song twenty times in succession yet never get beyond the second note and when i crept up to find out about it i would find them sitting disconsolately deep in shadow instead of out in the light where they love to sing with a pitiful little droop of wings and tail and the air of failure and dejection in every movement then again these same singers would touch the third note and always in such cases they would prolong the last trill the lillooleetlillooleet the peabodypeabody as some think of it to an indefinite length instead of stopping at the second or third repetition which is the rule with good singers then they would come out of the shadow and stir about briskly and sing again with an air of triumph  one day while lying still in the underbrush watching a wood mouse killooleet a fine male bird and a perfect singer came and sang on a branch just over my head not noticing me then i discovered that there is a trill a tiny grace note or yodel at the end of his second note i listened carefully to other singers as close as i could get and found that it is always there and is the one difficult part of the song you must be very close to the bird to appreciate the beauty of this little yodel for ten feet away it sounds like a faint cluck interrupting the flow of the third note and a little farther away you cannot hear it at all  illustration killooleet  whatever its object killooleet regards this as the indispensable part of his song and never goes on to the third note unless he gets the second perfectly that accounts for the many times when one hears only the first two notes that accounts also for the occasional prolonged trill which one hears for when a young bird has tried many times for his grace note without success and then gets it unexpectedly he is so pleased with himself that he forgets he is not whippoorwill who tries to sing as long as the brook without stopping and so keeps up the final lillooleetlillooleet as long as he has an atom of breath left to do it with  but of all the killooleetsand there were many that i soon recognized either by their songs or by some peculiarity in their striped caps or brown jacketsthe most interesting was the one who first perched on my ridgepole and bade me welcome to his camping ground i soon learned to distinguish him easily his cap was very bright and his white cravat very full and his song never stopped at the second note for he had mastered the trill perfectly then too he was more friendly and fearless than all the others the morning after our arrival it was better weather as simmo and killooleet had predicted we were eating breakfast by the fire when he lit on the ground close by and turned his head sidewise to look at us curiously i tossed him a big crumb which made him run away in fright but when he thought we were not looking he stole back touched tasted ate the whole of it and when i threw him another crumb he hopped to meet it  after that he came regularly to meals and would look critically over the tin plate which i placed at my feet and pick and choose daintily from the cracker and trout and bacon and porridge which i offered him soon he began to take bits away with him and i could hear him just inside the fringe of underbrush persuading his mate to come too and share his plate but she was much shyer than he it was several days before i noticed her flitting in and out of the shadowy underbrush and when i tossed her the first crumb she flew away in a terrible fright gradually however killooleet persuaded her that we were kindly and she came often to meals but she would never come near to eat from my tin plate till after i had gone away  never a day now passed that one or both of the birds did not rest on my tent when i put my head out like a turtle out of his shell in the early morning to look at the weather killooleet would look down from the projecting end of the ridgepole and sing goodmorning and when i had been out late on the lake nightfishing or following the inlet for beaver or watching the grassy points for caribou or just drifting along shore silently to catch the night sounds and smells of the woods i would listen with childish anticipation for killooleets welcome as i approached the landing he had learned to recognize the sounds of my coming the rub of a careless paddle the ripple of water under the bow or the grating of pebbles on the beach and with simmo asleep and the fire low it was good to be welcomed back by a cheery little voice in the darkness for he always sang when he heard me sometimes i would try to surprise him but his sleep was too light and his ears too keen the canoe would glide up to the old cedar and touch the shore noiselessly but with the first crunch of gravel under my foot or the rub of my canoe as i lifted it out he would waken and his song all sweetness and cheer im here sweet killooleetlillooleetlillooleet would ripple out of the dark underbrush where his nest was  i am glad now to think that i never saw that nest though it was scarcely ten yards from my tent until after the young had flown and killooleet cared no more about it i knew the bush in which it was close by the deer path could pick out from my fireplace the thick branch that sheltered it for i often watched the birds coming and going i have no doubt that killooleet would have welcomed me there without fear but his mate never laid aside her shyness about it never went to it directly when i was looking and i knew he would like me better if i respected her little secret  soon from the mates infrequent visits and from the amount of food which killooleet took away with him i knew she was brooding her eggs and when at last both birds came together and instead of helping themselves hungrily each took the largest morsel he could carry and hurried away to the nest i knew that the little ones were come and i spread the plate more liberally and moved it away to the foot of the old cedar where killooleets mate would not be afraid to come at any time  one day not long after as i sat at a late breakfast after the mornings fishing there was a great stir in the underbrush presently killooleet came skipping out all fuss and feathers running back and forth with an air of immense importance between the last bush and the plate by the cedar crying out in his own way here it is here it is all right just by the old tree as usual crackers trout brown bread porridge come on come on dont be afraid hes here but he wont harm i know him come on come on  soon his little gray mate appeared under the last bush and after much circumspection came hopping towards the breakfast and after her in a long line five little killooleets hopping fluttering cheeping stumblingall in a fright at the big world but all in a desperate hurry for crackers and porridge ad libitum now casting hungry eyes at the plate under the old cedar now stopping to turn their heads sidewise to see the big kind animal with only two legs that killooleet had told them about no doubt many times  after that we had often seven guests to breakfast instead of two it was good to hear them the lively tink tinkatink of their little bills on the tin plate in a merry tattoo as i ate my own tea and trout thankfully i had only to raise my eyes to see them in a bobbing brown ring about my bounty and just beyond them the lap of ripples on the beach the lake glinting far away in the sunshine and a bark canoe fretting at the landing swinging veering nodding at the ripples and beckoning me to come away as soon as i had finished my breakfast  before the little killooleets had grown accustomed to things however occurred the most delicious bit of our summer camping it was only a day or two after their first appearance they knew simply that crumbs and a welcome awaited them at my camp but had not yet learned that the tin plate in the cedar roots was their special portion simmo had gone off at daylight looking up beaver signs for his fall trapping i had just returned from the morning fishing and was getting breakfast when i saw an otter come out into the lake from a cold brook over on the east shore grabbing a handful of figs and some pilot bread from the cracker box i paddled away after the otter for that is an animal which one has small chance to watch nowadays besides i had found a den over near the brook and i wanted to find out if possible how a mother otter teaches her young to swim for though otters live much in the water and love it the young ones are afraid of it as so many kittens so the mother  but i must tell about that elsewhere i did not find out that day for the young were already good swimmers i watched the den two or three hours from a good hiding place and got several glimpses of the mother and the little ones on the way back i ran into a little bay where a mother shelldrake was teaching her brood to dive and catch trout there was also a big frog there that always sat in the same place and that i used to watch then i thought of a trap two miles away which simmo had set and went to see if nemox the cunning fisher who destroys the sable traps in winter had been caught at his own game so it was afternoon and i was hungry when i paddled back to camp it occurred to me suddenly that killooleet might be hungry too for i had neglected to feed him he had grown sleek and comfortable of late and never went insect hunting when he could get cold fried trout and corn bread  i landed silently and stole up to the tent to see if he were exploring under the fly as he sometimes did when i was away a curious sound a hollow tunk tunk tunk tunkatunk grew louder as i approached i stole to the big cedar where i could see the fireplace and the little opening before my tent and noticed first that i had left the cracker box open it was almost empty when i hurried away after the otter the curious sound was inside growing more eager every momenttunk tunk tunkatrrrrrrrrunk tunk tunk  i crept on my hands and knees to the box to see what queer thing had found his way to the crackers and peeped cautiously over the edge there were killooleet and mrs killooleet and the five little killooleets just seven hopping brown backs and bobbing heads helping themselves to the crackers and the sound of their bills on the empty box made the jolliest tattoo that ever came out of a camping kit  i crept away more cautiously than i had come and standing carelessly in my tent door whistled the call i always used in feeding the birds like a flash killooleet appeared on the edge of the cracker box looking very much surprised i thought you were away why i thought you were away he seemed to be saying then he clucked and the tunkatunk ceased instantly another cluck and mrs killooleet appeared looking frightened then one after another the five little killooleets bobbed up and there they sat in a solemn row on the edge of the cracker box turning their heads sidewise to see me better  there said killooleet didnt i tell you he wouldnt hurt you and like five winks the five little killooleets were back in the box and the tunkatunking began again  this assurance that they might do as they pleased and help themselves undisturbed to whatever they found seemed to remove the last doubt from the mind of even the little gray mate after that they stayed most of the time close about my tent and were never so far away or so busy insect hunting that they would not come when i whistled and scattered crumbs the little killooleets grew amazingly and no wonder they were always eating always hungry i took good pains to give them less than they wanted and so had the satisfaction of feeding them often and of finding their tin plate picked clean whenever i came back from fishing  did the woods seem lonely to killooleet when we paddled away at last and left the wilderness for another year that is a question which i would give much or watch long to answer there is always a regret at leaving a good camping ground but i had never packed up so unwillingly before killooleet was singing cheery as ever but my own heart gave a minor chord of sadness to his trill that was not there when he sang on my ridgepole before leaving i had baked a loaf big and hard which i fastened with stakes at the foot of the old cedar with a tin plate under it and a bark roof above so that when it rained and insects were hidden under the leaves and their hunting was no fun because the woods were wet killooleet and his little ones would find food and remember me and so we paddled away and left him to the wilderness  a year later my canoe touched the same old landing for ten months i had been in the city where killooleet never sings and where the wilderness is only a memory in the fall on some long tramps i had occasional glimpses of the little singer solitary now and silent stealing southward ahead of the winter and in the spring he showed himself rarely in the underbrush on country roads eager restless chirping hurrying northward where the streams were clear and the big woods budding but never a song in all that time my ears were hungry for his voice as i leaped out to run eagerly to the big cedar there were the stakes and the tin plate and the bark roof all crushed by the snows of winter the bread was gone what killooleet had spared tookhees the wood mouse had eaten thankfully i found the old tent poles and put up my house leisurely a hundred happy memories thronging about me in the midst of them came a call a clear whistleand there he was the same full cravat the same bright cap and the same perfect song to set my nerves atingling im here sweet killooleetlillooleetlillooleet and when i put crumbs by the old fireplace he flew down to help himself and went off with the biggest one as of yore to his nest by the deer path     iii kagax the bloodthirsty  illustration kagax   this is the story of one day the last one in the life of kagax the weasel who turns white in winter and yellow in spring and brown in summer the better to hide his villainy  it was early twilight when kagax came out of his den in the rocks under the old pine that lightning had blasted day and night were meeting swiftly but warily as they always meet in the woods the life of the sunshine came stealing nestwards and denwards in the peace of a long day and a full stomach the night life began to stir in its coverts eager hungry whining deep in the wild raspberry thickets a wood thrush rang his vesper bell softly from the mountain top a night hawk screamed back an answer and came booming down to earth where the insects were rising in myriads near the thrush a striped chipmunk sat chunkachunking his sleepy curiosity at a burned log which a bear had just torn open for red ants while down on the lake shore a cautious plashplash told where a cow moose had come out of the alders with her calf to sup on the yellow lily roots and sip the freshest water everywhere life was stirring everywhere cries calls squeaks chirps rustlings which only the wooddweller knows how to interpret broke in upon the twilight stillness  kagax grinned and showed all his wicked little teeth as the many voices went up from lake and stream and forest mine all mineto kill he snarled and his eyes began to glow deep red then he stretched one sinewy paw after another rolled over climbed a tree and jumped down from a swaying twig to get the sleep all out of him  kagax had slept too much and was mad with the world the night before he had killed from sunset to sunrise and much tasting of blood had made him heavy so he had slept all day long only stirring once to kill a partridge that had drummed near his den and waked him out of sleep but he was too heavy to hunt then so he crept back again leaving the bird untasted under the end of his own drumming log now kagax was eager to make up for lost time for all time is lost to kagax that is not spent in killing that is why he runs night and day and barely tastes the blood of his victims and sleeps only an hour or two of cat naps at a timejust long enough to gather energy for more evil doing  as he stretched himself again a sudden barking and snickering came from a giant spruce on the hill just above meeko the red squirrel had discovered a new jays nest and was making a sensation over it as he does over everything that he has not happened to see before had he known who was listening he would have risked his neck in a headlong rush for safety for all the wild things fear kagax as they fear death but no wild thing ever knows till too late that a weasel is near  kagax listened a moment a ferocious grin on his pointed face then he stole towards the sound i intended to kill those young hares first he thought but this fool squirrel will stretch my legs better and point my nose and get the sleep out of methere he is in the big spruce  kagax had not seen the squirrel but that did not matter he can locate a victim better with his nose or ears than he can with his eyes the moment he was sure of the place he rushed forward without caution meeko was in the midst of a prolonged snicker at the scolding jays when he heard a scratch on the bark below turned looked down and fled with a cry of terror kagax was already halfway up the tree the red fire blazing in his eyes  the squirrel rushed to the end of a branch jumped to a smaller spruce ran that up to the top then because his fright had made him forget the tree paths that ordinarily he knew very well he sprang out and down to the ground a clear fifty feet breaking his fall by catching and holding for an instant a swaying fir tip on the way then he rushed pellmell over logs and rocks and through the underbrush to a maple and from that across a dozen trees to another giant spruce where he ran up and down desperately over half the branches crossing and crisscrossing his trail and dropped panting at last into a little crevice under a broken limb there he crouched into the smallest possible space and watched with an awful fear in his eyes the rough trunk below  far behind him came kagax grim relentless silent as death he paid no attention to scratching claws nor swaying branches never looking for the jerking red tip of meekos tail nor listening for the loud thump of his feet when he struck the ground a pair of brave little flycatchers saw the chase and rushed at the common enemy striking him with their beaks and raising an outcry that brought a score of frightened clamoring birds to the scene but kagax never heeded his whole being seemed to be concentrated in the point of his nose he followed like a bloodhound to the top of the second spruce sniffed here and there till he caught the scent of meekos passage through the air ran to the end of a branch in the same direction and leaped to the ground landing not ten feet from the spot where the squirrel had struck a moment before there he picked up the trail followed over logs and rocks to the maple up to the third branch and across fifty yards of intervening branches to the giant spruce where his victim sat half paralyzed watching from his crevice  here kagax was more deliberate left and right up and down he went with deadly patience from the lowest branch to the top a hundred feet above following every cross and winding of the trail a dozen times he stopped went back picked up the fresher trail and went on again a dozen times he passed within a few feet of his victim smelling him strongly but scorning to use his eyes till his nose had done its perfect work so he came to the last turn followed the last branch his nose to the bark straight to the crevice under the broken branch where meeko crouched shivering knowing it was all over  there was a cry that no one heeded in the woods there was a flash of sharp teeth and the squirrel fell striking the ground with a heavy thump kagax ran down the trunk sniffed an instant at the body without touching it and darted away to the form among the ferns he had passed it at daylight when he was too heavy for killing  halfway to the lake he stopped a thrilling song from a dead spruce top bubbled out over the darkening woods when a hermit thrush sings like that his nest is somewhere just below kagax began twisting in and out like a snake among the bushes till a stir in a tangle of raspberry vines which no ears but his or an owls would ever notice made him shrink close to the ground and look up the red fire blazed in his eyes again for there was mother thrush just settling onto her nest not five feet from his head  to climb the raspberry vines without shaking them and so alarming the bird was out of the question but there was a fireblasted tree just behind kagax climbed it stealthily on the side away from the bird crept to a branch over the nest and leaped down mother thrush was preening herself sleepily feeling the grateful warmth of her eggs and listening to the wonderful song overhead when the blow came before she knew what it was the sharp teeth had met in her brain the pretty nest would never again wait for a brooding mother in the twilight  all the while the wonderful song went on for the hermit thrush pouring his soul out far above on the dead spruce top heard not a sound of the tragedy below  kagax flung the warm body aside savagely bit through the ends of the three eggs wishing they were young thrushes and leaped to the ground there he just tasted the brain of his victim to whet his appetite listened a moment crouching among the dead leaves to the melody overhead wishing it were darker so that the hermit would come down and he could end his wicked work then he glided away to the young hares  there were five of them in the form hidden among the coarse brakes of a little opening kagax went straight to the spot a weasel never forgets he killed them all one after another slowly deliberately by a single bite through the spine tasting only the blood of the last one then he wriggled down among the warm bodies and waited his nose to the path by which mother hare had gone away he knew well she would soon be coming back  presently he heard her putaput putaput hopping along the path with a waving line of ferns to show just where she was kagax wriggled lower among his helpless victims his eyes blazed red again so red that mother hare saw them and stopped short then kagax sat up straight among the dead babies and screeched in her face  the poor creature never moved a step she only crouched low before her own door and began to shiver violently kagax ran up to her raised himself on his hind legs so as to place his fore paws on her neck chose his favorite spot behind the ears and bit the hare straightened out the quivering ceased a tiny drop of blood followed the sharp teeth on either side kagax licked it greedily and hurried away afraid to spoil his hunt by drinking  but he had scarcely entered the woods running heedlessly when the moss by a great stone stirred with a swift motion there was a squeak of fright as kagax jumped forward like lightningbut too late tookhees the timid little wood mouse who was digging under the moss for twinflower roots to feed his little ones had heard the enemy coming and dove headlong into his hole just in time to escape the snap of kagaxs teeth  that angered the fiery little weasel like poking a stick at him to be caught napping or to be heard running through the woods is more than he can possibly stand his eyes fairly snapped as he began digging furiously below he could hear a chorus of faint squeaks the clamor of young wood mice for their supper but a few inches down and the hole doubled under a round stone then vanished between two roots close together try as he would kagax could only wear his claws out without making any progress he tried to force his shoulders through for a weasel thinks he can go anywhere but the hole was too small kagax cried out in rage and took up the trail a dozen times he ran it from the hole to the torn moss where tookhees had been digging roots and back again then sure that all the wood mice were inside he tried to tear his way between the obstinate roots as well try to claw down the tree itself  all the while tookhees who always has just such a turn in his tunnel and who knows perfectly when he is safe crouched just below the roots looking up with steady little eyes like two black beads at his savage pursuer and listening in a kind of dumb terror to his snarls of rage  kagax gave it up at last and took to running in circles wider and wider he went running swift and silent his nose to the ground seeking other mice on whom to wreak his vengeance suddenly he struck a fresh trail and ran it straight to the clearing where a foolish field mouse had built a nest in a tangle of dry brakes kagax caught and killed the mother as she rushed out in alarm then he tore the nest open and killed all the little ones he tasted the blood of one and went on again  the failure to catch the wood mouse still rankled in his head and kept his eyes bright red suddenly he turned from his course along the lake shore he began to climb the ridge up and up he went crossing a dozen trails that ordinarily he would have followed till he came to where a dead tree had fallen and lodged against a big spruce near the summit there he crouched in the underbrush and waited  up near the top of the dead tree a pair of pine martens had made their den in the hollow trunk and reared a family of young martens that drew kagaxs evil thoughts like a magnet the marten belongs to the weasels own family therefore as a choice bit of revenge kagax would rather kill him than anything else a score of times he had crouched in this same place and waited for his chance but the marten is larger and stronger every way than the weasel and though shyer almost as savage in a fight and kagax was afraid  but tonight kagax was in a more vicious mood than ever before and a weasels temper is always the most vicious thing in the woods he stole forward at last and put his nose to the foot of the leaning tree two fresh trails went out none came back kagax followed them far enough to be sure that both martens were away hunting then he turned and ran like a flash up the incline and into the den  in a moment he came out licking his chops greedily inside the young martens lay just as they had been left by the mother only they began to grow very cold kagax ran to the great spruce along a branch into another tree then to the ground by a dizzy jump there he ran swiftly for a good half hour in a long diagonal down towards the lake crisscrossing his trail here and there as he ran  once more his nights hunting began with greater zeal than before he was hungry now his nose grew keen as a brier for every trail a faint smell stopped him so faint that the keenestnosed dog or fox would have passed without turning the smell of a brooding partridge on her eggs there she was among the roots of a pine sitting close and blending perfectly with the roots and the brown needles kagax moved like a shadow his nose found the bird before she could spring he was on her back and his teeth had done their evil work once more he tasted the fresh brains with keen relish he broke all the eggs so that none else might profit by his hunting and went on again  on some moist ground under a hemlock he came upon the fresh trail of a wandering hareno simple unsuspecting mother coming back to her babies but a big strong suspicious fellow who knew how to make a run for his life kagax was still fresh and eager here was game that would stretch his muscles the red lust of killing flamed into his eyes as he jumped away on the trail  soon by the long distances between tracks he knew that the hare was startled the scent was fresher now so fresh that he could follow it in the air without putting his nose to the ground  suddenly a great commotion sounded among the bushes just ahead where a moment before all was still the hare had been lying there watching his back track to see what was following when he saw the red eyes of kagax he darted away wildly a few hundred yards and the foolish hare who could run far faster than his pursuer dropped in the bushes again to watch and see if the weasel was still after him  kagax was following swiftly silently again the hare bounded away only to stop and scare himself into fits by watching his own trail till the red eyes of the weasel blazed into view so it went on for a half hour through brush and brake and swamp till the hare had lost all his wits and began to run wildly in small circles then kagax turned ran the back track a little way and crouched flat on the ground  in a moment the hare came tearing along on his own trailstraight towards the yellowbrown ball under a fern tip kagax waited till he was almost run over then he sprang up and screeched that ended the chase the hare just dropped on his fore paws kagax jumped for his head his teeth met the hunger began to gnaw and he drank his fill greedily  for a time the madness of the chase seemed to be in the blood he drank keener than ever to kill he darted away on a fresh trail but soon his feast began to tell his feet grew heavy angry at himself he lay down to sleep their weight away  far behind him under the pine by the partridges nest a long dark shadow seemed to glide over the ground a pointed nose touched the leaves here and there over the nose a pair of fierce little eyes glowed deep red as kagaxs own so the shadow came to the partridges nest passed over it minding not the scent of broken eggs nor of the dead bird but only the scent of the weasel and vanished into the underbrush on the trail  kagax woke with a start and ran on a big bullfrog croaked down on the shore kagax stalked and killed him leaving his carcass untouched among the lily pads a dead pine in a thicket attracted his suspicion he climbed it swiftly found a fresh round hole and tumbled in upon a mother bird and a family of young woodpeckers he killed them all tasting the brains again and hunted the tree over for the father bird the great black logcock that makes the wilderness ring with his tattoo but the logcock heard claws on the bark and flew to another tree making a great commotion in the darkness as he blundered along but not knowing what it was that had startled him  so the night wore on with kagax killing in every thicket yet never satisfied with killing he thought longingly of the hard winter when game was scarce and he had made his way out over the snow to the settlement and lived among the chicken coops twenty big hens in one roostthat was killing snarled kagax savagely as he strangled two young herons in their nest while the mother bird went on with her frogging not ten yards away among the lily pads and never heard a rustle  toward morning he turned homeward making his way back in a circle along the top of the ridge where his den was and killing as he went he had tasted too much his feet grew heavier than they had ever been before he thought angrily that he would have to sleep another whole day and to sleep a whole day while the wilderness was just beginning to swarm with life filled kagax with snarling rage  a mother hare darted away from her form as the weasels wicked eyes looked in upon her kagax killed the little ones and had started after the mother when a shiver passed over him and he turned back to listen he had been moving more slowly of late several times he had looked behind him with the feeling that he was followed he stole back to the hares form and lay hidden watching his back track he shivered again if it were not stronger than i it would not follow my trail thought kagax the fear of a hunted thing came upon him he remembered the martens den the strangled young ones the two trails that left the leaning tree they must have turned back long ago thought kagax and darted away his back was cold now cold as ice  but his feet grew very heavy ere he reached his den a faint light began to show over the mountain across the lake killooleet the whitethroated sparrow saw it and his clear morning song tinkled out of the dark underbrush kagaxs eyes glowed red again he stole toward the sound for a last kill young sparrows brains are a dainty dish he would eat his fill since he must sleep all day he found the nest he had placed his fore paws against the tree that held it when he dropped suddenly the shivers began to course all over him just below from a stub in a dark thicket a deep whooohoohoo rolled out over the startled woods  it was kookooskoos the great horned owl who generally hunts only in the evening twilight but who with growing young ones to feed sometimes uses the morning twilight as well kagax lay still as a stone over him the sparrows knowing the danger crouched low in their nest not daring to move a claw lest the owl should hear  behind him the same shadow that had passed over the partridges nest looked into the hares form with fierce red eyes it followed kagaxs trail over that of the mother hare turned back sniffed the earth and came hurrying silently along the ridge  illustration kookooskoos  kagax crept stealthily out of the thicket he had an awful fear now of his feet for heavy with the blood he had eaten they would rustle the leaves or scratch on the stones that all night long they had glided over in silence he was near his den now he could see the old pine that lightning had blasted towering against the sky over the dark spruces  again the deep whooohoohoo rolled over the hillside to kagax who gloats over his killing except when he is afraid it became an awful accusation who has killed where he cannot eat who strangled a brooding bird who murdered his own kin came thundering through the woods kagax darted for his den his hind feet struck a rotten twig that they should have cleared it broke with a sharp snap in an instant a huge shadow swept down from the stub and hovered over the sound two fierce yellow eyes looked in upon kagax crouching and trying to hide under a fir tip  kagax whirled when the eyes found him and two sets of strong curved claws dropped down from the shadow with a savage snarl he sprang up and his teeth met but no blood followed the bite only a flutter of soft brown feathers then one set of sharp claws gripped his head another set met deep in his back kagax was jerked swiftly into the air and his evil doing was ended forever  there was a faint rustle in the thicket as the shadow of kookooskoos swept away to his nest the long lithe form of a pine marten glided straight to the fir tip where kagax had been a moment before his movements were quick nervous silent his eyes showed like two drops of blood over his twitching nostrils he circled swiftly about the end of the lost trail his nose touched a brown feather another and he glided back to the fir tip a drop of blood was soaking slowly into a dead leaf the marten thrust his nose into it one long sniff while his eyes blazed then he raised his head cried out once savagely and glided away on the back track     iv kookooskoos who catches the wrong rat  illustration kookooskoos   kookooskoos is the big brown owl the bubo virginianus or great horned owl of the books but his indian name is best almost any night in autumn if you leave the town and go out towards the big woods you can hear him calling it kookooskoos koooo kooo down in the swamp  kookooskoos is always catching the wrong rat the reason is that he is a great hunter and thinks that every furry thing which moves must be game and so he is like the fool sportsman who shoots at a sound or a motion in the bushes before finding out what makes it sometimes the rat turns out to be a skunk or a weasel sometimes your pet cat and once in a lifetime it is your own fur cap or even your head and then you feel the weight and the edge of kookooskoos claws but he never learns wisdom by mistakes for spite of his grave appearance he is excitable as a frenchman and so whenever anything stirs in the bushes and a bit of fur appears he cries out to himself a rat kookoo a rabbit and swoops on the instant  rats and rabbits are his favorite food by the way and he never lets a chance go by of taking them into camp i think i never climbed to his nest without finding plenty of the fur of both animals to tell of his skill in hunting  one evening in the twilight as i came home from hunting in the big woods i heard the sound of deer feeding just ahead i stole forward to the edge of a thicket and stood there motionless looking and listening intently my cap was in my pocket and only my head appeared above the low firs that sheltered me suddenly without noise or warning of any kind i received a sharp blow on the head from behind as if some one had struck me with a thorny stick i turned quickly surprised and a good bit startled for i thought myself utterly alone in the woodsand i was there was nobody there not a sound not a motion broke the twilight stillness something trickled on my neck i put up my hand to find my hair already wet with blood more startled than ever i sprang through the thicket looking listening everywhere for sight or sound of my enemy still no creature bigger than a wood mouse no movement save that of nodding fir tips no sound but the thumping of my own heart and far behind me a sudden rush and a bump or two as the frightened deer broke away then perfect stillness again as if nothing had ever lived in the thickets  i was little more than a boy and i went home that night more puzzled and more frightened than i have ever been before or since in the woods i ran into the doctors office on my way he found three cuts in my scalp and below them two shorter ones where pointed things seemed to have been driven through to the bone he looked at me queerly when i told my story of course he did not believe me and i made no effort to persuade him indeed i scarcely believed myself but for the blood which stained my handkerchief and the throbbing pain in my head i should have doubted the reality of the whole experience  that night i started up out of sleep some time towards morning and said before i was half awake it was an owl that hit you on the headof course it was an owl then i remembered that years before an older boy had a horned owl which he had taken from a nest and which he kept loose in a dark garret over the shed none of us younger boys dared go up to the garret for the owl was always hungry and the moment a boys head appeared through the scuttle the owl said hoooo and swooped for it so we used to get acquainted with the big pet by pushing in a dead rat or a squirrel or a chicken on the end of a stick and climbing in ourselves afterwards  as i write the whole picture comes back to me again vividly the dark cobwebby old garret pierced here and there by a pencil of light in which the motes were dancing the fierce bird down on the floor in the darkest corner horns up eyes gleaming feathers all abristle till he looked big as a bushel basket in the dim light standing on his game with one foot and tearing it savagely to pieces with the other snapping his beak and gobbling up feathers bones and all in great hungry mouthfuls and over the scuttle two or three small boys staring in eager curiosity but clinging to each others coats fearfully ready to tumble down the ladder with a yell at the first hostile demonstration  the next afternoon i was back in the big woods to investigate fifty feet behind the thicket where i had been struck was a tall dead stub overlooking a little clearing thats his watch tower i thought while i was watching the deer he was up there watching my head and when it moved he swooped  i had no intention of giving him another flight at the same game but hid my fur cap some distance out in the clearing tied a long string to it went back into the thicket with the other end of the string and sat down to wait a low whooohoohoo came from across the valley to tell me i was not the only watcher in the woods  towards dusk i noticed suddenly that the top of the old stub looked a bit peculiar but it was some time before i made out a big owl sitting up there i had no idea how long he had been there nor whence he came his back was towards me he sat up very straight and still so as to make himself just a piece the tip end of the stub as i watched he hooted once and bent forward to listen then i pulled on my string  with the first rustle of a leaf he whirled and poised forward in the intense attitude an eagle takes when he sights the prey on the instant he had sighted the cap wriggling in and out among the low bushes and swooped for it like an arrow just as he dropped his legs to strike i gave a sharp pull and the cap jumped from under him he missed his strike but wheeled like a fury and struck again another jerk and again he missed then he was at the thicket where i stood his fierce yellow eyes glared straight into mine for a startled instant and he brushed me with his wings as he sailed away into the shadow of the spruces  small doubt now that i had seen my assailant of the night before for an owl has regular hunting grounds and uses the same watch towers night after night he had seen my head in the thicket and struck at the first movement perceiving his mistake he kept straight on over my head so of course there was nothing in sight when i turned as an owls flight is perfectly noiseless the wing feathers are wonderfully soft and all the lamin√¶ are drawn out into hair points so that the wings never whirr nor rustle like other birds i had heard nothing though he passed close enough to strike and i was listening intently and so another mystery of the woods was made plain by a little watching  years afterwards the knowledge gained stood me in good stead in clearing up another mystery it was in a lumber campalways a superstitious placein the heart of a canada forest i had followed a wandering herd of caribou too far one day and late in the afternoon found myself alone at a river some twenty miles from my camp on the edge of the barren grounds somewhere above me i knew that a crew of lumbermen were at work so i headed up river to find their camp if possible and avoid sleeping out in the snow and bitter cold it was long after dark and the moon was flooding forest and river with a wonderful light when i at last caught sight of the camp the click of my snowshoes brought a dozen big men to the door at that moment i felt rather than saw that they seemed troubled and alarmed at seeing me alone but i was too tired to notice and no words save those of welcome were spoken until i had eaten heartily then as i started out for another look at the wild beauty of the place under the moonlight a lumberman followed and touched me on the shoulder  best not go far from camp alone sir t isnt above safe hereabouts he said in a low voice i noticed that he glanced back over his shoulder as he spoke  but why i objected theres nothing in these woods to be afraid of  come back to camp and ill tell you its warmer there he said and i followed to hear a strange storyhow andy there was sitting on a stump smoking his pipe in the twilight when he was struck and cut on the head from behind and when he sprang up to look there was nothing there nor any track save his own in the snow the next night gillies fur cap had been snatched from his head and when he turned there was nobody in sight and when he burst into camp with all his wits frightened out of him he could scarcely speak and his face was deathly white other uncanny things had happened since in the same way and coupled with a bad accident on the river which the men thought was an omen they had put the camp into such a state of superstitious fear that no one ventured alone out of doors after nightfall  i thought of kookooskoos and my own head but said nothing they would only have resented the suggestion  next day i found my caribou and returned to the lumber camp before sunset at twilight there was kookooskoos an enormous fellow looking like the end of a big spruce stub keeping sharp watch over the clearing and fortunately behind the camp where he could not see the door i called the men and set them crouching in the snow under the low eavesstay there a minute and ill show you the ghost that was all i told them  taking the skin of a hare which i had shot that day i hoisted it cautiously on a stick the lumbermen watching curiously a slight scratch of the stick a movement of the fur along the splits then a great dark shadow shot over our heads it struck the stick sharply and swept on and up into the spruces across the clearing taking bunnys skin with it  then one big lumberman who saw the point jumped up with a yell and danced a jig in the snow like a schoolboy there was no need of further demonstration with a cap and nobody volunteered his head for a final experiment but all remembered seeing the owl on his nightly watch and knew something of his swooping habits of course some were incredulous at first and had a dozen questions and objections when we were in camp no one likes to have a good ghost story spoiled and besides where superstition is there the marvelous is most easily believed it is only the simple truth that is doubted so i spent half the night in convincing them that they had been brought up in the woods to be scared by an owl  poor kookooskoos they shot him next night on his watch tower and nailed him to the camp door as a warning  i discovered another curious thing about kookooskoos that night when i watched to find out what had struck me i found out why he hoots sometimes if he is a young owl he hoots for practice or to learn how and then he makes an awful noise of it a rasping screech before his voice deepens and if you are camping near and are new to the woods the chances are that you lie awake and shiver for there is no other sound like it in the wilderness sometimes when you climb to his nest he has a terrifying hoohoohoohoohoohoo running up and down a deep guttural scale like a fiendish laugh accompanied by a vicious snapping of the beak and if you are a small boy and it is towards twilight you climb down the tree quick and let his nest alone but the regular whooohoohoo whooohoo always five notes with the second two very short is a hunting call and he uses it to alarm the game that is queer hunting but his ears account for it  if you separate the feathers on kookooskoos head you will find an enormous earopening running from above his eye halfway round his face and the ear within is so marvelously sensitive that it can hear the rustle of a rat in the grass or the scrape of a sparrows toes on a branch fifty feet away so he sits on his watch tower so still that he is never noticed and as twilight comes on when he can see best he hoots suddenly and listens the sound has a muffled quality which makes it hard to locate and it frightens every bird and small animal within hearing for all know kookooskoos and how fierce he is as the terrifying sound rolls out of the air so near them fur and feathers shiver with fright a rabbit stirs in his form a partridge shakes on his branch the mink stops hunting frogs at the brook the skunk takes his nose out of the hole where he is eating sarsaparilla roots a leaf stirs a toe scrapes and instantly kookooskoos is there his fierce eyes glare in his great claws drop one grip and its all over for the very sight of him scares the little creatures so that there is no life left in them to cry out or to run away  a nest which i found a few years ago shows how well this kind of hunting succeeds it was in a gloomy evergreen swamp in a big tree some eighty feet from the ground i found it by a pile of pellets of hair and feathers at the foot of the tree for the owl devours every part of his game and after digestion is complete feathers bones and hair are disgorged in small balls like so many sparrow heads when i looked up there at the top was a huge mass of sticks which had been added to year after year till it was nearly three feet across and half as thick kookooskoos was not there he had heard me coming and slipped away silently  wishing to be sure the nest was occupied before trying the hard climb i went away as far as i could see the nest and hid in a thicket presently a very large owl came back and stood by the nest soon after a smaller bird the male glided up beside her then i came on cautiously watching to see what they would do  at the first crack of a twig both birds started forward the male slipped away the female dropped below the nest and stood behind a limb just her face peering through a crotch in my direction had i not known she was there i might have looked the tree over twenty times without finding her and there she stayed hidden till i was halfway up the tree  when i peered at last over the edge of the big nest after a desperately hard climb there was a bundle of dark gray down in a little hollow in the middle it touched me at the time that the little ones rested on a feather bed pulled from the mother birds own breast i brushed the down with my fingers instantly two heads came up fuzzy gray heads with black pointed beaks and beautiful hazel eyes and a funny long pinfeather over each ear which made them look like little wise old clerks just waked up when i touched them again they staggered up and opened their mouthsenormous mouths for such little fellows then seeing that i was an intruder they tried to bristle their few pinfeathers and snap their beaks  they were fat as two aldermen and no wonder placed around the edge of the big nest were a red squirrel a rat a chicken a few frogs legs and a rabbit fine fare that at eighty feet from the ground kookooskoos had had good hunting all the game was partly eaten showing i had disturbed their dinner and only the hinder parts were left showing that owls like the head and brains best i left them undisturbed and came away for i wanted to watch the young growwhich they did marvelously and were presently learning to hoot but i have been less merciful to the great owls ever since thinking of the enormous destruction of game represented in raising two or three such young savages year after year in the same swamp  once at twilight i shot a big owl that was sitting on a limb facing me with what appeared to be an enormously long tail hanging below the limb the tail turned out to be a large mink just killed with a beautiful skin that put five dollars into a boys locker another time i shot one that sailed over me when he came down there was a ruffed grouse still living in his claws another time i could not touch one that i had killed for the overpowering odor which was in his feathers showing that mephitis the skunk never loses his head when attacked but kookooskoos like the fox cares little for such weapons and in the spring when game is scarce swoops for and kills a skunk wherever he finds him prowling away from his den in the twilight  the most savage bit of his hunting that i ever saw was one dark winter afternoon on the edge of some thick woods i was watching a cat a halfwild creature that was watching a red squirrel making a great fuss over some nuts which he had hidden and which he claimed somebody had stolen somewhere behind us kookooskoos was watching from a pine tree the squirrel was chattering in the midst of a whirlwind of leaves and empty shells which he had thrown out on the snow from under the wall behind him the cat creeping nearer and nearer had crouched with blazing eyes and quivering muscles her whole attention fixed on the spring when broad wings shot silently over my hiding place and fell like a shadow on the cat one set of strong claws gripped her behind the ears the others were fastened like a vise in the spine generally one such grip is enough but the cat was strong and at the first touch sprang away in a moment the owl was after her floating hovering above till the right moment came when he dropped and struck again then the cat whirled and fought like a fury for a few moments there was a desperate battle fur and feathers flying the cat screeching like mad the owl silent as death then the great claws did their work when i straightened up from my thicket kookooskoos was standing on his game tearing off the flesh with his feet and carrying it up to his mouth with the same movement swallowing everything alike as if famished  over them the squirrel which had whisked up a tree at the first alarm was peeking with evil eyes over the edge of a limb snickering at the bloodstained snow and the dead cat scolding barking threatening the owl for having disturbed the search for his stolen walnuts  i caught that same owl soon after in a peculiar way a farmer near by told me that an owl was taking his chickens regularly undoubtedly the bird had been driven southward by the severe winter and had not taken up regular hunting grounds until he caught the cat then came the chickens i set up a pole on the top of which was nailed a bit of board for a platform on the platform was fastened a small steel trap and under it hung a dead chicken the next morning there was kookooskoos on the platform one foot in the trap at which he was pulling awkwardly owls from their peculiar ways of hunting are prone to light on stubs and exposed branches and so kookooskoos had used my pole as a watch tower before carrying off his game  there is another way in which he is easily fooled in the early spring when he is mating and again in the autumn when the young birds are well fed and before they have learned much you can bring him close up to you by imitating his hunting call in the wilderness where these birds are plenty i have often had five or six about me at once you have only to go well out beyond your tent and sit down quietly making yourself part of the place give the call a few times and if there is a young bird near with a full stomach he will answer and presently come nearer soon he is in the tree over your head and if you keep perfectly still he will set up a great hooting that you have called him and now do not answer others are attracted by his calling they come in silently from all directions the outcry is startling the call is more nervous more eerie much more terrifying close at hand than when heard in the distance they sweep about like great dark shadows hoohoohooing and frolicking in their own uncanny way then go off to their separate watch towers and their hunting but the chances are that you will be awakened with a start more than once in the night as some inquisitive young owl comes back and gives the hunting call in the hope of finding out what the first summons was all about     v chigwooltz the frog  illustration chigwooltz   i was watching for a bear one day by an alder point when chigwooltz came swimming in from the lily pads in great curiosity to see what i was doing under the alders he was an enormous frog dull green with a yellowish vestwhich showed that he was a malebut with the most brilliant ear drums i had ever seen they fairly glowed with iridescent color each in its ring of bright yellow when i tried to catch him very quietly for the bear was somewhere just above on the ridge in order to examine these drums he dived under the canoe and watched me from a distance  in front of me in the shallow water along shore four more large frogs were sunning themselves among the lily pads i watched them carelessly while waiting for the bear after an hour or two i noticed that three of these frogs changed their positions slightly turning from time to time so as to warm the entire body at natures fireplace but the fourth was more deliberate and philosophical thinking evidently that if he simply sat still long enough the sun would do the turning when i came about eleven oclock he was sitting on the shore by a green stone his fore feet lapped by tiny ripples the sun full on his back for three hours while i watched there he never moved a muscle then the bear came and i left him for more exciting things  late in the afternoon i came back to get some of the big frogs for breakfast chigwooltz he with the ear drums was the first to see me and came pushing his way among the lily pads toward the canoe but when i dangled a red ibis fly in front of him he dived promptly and i saw his head come up by a black root where he sat thinking himself invisible and watched me  chigwooltz the second he of the green stone and the patient disposition was still sitting in the same place the sun had turned round it was now warming his other side his allday sun bath surprised me so that i let him alone to see how long he would sit still and went fishing for other frogs  two big ones showed their heads among the pads some twenty feet apart pushing up so as to make a triangle with my canoe i dangled a red ibis impartially between them for two or three long minutes neither moved so much as an eyelid then one seemed to wake suddenly from a trance or to be touched by an electric wire for he came scrambling in a desperate hurry over the lily pads swimming was too slow he jumped fiercely out of water at the red challenge making a great splash and commotion  fishing for big frogs by the way is no tame sport the red seems to excite them tremendously and they take the fly like a black salmon  but the moment the first frog started frog number two waked up and darted forward making less noise but coming more swiftly the first frog had jumped once for the fly and missed it when the other leaped upon him savagely and a fight began while the ibis lay neglected on a lily pad they pawed and bit each other fiercely for several minutes then the second frog a little smaller than the other got the grip he wanted and held it he clasped his fore legs tight about his rivals neck and began to strangle him slowly i knew well how strong chigwooltz is in his forearms and that his fightings and wrestlings are desperate affairs but i did not know till then how savage he can be he had gripped from behind by a clever dive so as to use his weight when the right moment came tighter and tighter he hugged the big frogs eyes seemed bursting from his head and his mouth was forced slowly open then his savage opponent lunged upon him with his weight and forced his head under water to finish him  the whole thing seemed scarcely more startling to the luckless big frog than to the watcher in the canoe it was all so brutal so deliberately planned the smaller frog knowing that he was no match for the other in strength had waited cunningly till he was all absorbed in the red fly and then stole upon him intending to finish him first and the little red thing afterwards he would have done it too for the big frog was at his last gasp when i interfered and put them both in my net  meanwhile a third frog had come walloping over the lily pads from somewhere out of sight and grabbed the fly while the other two were fighting about it it was he who first showed me a curious frog trick when i lifted him from the water on the end of my line he raised his hands above his head as if he had been a man and grasped the line and tried to lift himself hand over hand so as to take the strain from his mouthand i could never catch another frog like that  next morning as i went to the early fishing chigwooltz the patient sat by the same stone his fore feet at the edge of the same bronze lily leaf at noon he was still there in twentyfour hours at least he had not moved a muscle  at twilight i was following a bear along the shore it was the restless season when bears are moving constantly scarcely a twilight passed that i did not meet one or more on their wanderings this one was heading for the upper end of the lake traveling in the shallow water near shore and i was just behind him stealing along in my canoe to see what queer thing he would do he was in no hurry as most other bears were but went nosing along shore acting much as a fat pig would in the same place as he approached the alder point he stopped suddenly and twisted his head a bit and set his ears as a dog does that sees something very interesting then he began to steal forward could it bei shot my canoe forwardyes it was chigwooltz still sitting by the green stone with his eye like bunsbys on the coast of greenland in thirtytwo hours to my knowledge he had not stirred  mooween the bear crept nearer he was crouching now like a cat stealing along in the soft mud behind chigwooltz so as to surprise him i saw him raise one paw slowly cautiously high above his head down it came souse sending up a shower of mud and water and chigwooltz the restful who could sit still thirtytwo hours without getting stiff in the joints and then dodge the sweep of mooweens paw went splashing away hippetyippety over the lily pads to some water grass where he said ktung and disappeared for good  a few days later simmo and i moved camp to a grove of birches just above the alder point from behind my tent an old game path led down to the bay where the big frogs lived there were scores of them there the chorus at night with its multitude of voices running from a whistling treble to deep deep bass was at times tremendous it was here that i had the first good opportunity of watching frogs feeding  chigwooltz i found is a perfect gourmand and a cannibal eating besides his regular diet of flies and beetles and water snails young frogs and crawfish and turtles and fish of every kind but few have ever seen him at his hunting for he is active only at night or on dark days  i used to watch them from the shore or from my canoe at twilight just outside the lily pads a shoal of minnows would be playing at the surface or small trout would be rising freely for the night insects then if you watched sharply you would see gleaming points of light the eyes of chigwooltz stealing out with barely a ripple to the edge of the pads and then when some big feeding trout drove the minnows or small fry close in there would be a heavy plunge from the shadow of the pads and you would hear chigwooltz splashing if the fish were a larger one than he expected  that is why small frogs are so deadly afraid if you take them outside the fringe of lily pads they know that big hungry trout feed in from the deeps and that big frogs savage cannibals every one watch out from the shadowy fringe of water plants if you drop a little frog there in clear water he will shoot in as fast as his frightened legs will drive him swimming first on top to avoid fish diving deep as he reaches the pads to avoid his hungry relatives and so in to shallow water and thick stems where he can dodge about and the big frogs cannot follow  all sorts and conditions of frogs lived in that little bay there was one inquisitive fellow who always came out of the pads and swam as near as he could get whenever i appeared on the shore another would sit in his favorite spot under a stranded log and let me come as close as i would but the moment i dangled the red ibis fly in front of him he would disappear like a wink and not show himself again another would follow the fly in a wild kangaroo dance over the lily pads going round and round the canoe as if bewitched and would do his best to climb in after the bit of color when i pulled it up slowly over the bark he afforded me so much good fun that i could not eat him though i always stopped to give him another dance whenever i went fishing for other frogs just like him further along shore lived another a perfect savage so wild that i could never catch him which strangled or drowned two big frogs in a week to my certain knowledge and then one night when i was trying to find my canoe which i had lost in the darkness i came upon a frog migration dozens and dozens of them all hopping briskly in the same direction they had left the stream driven by some strange instinct just like rats or squirrels and were going through the woods to the unknown destination that beckoned them so strongly that they could not but follow  the most curious and interesting bit of their strange life came out at night when they were fascinated by my light i used sometimes to set a candle on a piece of board for a float and place it in the water close to shore where the ripples would set it dancing gently then i would place a little screen of bark at the shore end of the float and sit down behind it in darkness  illustration chigwooltz  presently two points of light would begin to shine then to scintillate out among the lily pads and chigwooltz would come stealing in his eyes growing bigger and brighter with wonder he would place his forearms akimbo on the edge of the float and lift himself up a bit like a little old man and stare steadfastly at the light and there he would stay as long as i let him just staring and blinking  soon two other points of light would come stealing in from the other side and another frog would set his elbows on the float and stare hard across at the firstcomer and then two more shining points and two more till twelve or fifteen frogs were gathered about my beacon as thick as they could find elbow room on the float all staring and blinking like so many strange water owls come up from the bottom to debate weighty things with a little flickering willothewisp nodding grave assent in the midst of them but never a word was spoken the silence was perfect  sometimes one more fascinated or more curious than the others would climb onto the float and put his nose solemnly into the light then there would be a loud sizzle a jump and a splash the candle would go out and the wondering circle of frogs scatter to the lily pads again all swimming as if in a trance dipping their heads under water to wash the light from their bewildered eyes  they were quite fearless almost senseless at such times i would stretch out my hand from the shadow pick up an unresisting frog that threatened too soon to climb onto the float and examine him at leisure but chigwooltz is wedded to his idols the moment i released him he would go fast as his legs could carry him to put his elbows on the float and stare at the light again  among the frogs and especially among the toads as among most wild animals certain individuals attach themselves strongly to man drawn doubtless by some unknown but no less strongly felt attraction it was so there in the wilderness the first morning after our arrival at the birch grove i was down at the shore preparing a trout for baking in the ashes when chigwooltz of the ear drums biggest of all the frogs came from among the lily pads he had lost all fear apparently he swam directly up to me touching my hands with his nose and even crawling out to my feet in the greatest curiosity  after that he took up his abode near the foot of the game path i had only to splash the water there with my finger when he would come from beside a green stone or from under a log or the lily padsfor he had a dozen hiding placesand swim up to me to be fed or petted or to have his back scratched  he ate all sorts of things insects bread beef game and fish either raw or cooked i would attach a bit of meat to a string or straw and wiggle it before him to make it seem alive the moment he saw it he had a queer way sometimes of staring hard at a thing without seeing it he would crouch and creep towards it nearer and nearer softly and more softly like a cat stalking a chipmunk then there would be a red flash and the meat would be gone the red flash was his tongue which is attached at the outer end and folds back in his mouth it is moreover large and sticky and he can throw it out and back like lightning all you see is the red flash of it and his game is gone  one day to try the effects of nicotine on a new subject i took a bit of simmos black tobacco and gave it to chigwooltz he ate it thankfully as he did everything else i gave him in a little while he grew uneasy sitting up and rubbing his belly with his fore paws presently he brought his stomach up into his mouth turned it inside out to get rid of the tobacco washed it thoroughly in the lake swallowed it down again and was ready for his bread and beef a most convenient arrangement that and also a perfectly unbiased opinion on a much debated subject  chigwooltz unlike many of my pets was not in the least dependent on my bounty indeed he was a remarkable hunter on his own account and what he took from me he took as hospitality not charity one morning he came to me with the tail of a small trout sticking out of his mouth the rest of the fish was below being digested another day towards twilight i saw him resting on the lily pads looking very full with a suspiciouslooking object curling out over his under lip i wiggled my finger in the water and he came from pure sociability for he was beyond eating any more the suspiciouslooking object proved to be a birds foot and beside it was a pointed wing tip that was too much for my curiosity i opened his mouth and pulled out the bird with some difficulty for chigwooltz had been engaged some time in the act of swallowing his game and had it well down it proved to be a fullgrown male swallow without a mark anywhere to show how he had come by his death chigwooltz looked at me reproachfully but swallowed his game promptly the moment i had finished examining it  there was small doubt in my mind that he had caught his bird fairly by a quick spring as the swallow touched the water almost at his nose near one of his numerous lurking places still it puzzled me a good deal till one early morning when i saw him in broad daylight do a much more difficult thing than snapping up a swallow  i was coming down the game path to the shore when a bird a tree sparrow i thought flew to the ground just ahead of me and hopped to the water to drink i watched him a moment curiously then with intense interest as i saw a ripple steal out of the lily pads towards him the ripple was chigwooltz  the sparrow had finished drinking and was absorbed in a morning bath chigwooltz stole nearer and nearer sinking himself till only his eyes showed above water the ripple that flowed away on either side was gentle as that of a floating leaf then just as the bird had sipped and lifted its head for a last swallow chigwooltz hurled himself out of water one snap of his big mouth and the sparrow was done for  an hour later when i came down to my canoe he was sitting low on the lily pads winking sleepily now and then with eight little sparrows toes curling over the rim of his under lip like a hornpouts whiskers     vi cloud wings the eagle  illustration old whitehead   here he is again heres old whitehead robbing the fishhawk  i started up from the little commoosie beyond the fire at gillies excited cry and ran to join him on the shore a glance out over caribou point to the big bay where innumerable whitefish were shoaling showed me another chapter in a long but always interesting story ismaquehs the fishhawk had risen from the lake with a big fish and was doing his best to get away to his nest where his young ones were clamoring over him soared the eagle still as fate and as sure now dropping to flap a wing in ismaquehs face now touching him with his great talons gently as if to say do you feel that ismaquehs if i grip once t will be the end of you and your fish together and what will the little ones do then up in the nest on the old pine better drop him peacefully you can catch anotherdrop him i say  illustration ismaquehs  up to that moment the eagle had merely bothered the big hawks flight with a gentle reminder now and then that he meant no harm but wanted the fish which he could not catch himself now there was a change a flash of the kings temper with a roar of wings he whirled round the hawk like a tempest bringing up short and fierce squarely in his line of flight there he poised on dark broad wings his yellow eyes glaring fiercely into the shrinking soul of ismaquehs his talons drawn hard back for a deadly strike and simmo the indian who had run down to join me muttered cheplahgan mad now ismaquehs findum out in a minute  but ismaquehs knew just when to stop with a cry of rage he dropped or rather threw his fish hoping it would strike the water and be lost on the instant the eagle wheeled out of the way and bent his head sharply i had seen him fold wings and drop before and had held my breath at the speed but dropping was of no use now for the fish fell faster instead he swooped downward adding to the weight of his fall the push of his strong wings glancing down like a bolt to catch the fish ere it struck the water and rising again in a great curveup and away steadily evenly as the king should fly to his own little ones far away on the mountain  weeks before i had had my introduction to old whitehead as gillie called him on the madawaska we were pushing up river on our way to the wilderness when a great outcry and the bangbang of a gun sounded just ahead dashing round a wooded bend we came upon a man with a smoking gun a boy up to his middle in the river trying to get across and on the other side a black sheep running about baaing at every jump  hes taken the lamb hes taken the lamb shouted the boy following the direction of his pointing finger i saw old whitehead a splendid bird rising heavily above the treetops across the clearing reaching back almost instinctively i clutched the heavy rifle which gillie put into my hand and jumped out of the canoe for with a rifle one wants steady footing it was a long shot but not so very difficult old whitehead had got his bearings and was moving steadily straight away a second after the report of the rifle we saw him hitch and swerve in the air then two white quills came floating down and as he turned we saw the break in his broad white tail and that was the mark that we knew him by ever afterwards  that was nearly eighty miles by canoe from where we now stood though scarcely ten in a straight line over the mountains for the rivers and lakes we were following doubled back almost to the starting point and the whole wild splendid country was the eagles hunting ground wherever i went i saw him following the rivers for stranded trout and salmon or floating high in air where he could overlook two or three wilderness lakes with as many honest fishhawks catching their dinners i had promised the curator of a museum that i would get him an eagle that summer and so took to hunting the great bird diligently but hunting was of little use except to teach me many of his ways and habits for he seemed to have eyes and ears all over him and whether i crept like a snake through the woods or floated like a wild duck in my canoe over the water he always saw or heard me and was off before i could get within shooting distance  then i tried to trap him i placed two large trout with a steel trap between them in a shallow spot on the river that i could watch from my camp on a bluff half a mile below next day gillie who was more eager than i set up a shout and running out i saw old whitehead standing in the shallows and flopping about the trap we jumped into a canoe and pushed up river in hot haste singing in exultation that we had the fierce old bird at last when we doubled the last point that hid the shallows there was old whitehead still tugging away at a fish and splashing the water not thirty yards away i shall not soon forget his attitude and expression as we shot round the point his body erect and rigid his wings half spread his head thrust forward eyelids drawn straight and a strong fierce gleam of freedom and utter wildness in his bright eyes so he stood a magnificent creature till we were almost upon himwhen he rose quietly taking one of the trout the other was already in his stomach he was not in the trap at all but had walked carefully round it the splashing was made in tearing one fish to pieces with his claws and freeing the other from a stake that held it  after that he would not go near the shallows for a new experience had come into his life leaving its shadow dark behind it he who was king of all he surveyed from the old blasted pine on the crags top who had always heretofore been the hunter now knew what it meant to be hunted and the fear of it was in his eyes i think and softened their fierce gleam when i looked into them again weeks later by his own nest on the mountain  simmo entered also into our hunting but without enthusiasm or confidence he had chased the same eagle beforeall one summer in fact when a sportsman whom he was guiding had offered him twenty dollars for the royal birds skin but old whitehead still wore it triumphantly and simmo prophesied for him long life and a natural death no use huntum dat heagle he said simply i try once an cant get near him he see everyting and wot he dont see he hear sides he kin feel danger das why he build nest way off long ways o don know where this last with a wave of his arm to include the universe cheplahgan old cloud wings he proudly called the bird that had defied him in a summers hunting  at first i had hunted him like any other savage partly of course to get his skin for the curator partly perhaps to save the settlers lambs over on the madawaska but chiefly just to kill him to exult in his death flaps and to rid the woods of a cruel tyrant gradually however a change came over me as i hunted i sought him less and less for his skin and his life and more and more for himself to know all about him i used to watch him by the hour from my camp on the big lake sailing quietly over caribou point after he had eaten with his little ones and was disposed to let ismaquehs go on with his fishing in peace he would set his great wings to the breeze and sit like a kite in the wind mounting steadily in an immense spiral up and up without the shadow of effort till the eye grew dizzy in following and i loved to watch him so strong so free so sure of himselfround and round up and ever up without hurry without exertion and every turn found the heavens nearer and the earth spread wider below now head and tail gleam silver white in the sunshine now he hangs motionless a cross of jet that a lady might wear at her throat against the clear unfathomable blue of the june heavensthere he is lost in the blue so high that i cannot see any more but even as i turn away he plunges down into vision again dropping with folded wings straight down like a plummet faster and faster larger and larger through a terrifying rush of air till i spring to my feet and catch the breath as if i myself were falling and just before he dashes himself to pieces he turns in the air head downward and half spreads his wings and goes shooting slanting down towards the lake then up in a great curve to the tree tops where he can watch better what kakagos the rare woodsraven is doing and what game he is hunting for that is what cheplahgan came down in such a hurry to find out about  again he would come in the early morning sweeping up river as if he had already been a long days journey with the air of faraway and fartogo in his onward rush and if i were at the trout pools and very still i would hear the strong silken rustle of his wings as he passed at midday i would see him poised over the highest mountaintop northward at an enormous altitude where the imagination itself could not follow the splendid sweep of his vision and at evening he would cross the lake moving westward into the sunset on tireless pinionsalways strong noble magnificent in his power and loneliness a perfect emblem of the great lonely magnificent wilderness  one day as i watched him it swept over me suddenly that forest and river would be incomplete without him the thought of this came back to me and spared him to the wilderness on the last occasion when i went hunting for his life  that was just after we reached the big lake where i saw him robbing the fishhawk after much searching and watching i found a great log by the outlet where old whitehead often perched there was a big eddy hard by on the edge of a shallow and he used to sit on the log waiting for fish to come out where he could wade in and get them there was a sickness among the suckers that year it comes regularly every few years as among rabbits and they would come struggling out of the deep water to rest on the sand only to be caught by the minks and fishhawks and bears and old whitehead all of whom were waiting and hungry for fish  for several days i put a big bait of trout and whitefish on the edge of the shallows the first two baits were put out late in the afternoon and a bear got them both the next night then i put them out in the early morning and before noon cheplahgan had found them he came straight as a string from his watch place over the mountain miles away causing me to wonder greatly what strange sixth sense guided him for sight and smell seemed equally out of the question the next day he came again then i placed the best bait of all in the shallows and hid in the dense underbrush near with my gun  he came at last after hours of waiting dropping from above the treetops with a heavy rustling of pinions and as he touched the old log and spread his broad white tail i saw and was proud of the gap which my bullet had made weeks before he stood there a moment erect and splendid head neck and tail a shining white even the dark brown feathers of his body glinted in the bright sunshine and he turned his head slowly from side to side his keen eyes flashing as if he would say behold a king to chigwooltz the frog and tookhees the wood mouse and to any other chance wild creature that might watch him from the underbrush at his unkingly act of feeding on dead fish then he hopped downrather awkwardly it must be confessed for he is a creature of the upper deeps who cannot bear to touch the earthseized a fish which he tore to pieces with his claws and ate greedily twice i tried to shoot him but the thought of the wilderness without him was upon me and held me back then too it seemed so mean to pot him from ambush when he had come down to earth where he was at a disadvantage and when he clutched some of the larger fish in his talons and rose swiftly and bore away westward all desire to kill him was gone there were little cloud wings it seemed which i must also find and watch after that i hunted him more diligently than before but without my gun and a curious desire which i could not account for took possession of me to touch this untamed untouched creature of the clouds and mountains  next day i did it there were thick bushes growing along one end of the old log on which the eagle rested into these i cut a tunnel with my huntingknife arranging the tops in such a way as to screen me more effectively then i put out my bait a good two hours before the time of old whiteheads earliest appearance and crawled into my den to wait  i had barely settled comfortably into my place wondering how long human patience could endure the sting of insects and the hot close air without moving or stirring a leaf when the heavy silken rustle sounded close at hand and i heard the grip of his talons on the log there he stood at arms length turning his head uneasily the light glinting on his white crest the fierce untamed flash in his bright eye never before had he seemed so big so strong so splendid my heart jumped at the thought of him as our national emblem i am glad still to have seen that emblem once and felt the thrill of it  but i had little time to think for cheplahgan was restless some instinct seemed to warn him of a danger that he could not see the moment his head was turned away i stretched out my arm scarcely a leaf moved with the motion yet he whirled like a flash and crouched to spring his eyes glaring straight into mine with an intensity that i could scarce endure perhaps i was mistaken but in that swift instant the hard glare in his eyes seemed to soften with fear as he recognized me as the one thing in the wilderness that dared to hunt him the king my hand touched him fair on the shoulder then he shot into the air and went sweeping in great circles over the treetops still looking down at the man wondering and fearing at the way in which he had been brought into the mans power  but one thing he did not understand standing erect on the log and looking up at him as he swept over me i kept thinking i did it i did it cheplahgan old cloud wings and i had grabbed your legs and pinned you down and tied you in a bag and brought you to camp but that i chose to let you go free and that is better than shooting you now i shall find your little ones and touch them too  for several days i had been watching old whiteheads lines of flight and had concluded that his nest was somewhere in the hills northwest of the big lake i went there one afternoon and while confused in the big timber which gave no outlook in any direction i saw not old whitehead but a larger eagle his mate undoubtedly flying straight westward with food towards a great cliff that i had noticed with my glass one day from a mountain on the other side of the lake  when i went there early next morning it was cheplahgan himself who showed me where his nest was i was hunting along the foot of the cliff when glancing back towards the lake i saw him coming far away and hid in the underbrush he passed very near and following i saw him standing on a ledge near the top of the cliff just below him in the top of a stunted tree growing out of the face of the rock was a huge mass of sticks that formed the nest with a great mothereagle standing by feeding the little ones both birds started away silently when i appeared but came back soon and swept back and forth over me as i sat watching the nest and the face of the cliff through my glass no need now of caution both birds seemed to know instinctively why i had come and that the fate of the eaglets lay in my hands if i could but scale the cliff  it was scaring business that threehundredfoot climb up the sheer face of the mountain fortunately the rock was seamed and scarred with the wear of centuries bushes and stunted trees grew out of countless crevices which gave me sure footing and sometimes a lift of a dozen feet or more on my way up as i climbed the eagles circled lower and lower the strong rustling of their wings was about my head continually they seemed to grow larger fiercer every moment as my hold grew more precarious and the earth and the pointed treetops dropped farther below there was a good revolver in my pocket to use in case of necessity but had the great birds attacked me i should have fared badly for at times i was obliged to grip hard with both hands my face to the cliff leaving the eagles free to strike from above and behind i think now that had i shown fear in such a place or shouted or tried to fray them away they would have swooped upon me wing and claw like furies i could see it in their fierce eyes as i looked up but the thought of the times when i had hunted him and especially the thought of that time when i had reached out of the bushes and touched him was upon old whitehead and made him fear so i kept steadily on my way apparently giving no thought to the eagles though deep inside i was anxious enough and reached the foot of the tree in which the nest was made  i stood there a long time my arm clasping the twisted old boll looking out over the forest spread wide below partly to regain courage partly to reassure the eagles which were circling very near with a kind of intense wonder in their eyes but chiefly to make up my mind what to do next the tree was easy to climb but the nesta huge affair which had been added to year after yearfilled the whole treetop and i could gain no foothold from which to look over and see the eaglets without tearing the nest to pieces i did not want to do that and i doubted whether the mothereagle would stand it a dozen times she seemed on the point of dropping on my head to tear it with her talons but always she veered off as i looked up quietly and old whitehead with the mark of my bullet strong upon him swept between her and me and seemed to say wait wait i dont understand but he can kill us if he willand the little ones are in his power now he was closer to me than ever and the fear was vanishing but so also was the fierceness  from the foot of the tree the crevice in which it grew led upwards to the right then doubled back to the ledge above the nest upon which cheplahgan was standing when i discovered him the lip of this crevice made a dizzy path that one might follow by moving crabwise his face to the cliff with only its roughnesses to cling to with his fingers i tried it at last crept up and out twenty feet and back ten and dropped with a great breath of relief to a broad ledge covered with bones and fish scales the relics of many a savage feast below me almost within reach was the nest with two dark scraggly young birds resting on twigs and grass with fish flesh and fowl in a gory skinny scaly ring about themthe most savagelooking household into which i ever looked unbidden  but even as i looked and wondered and tried to make out what other game had been furnished the young savages i had helped to feed a strange thing happened which touched me as few things ever have among the wild creatures the eagles had followed me close along the last edge of rock hoping no doubt in their wild hearts that i would slip and end their troubles and give my body as food to the young now as i sat on the ledge peering eagerly into the nest the great motherbird left me and hovered over her eaglets as if to shield them with her wings from even the sight of my eyes but old whitehead still circled over me lower he came and lower till with a supreme effort of daring he folded his wings and dropped to the ledge beside me within ten feet and turned and looked into my eyes see he seemed to say we are within reach again you touched me once i dont know how or why here i am now to touch or to kill as you will only spare the little ones  a moment later the motherbird dropped to the edge of the nest and there we sat we three with the wonder upon us all the young eagles at our feet the cliff above and three hundred feet below the spruce tops of the wilderness reaching out and away to the mountains beyond the big lake i sat perfectly still which is the only way to reassure a wild creature and soon i thought cheplahgan had lost his fear in his anxiety for the little ones but the moment i rose to go he was in the air again circling restlessly above my head with his mate the same wild fierceness in his eyes as he looked down a halfhour later i had gained the top of the cliff and started eastward towards the lake coming down by a much easier way than that by which i went up later i returned several times and from a distance watched the eaglets being fed but i never climbed to the nest again  one day when i came to the little thicket on the cliff where i used to lie and watch the nest through my glass i found that one eaglet was gone the other stood on the edge of the nest looking down fearfully into the abyss whither no doubt his bolder nest mate had flown and calling disconsolately from time to time his whole attitude showed plainly that he was hungry and cross and lonesome presently the mothereagle came swiftly up from the valley and there was food in her talons she came to the edge of the nest hovered over it a moment so as to give the hungry eaglet a sight and smell of food then went slowly down to the valley taking the food with her telling the little one in her own way to come and he should have it he called after her loudly from the edge of the nest and spread his wings a dozen times to follow but the plunge was too awful his heart failed him and he settled back in the nest and pulled his head down into his shoulders and shut his eyes and tried to forget that he was hungry the meaning of the little comedy was plain enough she was trying to teach him to fly telling him that his wings were grown and the time was come to use them but he was afraid  in a little while she came back again this time without food and hovered over the nest trying every way to induce the little one to leave it she succeeded at last when with a desperate effort he sprang upward and flapped to the ledge above where i had sat and watched him with old whitehead then after surveying the world gravely from his new place he flapped back to the nest and turned a deaf ear to all his mothers assurances that he could fly just as easily to the treetops below if he only would  suddenly as if discouraged she rose well above him i held my breath for i knew what was coming the little fellow stood on the edge of the nest looking down at the plunge which he dared not take there was a sharp cry from behind which made him alert tense as a watchspring the next instant the mothereagle had swooped striking the nest at his feet sending his support of twigs and himself with them out into the air together  he was afloat now afloat on the blue air in spite of himself and flapped lustily for life over him under him beside him hovered the mother on tireless wings calling softly that she was there but the awful fear of the depths and the lance tops of the spruces was upon the little one his flapping grew more wild he fell faster and faster suddenlymore in fright it seemed to me than because he had spent his strengthhe lost his balance and tipped head downward in the air it was all over now it seemed he folded his wings to be dashed in pieces among the trees then like a flash the old mothereagle shot under him his despairing feet touched her broad shoulders between her wings he righted himself rested an instant found his head then she dropped like a shot from under him leaving him to come down on his own wings a handful of feathers torn out by his claws hovered slowly down after them  it was all the work of an instant before i lost them among the trees far below and when i found them again with my glass the eaglet was in the top of a great pine and the mother was feeding him  and then standing there alone in the great wilderness it flashed upon me for the first time just what the wise old prophet meant though he wrote long ago in a distant land and another than cloud wings had taught her little ones all unconscious of the kindly eyes that watched out of a thicket as the eagle stirreth up her nest fluttereth over her young spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them beareth them on her wingsso the lord     vii upweekis the shadow  illustration upweekis   long go o long time go so says simmo the indian upweekis the lynx came to clote scarpe one day with a complaint see he said you are good to everybody but me pekquam the fisher is cunning and patient he can catch what he will lhoks the panther is strong and tireless nothing can get away from him not even the great moose and mooween the bear sleeps all winter when game is scarce and in summer eats everythingroots and mice and berries and dead fish and meat and honey and red ants so he is always full and happy but my eyes are no good they are bright like cheplahgan the eagles yet they cannot see anything unless it moves for you have made every creature that hides just like the place he hides in my nose is worse it cannot smell seksagadagee the grouse though i walk over him asleep in the snow and my feet make a noise in the leaves so that moktaques the rabbit hears me and hides and laughs behind me when i go to catch him and i am always hungry make me now like the shadows that play in order that nothing may notice me when i go hunting  so clote scarpe the great chief who was kind to all animals gave upweekis a soft gray coat that is almost invisible in the woods summer or winter and made his feet large and padded them with soft fur so that indeed he is like the shadows that play for you can neither see nor hear him but clote scarpe remembered moktaques the rabbit also and gave him two coats a brown one for summer and a white one for winter consequently he is harder than ever to see when he is quiet and upweekis must still depend upon his wits to catch him as upweekis has few wits to spare moktaques often sees him close at hand and chuckles in his form under the brown ferns or sits up straight under the snowcovered hemlock tips and watches the big lynx at his hunting  sometimes on a winter night when you camp in the wilderness and the snow is sifting down into your fire and the woods are all still a fierce screech breaks suddenly out of the darkness just behind your windbreak of boughs you jump to your feet and grab your rifle but simmo who is down on his knees before the fire frying pork only turns his head to listen a moment and says upweekis catchum rabbit dat time then he gets closer to the fire for the screech was not pleasant and goes on with his cooking  you are more curious than he or you want the big cats skin to take home with you you steal away towards the cry past the little commoosie or shelter that you made hastily at sundown when the trail ended there with your back to the fire and the commoosie between the light does not dazzle your eyes you can trace the shadows creeping in and out stealthily among the underbrush but if upweekis is thereand he probably isyou do not see him he is a shadow among the shadows only there is this difference shadows move no bushes as you watch a firtip stirs a bit of snow drops down you gaze intently at the spot then out of the deep shadow two living coals are suddenly kindled they grow larger and larger glowing flashing burning holes into your eyes till you brush them swiftly with your hand a shiver runs over you for to look into the eyes of a lynx at night when the light catches them is a scary experience your rifle jumps to position the glowing coals are quenched on the instant then when your eyes have blinked the fascination out of them the shadows go creeping in and out again and upweekis is lost amongst them  sometimes indeed you see him again moktaques the big white hare who forgets a thing the moment it is past sees you standing there and is full of curiosity he forgets that he was being hunted a moment ago and comes hopping along to see what you are you back away toward the fire he scampers off in a fright but presently comes hopping after you watch the underbrush behind him sharply in a moment it stirs stealthily as if a shadow were moving it and there is the lynx stealing along in the snow with his eyes blazing again moktaques feels that he is hunted and does the only safe thing he crouches low in the snow where a firtip bends over him and is still as the earth his color hides him perfectly  upweekis has lost the trail again he wavers back and forth like a shadow under a swinging lamp turning his great head from side to side he cannot see nor hear nor smell his game but he saw a bit of snow fly a moment ago and knows that it came from moktaques big pads dont stir now be still as the great spruce in whose shadow you stand and once in a hunters lifetime perhaps you will see a curious tragedy  the lynx settles himself in the snow with all four feet close together ready for a spring as you watch and wonder a screech rings out through the woods so sharp and fierce that no rabbits nerves can stand it close at hand and be still moktaques jumps straight up in the air the lynx sees it whirls hurls himself at the spot another screech a different one and then you know that its all over  and that is why upweekis cry is so fierce and sudden on a winter night your fire attracts the rabbits upweekis knows this or is perhaps attracted himself and comes also and hides among the shadows but he never catches anything unless he blunders onto it that is why he wanders so much in winter and passes twenty rabbits before he catches one so when he knows that moktaques is near watching the light but remaining himself invisible upweekis crouches for a spring then he screeches fearfully moktaques hears it and is startled as anybody else would be hearing such a cry near him he jumps in a fright and pays the penalty  if the lynx is a big one and very hungry as he generally is in winter you may get some unpleasant impressions of him in another way when you venture far from your fire his eyes blaze out at you from the darkness just two big glowing spots which are all you see and which disappear at your first motion then as you strain your eyes and watch and listen you feel the coals upon you again from another place and there they are under a bush on your left creeping closer and blazing deep red they disappear suddenly as the lynx turns his head only to reappear and fascinate you from another point so he plays with you as if you were a great mouse creeping closer all the time swishing his stub tail fiercely to lash himself up to the courage point of springing but his movements are so still and shadowy that unless he follows you as you back away to the fire and so comes within the circle of light the chances are that you will never see him  indeed the chances are always that way day or night unless you turn hunter and set a trap for him in the rabbit paths which he follows nightly and hang a bait over it to make him look up and forget his steps in summer he goes to the burned lands for the rabbits that swarm in the thickets and to rear his young in seclusion you find his tracks there all about and the marks of his killing but though you watch and prowl all day and come home in the twilight you will learn little he hears you and skulks away amid the lights and shadows of the hillside and so hides himselfin plain sight sometimes like a young partridgethat he manages to keep a clean record in the notebook where you hoped to write down all about him  in winter you cross his tracks great round tracks that wander everywhere through the big woods and you think now i shall find him surely but though you follow for miles and learn much about him finding where he passed this rabbit close at hand without suspecting it and caught that one by accident and missed the partridge that burst out of the snow under his very feetstill upweekis himself remains only a shadow of the woods once after a glorious long tramp on his trail i found the spot where he had been sleeping a moment before but beside that experience i must put fifty other trails that i have followed of which i never saw the end nor the beginning and whenever i have found out anything about upweekis it has generally come unexpectedly as most good things do  once the chance came as i was watching a muskrat at his supper it was twilight in the woods i had drifted in close to shore in my canoe to see what musquash was doing on top of a rock all muskrats have favorite eating placesa rock a stranded log a tree boll that leans out over the water and always a pretty spotwhither they bring food from a distance evidently for the purpose of eating it where they feel most at home this one had gathered a half dozen big freshwater clams onto his dining table and sat down in the midst to enjoy the feast he would take a clam in his fore paws whack it a few times on the rock till the shell cracked then open it with his teeth and devour the morsel inside he ate leisurely tasting each clam critically before swallowing and sitting up often to wash his whiskers or to look out over the lake a hermit thrush sang marvelously sweet above him the twilight colors glowed deep and deeper in the water below where his shadow was clearly eating clams also in the midst of heavens splendoraltogether a pretty scene and a moment of peace that i still love to remember i quite forgot that musquash is a villain but the tragedy was near as it always is in the wilderness suddenly a movement caught my eye on the bank above something was waving nervously under the bushes before i could make out what it was there was a fearful rush a gleam of wild yellow eyes a squeak from the muskrat then upweekis looking gaunt and dark and strange in his summer coat was crouched on the rock with musquash between his great paws growling fiercely as he cracked the bones he bit his game all over to make sure that it was quite dead then took it by the back of the neck glided into the bushes with his stub tail twitching and became a shadow again  another time i was perched up in a lodged tree some twenty feet from the ground watching a big bait of fish which i had put in an open spot for anything that might choose to come and get it i was hoping for a bear and so climbed above the ground that he might not get my scent should he come from leeward it was early autumn and my intentions were wholly peaceable i had no weapon of any kind  late in the afternoon something took to chasing a red squirrel near me i heard them scurrying through the trees but could see nothing the chase passed out of hearing and i had almost forgotten it for something was moving in the underbrush near my bait when back it came with a rush the squirrel half dead with fright leaped from a sprucetip to the ground jumped onto the tree in which i sat and raced up the incline almost to my feet where he sprang to a branch and sat chattering hysterically between two fears after him came a pine marten following swiftly catching the scent of his game not from the bark or the ground but apparently from the air scarcely had he jumped upon my tree when there was a screech and a rush in the underbrush just below him and out of the bushes came a young lynx to join in the chase he missed the marten on the ground but sprang to my tree like a flash i remember still that the only sound i was conscious of at the time was the ripping of his nails in the dead bark he had been seeking my bait undoubtedlyfor it was a good lynx country and upweekis loves fish like a catwhen the chase passed under his nose and he joined it on the instant  halfway up the incline the marten smelled me or was terrified by the noise behind him and leaped aside a branch upon which i was leaning swayed or snapped and the lucivee stopped as if struck crouching lower and lower against the tree his big yellow expressionless eyes glaring straight into mine a moment only he stood the steady look then his eyes wavered he turned his head leaped for the underbrush and was gone  another moment and meeko the squirrel had forgotten his fright and peril and everything else save his curiosity to find out who i was and all about me he had to pass quite close to me to get to another tree but anything was better than going back where the marten might be waiting so he was presently over my head snickering and barking to make me move and scolding me soundly for disturbing the peace of the woods in summer upweekis is a solitary creature rearing his young away back on the wildest burned lands where game is plenty and where it is almost impossible to find him except by accident in winter also he roams alone for the most part but occasionally when rabbits are scarce as they are periodically in the northern woods he gathers in small bands for the purpose of pulling down big game that he would never attack singly generally upweekis is skulking and cowardly with man but when driven by hunger as i found out once or when hunting in bands he is a savage beast and must be followed cautiously  i had heard much of the fierceness of these hunting bands from settlers and hunters and once a friend of mine an old backwoodsman had a narrow escape from them he had a dog grip a big brindled cur of whose prowess in killing varmints he was always bragging calling him the best lucififer dog in all canada lucififer by the way is a local name for the lynx on the upper st john where grip and his master lived  one day in winter the master missed a young heifer and went on his trail with grip and his axe for companions presently he came to lynx tracks then to signs of a struggle then plump upon six or seven of the big cats snarling savagely over the body of the heifer grip the lucififer dog rushed in blindly and in two minutes was torn to ribbons then the lynxes came creeping and snarling towards the man who backed away shouting and swinging his axe he killed one by a lucky blow as it sprang for his chest the others drove him to his own door but he would never have reached it so he told me but for a long strip of open land that he had cleared back into the woods he would face and charge the beasts which seemed more afraid of his voice than of the axe then run desperately to keep them from circling and getting between him and safety when he reached the open strip they followed a little way along the edges of the underbrush but returned one at a time when they were sure he had no further mind to disturb their feast or their fighting  it is curious that when upweekis and his hunting pack pull down game in this way the first thing they do is to fight over it there may be meat enough and to spare but under their fearful hunger is the old beastly instinct for each one to grab all for himself so they fall promptly to teeth and claws before the game is dead the fightings at such times are savage affairs both to the eye and ear one forgets that upweekis is a shadow and thinks that he must be a fiend  one day in winter when after caribou i came upon a very large lynx track the largest i have ever seen it was two days old but it led in my direction toward the caribou barrens and i followed it to see what i should see  presently it joined four other lynx trails and a mile farther on all five trails went forward in great flying leaps each lynx leaving a hole in the snow as big as a bucket at every jump a hundred yards of this kind of traveling and the trails joined another trailthat of a wounded caribou from the barrens his tracks showed that he had been traveling with difficulty on three legs here was a place where he had stood to listen and there was another place where even untrained eyes might see that he had plunged forward with a start of fear it was a silent story but full of eager interest in every detail  the lucivee tracks now showed different tactics they crossed and crisscrossed the trail appearing now in front now behind now on either side the wounded bull evidently closing in upon him warily here and there was a depression in the snow where one had crouched growling as the game passed then the struggle began first there was a trampled place in the snow where the bull had taken a stand and the big cats went creeping about him waiting for a chance to spring all together he broke away from that but the threelegged gallop speedily exhausted him only when he trots is a caribou tireless the lynxes followed the deadly catplay began again first one then another leaped only to be shaken off then two then all five were upon the poor brute which still struggled forward the record was written red all over the snow  illustration the lynxes and caribou  as i followed it cautiously a snarl sounded just ahead i kicked off my snowshoes and circled noiselessly to the left so as to look out over a little opening there lay the stripped carcass of the caribou with two lynxes still upon it growling fearfully at each other as they pulled at the bones another lynx crouched in the snow under a bush watching the scene two others circled about each other snarling looking for an opening but too well fed to care for a fight just then two or three foxes a pine marten and a fisher moved ceaselessly in and out sniffing hungrily and waiting for a chance to seize every scrap of bone or skin that was left unguarded for an instant above them a dozen moose birds kept the same watch vigilantly as i stole nearer hoping to get behind an old log where i could lie and watch the spectacle some creature scurried out of the underbrush at one side i was watching the movement when a loud keeyaaah startled me i whirled towards the opening from behind the old log a fierce round head with tasseled ears rose up and the big lynx whose trail i had first followed sprang into sight snarling and spitting viciously  the feast stopped at the first alarm the marten disappeared instantly the foxes and the fisher and one lynx slunk away another which i had not seen stalked up to the carcass and put his fore paws upon it and turned his savage head in my direction evidently other lynxes had come in to the kill beside the five i had followed then all the big cats crouched in the snow and stared at me steadily out of their wild yellow eyes  it was only for a moment the big lynx on my side of the log was in a fighting temper he snarled continuously another sprang over the log and crouched beside him facing me then began a curious scene of which i could not wait to see the end the two lynxes hitched nearer and nearer to where i stood motionless watching they would creep forward a step or two then crouch in the snow like a cat warming her feet and stare at me unblinkingly for a few moments then another hitch or two which brought them nearer and another stare i could not look at one steadily to make him waver for the moment my eyes were upon him the others hitched closer and already two more lynxes were coming over the log i had to draw the curtain hastily with a bullet between the yellow eyes of the biggest lynx and a second straight into the chest of his fellowstarer just as he wriggled down into the snow for a spring the others had leaped away snarling as the first heavy report rolled through the woods  another time in the same region a solitary lynx made me uncomfortable for half an afternoon it was sunday and i had gone for a snowshoe tramp leaving my rifle behind me on the way back to camp i stopped for a caribou head and skin which i had cached on the edge of a barren the morning before the weather had changed a bitter cold wind blew after me as i turned toward camp i carried the head with its branching antlers on my shoulder the skin hung down to keep my back warm its edges trailing in the snow  gradually i became convinced that something was following me but i turned several times without seeing anything it is only a fisher i thought and kept on steadily instead of going back to examine my trail for i was hoping for a glimpse of the cunning creature whose trail you find so often running side by side with your own and who follows you if you have any trace of game about you hour after hour through the wilderness without ever showing himself in the light then i whirled suddenly obeying an impulse and there was upweekis a big savagelooking fellow just gliding up on my trail in plain sight following the broad snowshoe track and the scent of the fresh caribou skin without difficulty poor trailer though he be  he stopped and sat down on his feet as a lucivee generally does when you surprise him and stared at me steadily when i went on again i knew that he was after me though he had disappeared from the trail  then began a doublequick of four miles the object being to reach camp before night should fall and give the lucivee the advantage it was already late enough to make one a bit uneasy he knew that i was hurrying he grew bolder showing himself openly on the trail behind me i turned into an old swamping road which gave me a bit of open before and behind then i saw him occasionally on either side or crouching half hid until i passed clearly he was waiting for night but to this day i am not sure whether it was the man or the caribou skin upon which he had set his heart the scent of flesh and blood was in his nose and he was too hungry to control himself much longer  i cut a good club with my big jackknife and watching my chance threw off the caribou head and jumped for him as he crouched in the snow he leaped aside untouched but crouched again instantly showing all his teeth snarling horribly three times i swung at him warily each time he jumped aside and watched for his opening but i kept the club in play before his eyes and it was not yet dark enough then i yelled in his face to teach him fear and went on again  near camp i shouted for simmo to bring my rifle but he was slow in understanding and his answering shout alarmed the savage creature near me his movements became instantly more wary more hidden he left the open trail and once when i saw him well behind me his head was raised high listening i threw down the caribou head to keep him busy and ran for camp in a few minutes i was stealing back again with my rifle but upweekis had felt the change in the situation and was again among the shadows where he belongs i lost his trail in the darkening woods  there was another lynx which showed me one day a different side to upweekis nature it was in summer when every creature in the wilderness seems an altogether different creature from the one you knew last winter with new habits new duties new pleasures and even a new coat to hide him better from his enemies opposite my island camp where i halted a little while in a summers roving was a burned ridge that is it had been burned over years before now it was a perfect tangle with many an open sunny spot however where berries grew by handfuls rabbits swarmed there and grouse were plenty as it was forty miles back from the settlements it seemed a perfect place for upweekis to make a den in and so it was i have no doubt there were a dozen litters of kittens on that two miles of ridge but the cover was so dense that nothing smaller than a deer could be seen moving  for two weeks i hunted the ridge whenever i was not fishing stealing in and out among the thickets depending more upon ears than eyes but seeing nothing of upweekis save here and there a trampled fern or a bloodsplashed leaf with a bit of rabbit fur or a great round cat track to tell the story once i came upon a bear and two cubs among the berries and once when the wind was blowing down the hill i walked almost up to a bull caribou without seeing him he was watching my approach curiously only his eyes ears and horns showing above the tangle where he stood down in the coverts it was always intensely still with a stillness that i took good care not to break so when the great brute whirled with a snort and a tremendous crash of bushes almost under my nose it raised my hair for a moment not knowing what the creature was nor which way he was heading but though every day brought its experience and its knowledge and its new wonder at the ways of wild things i found no trace of the den nor of the kittens i had hoped to watch all animals are silent near their little ones so there was never a cry by night or day to guide me  late one afternoon when i had climbed to the top of the ridge and was on my way back to camp i ran into an odor the strong disagreeable odor that always hovers about the den of a carnivorous animal i followed it through a thicket and came to an open stony place with a sharp drop of five or six feet to dense cover below the odor came from this cover so i jumped down whenyeow karrrr pftpft almost under my feet a gray thing leaped away snarling followed by another i had the merest glimpse of them but from the way they bristled and spit and arched their backs i knew that i had stumbled upon a pair of the lynx kittens for which i had searched so long in vain  they had probably been lying out on the warm stones until hearing strange footsteps they had glided away to cover when i crashed down near them they had been scared into showing their temper else i had never seen them in the underbrush fortunately for me the fierce old mother was away had she been there i should undoubtedly have had more serious business on hand than watching her kittens  they had not seen more of me than my shoes and stockings so when i stole after them to see what they were like they were waiting under a bush to see what i was like they jumped away again spitting without seeing me alarmed by the rustle which i could not avoid making in the cover so i followed them just a quiver of leaves here a snarl there and then a rush away until they doubled back towards the rocky place where parting the underbrush cautiously i saw a dark hole among the rocks of a little opening the roots of an upturned tree arched over the hole making a broad doorway in this doorway stood two halfgrown lucivees fuzzy and gray and savagelooking their backs still up their wild eyes turned in my direction apprehensively seeing me they drew farther back into the den and i saw nothing more of them save now and then their round heads or the fire in their yellow eyes  it was too late for further observation that day the fierce old mother lynx would presently be back they would let her know of the intruder in some way and they would all keep close in the den i found a place some dozen yards above where it would be possible to watch them marked the spot by a blasted stub to which i made a compass of broken twigs and then went back to camp  next morning i omitted the early fishing and was back at the place before the sun looked over the ridge their den was all quiet in deep shadow mother lynx was still away on the early hunting i intended to kill her when she came back my rifle lay ready across my knees then i would watch the kittens a little while and kill them also i wanted their skins all soft and fine with their first fur and they were too big and fierce to think of taking them alive my vacation was over simmo was already packing up to break camp that morning so there would be no time to carry out my longcherished plan of watching young lynxes at play as i had before watched young foxes and bears and owls and fishhawks and indeed almost everything except upweekis in the wilderness  presently one of the lucivees came out yawned stretched raised himself against a root in the morning stillness i could hear the cut and rip of his claws on the wood we call the action sharpening the claws but it is only the occasional exercise of the fine flexor muscles that a cat uses so seldom yet must use powerfully when the time comes the second lucivee came out of the shadow a moment later and leaped upon the fallen tree where he could better watch the hillside below for half an hour or more while i waited expectantly both animals moved restlessly about the den or climbed over the roots and trunk of the fallen tree they were plainly cross they made no attempt at play but kept well away from each other with a wholesome respect for teeth and claws and temper breakfast hour was long past evidently and they were hungry  suddenly one who was at that moment watching from the tree trunk leaped down the second joined him and both paced back and forth excitedly they had heard the sounds of a coming that were too fine for my ears a stir in the underbrush and mother lynx a great savage creature stalked out proudly she carried a dead hare gripped across the middle of the back the long ears on one side the long legs on the other hung limply showing a fresh kill she walked to the doorway of her den crossed it back and forth two or three times still carrying the hare as if the lust of blood were raging within her and she could not drop her prey even to her own little ones which followed her hungrily one on either side once as she turned toward me one of the kittens seized a leg of the hare and jerked it savagely the mother whirled on him growling deep down in her throat the youngster backed away scared but snarling at last she flung the game down the kittens fell upon it like furies growling at each other as i had seen the stranger lynxes growling once before over the caribou in a moment they had torn the carcass apart and were crouched each one over his piece gnarling like a cat over a rat and stuffing themselves greedily in utter forgetfulness of the mother lynx which lay under a bush some distance away and watched them  in a half hour the savage meal was over the little ones sat up licked their chops and began to tongue their broad paws the mother had been blinking sleepily now she rose and came to her young a change had come over the family the kittens ran to meet the dam as if they had not seen her before rubbing softly against her legs or sitting up to rub their whiskers against hersa tardy thanks for the breakfast she had provided the fierce old mother too seemed altogether different she arched her back against the roots purring loudly while the little ones arched and purred against her sides then she bent her savage head and licked them fondly with her tongue while they rubbed as close to her as they could get passing between her legs as under a bridge and trying to lick her face in return till all their tongues were going at once and the family lay down together  it was time to kill them now the rifle lay ready but a change had come over the watcher too hitherto he had seen upweekis as a ferocious brute whom it was good to kill this was altogether different upweekis could be gentle also it seemed and give herself for her little ones and a bit of tenderness like that which lay so unconscious under my eyes gets hold of a man and spikes his guns better than moralizing so the watcher stole away making as little noise as he could following his compass of twigs to where the canoes lay ready and simmo was waiting  sometime i hope simmo and i will camp there again in winter and then i shall listen with a new interest for a cry in the night which tells me that moktaques the rabbit is hiding close at hand in the snow where a young lynx of my acquaintance cannot find him     viii hukweem the night voice  illustration hukweem   hukweem the loon must go through the world crying for what he never gets and searching for one whom he never finds for he is the huntingdog of clote scarpe so said simmo to me one night in explaining why the loons cry is so wild and sad  clote scarpe by the way is the legendary hero the hiawatha of the northern indians long ago he lived on the wollastook and ruled the animals which all lived peaceably together understanding each others language and nobody ever ate anybody as simmo says but when clote scarpe went away they quarreled and lhoks the panther and nemox the fisher took to killing the other animals malsun the wolf soon followed and ate all he killed and meeko the squirrel who always makes all the mischief he can set even the peaceable animals by the ears so that they feared and distrusted each other then they scattered through the big woods living each one for himself and now the strong ones kill the weak and nobody understands anybody any more  there were no dogs in those days hukweem was clote scarpes hunting companion when he hunted the great evil beasts that disturbed the wilderness and hukweem alone of all the birds and animals remained true to his master for hunting makes strong friendship says simmo and that is true therefore does hukweem go through the world looking for his master and calling him to come back over the treetops when he flies low looking for new waters high in air out of sight on his southern migrations and on every lake where he is only a voice the sad night voice of the vast solitary unknown wildernesseverywhere you hear him seeking even on the seacoast in winter where he knows clote scarpe cannot befor clote scarpe hates the seahukweem forgets himself and cries occasionally out of pure loneliness  when i asked what hukweem says when he criesfor all cries of the wilderness have their interpretationsimmo answered wy he say two ting first he say where are you o where are you dass what you callum his laugh like he crazy denn wen nobody answer he say o i so sorry so sorry oooooeee like woman lost in woods an dass his tother cry  illustration hukweem  this comes nearer to explaining the wild unearthliness of hukweems call than anything else i know it makes things much simpler to understand when you are camped deep in the wilderness and the night falls and out of the misty darkness under the farther shore comes a wild shivering call that makes ones nerves tingle till he finds out about itwhere are you o where are you that is just like hukweem  sometimes however he varies the cry and asks very plainly who are you o who are you there was a loon on the big squattuk lake where i camped one summer which was full of inquisitiveness as a blue jay he lived alone at one end of the lake while his mate with her brood of two lived at the other end nine miles away every morning and evening he came close to my campvery much nearer than is usual for loons are wild and shy in the wildernessto cry out his challenge once late at night i flashed a lantern at the end of the old log that served as a landing for the canoes where i had heard strange ripples and there was hukweem examining everything with the greatest curiosity  every unusual thing in our doings made him inquisitive to know all about it once when i started down the lake with a fair wind and a small spruce set up in the bow of my canoe for a sail he followed me four or five miles calling all the way and when i came back to camp at twilight with a big bear in the canoe his shaggy head showing over the bow and his legs up over the middle thwart like a little old black man with his wrinkled feet on the table hukweems curiosity could stand it no longer he swam up within twenty yards and circled the canoe half a dozen times sitting up straight on his tail by a vigorous use of his wings stretching his neck like an inquisitive duck so as to look into the canoe and see what queer thing i had brought with me  he had another curious habit which afforded him unending amusement there was a deep bay on the west shore of the lake with hills rising abruptly on three sides the echo here was remarkable a single shout brought a dozen distinct answers and then a confusion of tongues as the echoes and reechoes from many hills met and mingled i discovered the place in an interesting way  one evening at twilight as i was returning to camp from exploring the upper lake i heard a wild crying of loons on the west side there seemed to be five or six of the great divers all laughing and shrieking like so many lunatics pushing over to investigate i noticed for the first time the entrance to a great bay and paddled up cautiously behind a point so as to surprise the loons at their game for they play games just as crows do but when i looked in there was only one bird hukweem the inquisitive i knew him instantly by his great size and beautiful markings he would give a single sharp call and listen intently with head up swinging from side to side as the separate echoes came ringing back from the hills then he would try his cackling laugh ooo√°hhahahahoo ooo√°hhahahahoo and as the echoes began to ring about his head he would get excited sitting up on his tail flapping his wings cackling and shrieking with glee at his own performance every wild syllable was flung back like a shot from the surrounding hills till the air seemed full of loons all mingling their crazy cachinnations with the din of the chief performer the uproar made one shiver then hukweem would cease suddenly listening intently to the warring echoes before the confusion was half ended he would get excited again and swim about in small circles spreading wings and tail showing his fine feathers as if every echo were an admiring loon pleased as a peacock with himself at having made such a noise in a quiet world  there was another loon a mother bird on a different lake whose two eggs had been carried off by a thieving muskrat but she did not know who did it for musquash knows how to roll the eggs into water and carry them off before eating where the mother bird will not find the shells she came swimming down to meet us the moment our canoe entered the lake and what she seemed to cry was where are they o where are they she followed us across the lake accusing us of robbery and asking the same question over and over  but whatever the meaning of hukweems crying it seems to constitute a large part of his existence indeed it is as a cry that he is chiefly knownthe wild unearthly cry of the wilderness night his education for this begins very early once i was exploring the grassy shores of a wild lake when a mother loon appeared suddenly out in the middle with a great splashing and crying i paddled out to see what was the matter she withdrew with a great effort apparently as i approached still crying loudly and beating the water with her wings oho i said you have a nest in there somewhere and now you are trying to get me away from it this was the only time i have ever known a loon to try that old mother birds trick generally they slip off the nest while the canoe is yet half a mile away and swim under water a long distance and watch you silently from the other side of the lake  i went back and hunted awhile for the nest among the bogs of a little bay then left the search to investigate a strange call that sounded continuously farther up the shore it came from some hidden spot in the tall grass an eager little whistling cry reminding me somehow of a nest of young fishhawks  as i waded cautiously among the bogs trying to locate the sound i came suddenly upon the loons nestjust the bare top of a bog where the mother bird had pulled up the grass and hollowed the earth enough to keep the eggs from rolling out they were there on the bare ground two very large olive eggs with dark blotches i left them undisturbed and went on to investigate the crying which had stopped a moment as i approached the nest  presently it began again behind me faint at first then louder and more eager till i traced it back to hukweems household but there was nothing here to account for it only two innocentlooking eggs on top of a bog i bent over to examine them more closely there on the sides were two holes and out of the holes projected the points of two tiny bills inside were two little loons crying at the top of their lungs let me out o let me out its hot in here let me outooooeee pippippip  but i left the work of release to the mother bird thinking she knew more about it next day i went back to the place and after much watching saw two little loons stealing in and out among the bogs exulting in their freedom but silent as two shadows the mother bird was off on the lake fishing for their dinner  hukweems fishing is always an interesting thing to watch unfortunately he is so shy that one seldom gets a good opportunity once i found his favorite fishing ground and came every day to watch him from a thicket on the shore it was of little use to go in a canoe at my approach he would sink deeper and deeper in the water as if taking in ballast how he does this is a mystery for his body is much lighter than its bulk of water dead or alive it floats like a cork yet without any perceptible motion by an effort of will apparently he sinks it out of sight you are approaching in your canoe and he moves off slowly swinging his head from side to side so as to look at you first with one eye then with the other your canoe is swift he sees that you are gaining that you are already too near he swings on the water and sits watching you steadily suddenly he begins to sink deeper and deeper till his back is just awash go a little nearer and now his body disappears only his neck and head remain above water raise your hand or make any quick motion and he is gone altogether he dives like a flash swims deep and far and when he comes to the surface will be well out of danger  if you notice the direction of his bill as it enters the water you can tell fairly well about where he will come up again it was confusing at first in chasing him to find that he rarely came up where he was expected i would paddle hard in the direction he was going only to find him far to the right or left or behind me when at last he showed himself that was because i followed his body not his bill moving in one direction he will turn his head and dive that is to mislead you if you are following him follow his bill as he does himself and you will be near him when he rises for he rarely turns under water  with two good men to paddle it is not difficult to tire him out though he swims with extraordinary rapidity under waterfast enough to follow and catch a trouta long deep dive tires him and he must rest before another if you are chasing him shout and wave your hat the moment he appears and paddle hard the way his bill points as he dives again the next time he comes up you are nearer to him send him down again quick and after him the next time he is frightened to see the canoe so close and dives deep which tires him the more so his disappearances become shorter and more confused you follow him more surely because you can see him plainly now as he goes down suddenly he bursts out of water beside you scattering the spray into your canoe once he came up under my paddle and i plucked a feather from his back before he got away  this last appearance always scares him out of his wits and you get what you have been working hard fora sight of hukweem getting under way away he goes in a smother of spray beating the water with his wings kicking hard to lift himself up and so for a hundred yards leaving a wake like a sternwheel steamer till he gathers headway enough to rise from the water  after that first start there is no sign of awkwardness his short wings rise and fall with a rapidity that tries the eye to follow like the rush of a coot down wind to decoys you can hear the swift strong beat of them far over your head when he is not calling his flight is very rapid very even and often at enormous altitudes but when he wants to come down he always gets frightened thinking of his short wings and how high he is and how fast he is going on the ocean in winter where he has all the room he wants he sometimes comes down in a great incline miles long and plunges through and over a dozen waves like a dolphin before he can stop but where the lake is small and he cannot come down that way he has a dizzy time of it  once on a little lake in september i used to watch for hours to get a sight of the process twelve or fifteen loons were gathered there holding high carnival they called down every migrating loon that passed that way their numbers increased daily twilight was the favorite time for arriving in the stillness i would hear hukweem far away so high that he was only a voice presently i would see him whirling over the lake in a great circlecome down o come down cry all the loons im afraid ooohohohohohooooeee im afraid says hukweem who is perhaps a little loon all the way from labrador on his first migration and has never come down from a height before come on o come ohhohohohohon it wont hurt you we did it come on cry all the loons  then hukweem would slide lower with each circle whirling round and round the lake in a great spiral yelling all the time and all the loons answering when low enough he would set his wings and plunge like a catapult at the very midst of the assembly which scattered wildly yelling like schoolboyslook out hell break his neck hell hit you hell break your back if he hits youso they splashed away in a desperate fright each one looking back over his shoulder to see hukweem come down which he would do at a terrific pace striking the water with a mighty splash and shooting half across the lake in a smother of white before he could get his legs under him and turn around then all the loons would gather round him cackling shrieking laughing with such a din as the little loon never heard in his life before and he would go off in the midst of them telling them no doubt what a mighty thing it was to come down from so high and not break his neck  a little later in the fall i saw those same loons do an astonishing thing for several evenings they had been keeping up an unusual racket in a quiet bay out of sight of my camp i asked simmo what he thought they were doingo i don know playin game i guess jus like one boy hukweem do dat sometime wen he not hungry said simmo going on with his beancooking that excited my curiosity but when i reached the bay it was too dark to see what they were playing  one evening when i was fishing at the inlet the racket was different from any i had heard before there would be an interval of perfect silence broken suddenly by wild yelling then the ordinary loon talk for a few minutes and another silence broken by a shriller outcry that meant that something unusual was going on so i left the trout to find out about it  when i pushed my canoe through the fringe of watergrass on the point nearest the loons they were scattered in a long line twelve or fifteen of them extending from the head of the bay to a point nearly opposite me at the other end of the line two loons were swimming about doing something which i could not make out suddenly the loon talk ceased there may have been a signal given which i did not hear anyway the two loons faced about at the same moment and came tearing down the line using wings and feet to help in the race the upper loons swung in behind them as they passed so as to watch the finish better but not a sound was heard till they passed my end of the line in a close hard race one scarcely a yard ahead of the other when such a yelling began as i never heard before all the loons gathered about the two swimmers there was much cackling and crying which grew gradually quieter then they began to string out in another long line and two more racers took their places at one end of it by that time it was almost dark and i broke up the race trying to get nearer in my canoe so as to watch things better twice since then i have heard from summer campers of their having seen loons racing across a lake i have no doubt it is a frequent pastime with the birds when the summer cares for the young are ended and autumn days are mellow and fish are plenty and there are long hours just for fun together before hukweem moves southward for the hard solitary winter life on the seacoast  of all the loons that cried out to me in the night or shared the summer lakes with me only one ever gave me the opportunity of watching at close quarters it was on a very wild lake so wild that no one had ever visited it before in summer and a mother loon felt safe in leaving the open shore where she generally nests and placing her eggs on a bog at the head of a narrow bay i found them there a day or two after my arrival  i used to go at all hours of the day hoping the mother would get used to me and my canoe so that i could watch her later teaching her little ones but her wildness was unconquerable whenever i came in sight of the nestbog with only the loons neck and head visible standing up very straight and still in the grass i would see her slip from the nest steal away through the green cover to a deep place and glide under water without leaving a ripple then looking sharp over the side into the clear water i would get a glimpse of her just a gray streak with a string of silver bubbles passing deep and swift under my canoe so she went through the opening and appeared far out in the lake where she would swim back and forth as if fishing until i went away as i never disturbed her nest and always paddled away soon she thought undoubtedly that she had fooled me and that i knew nothing about her or her nest  then i tried another plan i lay down in my canoe and had simmo paddle me up to the nest while the loon was out on the lake hidden by the grassy shore i went and sat on a bog with a friendly alder bending over me within twenty feet of the nest which was in plain sight then simmo paddled away and hukweem came back without the slightest suspicion as i had supposed from the shape of the nest she did not sit on her two eggs she sat on the bog instead and gathered them close to her side with her wing that was all the brooding they had or needed for within a week there were two bright little loons to watch instead of the eggs  after the first success i used to go alone and while the mother bird was out on the lake would pull my canoe up in the grass a hundred yards or so below the nest from here i entered the alders and made my way to the bog where i could watch hukweem at my leisure after a long wait she would steal into the bay very shyly and after much fear and circumspection glide up to the canoe it took a great deal of looking and listening to convince her that it was harmless and that i was not hiding near in the grass once convinced however she would come direct to the nest and i had the satisfaction at last of watching a loon at close quarters  she would sit there for hoursnever sleeping apparently for her eye was always brightpreening herself turning her head slowly so as to watch on all sides snapping now and then at an obtrusive fly all in utter unconsciousness that i was just behind her watching every movement then when i had enough i would steal away along a caribou path and push off quietly in my canoe without looking back she saw me of course when i entered the canoe but not once did she leave the nest when i reached the open lake a little searching with my glass always showed me her head there in the grass still turned in my direction apprehensively  i had hoped to see her let the little ones out of their hard shell and see them first take the water but that was too much to expect one day i heard them whistling in the eggs the next day when i came there was nothing to be seen on the nestbog i feared that something had heard their whistling and put an untimely end to the young hukweems while mother bird was away but when she came back after a more fearful survey than usual of the old bark canoe two downy little fellows came bobbing to meet her out of the grass where she had hidden them and told them to stay till she came back  it was a rare treat to watch them at their first feeding the little ones all eagerness bobbing about in the delight of eating and the wonder of the new great world the mother all tenderness and watchfulness hukweem had never looked to me so noble before this great wild mother bird moving ceaselessly with marvelous grace about her little ones watching their play with exquisite fondness and watching the great dangerous world for their sakes now chiding them gently now drawing near to touch them with her strong bill or to rub their little cheeks with hers or just to croon over them in an ecstasy of that wonderful mother love which makes the summer wilderness beautifulin ten minutes she upset all my theories and won me altogether spite of what i had heard and seen of her destructiveness on the fishing grounds after all why should she not fish as well as i and then began the first lessons in swimming and hiding and diving which i had waited so long to see  later i saw her bring little fish which she had slightly wounded turn them loose in shallow water and with a sharp cluck bring the young loons out of their hiding to set them chasing and diving wildly for their own dinners but before that happened there was almost a tragedy  one day while the mother was gone fishing the little ones came out of their hiding among the grasses and ventured out some distance into the bay it was their first journey alone into the world they were full of the wonder and importance of it suddenly as i watched they began to dart about wildly moving with astonishing rapidity for such little fellows and whistling loudly from the bank above a swift ripple had cut out into the water between them and the only bit of bog with which they were familiar just behind the ripple were the sharp nose and the beady eyes of musquash who is always in some mischief of this kind in one of his prowlings he had discovered the little brood now he was man≈ìuvering craftily to keep the frightened youngsters moving till they should be tired out while he himself crept carefully between them and the shore  musquash knows well that when a young loon or a shelldrake or a black duck is caught in the open like that he always tries to get back where his mother hid him when she went away that is what the poor little fellows were trying to do now only to be driven back and kept moving wildly by the muskrat who lifted himself now and then from the water and wiggled his ugly jaws in anticipation of the feast he had missed the eggs in his search but young loon would be better and more of itthere you are he snapped viciously lunging at the nearest loon which flashed under water and barely escaped  i had started up to interfere for i had grown fond of the little wild things whose growth i had watched from the beginning when a great splashing began on my left and i saw the old mother bird coming like a fury she was half swimming half flying tearing over the water at a great pace a foamy white wake behind hernow you little villain take your medicine its coming its coming i cried excitedly and dodged back to watch but musquash intent on his evil doing he has no need whatever to turn flesheater kept on viciously after the exhausted little ones paying no heed to his rear  twenty yards away the mother bird to my great astonishment flashed out of sight under water what could it mean but there was little time to wonder suddenly a catapult seemed to strike the muskrat from beneath and lift him clear from the water with a tremendous rush and sputter hukweem came out beneath him her great pointed bill driven through to his spine little need of my help now with another straight hard drive this time at eye and brain she flung him aside disdainfully and rushed to her shivering little ones questioning chiding praising them all in the same breath fluttering and cackling low in an hysteric wave of tenderness then she swam twice around the dead muskrat and led her brood away from the place  perhaps it was to one of those same little ones that i owe a service for which i am more than grateful it was in september when i was at a lake ten miles awaythe same lake into which a score of frolicking young loons gathered before moving south and swam a race or two for my benefit i was lost one day hopelessly lost in trying to make my way from a wild little lake where i had been fishing to the large lake where my camp was it was late afternoon to avoid the long hard tramp down a river up which i had come in the early morning i attempted to cut across through unbroken forest without a compass traveling through a northern forest in summer is desperately hard work the moss is ankle deep the underbrush thick fallen logs lie across each other in hopeless confusion through and under and over which one must make his laborious way stung and pestered by hordes of black flies and mosquitoes so that unless you have a strong instinct of direction it is almost impossible to hold your course without a compass or a bright sun to guide you  i had not gone half the distance before i was astray the sun was long obscured and a drizzling rain set in without any direction whatever in it by the time it reached the underbrush where i was i had begun to make a little shelter intending to put in a cheerless night there when i heard a cry and looking up caught a glimpse of hukweem speeding high over the treetops far down on my right came a faint answering cry and i hastened in its direction making an indian compass of broken twigs as i went along hukweem was a young loon and was long in coming down the crying ahead grew louder stirred up from their day rest by his arrival the other loons began their sport earlier than usual the crying soon became almost continuous and i followed it straight to the lake  once there it was a simple matter to find the river and my old canoe waiting patiently under the alders in the gathering twilight soon i was afloat again with a sense of unspeakable relief that only one can appreciate who has been lost and now hears the ripples sing under him knowing that the cheerless woods lie behind and that the campfire beckons beyond yonder point the loons were hallooing far away and i went overthis time in pure gratitudeto see them again but my guide was modest and vanished posthaste into the mist the moment my canoe appeared  since then whenever i hear hukweem in the night or hear others speak of his unearthly laughter i think of that cry over the treetops and the thrilling answer far away and the sound has a ring to it in my ears that it never had before hukweem the night voice found me astray in the woods and brought me safe to a snug campthat is a service which one does not forget in the wilderness                           glossary of indian names    cheplahgan       chepl√¢h¬¥gan the bald eagle  chigwo√≤ltz       chigwooltz¬¥
