and lucy 5  the last conflict      book i  boy and girl     chapter i  outside dorlcote mill   a wide plain where the broadening floss hurries on between its green banks to the sea and the loving tide rushing to meet it checks its passage with an impetuous embrace on this mighty tide the black shipsladen with the freshscented firplanks with rounded sacks of oilbearing seed or with the dark glitter of coalare borne along to the town of st oggs which shows its aged fluted red roofs and the broad gables of its wharves between the low wooded hill and the riverbrink tingeing the water with a soft purple hue under the transient glance of this february sun far away on each hand stretch the rich pastures and the patches of dark earth made ready for the seed of broadleaved green crops or touched already with the tint of the tenderbladed autumnsown corn there is a remnant still of last years golden clusters of beehivericks rising at intervals beyond the hedgerows and everywhere the hedgerows are studded with trees the distant ships seem to be lifting their masts and stretching their redbrown sails close among the branches of the spreading ash just by the redroofed town the tributary ripple flows with a lively current into the floss how lovely the little river is with its dark changing wavelets it seems to me like a living companion while i wander along the bank and listen to its low placid voice as to the voice of one who is deaf and loving i remember those large dipping willows i remember the stone bridge  and this is dorlcote mill i must stand a minute or two here on the bridge and look at it though the clouds are threatening and it is far on in the afternoon even in this leafless time of departing february it is pleasant to look atperhaps the chill damp season adds a charm to the trimly kept comfortable dwellinghouse as old as the elms and chestnuts that shelter it from the northern blast the stream is brimful now and lies high in this little withy plantation and half drowns the grassy fringe of the croft in front of the house as i look at the full stream the vivid grass the delicate brightgreen powder softening the outline of the great trunks and branches that gleam from under the bare purple boughs i am in love with moistness and envy the white ducks that are dipping their heads far into the water here among the withes unmindful of the awkward appearance they make in the drier world above  the rush of the water and the booming of the mill bring a dreamy deafness which seems to heighten the peacefulness of the scene they are like a great curtain of sound shutting one out from the world beyond and now there is the thunder of the huge covered wagon coming home with sacks of grain that honest wagoner is thinking of his dinner getting sadly dry in the oven at this late hour but he will not touch it till he has fed his horsesthe strong submissive meekeyed beasts who i fancy are looking mild reproach at him from between their blinkers that he should crack his whip at them in that awful manner as if they needed that hint see how they stretch their shoulders up the slope toward the bridge with all the more energy because they are so near home look at their grand shaggy feet that seem to grasp the firm earth at the patient strength of their necks bowed under the heavy collar at the mighty muscles of their struggling haunches i should like well to hear them neigh over their hardly earned feed of corn and see them with their moist necks freed from the harness dipping their eager nostrils into the muddy pond now they are on the bridge and down they go again at a swifter pace and the arch of the covered wagon disappears at the turning behind the trees  now i can turn my eyes toward the mill again and watch the unresting wheel sending out its diamond jets of water that little girl is watching it too she has been standing on just the same spot at the edge of the water ever since i paused on the bridge and that queer white cur with the brown ear seems to be leaping and barking in ineffectual remonstrance with the wheel perhaps he is jealous because his playfellow in the beaver bonnet is so rapt in its movement it is time the little playfellow went in i think and there is a very bright fire to tempt her the red light shines out under the deepening gray of the sky it is time too for me to leave off resting my arms on the cold stone of this bridge  ah my arms are really benumbed i have been pressing my elbows on the arms of my chair and dreaming that i was standing on the bridge in front of dorlcote mill as it looked one february afternoon many years ago before i dozed off i was going to tell you what mr and mrs tulliver were talking about as they sat by the bright fire in the lefthand parlor on that very afternoon i have been dreaming of    chapter ii  mr tulliver of dorlcote mill declares his resolution about tom   what i want you know said mr tulliverwhat i want is to give tom a good eddication an eddication asll be a bread to him that was what i was thinking of when i gave notice for him to leave the academy at ladyday i mean to put him to a downright good school at midsummer the two years at th academy ud ha done well enough if id meant to make a miller and farmer of him for hes had a fine sight more schoolin nor i ever got all the learnin my father ever paid for was a bit o birch at one end and the alphabet at th other but i should like tom to be a bit of a scholard so as he might be up to the tricks o these fellows as talk fine and write with a flourish it ud be a help to me wi these lawsuits and arbitrations and things i wouldnt make a downright lawyer o the ladi should be sorry for him to be a raskillbut a sort o engineer or a surveyor or an auctioneer and vallyer like riley or one o them smartish businesses as are all profits and no outlay only for a big watchchain and a high stool theyre pretty nigh all one and theyre not far off being even wi the law i believe for riley looks lawyer wakem i the face as hard as one cat looks another hes none frightened at him  mr tulliver was speaking to his wife a blond comely woman in a fanshaped cap i am afraid to think how long it is since fanshaped caps were worn they must be so near coming in again at that time when mrs tulliver was nearly forty they were new at st oggs and considered sweet things  well mr tulliver you know best ive no objections but hadnt i better kill a couple o fowl and have th aunts and uncles to dinner next week so as you may hear what sister glegg and sister pullet have got to say about it theres a couple o fowl wants killing  you may kill every fowl i the yard if you like bessy but i shall ask neither aunt nor uncle what im to do wi my own lad said mr tulliver defiantly  dear heart said mrs tulliver shocked at this sanguinary rhetoric how can you talk so mr tulliver but its your way to speak disrespectful o my family and sister glegg throws all the blame upo me though im sure im as innocent as the babe unborn for nobodys ever heard me say as it wasnt lucky for my children to have aunts and uncles as can live independent howiver if toms to go to a new school i should like him to go where i can wash him and mend him else he might as well have calico as linen for theyd be one as yallow as th other before theyd been washed halfadozen times and then when the box is goin backard and forrard i could send the lad a cake or a porkpie or an apple for he can do with an extry bit bless him whether they stint him at the meals or no my children can eat as much victuals as most thank god  well well we wont send him out o reach o the carriers cart if other things fit in said mr tulliver but you mustnt put a spoke i the wheel about the washin if we cant get a school near enough thats the fault i have to find wi you bessy if you see a stick i the road youre allays thinkin you cant step over it youd want me not to hire a good wagoner cause hed got a mole on his face  dear heart said mrs tulliver in mild surprise when did i iver make objections to a man because hed got a mole on his face im sure im rether fond o the moles for my brother as is dead an gone had a mole on his brow but i cant remember your iver offering to hire a wagoner with a mole mr tulliver there was john gibbs hadnt a mole on his face no more nor you have an i was all for having you hire him an so you did hire him an if he hadnt died o th inflammation as we paid dr turnbull for attending him hed very like ha been drivin the wagon now he might have a mole somewhere out o sight but how was i to know that mr tulliver  no no bessy i didnt mean justly the mole i meant it to stand for summat else but niver mindits puzzling work talking is what im thinking on is how to find the right sort o school to send tom to for i might be taen in again as ive been wi th academy ill have nothing to do wi a cademy again whativer school i send tom to it shant be a cademy it shall be a place where the lads spend their time i summat else besides blacking the familys shoes and getting up the potatoes its an uncommon puzzling thing to know what school to pick  mr tulliver paused a minute or two and dived with both hands into his breeches pockets as if he hoped to find some suggestion there apparently he was not disappointed for he presently said i know what ill do ill talk it over wi riley hes coming tomorrow t arbitrate about the dam  well mr tulliver ive put the sheets out for the best bed and kezias got em hanging at the fire they arent the best sheets but theyre good enough for anybody to sleep in be he who he will for as for them best holland sheets i should repent buying em only theyll do to lay us out in an if you was to die tomorrow mr tulliver theyre mangled beautiful an all ready an smell o lavender as it ud be a pleasure to lay em out an they lie at the lefthand corner o the big oak linenchest at the back not as i should trust anybody to look em out but myself  as mrs tulliver uttered the last sentence she drew a bright bunch of keys from her pocket and singled out one rubbing her thumb and finger up and down it with a placid smile while she looked at the clear fire if mr tulliver had been a susceptible man in his conjugal relation he might have supposed that she drew out the key to aid her imagination in anticipating the moment when he would be in a state to justify the production of the best holland sheets happily he was not so he was only susceptible in respect of his right to waterpower moreover he had the marital habit of not listening very closely and since his mention of mr riley had been apparently occupied in a tactile examination of his woollen stockings  i think ive hit it bessy was his first remark after a short silence rileys as likely a man as any to know o some school hes had schooling himself an goes about to all sorts o places arbitratin and vallyin and that and we shall have time to talk it over tomorrow night when the business is done i want tom to be such a sort o man as riley you knowas can talk pretty nigh as well as if it was all wrote out for him and knows a good lot o words as dont mean much so as you cant lay hold of em i law and a good solid knowledge o business too  well said mrs tulliver so far as talking proper and knowing everything and walking with a bend in his back and setting his hair up i shouldnt mind the lad being brought up to that but them finetalking men from the big towns mostly wear the false shirtfronts they wear a frill till its all a mess and then hide it with a bib i know riley does and then if toms to go and live at mudport like riley hell have a house with a kitchen hardly big enough to turn in an niver get a fresh egg for his breakfast an sleep up three pair o stairsor four for what i knowand be burnt to death before he can get down  no no said mr tulliver ive no thoughts of his going to mudport i mean him to set up his office at st oggs close by us an live at home but continued mr tulliver after a pause what im a bit afraid on is as tom hasnt got the right sort o brains for a smart fellow i doubt hes a bit slowish he takes after your family bessy  yes that he does said mrs tulliver accepting the last proposition entirely on its own merits hes wonderful for liking a deal o salt in his broth that was my brothers way and my fathers before him  it seems a bit a pity though said mr tulliver as the lad should take after the mothers side instead o the little wench thats the worst ont wi crossing o breeds you can never justly calkilate whatll come ont the little un takes after my side now shes twice as cute as tom too cute for a woman im afraid continued mr tulliver turning his head dubiously first on one side and then on the other its no mischief much while shes a little un but an overcute womans no better nor a longtailed sheepshell fetch none the bigger price for that  yes it is a mischief while shes a little un mr tulliver for it runs to naughtiness how to keep her in a clean pinafore two hours together passes my cunning an now you put me i mind continued mrs tulliver rising and going to the window i dont know where she is now an its pretty nigh teatime ah i thought sowanderin up an down by the water like a wild thing shell tumble in some day  mrs tulliver rapped the window sharply beckoned and shook her heada process which she repeated more than once before she returned to her chair  you talk o cuteness mr tulliver she observed as she sat down but im sure the childs half an idiot i some things for if i send her upstairs to fetch anything she forgets what shes gone for an perhaps ull sit down on the floor i the sunshine an plait her hair an sing to herself like a bedlam creatur all the while im waiting for her downstairs that niver run i my family thank god no more nor a brown skin as makes her look like a mulatter i dont like to fly i the face o providence but it seems hard as i should have but one gell an her so comical  pooh nonsense said mr tulliver shes a straight blackeyed wench as anybody need wish to see i dont know i what shes behind other folkss children and she can read almost as well as the parson  but her hair wont curl all i can do with it and shes so franzy about having it put i paper and ive such work as never was to make her stand and have it pinched with th irons  cut it offcut it off short said the father rashly  how can you talk so mr tulliver shes too big a gellgone nine and tall of her ageto have her hair cut short an theres her cousin lucys got a row o curls round her head an not a hair out o place it seems hard as my sister deane should have that pretty child im sure lucy takes more after me nor my own child does maggie maggie continued the mother in a tone of halfcoaxing fretfulness as this small mistake of nature entered the room wheres the use o my telling you to keep away from the water youll tumble in and be drownded some day an then youll be sorry you didnt do as mother told you  maggies hair as she threw off her bonnet painfully confirmed her mothers accusation mrs tulliver desiring her daughter to have a curled crop like other folkss children had had it cut too short in front to be pushed behind the ears and as it was usually straight an hour after it had been taken out of paper maggie was incessantly tossing her head to keep the dark heavy locks out of her gleaming black eyesan action which gave her very much the air of a small shetland pony  oh dear oh dear maggie what are you thinkin of to throw your bonnet down there take it upstairs theres a good gell an let your hair be brushed an put your other pinafore on an change your shoes do for shame an come an go on with your patchwork like a little lady  oh mother said maggie in a vehemently cross tone i dont want to do my patchwork  what not your pretty patchwork to make a counterpane for your aunt glegg  its foolish work said maggie with a toss of her manetearing things to pieces to sew em together again and i dont want to do anything for my aunt glegg i dont like her  exit maggie dragging her bonnet by the string while mr tulliver laughs audibly  i wonder at you as youll laugh at her mr tulliver said the mother with feeble fretfulness in her tone you encourage her i naughtiness an her aunts will have it as its me spoils her  mrs tulliver was what is called a goodtempered personnever cried when she was a baby on any slighter ground than hunger and pins and from the cradle upward had been healthy fair plump and dullwitted in short the flower of her family for beauty and amiability but milk and mildness are not the best things for keeping and when they turn only a little sour they may disagree with young stomachs seriously i have often wondered whether those early madonnas of raphael with the blond faces and somewhat stupid expression kept their placidity undisturbed when their stronglimbed strongwilled boys got a little too old to do without clothing i think they must have been given to feeble remonstrance getting more and more peevish as it became more and more ineffectual    chapter iii  mr riley gives his advice concerning a school for tom   the gentleman in the ample white cravat and shirtfrill taking his brandyandwater so pleasantly with his good friend tulliver is mr riley a gentleman with a waxen complexion and fat hands rather highly educated for an auctioneer and appraiser but largehearted enough to show a great deal of bonhomie toward simple country acquaintances of hospitable habits mr riley spoke of such acquaintances kindly as people of the old school  the conversation had come to a pause mr tulliver not without a particular reason had abstained from a seventh recital of the cool retort by which riley had shown himself too many for dix and how wakem had had his comb cut for once in his life now the business of the dam had been settled by arbitration and how there never would have been any dispute at all about the height of water if everybody was what they should be and old harry hadnt made the lawyers  mr tulliver was on the whole a man of safe traditional opinions but on one or two points he had trusted to his unassisted intellect and had arrived at several questionable conclusions amongst the rest that rats weevils and lawyers were created by old harry unhappily he had no one to tell him that this was rampant manichæism else he might have seen his error but today it was clear that the good principle was triumphant this affair of the waterpower had been a tangled business somehow for all it seemedlook at it one wayas plain as waters water but big a puzzle as it was it hadnt got the better of riley mr tulliver took his brandyandwater a little stronger than usual and for a man who might be supposed to have a few hundreds lying idle at his bankers was rather incautiously open in expressing his high estimate of his friends business talents  but the dam was a subject of conversation that would keep it could always be taken up again at the same point and exactly in the same condition and there was another subject as you know on which mr tulliver was in pressing want of mr rileys advice this was his particular reason for remaining silent for a short space after his last draught and rubbing his knees in a meditative manner he was not a man to make an abrupt transition this was a puzzling world as he often said and if you drive your wagon in a hurry you may light on an awkward corner mr riley meanwhile was not impatient why should he be even hotspur one would think must have been patient in his slippers on a warm hearth taking copious snuff and sipping gratuitous brandyandwater  theres a thing ive got i my head said mr tulliver at last in rather a lower tone than usual as he turned his head and looked steadfastly at his companion  ah said mr riley in a tone of mild interest he was a man with heavy waxen eyelids and higharched eyebrows looking exactly the same under all circumstances this immovability of face and the habit of taking a pinch of snuff before he gave an answer made him trebly oracular to mr tulliver  its a very particular thing he went on its about my boy tom  at the sound of this name maggie who was seated on a low stool close by the fire with a large book open on her lap shook her heavy hair back and looked up eagerly there were few sounds that roused maggie when she was dreaming over her book but toms name served as well as the shrillest whistle in an instant she was on the watch with gleaming eyes like a skye terrier suspecting mischief or at all events determined to fly at any one who threatened it toward tom  you see i want to put him to a new school at midsummer said mr tulliver hes comin away from the cademy at ladyday an i shall let him run loose for a quarter but after that i want to send him to a downright good school where theyll make a scholard of him  well said mr riley theres no greater advantage you can give him than a good education not he added with polite significancenot that a man cant be an excellent miller and farmer and a shrewd sensible fellow into the bargain without much help from the schoolmaster  i believe you said mr tulliver winking and turning his head on one side but thats where it is i dont mean tom to be a miller and farmer i see no fun i that why if i made him a miller an farmer hed be expectin to take to the mill an the land an ahinting at me as it was time for me to lay by an think o my latter end nay nay ive seen enough o that wi sons ill never pull my coat off before i go to bed i shall give tom an eddication an put him to a business as he may make a nest for himself an not want to push me out o mine pretty well if he gets it when im dead an gone i shant be put off wi spoonmeat afore ive lost my teeth  this was evidently a point on which mr tulliver felt strongly and the impetus which had given unusual rapidity and emphasis to his speech showed itself still unexhausted for some minutes afterward in a defiant motion of the head from side to side and an occasional nay nay like a subsiding growl  these angry symptoms were keenly observed by maggie and cut her to the quick tom it appeared was supposed capable of turning his father out of doors and of making the future in some way tragic by his wickedness this was not to be borne and maggie jumped up from her stool forgetting all about her heavy book which fell with a bang within the fender and going up between her fathers knees said in a halfcrying halfindignant voice  father tom wouldnt be naughty to you ever i know he wouldnt  mrs tulliver was out of the room superintending a choice supperdish and mr tullivers heart was touched so maggie was not scolded about the book mr riley quietly picked it up and looked at it while the father laughed with a certain tenderness in his hardlined face and patted his little girl on the back and then held her hands and kept her between his knees  what they mustnt say any harm o tom eh said mr tulliver looking at maggie with a twinkling eye then in a lower voice turning to mr riley as though maggie couldnt hear she understands what ones talking about so as never was and you should hear her readstraight off as if she knowed it all beforehand and allays at her book but its badits bad mr tulliver added sadly checking this blamable exultation a womans no business wi being so clever itll turn to trouble i doubt but bless youhere the exultation was clearly recovering the masteryshell read the books and understand em better nor half the folks as are growed up  maggies cheeks began to flush with triumphant excitement she thought mr riley would have a respect for her now it had been evident that he thought nothing of her before  mr riley was turning over the leaves of the book and she could make nothing of his face with its higharched eyebrows but he presently looked at her and said  come come and tell me something about this book here are some picturesi want to know what they mean  maggie with deepening color went without hesitation to mr rileys elbow and looked over the book eagerly seizing one corner and tossing back her mane while she said  oh ill tell you what that means its a dreadful picture isnt it but i cant help looking at it that old woman in the waters a witchtheyve put her in to find out whether shes a witch or no and if she swims shes a witch and if shes drownedand killed you knowshes innocent and not a witch but only a poor silly old woman but what good would it do her then you know when she was drowned only i suppose shed go to heaven and god would make it up to her and this dreadful blacksmith with his arms akimbo laughingoh isnt he uglyill tell you what he is hes the devil really here maggies voice became louder and more emphatic and not a right blacksmith for the devil takes the shape of wicked men and walks about and sets people doing wicked things and hes oftener in the shape of a bad man than any other because you know if people saw he was the devil and he roared at em theyd run away and he couldnt make em do what he pleased  mr tulliver had listened to this exposition of maggies with petrifying wonder  why what book is it the wench has got hold on he burst out at last  the history of the devil by daniel defoenot quite the right book for a little girl said mr riley how came it among your books mr tulliver  maggie looked hurt and discouraged while her father said  why its one o the books i bought at partridges sale they was all bound alikeits a good binding you seeand i thought theyd be all good books theres jeremy taylors holy living and dying among em i read in it often of a sunday mr tulliver felt somehow a familiarity with that great writer because his name was jeremy and theres a lot more of emsermons mostly i thinkbut theyve all got the same covers and i thought they were all o one sample as you may say but it seems one mustnt judge by th outside this is a puzzlin world  well said mr riley in an admonitory patronizing tone as he patted maggie on the head i advise you to put by the history of the devil and read some prettier book have you no prettier books  oh yes said maggie reviving a little in the desire to vindicate the variety of her reading i know the reading in this book isnt pretty but i like the pictures and i make stories to the pictures out of my own head you know but ive got Æsops fables and a book about kangaroos and things and the pilgrims progress  ah a beautiful book said mr riley you cant read a better  well but theres a great deal about the devil in that said maggie triumphantly and ill show you the picture of him in his true shape as he fought with christian  maggie ran in an instant to the corner of the room jumped on a chair and reached down from the small bookcase a shabby old copy of bunyan which opened at once without the least trouble of search at the picture she wanted  here he is she said running back to mr riley and tom colored him for me with his paints when he was at home last holidaysthe body all black you know and the eyes red like fire because hes all fire inside and it shines out at his eyes  go go said mr tulliver peremptorily beginning to feel rather uncomfortable at these free remarks on the personal appearance of a being powerful enough to create lawyers shut up the book and lets hear no more o such talk it is as i thoughtthe child ull learn more mischief nor good wi the books go go and see after your mother  maggie shut up the book at once with a sense of disgrace but not being inclined to see after her mother she compromised the matter by going into a dark corner behind her fathers chair and nursing her doll toward which she had an occasional fit of fondness in toms absence neglecting its toilet but lavishing so many warm kisses on it that the waxen cheeks had a wasted unhealthy appearance  did you ever hear the like ont said mr tulliver as maggie retired its a pity but what shed been the ladshed ha been a match for the lawyers she would its the wonderfulst thinghere he lowered his voiceas i picked the mother because she wasnt oer cutebein a goodlooking woman too an come of a rare family for managing but i picked her from her sisters o purpose cause she was a bit weak like for i wasnt agoin to be told the rights o things by my own fireside but you see when a mans got brains himself theres no knowing where theyll run to an a pleasant sort o soft woman may go on breeding you stupid lads and cute wenches till its like as if the world was turned topsyturvy its an uncommon puzzlin thing  mr rileys gravity gave way and he shook a little under the application of his pinch of snuff before he said  but your lads not stupid is he i saw him when i was here last busy making fishingtackle he seemed quite up to it  well he isnt not to say stupidhes got a notion o things out o door an a sort o common sense as hed lay hold o things by the right handle but hes slow with his tongue you see and he reads but poorly and cant abide the books and spells all wrong they tell me an as shy as can be wi strangers an you never hear him say cute things like the little wench now what i want is to send him to a school where theyll make him a bit nimble with his tongue and his pen and make a smart chap of him i want my son to be even wi these fellows as have got the start o me with having better schooling not but what if the world had been left as god made it i could ha seen my way and held my own wi the best of em but things have got so twisted round and wrapped up i unreasonable words as arent a bit like em as im clean at fault often an often everything winds about sothe more straightforrad you are the more youre puzzled  mr tulliver took a draught swallowed it slowly and shook his head in a melancholy manner conscious of exemplifying the truth that a perfectly sane intellect is hardly at home in this insane world  youre quite in the right of it tulliver observed mr riley better spend an extra hundred or two on your sons education than leave it him in your will i know i should have tried to do so by a son of mine if id had one though god knows i havent your ready money to play with tulliver and i have a houseful of daughters into the bargain  i dare say now you know of a school as ud be just the thing for tom said mr tulliver not diverted from his purpose by any sympathy with mr rileys deficiency of ready cash  mr riley took a pinch of snuff and kept mr tulliver in suspense by a silence that seemed deliberative before he said  i know of a very fine chance for any one thats got the necessary money and thats what you have tulliver the fact is i wouldnt recommend any friend of mine to send a boy to a regular school if he could afford to do better but if any one wanted his boy to get superior instruction and training where he would be the companion of his master and that master a first rate fellow i know his man i wouldnt mention the chance to everybody because i dont think everybody would succeed in getting it if he were to try but i mention it to you tulliver between ourselves  the fixed inquiring glance with which mr tulliver had been watching his friends oracular face became quite eager  ay now lets hear he said adjusting himself in his chair with the complacency of a person who is thought worthy of important communications  hes an oxford man said mr riley sententiously shutting his mouth close and looking at mr tulliver to observe the effect of this stimulating information  what a parson said mr tulliver rather doubtfully  yes and an ma the bishop i understand thinks very highly of him why it was the bishop who got him his present curacy  ah said mr tulliver to whom one thing was as wonderful as another concerning these unfamiliar phenomena but what can he want wi tom then  why the fact is hes fond of teaching and wishes to keep up his studies and a clergyman has but little opportunity for that in his parochial duties hes willing to take one or two boys as pupils to fill up his time profitably the boys would be quite of the familythe finest thing in the world for them under stellings eye continually  but do you think theyd give the poor lad twice o pudding said mrs tulliver who was now in her place again hes such a boy for pudding as never was an a growing boy like thatits dreadful to think o their stintin him  and what money ud he want said mr tulliver whose instinct told him that the services of this admirable ma would bear a high price  why i know of a clergyman who asks a hundred and fifty with his youngest pupils and hes not to be mentioned with stelling the man i speak of i know on good authority that one of the chief people at oxford said stelling might get the highest honors if he chose but he didnt care about university honors hes a quiet mannot noisy  ah a deal bettera deal better said mr tulliver but a hundred and fiftys an uncommon price i never thought o paying so much as that  a good education let me tell you tullivera good education is cheap at the money but stelling is moderate in his terms hes not a grasping man ive no doubt hed take your boy at a hundred and thats what you wouldnt get many other clergymen to do ill write to him about it if you like  mr tulliver rubbed his knees and looked at the carpet in a meditative manner  but belike hes a bachelor observed mrs tulliver in the interval an ive no opinion o housekeepers there was my brother as is dead an gone had a housekeeper once an she took half the feathers out o the best bed an packed em up an sent em away an its unknown the linen she made away withstott her name was it ud break my heart to send tom where theres a housekeeper an i hope you wont think of it mr tulliver  you may set your mind at rest on that score mrs tulliver said mr riley for stelling is married to as nice a little woman as any man need wish for a wife there isnt a kinder little soul in the world i know her family well she has very much your complexionlight curly hair she comes of a good mudport family and its not every offer that would have been acceptable in that quarter but stellings not an everyday man rather a particular fellow as to the people he chooses to be connected with but i think he would have no objection to take your son i think he would not on my representation  i dont know what he could have against the lad said mrs tulliver with a slight touch of motherly indignation a nice freshskinned lad as anybody need wish to see  but theres one thing im thinking on said mr tulliver turning his head on one side and looking at mr riley after a long perusal of the carpet wouldnt a parson be almost too highlearnt to bring up a lad to be a man o business my notion o the parsons was as theyd got a sort o learning as lay mostly out o sight and that isnt what i want for tom i want him to know figures and write like print and see into things quick and know what folks mean and how to wrap things up in words as arent actionable its an uncommon fine thing that is concluded mr tulliver shaking his head when you can let a man know what you think of him without paying for it  oh my dear tulliver said mr riley youre quite under a mistake about the clergy all the best schoolmasters are of the clergy the schoolmasters who are not clergymen are a very low set of men generally  ay that jacobs is at the cademy interposed mr tulliver  to be suremen who have failed in other trades most likely now a clergyman is a gentleman by profession and education and besides that he has the knowledge that will ground a boy and prepare him for entering on any career with credit there may be some clergymen who are mere bookmen but you may depend upon it stelling is not one of thema man thats wide awake let me tell you drop him a hint and thats enough you talk of figures now you have only to say to stelling i want my son to be a thorough arithmetician and you may leave the rest to him  mr riley paused a moment while mr tulliver somewhat reassured as to clerical tutorship was inwardly rehearsing to an imaginary mr stelling the statement i want my son to know rethmetic  you see my dear tulliver mr riley continued when you get a thoroughly educated man like stelling hes at no loss to take up any branch of instruction when a workman knows the use of his tools he can make a door as well as a window  ay thats true said mr tulliver almost convinced now that the clergy must be the best of schoolmasters  well ill tell you what ill do for you said mr riley and i wouldnt do it for everybody ill see stellings fatherinlaw or drop him a line when i get back to mudport to say that you wish to place your boy with his soninlaw and i dare say stelling will write to you and send you his terms  but theres no hurry is there said mrs tulliver for i hope mr tulliver you wont let tom begin at his new school before midsummer he began at the cademy at the ladyday quarter and you see what goods come of it  ay ay bessy never brew wi bad malt upo michaelmasday else youll have a poor tap said mr tulliver winking and smiling at mr riley with the natural pride of a man who has a buxom wife conspicuously his inferior in intellect but its true theres no hurry youve hit it there bessy  it might be as well not to defer the arrangement too long said mr riley quietly for stelling may have propositions from other parties and i know he would not take more than two or three boarders if so many if i were you i think i would enter on the subject with stelling at once theres no necessity for sending the boy before midsummer but i would be on the safe side and make sure that nobody forestalls you  ay theres summat in that said mr tulliver  father broke in maggie who had stolen unperceived to her fathers elbow again listening with parted lips while she held her doll topsyturvy and crushed its nose against the wood of the chairfather is it a long way off where tom is to go shant we ever go to see him  i dont know my wench said the father tenderly ask mr riley he knows  maggie came round promptly in front of mr riley and said how far is it please sir  oh a long long way off that gentleman answered being of opinion that children when they are not naughty should always be spoken to jocosely you must borrow the sevenleagued boots to get to him  thats nonsense said maggie tossing her head haughtily and turning away with the tears springing in her eyes she began to dislike mr riley it was evident he thought her silly and of no consequence  hush maggie for shame of you asking questions and chattering said her mother come and sit down on your little stool and hold your tongue do but added mrs tulliver who had her own alarm awakened is it so far off as i couldnt wash him and mend him  about fifteen miles thats all said mr riley you can drive there and back in a day quite comfortably orstelling is a hospitable pleasant manhed be glad to have you stay  but its too far off for the linen i doubt said mrs tulliver sadly  the entrance of supper opportunely adjourned this difficulty and relieved mr riley from the labor of suggesting some solution or compromisea labor which he would otherwise doubtless have undertaken for as you perceive he was a man of very obliging manners and he had really given himself the trouble of recommending mr stelling to his friend tulliver without any positive expectation of a solid definite advantage resulting to himself notwithstanding the subtle indications to the contrary which might have misled a toosagacious observer for there is nothing more widely misleading than sagacity if it happens to get on a wrong scent and sagacity persuaded that men usually act and speak from distinct motives with a consciously proposed end in view is certain to waste its energies on imaginary game  plotting covetousness and deliberate contrivance in order to compass a selfish end are nowhere abundant but in the world of the dramatist they demand too intense a mental action for many of our fellowparishioners to be guilty of them it is easy enough to spoil the lives of our neighbors without taking so much trouble we can do it by lazy acquiescence and lazy omission by trivial falsities for which we hardly know a reason by small frauds neutralized by small extravagances by maladroit flatteries and clumsily improvised insinuations we live from hand to mouth most of us with a small family of immediate desires we do little else than snatch a morsel to satisfy the hungry brood rarely thinking of seedcorn or the next years crop  mr riley was a man of business and not cold toward his own interest yet even he was more under the influence of small promptings than of farsighted designs he had no private understanding with the rev walter stelling on the contrary he knew very little of that ma and his acquirementsnot quite enough perhaps to warrant so strong a recommendation of him as he had given to his friend tulliver but he believed mr stelling to be an excellent classic for gadsby had said so and gadsbys first cousin was an oxford tutor which was better ground for the belief even than his own immediate observation would have been for though mr riley had received a tincture of the classics at the great mudport free school and had a sense of understanding latin generally his comprehension of any particular latin was not ready doubtless there remained a subtle aroma from his juvenile contact with the de senectute and the fourth book of the Æneid but it had ceased to be distinctly recognizable as classical and was only perceived in the higher finish and force of his auctioneering style then stelling was an oxford man and the oxford men were alwaysno no it was the cambridge men who were always good mathematicians but a man who had had a university education could teach anything he liked especially a man like stelling who had made a speech at a mudport dinner on a political occasion and had acquitted himself so well that it was generally remarked this soninlaw of timpsons was a sharp fellow it was to be expected of a mudport man from the parish of st ursula that he would not omit to do a good turn to a soninlaw of timpsons for timpson was one of the most useful and influential men in the parish and had a good deal of business which he knew how to put into the right hands mr riley liked such men quite apart from any money which might be diverted through their good judgment from less worthy pockets into his own and it would be a satisfaction to him to say to timpson on his return home ive secured a good pupil for your soninlaw timpson had a large family of daughters mr riley felt for him besides louisa timpsons face with its light curls had been a familiar object to him over the pew wainscot on a sunday for nearly fifteen years it was natural her husband should be a commendable tutor moreover mr riley knew of no other schoolmaster whom he had any ground for recommending in preference why then should he not recommend stelling his friend tulliver had asked him for an opinion it is always chilling in friendly intercourse to say you have no opinion to give and if you deliver an opinion at all it is mere stupidity not to do it with an air of conviction and wellfounded knowledge you make it your own in uttering it and naturally get fond of it thus mr riley knowing no harm of stelling to begin with and wishing him well so far as he had any wishes at all concerning him had no sooner recommended him than he began to think with admiration of a man recommended on such high authority and would soon have gathered so warm an interest on the subject that if mr tulliver had in the end declined to send tom to stelling mr riley would have thought his friend of the old school a thoroughly pigheaded fellow  if you blame mr riley very severely for giving a recommendation on such slight grounds i must say you are rather hard upon him why should an auctioneer and appraiser thirty years ago who had as good as forgotten his freeschool latin be expected to manifest a delicate scrupulosity which is not always exhibited by gentlemen of the learned professions even in our present advanced stage of morality  besides a man with the milk of human kindness in him can scarcely abstain from doing a goodnatured action and one cannot be goodnatured all round nature herself occasionally quarters an inconvenient parasite on an animal toward whom she has otherwise no ill will what then we admire her care for the parasite if mr riley had shrunk from giving a recommendation that was not based on valid evidence he would not have helped mr stelling to a paying pupil and that would not have been so well for the reverend gentleman consider too that all the pleasant little dim ideas and complacenciesof standing well with timpson of dispensing advice when he was asked for it of impressing his friend tulliver with additional respect of saying something and saying it emphatically with other inappreciably minute ingredients that went along with the warm hearth and the brandyandwater to make up mr rileys consciousness on this occasionwould have been a mere blank    chapter iv  tom is expected   it was a heavy disappointment to maggie that she was not allowed to go with her father in the gig when he went to fetch tom home from the academy but the morning was too wet mrs tulliver said for a little girl to go out in her best bonnet maggie took the opposite view very strongly and it was a direct consequence of this difference of opinion that when her mother was in the act of brushing out the reluctant black crop maggie suddenly rushed from under her hands and dipped her head in a basin of water standing near in the vindictive determination that there should be no more chance of curls that day  maggie maggie exclaimed mrs tulliver sitting stout and helpless with the brushes on her lap what is to become of you if youre so naughty ill tell your aunt glegg and your aunt pullet when they come next week and theyll never love you any more oh dear oh dear look at your clean pinafore wet from top to bottom folks ull think its a judgment on me as ive got such a childtheyll think ive done summat wicked  before this remonstrance was finished maggie was already out of hearing making her way toward the great attic that run under the old highpitched roof shaking the water from her black locks as she ran like a skye terrier escaped from his bath this attic was maggies favorite retreat on a wet day when the weather was not too cold here she fretted out all her ill humors and talked aloud to the wormeaten floors and the wormeaten shelves and the dark rafters festooned with cobwebs and here she kept a fetish which she punished for all her misfortunes this was the trunk of a large wooden doll which once stared with the roundest of eyes above the reddest of cheeks but was now entirely defaced by a long career of vicarious suffering three nails driven into the head commemorated as many crises in maggies nine years of earthly struggle that luxury of vengeance having been suggested to her by the picture of jael destroying sisera in the old bible the last nail had been driven in with a fiercer stroke than usual for the fetish on that occasion represented aunt glegg but immediately afterward maggie had reflected that if she drove many nails in she would not be so well able to fancy that the head was hurt when she knocked it against the wall nor to comfort it and make believe to poultice it when her fury was abated for even aunt glegg would be pitiable when she had been hurt very much and thoroughly humiliated so as to beg her nieces pardon since then she had driven no more nails in but had soothed herself by alternately grinding and beating the wooden head against the rough brick of the great chimneys that made two square pillars supporting the roof that was what she did this morning on reaching the attic sobbing all the while with a passion that expelled every other form of consciousnesseven the memory of the grievance that had caused it as at last the sobs were getting quieter and the grinding less fierce a sudden beam of sunshine falling through the wire lattice across the wormeaten shelves made her throw away the fetish and run to the window the sun was really breaking out the sound of the mill seemed cheerful again the granary doors were open and there was yap the queer whiteandbrown terrier with one ear turned back trotting about and sniffing vaguely as if he were in search of a companion it was irresistible maggie tossed her hair back and ran downstairs seized her bonnet without putting it on peeped and then dashed along the passage lest she should encounter her mother and was quickly out in the yard whirling round like a pythoness and singing as she whirled yap yap toms coming home while yap danced and barked round her as much as to say if there was any noise wanted he was the dog for it  hegh hegh miss youll make yourself giddy an tumble down i the dirt said luke the head miller a tall broadshouldered man of forty blackeyed and blackhaired subdued by a general mealiness like an auricula  maggie paused in her whirling and said staggering a little oh no it doesnt make me giddy luke may i go into the mill with you  maggie loved to linger in the great spaces of the mill and often came out with her black hair powdered to a soft whiteness that made her dark eyes flash out with new fire the resolute din the unresting motion of the great stones giving her a dim delicious awe as at the presence of an uncontrollable force the meal forever pouring pouring the fine white powder softening all surfaces and making the very spidernets look like a faery lacework the sweet pure scent of the mealall helped to make maggie feel that the mill was a little world apart from her outside everyday life the spiders were especially a subject of speculation with her she wondered if they had any relatives outside the mill for in that case there must be a painful difficulty in their family intercoursea fat and floury spider accustomed to take his fly well dusted with meal must suffer a little at a cousins table where the fly was au naturel and the lady spiders must be mutually shocked at each others appearance but the part of the mill she liked best was the topmost storythe cornhutch where there were the great heaps of grain which she could sit on and slide down continually she was in the habit of taking this recreation as she conversed with luke to whom she was very communicative wishing him to think well of her understanding as her father did  perhaps she felt it necessary to recover her position with him on the present occasion for as she sat sliding on the heap of grain near which he was busying himself she said at that shrill pitch which was requisite in millsociety  i think you never read any book but the bible did you luke  nay miss an not much o that said luke with great frankness im no reader i arent  but if i lent you one of my books luke ive not got any very pretty books that would be easy for you to read but theres pugs tour of europethat would tell you all about the different sorts of people in the world and if you didnt understand the reading the pictures would help you they show the looks and ways of the people and what they do there are the dutchmen very fat and smoking you know and one sitting on a barrel  nay miss in no opinion o dutchmen there bent much good i knowin about them  but theyre our fellowcreatures luke we ought to know about our fellowcreatures  not much o fellowcreaturs i think miss all i knowmy old master as war a knowin man used to say says he if eer i sow my wheat wiout brinin im a dutchman says he an that war as much as to say as a dutchman war a fool or next door nay nay i arent goin to bother mysen about dutchmen theres fools enoo an rogues enoo wiout lookin i books for em  oh well said maggie rather foiled by lukes unexpectedly decided views about dutchmen perhaps you would like animated nature better thats not dutchmen you know but elephants and kangaroos and the civetcat and the sunfish and a bird sitting on its taili forget its name there are countries full of those creatures instead of horses and cows you know shouldnt you like to know about them luke  nay miss in got to keep count o the flour an corn i cant do wi knowin so many things besides my work thats what brings folks to the gallowsknowin everything but what theyn got to get their bread by an theyre mostly lies i think whats printed i the books them printed sheets are anyhow as the men cry i the streets  why youre like my brother tom luke said maggie wishing to turn the conversation agreeably toms not fond of reading i love tom so dearly lukebetter than anybody else in the world when he grows up i shall keep his house and we shall always live together i can tell him everything he doesnt know but i think toms clever for all he doesnt like books he makes beautiful whipcord and rabbitpens  ah said luke but hell be fine an vexed as the rabbits are all dead  dead screamed maggie jumping up from her sliding seat on the corn oh dear luke what the lopeared one and the spotted doe that tom spent all his money to buy  as dead as moles said luke fetching his comparison from the unmistakable corpses nailed to the stable wall  oh dear luke said maggie in a piteous tone while the big tears rolled down her cheek tom told me to take care of em and i forgot what shall i do  well you see miss they were in that far toolhouse an it was nobodys business to see to em i reckon master tom told harry to feed em but theres no countin on harry hes an offal creatur as iver come about the primises he is he remembers nothing but his own insidean i wish it ud gripe him  oh luke tom told me to be sure and remember the rabbits every day but how could i when they didnt come into my head you know oh he will be so angry with me i know he will and so sorry about his rabbits and so am i sorry oh what shall i do  dont you fret miss said luke soothingly theyre nash things them lopeared rabbits theyd happen ha died if theyd been fed things out o natur niver thrive god amighty doesnt like em he made the rabbits ears to lie back an its nothin but contrairiness to make em hing down like a mastiff dogs master tom ull know better nor buy such things another time dont you fret miss will you come along home wi me and see my wife im agoin this minute  the invitation offered an agreeable distraction to maggies grief and her tears gradually subsided as she trotted along by lukes side to his pleasant cottage which stood with its apple and pear trees and with the added dignity of a leanto pigsty at the other end of the mill fields mrs moggs lukes wife was a decidedly agreeable acquaintance she exhibited her hospitality in bread and treacle and possessed various works of art maggie actually forgot that she had any special cause of sadness this morning as she stood on a chair to look at a remarkable series of pictures representing the prodigal son in the costume of sir charles grandison except that as might have been expected from his defective moral character he had not like that accomplished hero the taste and strength of mind to dispense with a wig but the indefinable weight the dead rabbits had left on her mind caused her to feel more than usual pity for the career of this weak young man particularly when she looked at the picture where he leaned against a tree with a flaccid appearance his kneebreeches unbuttoned and his wig awry while the swine apparently of some foreign breed seemed to insult him by their good spirits over their feast of husks  im very glad his father took him back again arent you luke she said for he was very sorry you know and wouldnt do wrong again  eh miss said luke hed be no great shakes i doubt lets feyther do what he would for him  that was a painful thought to maggie and she wished much that the subsequent history of the young man had not been left a blank    chapter v  tom comes home   tom was to arrive early in the afternoon and there was another fluttering heart besides maggies when it was late enough for the sound of the gigwheels to be expected for if mrs tulliver had a strong feeling it was fondness for her boy at last the sound camethat quick light bowling of the gigwheelsand in spite of the wind which was blowing the clouds about and was not likely to respect mrs tullivers curls and capstrings she came outside the door and even held her hand on maggies offending head forgetting all the griefs of the morning  there he is my sweet lad but lord ha mercy hes got never a collar on its been lost on the road ill be bound and spoilt the set  mrs tulliver stood with her arms open maggie jumped first on one leg and then on the other while tom descended from the gig and said with masculine reticence as to the tender emotions hallo yapwhat are you there  nevertheless he submitted to be kissed willingly enough though maggie hung on his neck in rather a strangling fashion while his bluegray eyes wandered toward the croft and the lambs and the river where he promised himself that he would begin to fish the first thing tomorrow morning he was one of those lads that grow everywhere in england and at twelve or thirteen years of age look as much alike as goslingsa lad with lightbrown hair cheeks of cream and roses full lips indeterminate nose and eyebrowsa physiognomy in which it seems impossible to discern anything but the generic character to boyhood as different as possible from poor maggies phiz which nature seemed to have moulded and colored with the most decided intention but that same nature has the deep cunning which hides itself under the appearance of openness so that simple people think they can see through her quite well and all the while she is secretly preparing a refutation of their confident prophecies under these average boyish physiognomies that she seems to turn off by the gross she conceals some of her most rigid inflexible purposes some of her most unmodifiable characters and the darkeyed demonstrative rebellious girl may after all turn out to be a passive being compared with this pinkandwhite bit of masculinity with the indeterminate features  maggie said tom confidentially taking her into a corner as soon as his mother was gone out to examine his box and the warm parlor had taken off the chill he had felt from the long drive you dont know what ive got in my pockets nodding his head up and down as a means of rousing her sense of mystery  no said maggie how stodgy they look tom is it marls marbles or cobnuts maggies heart sank a little because tom always said it was no good playing with her at those games she played so badly  marls no ive swopped all my marls with the little fellows and cobnuts are no fun you silly only when the nuts are green but see here he drew something half out of his righthand pocket  what is it said maggie in a whisper i can see nothing but a bit of yellow  why itsanewguess maggie  oh i cant guess tom said maggie impatiently  dont be a spitfire else i wont tell you said tom thrusting his hand back into his pocket and looking determined  no tom said maggie imploringly laying hold of the arm that was held stiffly in the pocket im not cross tom it was only because i cant bear guessing please be good to me  toms arm slowly relaxed and he said well then its a new fishlinetwo new unsone for you maggie all to yourself i wouldnt go halves in the toffee and gingerbread on purpose to save the money and gibson and spouncer fought with me because i wouldnt and heres hooks see herei say wont we go and fish tomorrow down by the round pool and you shall catch your own fish maggie and put the worms on and everything wont it be fun  maggies answer was to throw her arms round toms neck and hug him and hold her cheek against his without speaking while he slowly unwound some of the line saying after a pause  wasnt i a good brother now to buy you a line all to yourself you know i neednt have bought it if i hadnt liked  yes very very goodi do love you tom  tom had put the line back in his pocket and was looking at the hooks one by one before he spoke again  and the fellows fought me because i wouldnt give in about the toffee  oh dear i wish they wouldnt fight at your school tom didnt it hurt you  hurt me no said tom putting up the hooks again taking out a large pocketknife and slowly opening the largest blade which he looked at meditatively as he rubbed his finger along it then he added  i gave spouncer a black eye i know thats what he got by wanting to leather me i wasnt going to go halves because anybody leathered me  oh how brave you are tom i think youre like samson if there came a lion roaring at me i think youd fight him wouldnt you tom  how can a lion come roaring at you you silly thing theres no lions only in the shows  no but if we were in the lion countriesi mean in africa where its very hot the lions eat people there i can show it you in the book where i read it  well i should get a gun and shoot him  but if you hadnt got a gunwe might have gone out you know not thinking just as we go fishing and then a great lion might run toward us roaring and we couldnt get away from him what should you do tom  tom paused and at last turned away contemptuously saying but the lion isnt coming whats the use of talking  but i like to fancy how it would be said maggie following him just think what you would do tom  oh dont bother maggie youre such a silly i shall go and see my rabbits  maggies heart began to flutter with fear she dared not tell the sad truth at once but she walked after tom in trembling silence as he went out thinking how she could tell him the news so as to soften at once his sorrow and his anger for maggie dreaded toms anger of all things it was quite a different anger from her own  tom she said timidly when they were out of doors how much money did you give for your rabbits  two halfcrowns and a sixpence said tom promptly  i think ive got a great deal more than that in my steel purse upstairs ill ask mother to give it you  what for said tom i dont want your money you silly thing ive got a great deal more money than you because im a boy i always have halfsovereigns and sovereigns for my christmas boxes because i shall be a man and you only have fiveshilling pieces because youre only a girl  well but tomif mother would let me give you two halfcrowns and a sixpence out of my purse to put into your pocket and spend you know and buy some more rabbits with it  more rabbits i dont want any more  oh but tom theyre all dead  tom stopped immediately in his walk and turned round toward maggie you forgot to feed em then and harry forgot he said his color heightening for a moment but soon subsiding ill pitch into harry ill have him turned away and i dont love you maggie you shant go fishing with me tomorrow i told you to go and see the rabbits every day he walked on again  yes but i forgotand i couldnt help it indeed tom im so very sorry said maggie while the tears rushed fast  youre a naughty girl said tom severely and im sorry i bought you the fishline i dont love you  oh tom its very cruel sobbed maggie id forgive you if you forgot anythingi wouldnt mind what you didid forgive you and love you  yes youre silly but i never do forget things i dont  oh please forgive me tom my heart will break said maggie shaking with sobs clinging to toms arm and laying her wet cheek on his shoulder  tom shook her off and stopped again saying in a peremptory tone now maggie you just listen arent i a good brother to you  yeyees sobbed maggie her chin rising and falling convulsedly  didnt i think about your fishline all this quarter and mean to buy it and saved my money o purpose and wouldnt go halves in the toffee and spouncer fought me because i wouldnt  yeyeesand ilololove you so tom  but youre a naughty girl last holidays you licked the paint off my lozengebox and the holidays before that you let the boat drag my fishline down when id set you to watch it and you pushed your head through my kite all for nothing  but i didnt mean said maggie i couldnt help it  yes you could said tom if youd minded what you were doing and youre a naughty girl and you shant go fishing with me tomorrow  with this terrible conclusion tom ran away from maggie toward the mill meaning to greet luke there and complain to him of harry  maggie stood motionless except from her sobs for a minute or two then she turned round and ran into the house and up to her attic where she sat on the floor and laid her head against the wormeaten shelf with a crushing sense of misery tom was come home and she had thought how happy she should be and now he was cruel to her what use was anything if tom didnt love her oh he was very cruel hadnt she wanted to give him the money and said how very sorry she was she knew she was naughty to her mother but she had never been naughty to tomhad never meant to be naughty to him  oh he is cruel maggie sobbed aloud finding a wretched pleasure in the hollow resonance that came through the long empty space of the attic she never thought of beating or grinding her fetish she was too miserable to be angry  these bitter sorrows of childhood when sorrow is all new and strange when hope has not yet got wings to fly beyond the days and weeks and the space from summer to summer seems measureless  maggie soon thought she had been hours in the attic and it must be teatime and they were all having their tea and not thinking of her well then she would stay up there and starve herselfhide herself behind the tub and stay there all nightand then they would all be frightened and tom would be sorry thus maggie thought in the pride of her heart as she crept behind the tub but presently she began to cry again at the idea that they didnt mind her being there if she went down again to tom nowwould he forgive her perhaps her father would be there and he would take her part but then she wanted tom to forgive her because he loved her not because his father told him no she would never go down if tom didnt come to fetch her this resolution lasted in great intensity for five dark minutes behind the tub but then the need of being lovedthe strongest need in poor maggies naturebegan to wrestle with her pride and soon threw it she crept from behind her tub into the twilight of the long attic but just then she heard a quick footstep on the stairs  tom had been too much interested in his talk with luke in going the round of the premises walking in and out where he pleased and whittling sticks without any particular reasonexcept that he didnt whittle sticks at schoolto think of maggie and the effect his anger had produced on her he meant to punish her and that business having been performed he occupied himself with other matters like a practical person but when he had been called in to tea his father said why wheres the little wench and mrs tulliver almost at the same moment said wheres your little sisterboth of them having supposed that maggie and tom had been together all the afternoon  i dont know said tom he didnt want to tell of maggie though he was angry with her for tom tulliver was a lad of honor  what hasnt she been playing with you all this while said the father shed been thinking o nothing but your coming home  i havent seen her this two hours says tom commencing on the plumcake  goodness heart shes got drownded exclaimed mrs tulliver rising from her seat and running to the window  how could you let her do so she added as became a fearful woman accusing she didnt know whom of she didnt know what  nay nay shes none drownded said mr tulliver youve been naughty to her i doubt tom  im sure i havent father said tom indignantly i think shes in the house  perhaps up in that attic said mrs tulliver asinging and talking to herself and forgetting all about mealtimes  you go and fetch her down tom said mr tulliver rather sharplyhis perspicacity or his fatherly fondness for maggie making him suspect that the lad had been hard upon the little un else she would never have left his side and be good to her do you hear else ill let you know better  tom never disobeyed his father for mr tulliver was a peremptory man and as he said would never let anybody get hold of his whiphand but he went out rather sullenly carrying his piece of plumcake and not intending to reprieve maggies punishment which was no more than she deserved tom was only thirteen and had no decided views in grammar and arithmetic regarding them for the most part as open questions but he was particularly clear and positive on one pointnamely that he would punish everybody who deserved it why he wouldnt have minded being punished himself if he deserved it but then he never did deserve it  it was toms step then that maggie heard on the stairs when her need of love had triumphed over her pride and she was going down with her swollen eyes and dishevelled hair to beg for pity at least her father would stroke her head and say never mind my wench it is a wonderful subduer this need of lovethis hunger of the heartas peremptory as that other hunger by which nature forces us to submit to the yoke and change the face of the world  but she knew toms step and her heart began to beat violently with the sudden shock of hope he only stood still at the top of the stairs and said maggie youre to come down but she rushed to him and clung round his neck sobbing oh tom please forgive mei cant bear iti will always be goodalways remember thingsdo love meplease dear tom  we learn to restrain ourselves as we get older we keep apart when we have quarrelled express ourselves in wellbred phrases and in this way preserve a dignified alienation showing much firmness on one side and swallowing much grief on the other we no longer approximate in our behavior to the mere impulsiveness of the lower animals but conduct ourselves in every respect like members of a highly civilized society maggie and tom were still very much like young animals and so she could rub her cheek against his and kiss his ear in a random sobbing way and there were tender fibres in the lad that had been used to answer to maggies fondling so that he behaved with a weakness quite inconsistent with his resolution to punish her as much as she deserved he actually began to kiss her in return and say  dont cry then magsie here eat a bit o cake  maggies sobs began to subside and she put out her mouth for the cake and bit a piece and then tom bit a piece just for company and they ate together and rubbed each others cheeks and brows and noses together while they ate with a humiliating resemblance to two friendly ponies  come along magsie and have tea said tom at last when there was no more cake except what was downstairs  so ended the sorrows of this day and the next morning maggie was trotting with her own fishingrod in one hand and a handle of the basket in the other stepping always by a peculiar gift in the muddiest places and looking darkly radiant from under her beaverbonnet because tom was good to her she had told tom however that she should like him to put the worms on the hook for her although she accepted his word when he assured her that worms couldnt feel it was toms private opinion that it didnt much matter if they did he knew all about worms and fish and those things and what birds were mischievous and how padlocks opened and which way the handles of the gates were to be lifted maggie thought this sort of knowledge was very wonderfulmuch more difficult than remembering what was in the books and she was rather in awe of toms superiority for he was the only person who called her knowledge stuff and did not feel surprised at her cleverness tom indeed was of opinion that maggie was a silly little thing all girls were sillythey couldnt throw a stone so as to hit anything couldnt do anything with a pocketknife and were frightened at frogs still he was very fond of his sister and meant always to take care of her make her his housekeeper and punish her when she did wrong  they were on their way to the round poolthat wonderful pool which the floods had made a long while ago no one knew how deep it was and it was mysterious too that it should be almost a perfect round framed in with willows and tall reeds so that the water was only to be seen when you got close to the brink the sight of the old favorite spot always heightened toms good humor and he spoke to maggie in the most amicable whispers as he opened the precious basket and prepared their tackle he threw her line for her and put the rod into her hand maggie thought it probable that the small fish would come to her hook and the large ones to toms but she had forgotten all about the fish and was looking dreamily at the glassy water when tom said in a loud whisper look look maggie and came running to prevent her from snatching her line away  maggie was frightened lest she had been doing something wrong as usual but presently tom drew out her line and brought a large tench bouncing on the grass  tom was excited  o magsie you little duck empty the basket  maggie was not conscious of unusual merit but it was enough that tom called her magsie and was pleased with her there was nothing to mar her delight in the whispers and the dreamy silences when she listened to the light dripping sounds of the rising fish and the gentle rustling as if the willows and the reeds and the water had their happy whisperings also maggie thought it would make a very nice heaven to sit by the pool in that way and never be scolded she never knew she had a bite till tom told her but she liked fishing very much  it was one of their happy mornings they trotted along and sat down together with no thought that life would ever change much for them they would only get bigger and not go to school and it would always be like the holidays they would always live together and be fond of each other and the mill with its booming the great chestnuttree under which they played at houses their own little river the ripple where the banks seemed like home and tom was always seeing the waterrats while maggie gathered the purple plumy tops of the reeds which she forgot and dropped afterward above all the great floss along which they wandered with a sense of travel to see the rushing springtide the awful eagle come up like a hungry monster or to see the great ash which had once wailed and groaned like a man these things would always be just the same to them tom thought people were at a disadvantage who lived on any other spot of the globe and maggie when she read about christiana passing the river over which there is no bridge always saw the floss between the green pastures by the great ash  life did change for tom and maggie and yet they were not wrong in believing that the thoughts and loves of these first years would always make part of their lives we could never have loved the earth so well if we had had no childhood in itif it were not the earth where the same flowers come up again every spring that we used to gather with our tiny fingers as we sat lisping to ourselves on the grass the same hips and haws on the autumns hedgerows the same redbreasts that we used to call gods birds because they did no harm to the precious crops what novelty is worth that sweet monotony where everything is known and loved because it is known  the wood i walk in on this mild may day with the young yellowbrown foliage of the oaks between me and the blue sky the white starflowers and the blueeyed speedwell and the ground ivy at my feet what grove of tropic palms what strange ferns or splendid broadpetalled blossoms could ever thrill such deep and delicate fibres within me as this home scene these familiar flowers these wellremembered birdnotes this sky with its fitful brightness these furrowed and grassy fields each with a sort of personality given to it by the capricious hedgerowssuch things as these are the mothertongue of our imagination the language that is laden with all the subtle inextricable associations the fleeting hours of our childhood left behind them our delight in the sunshine on the deepbladed grass today might be no more than the faint perception of wearied souls if it were not for the sunshine and the grass in the faroff years which still live in us and transform our perception into love    chapter vi  the aunts and uncles are coming   it was easter week and mrs tullivers cheesecakes were more exquisitely light than usual a puff o wind ud make em blow about like feathers kezia the housemaid said feeling proud to live under a mistress who could make such pastry so that no season or circumstances could have been more propitious for a family party even if it had not been advisable to consult sister glegg and sister pullet about toms going to school  id as lief not invite sister deane this time said mrs tulliver for shes as jealous and having as can be ands allays trying to make the worst o my poor children to their aunts and uncles  yes yes said mr tulliver ask her to come i never hardly get a bit o talk with deane now we havent had him this six months whats it matter what she says my children need be beholding to nobody  thats what you allays say mr tulliver but im sure theres nobody o your side neither aunt nor uncle to leave em so much as a fivepound note for a leggicy and theres sister glegg and sister pullet too saving money unknown for they put by all their own interest and buttermoney too their husbands buy em everything mrs tulliver was a mild woman but even a sheep will face about a little when she has lambs  tchuh said mr tulliver it takes a big loaf when theres many to breakfast what signifies your sisters bits o money when theyve got halfadozen nevvies and nieces to divide it among and your sister deane wont get em to leave all to one i reckon and make the country cry shame on em when they are dead  i dont know what she wont get em to do said mrs tulliver for my children are so awkard wi their aunts and uncles maggies ten times naughtier when they come than she is other days and tom doesnt like em bless himthough its more natral in a boy than a gell and theres lucy deans such a good childyou may set her on a stool and there shell sit for an hour together and never offer to get off i cant help loving the child as if she was my own and im sure shes more like my child than sister deanes for shed allays a very poor color for one of our family sister deane had  well well if youre fond o the child ask her father and mother to bring her with em and wont you ask their aunt and uncle moss too and some o their children  oh dear mr tulliver why thered be eight people besides the children and i must put two more leaves i the table besides reaching down more o the dinnerservice and you know as well as i do as my sisters and your sister dont suit well together  well well do as you like bessy said mr tulliver taking up his hat and walking out to the mill few wives were more submissive than mrs tulliver on all points unconnected with her family relations but she had been a miss dodson and the dodsons were a very respectable family indeedas much looked up to as any in their own parish or the next to it the miss dodsons had always been thought to hold up their heads very high and no one was surprised the two eldest had married so wellnot at an early age for that was not the practice of the dodson family there were particular ways of doing everything in that family particular ways of bleaching the linen of making the cowslip wine curing the hams and keeping the bottled gooseberries so that no daughter of that house could be indifferent to the privilege of having been born a dodson rather than a gibson or a watson funerals were always conducted with peculiar propriety in the dodson family the hatbands were never of a blue shade the gloves never split at the thumb everybody was a mourner who ought to be and there were always scarfs for the bearers when one of the family was in trouble or sickness all the rest went to visit the unfortunate member usually at the same time and did not shrink from uttering the most disagreeable truths that correct family feeling dictated if the illness or trouble was the sufferers own fault it was not in the practice of the dodson family to shrink from saying so in short there was in this family a peculiar tradition as to what was the right thing in household management and social demeanor and the only bitter circumstance attending this superiority was a painful inability to approve the condiments or the conduct of families ungoverned by the dodson tradition a female dodson when in strange houses always ate dry bread with her tea and declined any sort of preserves having no confidence in the butter and thinking that the preserves had probably begun to ferment from want of due sugar and boiling there were some dodsons less like the family than others that was admitted but in so far as they were kin they were of necessity better than those who were no kin and it is remarkable that while no individual dodson was satisfied with any other individual dodson each was satisfied not only with him or her self but with the dodsons collectively the feeblest member of a familythe one who has the least characteris often the merest epitome of the family habits and traditions and mrs tulliver was a thorough dodson though a mild one as smallbeer so long as it is anything is only describable as very weak ale and though she had groaned a little in her youth under the yoke of her elder sisters and still shed occasional tears at their sisterly reproaches it was not in mrs tulliver to be an innovator on the family ideas she was thankful to have been a dodson and to have one child who took after her own family at least in his features and complexion in liking salt and in eating beans which a tulliver never did  in other respects the true dodson was partly latent in tom and he was as far from appreciating his kin on the mothers side as maggie herself generally absconding for the day with a large supply of the most portable food when he received timely warning that his aunts and uncles were cominga moral symptom from which his aunt glegg deduced the gloomiest views of his future it was rather hard on maggie that tom always absconded without letting her into the secret but the weaker sex are acknowledged to be serious impedimenta in cases of flight  on wednesday the day before the aunts and uncles were coming there were such various and suggestive scents as of plumcakes in the oven and jellies in the hot state mingled with the aroma of gravy that it was impossible to feel altogether gloomy there was hope in the air tom and maggie made several inroads into the kitchen and like other marauders were induced to keep aloof for a time only by being allowed to carry away a sufficient load of booty  tom said maggie as they sat on the boughs of the eldertree eating their jampuffs shall you run away tomorrow  no said tom slowly when he had finished his puff and was eying the third which was to be divided between themno i shant  why tom because lucys coming  no said tom opening his pocketknife and holding it over the puff with his head on one side in a dubitative manner it was a difficult problem to divide that very irregular polygon into two equal parts what do i care about lucy shes only a girlshe cant play at bandy  is it the tipsycake then said maggie exerting her hypothetic powers while she leaned forward toward tom with her eyes fixed on the hovering knife  no you silly thatll be good the day after its the pudden i know what the puddens to beapricot rollupo my buttons  with this interjection the knife descended on the puff and it was in two but the result was not satisfactory to tom for he still eyed the halves doubtfully at last he said  shut your eyes maggie  what for  you never mind what for shut em when i tell you  maggie obeyed  now whichll you have maggieright hand or left  ill have that with the jam run out said maggie keeping her eyes shut to please tom  why you dont like that you silly you may have it if it comes to you fair but i shant give it you without right or leftyou choose now haaa said tom in a tone of exasperation as maggie peeped you keep your eyes shut now else you shant have any  maggies power of sacrifice did not extend so far indeed i fear she cared less that tom should enjoy the utmost possible amount of puff than that he should be pleased with her for giving him the best bit so she shut her eyes quite close till tom told her to say which and then she said left hand  youve got it said tom in rather a bitter tone  what the bit with the jam run out  no here take it said tom firmly handing decidedly the best piece to maggie  oh please tom have it i dont mindi like the other please take this  no i shant said tom almost crossly beginning on his own inferior piece  maggie thinking it was no use to contend further began too and ate up her half puff with considerable relish as well as rapidity but tom had finished first and had to look on while maggie ate her last morsel or two feeling in himself a capacity for more maggie didnt know tom was looking at her she was seesawing on the elderbough lost to almost everything but a vague sense of jam and idleness  oh you greedy thing said tom when she had swallowed the last morsel he was conscious of having acted very fairly and thought she ought to have considered this and made up to him for it he would have refused a bit of hers beforehand but one is naturally at a different point of view before and after ones own share of puff is swallowed  maggie turned quite pale oh tom why didnt you ask me  i wasnt going to ask you for a bit you greedy you might have thought of it without when you knew i gave you the best bit  but i wanted you to have it you know i did said maggie in an injured tone  yes but i wasnt going to do what wasnt fair like spouncer he always takes the best bit if you dont punch him for it and if you choose the best with your eyes shut he changes his hands but if i go halves ill go em fair only i wouldnt be a greedy  with this cutting innuendo tom jumped down from his bough and threw a stone with a hoigh as a friendly attention to yap who had also been looking on while the eatables vanished with an agitation of his ears and feelings which could hardly have been without bitterness yet the excellent dog accepted toms attention with as much alacrity as if he had been treated quite generously  but maggie gifted with that superior power of misery which distinguishes the human being and places him at a proud distance from the most melancholy chimpanzee sat still on her bough and gave herself up to the keen sense of unmerited reproach she would have given the world not to have eaten all her puff and to have saved some of it for tom not but that the puff was very nice for maggies palate was not at all obtuse but she would have gone without it many times over sooner than tom should call her greedy and be cross with her and he had said he wouldnt have it and she ate it without thinking how could she help it the tears flowed so plentifully that maggie saw nothing around her for the next ten minutes but by that time resentment began to give way to the desire of reconciliation and she jumped from her bough to look for tom he was no longer in the paddock behind the rickyard where was he likely to be gone and yap with him maggie ran to the high bank against the great hollytree where she could see far away toward the floss there was tom but her heart sank again as she saw how far off he was on his way to the great river and that he had another companion besides yapnaughty bob jakin whose official if not natural function of frightening the birds was just now at a standstill maggie felt sure that bob was wicked without very distinctly knowing why unless it was because bobs mother was a dreadfully large fat woman who lived at a queer round house down the river and once when maggie and tom had wandered thither there rushed out a brindled dog that wouldnt stop barking and when bobs mother came out after it and screamed above the barking to tell them not to be frightened maggie thought she was scolding them fiercely and her heart beat with terror maggie thought it very likely that the round house had snakes on the floor and bats in the bedroom for she had seen bob take off his cap to show tom a little snake that was inside it and another time he had a handful of young bats altogether he was an irregular character perhaps even slightly diabolical judging from his intimacy with snakes and bats and to crown all when tom had bob for a companion he didnt mind about maggie and would never let her go with him  it must be owned that tom was fond of bobs company how could it be otherwise bob knew directly he saw a birds egg whether it was a swallows or a tomtits or a yellowhammers he found out all the wasps nests and could set all sort of traps he could climb the trees like a squirrel and had quite a magical power of detecting hedgehogs and stoats and he had courage to do things that were rather naughty such as making gaps in the hedgerows throwing stones after the sheep and killing a cat that was wandering incognito  such qualities in an inferior who could always be treated with authority in spite of his superior knowingness had necessarily a fatal fascination for tom and every holidaytime maggie was sure to have days of grief because he had gone off with bob  well there was no hope for it he was gone now and maggie could think of no comfort but to sit down by the hollow or wander by the hedgerow and fancy it was all different refashioning her little world into just what she should like it to be  maggies was a troublous life and this was the form in which she took her opium  meanwhile tom forgetting all about maggie and the sting of reproach which he had left in her heart was hurrying along with bob whom he had met accidentally to the scene of a great ratcatching in a neighboring barn bob knew all about this particular affair and spoke of the sport with an enthusiasm which no one who is not either divested of all manly feeling or pitiably ignorant of ratcatching can fail to imagine for a person suspected of preternatural wickedness bob was really not so very villanouslooking there was even something agreeable in his snubnosed face with its closecurled border of red hair but then his trousers were always rolled up at the knee for the convenience of wading on the slightest notice and his virtue supposing it to exist was undeniably virtue in rags which on the authority even of bilious philosophers who think all welldressed merit overpaid is notoriously likely to remain unrecognized perhaps because it is seen so seldom  i know the chap as owns the ferrets said bob in a hoarse treble voice as he shuffled along keeping his blue eyes fixed on the river like an amphibious animal who foresaw occasion for darting in he lives up the kennel yard at sut oggs he does hes the biggest rotcatcher anywhere he is id sooner be a rotcatcher nor anything i would the moles is nothing to the rots but lors you mun ha ferrets dogs is no good why theres that dog now bob continued pointing with an air of disgust toward yap hes no more good wi a rot nor nothin i see it myself i did at the rotcatchin i your feythers barn  yap feeling the withering influence of this scorn tucked his tail in and shrank close to toms leg who felt a little hurt for him but had not the superhuman courage to seem behindhand with bob in contempt for a dog who made so poor a figure  no no he said yaps no good at sport ill have regular good dogs for rats and everything when ive done school  hev ferrets measter tom said bob eagerlythem white ferrets wi pink eyes lors you might catch your own rots an you might put a rot in a cage wi a ferret an see em fight you might thats what id do i know an it ud be better fun amost nor seein two chaps fightif it wasnt them chaps as sold cakes an oranges at the fair as the things flew out o their baskets an some o the cakes was smashedbut they tasted just as good added bob by way of note or addendum after a moments pause  but i say bob said tom in a tone of deliberation ferrets are nasty biting thingstheyll bite a fellow without being set on  lors why thats the beauty on em if a chap lays hold o your ferret he wont be long before he hollows out a good un he wont  at this moment a striking incident made the boys pause suddenly in their walk it was the plunging of some small body in the water from among the neighboring bulrushes if it was not a waterrat bob intimated that he was ready to undergo the most unpleasant consequences  hoigh yaphoigh there he is said tom clapping his hands as the little black snout made its arrowy course to the opposite bank seize him lad seize him  yap agitated his ears and wrinkled his brows but declined to plunge trying whether barking would not answer the purpose just as well  ugh you coward said tom and kicked him over feeling humiliated as a sportsman to possess so poorspirited an animal bob abstained from remark and passed on choosing however to walk in the shallow edge of the overflowing river by way of change  hes none so full now the floss isnt said bob as he kicked the water up before him with an agreeable sense of being insolent to it why last ear the meadows was all one sheet o water they was  ay but said tom whose mind was prone to see an opposition between statements that were really accordantbut there was a big flood once when the round pool was made i know there was cause father says so and the sheep and cows all drowned and the boats went all over the fields ever such a way  i dont care about a flood comin said bob i dont mind the water no more nor the land id swim i would  ah but if you got nothing to eat for ever so long said tom his imagination becoming quite active under the stimulus of that dread when im a man i shall make a boat with a wooden house on the top of it like noahs ark and keep plenty to eat in itrabbits and thingsall ready and then if the flood came you know bob i shouldnt mind and id take you in if i saw you swimming he added in the tone of a benevolent patron  i arent frighted said bob to whom hunger did not appear so appalling but id get in an knock the rabbits on th head when you wanted to eat em  ah and i should have halfpence and wed play at headsandtails said tom not contemplating the possibility that this recreation might have fewer charms for his mature age id divide fair to begin with and then wed see whod win  ive got a halfpenny o my own said bob proudly coming out of the water and tossing his halfpenny in the air yeads or tails  tails said tom instantly fired with the desire to win  its yeads said bob hastily snatching up the halfpenny as it fell  it wasnt said tom loudly and peremptorily you give me the halfpenny ive won it fair  i shant said bob holding it tight in his pocket  then ill make you see if i dont said tom  yes i can  you cant make me do nothing you cant said bob  no you cant  im master  i dont care for you  but ill make you care you cheat said tom collaring bob and shaking him  you get out wi you said bob giving tom a kick  toms blood was thoroughly up he went at bob with a lunge and threw him down but bob seized hold and kept it like a cat and pulled tom down after him they struggled fiercely on the ground for a moment or two till tom pinning bob down by the shoulders thought he had the mastery  you say youll give me the halfpenny now he said with difficulty while he exerted himself to keep the command of bobs arms  but at this moment yap who had been running on before returned barking to the scene of action and saw a favorable opportunity for biting bobs bare leg not only with inpunity but with honor the pain from yaps teeth instead of surprising bob into a relaxation of his hold gave it a fiercer tenacity and with a new exertion of his force he pushed tom backward and got uppermost but now yap who could get no sufficient purchase before set his teeth in a new place so that bob harassed in this way let go his hold of tom and almost throttling yap flung him into the river by this time tom was up again and before bob had quite recovered his balance after the act of swinging yap tom fell upon him threw him down and got his knees firmly on bobs chest  you give me the halfpenny now said tom  take it said bob sulkily  no i shant take it you give it me  bob took the halfpenny out of his pocket and threw it away from him on the ground  tom loosed his hold and left bob to rise  there the halfpenny lies he said i dont want your halfpenny i wouldnt have kept it but you wanted to cheat i hate a cheat i shant go along with you any more he added turning round homeward not without casting a regret toward the ratcatching and other pleasures which he must relinquish along with bobs society  you may let it alone then bob called out after him i shall cheat if i like theres no fun i playing else and i know where theres a goldfinchs nest but ill take care you dont an youre a nasty fightin turkeycock you are  tom walked on without looking around and yap followed his example the cold bath having moderated his passions  go along wi you then wi your drowned dog i wouldnt own such a dogi wouldnt said bob getting louder in a last effort to sustain his defiance but tom was not to be provoked into turning round and bobs voice began to falter a little as he said  an in gien you everything an showed you everything an niver wanted nothin from you an theres your hornhanded knife then as you gien me here bob flung the knife as far as he could after toms retreating footsteps but it produced no effect except the sense in bobs mind that there was a terrible void in his lot now that knife was gone  he stood still till tom had passed through the gate and disappeared behind the hedge the knife would do not good on the ground there it wouldnt vex tom and pride or resentment was a feeble passion in bobs mind compared with the love of a pocketknife his very fingers sent entreating thrills that he would go and clutch that familiar rough buckshorn handle which they had so often grasped for mere affection as it lay idle in his pocket and there were two blades and they had just been sharpened what is life without a pocketknife to him who has once tasted a higher existence no to throw the handle after the hatchet is a comprehensible act of desperation but to throw ones pocketknife after an implacable friend is clearly in every sense a hyperbole or throwing beyond the mark so bob shuffled back to the spot where the beloved knife lay in the dirt and felt quite a new pleasure in clutching it again after the temporary separation in opening one blade after the other and feeling their edge with his wellhardened thumb poor bob he was not sensitive on the point of honor not a chivalrous character that fine moral aroma would not have been thought much of by the public opinion of kennel yard which was the very focus or heart of bobs world even if it could have made itself perceptible there yet for all that he was not utterly a sneak and a thief as our friend tom had hastily decided  but tom you perceive was rather a rhadamanthine personage having more than the usual share of boys justice in himthe justice that desires to hurt culprits as much as they deserve to be hurt and is troubled with no doubts concerning the exact amount of their deserts maggie saw a cloud on his brow when he came home which checked her joy at his coming so much sooner than she had expected and she dared hardly speak to him as he stood silently throwing the small gravelstones into the milldam it is not pleasant to give up a ratcatching when you have set your mind on it but if tom had told his strongest feeling at that moment he would have said id do just the same again that was his usual mode of viewing his past actions whereas maggie was always wishing she had done something different    chapter vii  enter the aunts and uncles   the dodsons were certainly a handsome family and mrs glegg was not the least handsome of the sisters as she sat in mrs tullivers armchair no impartial observer could have denied that for a woman of fifty she had a very comely face and figure though tom and maggie considered their aunt glegg as the type of ugliness it is true she despised the advantages of costume for though as she often observed no woman had better clothes it was not her way to wear her new things out before her old ones other women if they liked might have their best threadlace in every wash but when mrs glegg died it would be found that she had better lace laid by in the righthand drawer of her wardrobe in the spotted chamber than ever mrs wooll of st oggs had bought in her life although mrs wooll wore her lace before it was paid for so of her curled fronts mrs glegg had doubtless the glossiest and crispest brown curls in her drawers as well as curls in various degrees of fuzzy laxness but to look out on the weekday world from under a crisp and glossy front would be to introduce a most dreamlike and unpleasant confusion between the sacred and the secular occasionally indeed mrs glegg wore one of her thirdbest fronts on a weekday visit but not at a sisters house especially not at mrs tullivers who since her marriage had hurt her sisters feelings greatly by wearing her own hair though as mrs glegg observed to mrs deane a mother of a family like bessy with a husband always going to law might have been expected to know better but bessy was always weak  so if mrs gleggs front today was more fuzzy and lax than usual she had a design under it she intended the most pointed and cutting allusion to mrs tullivers bunches of blond curls separated from each other by a due wave of smoothness on each side of the parting mrs tulliver had shed tears several times at sister gleggs unkindness on the subject of these unmatronly curls but the consciousness of looking the handsomer for them naturally administered support mrs glegg chose to wear her bonnet in the house todayuntied and tilted slightly of coursea frequent practice of hers when she was on a visit and happened to be in a severe humor she didnt know what draughts there might be in strange houses for the same reason she wore a small sable tippet which reached just to her shoulders and was very far from meeting across her wellformed chest while her long neck was protected by a chevauxdefrise of miscellaneous frilling one would need to be learned in the fashions of those times to know how far in the rear of them mrs gleggs slatecolored silk gown must have been but from certain constellations of small yellow spots upon it and a mouldy odor about it suggestive of a damp clotheschest it was probable that it belonged to a stratum of garments just old enough to have come recently into wear  mrs glegg held her large gold watch in her hand with the manydoubled chain round her fingers and observed to mrs tulliver who had just returned from a visit to the kitchen that whatever it might be by other peoples clocks and watches it was gone halfpast twelve by hers  i dont know what ails sister pullet she continued it used to be the way in our family for one to be as early as anotherim sure it was so in my poor fathers timeand not for one sister to sit half an hour before the others came but if the ways o the family are altered it shant be my fault ill never be the one to come into a house when all the rest are going away i wonder at sister deaneshe used to be more like me but if youll take my advice bessy youll put the dinner forrard a bit sooner than put it back because folks are late as ought to ha known better  oh dear theres no fear but what theyll be all here in time sister said mrs tulliver in her mildpeevish tone the dinner wont be ready till halfpast one but if its long for you to wait let me fetch you a cheesecake and a glass o wine  well bessy said mrs glegg with a bitter smile and a scarcely perceptible toss of her head i should ha thought youd known your own sister better i never did eat between meals and im not going to begin not but what i hate that nonsense of having your dinner at halfpast one when you might have it at one you was never brought up in that way bessy  why jane what can i do mr tulliver doesnt like his dinner before two oclock but i put it half an hour earlier because o you  yes yes i know how it is with husbandstheyre for putting everything off theyll put the dinner off till after tea if theyve got wives as are weak enough to give in to such work but its a pity for you bessy as you havent got more strength o mind itll be well if your children dont suffer for it and i hope youve not gone and got a great dinner for usgoing to expense for your sisters as ud sooner eat a crust o dry bread nor help to ruin you with extravagance i wonder you dont take pattern by your sister deane shes far more sensible and here youve got two children to provide for and your husbands spent your fortin i going to law ands likely to spend his own too a boiled joint as you could make broth of for the kitchen mrs glegg added in a tone of emphatic protest and a plain pudding with a spoonful o sugar and no spice ud be far more becoming  with sister glegg in this humor there was a cheerful prospect for the day mrs tulliver never went the length of quarrelling with her any more than a waterfowl that puts out its leg in a deprecating manner can be said to quarrel with a boy who throws stones but this point of the dinner was a tender one and not at all new so that mrs tulliver could make the same answer she had often made before  mr tulliver says he always will have a good dinner for his friends while he can pay for it she said and hes a right to do as he likes in his own house sister  well bessy i cant leave your children enough out o my savings to keep em from ruin and you mustnt look to having any o mr gleggs money for its well if i dont go firsthe comes of a longlived family and if he was to die and leave me well for my life hed tie all the money up to go back to his own kin  the sound of wheels while mrs glegg was speaking was an interruption highly welcome to mrs tulliver who hastened out to receive sister pullet it must be sister pullet because the sound was that of a fourwheel  mrs glegg tossed her head and looked rather sour about the mouth at the thought of the fourwheel she had a strong opinion on that subject  sister pullet was in tears when the onehorse chaise stopped before mrs tullivers door and it was apparently requisite that she should shed a few more before getting out for though her husband and mrs tulliver stood ready to support her she sat still and shook her head sadly as she looked through her tears at the vague distance  why whativer is the matter sister said mrs tulliver she was not an imaginative woman but it occurred to her that the large toiletglass in sister pullets best bedroom was possibly broken for the second time  there was no reply but a further shake of the head as mrs pullet slowly rose and got down from the chaise not without casting a glance at mr pullet to see that he was guarding her handsome silk dress from injury mr pullet was a small man with a high nose small twinkling eyes and thin lips in a freshlooking suit of black and a white cravat that seemed to have been tied very tight on some higher principle than that of mere personal ease he bore about the same relation to his tall goodlooking wife with her balloon sleeves abundant mantle and a large befeathered and beribboned bonnet as a small fishingsmack bears to a brig with all its sails spread  it is a pathetic sight and a striking example of the complexity introduced into the emotions by a high state of civilization the sight of a fashionably dressed female in grief from the sorrow of a hottentot to that of a woman in large buckram sleeves with several bracelets on each arm an architectural bonnet and delicate ribbon strings what a long series of gradations in the enlightened child of civilization the abandonment characteristic of grief is checked and varied in the subtlest manner so as to present an interesting problem to the analytic mind if with a crushed heart and eyes half blinded by the mist of tears she were to walk with a toodevious step through a doorplace she might crush her buckram sleeves too and the deep consciousness of this possibility produces a composition of forces by which she takes a line that just clears the doorpost perceiving that the tears are hurrying fast she unpins her strings and throws them languidly backward a touching gesture indicative even in the deepest gloom of the hope in future dry moments when capstrings will once more have a charm as the tears subside a little and with her head leaning backward at the angle that will not injure her bonnet she endures that terrible moment when grief which has made all things else a weariness has itself become weary she looks down pensively at her bracelets and adjusts their clasps with that pretty studied fortuity which would be gratifying to her mind if it were once more in a calm and healthy state  mrs pullet brushed each doorpost with great nicety about the latitude of her shoulders at that period a woman was truly ridiculous to an instructed eye if she did not measure a yard and a half across the shoulders and having done that sent the muscles of her face in quest of fresh tears as she advanced into the parlor where mrs glegg was seated  well sister youre late whats the matter said mrs glegg rather sharply as they shook hands  mrs pullet sat down lifting up her mantle carefully behind before she answered  shes gone unconsciously using an impressive figure of rhetoric  it isnt the glass this time then thought mrs tulliver  died the day before yesterday continued mrs pullet an her legs was as thick as my body she added with deep sadness after a pause theyd tapped her no end o times and the waterthey say you might ha swum in it if youd liked  well sophy its a mercy shes gone then whoever she may be said mrs glegg with the promptitude and emphasis of a mind naturally clear and decided but i cant think who youre talking of for my part  but i know said mrs pullet sighing and shaking her head and there isnt another such a dropsy in the parish i know as its old mrs sutton o the twentylands  well shes no kin o yours nor much acquaintance as ive ever heared of said mrs glegg who always cried just as much as was proper when anything happened to her own kin but not on other occasions  shes so much acquaintance as ive seen her legs when they was like bladders and an old lady as had doubled her money over and over again and kept it all in her own management to the last and had her pocket with her keys in under her pillow constant there isnt many old parishners like her i doubt  and they say shed took as much physic as ud fill a wagon observed mr pullet  ah sighed mrs pullet shed another complaint ever so many years before she had the dropsy and the doctors couldnt make out what it was and she said to me when i went to see her last christmas she said mrs pullet if ever you have the dropsy youll think o me she did say so added mrs pullet beginning to cry bitterly again those were her very words and shes to be buried o saturday and pullets bid to the funeral  sophy said mrs glegg unable any longer to contain her spirit of rational remonstrancesophy i wonder at you fretting and injuring your health about people as dont belong to you your poor father never did so nor your aunt frances neither nor any o the family as i ever heard of you couldnt fret no more than this if wed heared as our cousin abbott had died sudden without making his will  mrs pullet was silent having to finish her crying and rather flattered than indignant at being upbraided for crying too much it was not everybody who could afford to cry so much about their neighbors who had left them nothing but mrs pullet had married a gentleman farmer and had leisure and money to carry her crying and everything else to the highest pitch of respectability  mrs sutton didnt die without making her will though said mr pullet with a confused sense that he was saying something to sanction his wifes tears ours is a rich parish but they say theres nobody else to leave as many thousands behind em as mrs sutton and shes left no leggicies to speak onleft it all in a lump to her husbands nevvy  there wasnt much good i being so rich then said mrs glegg if shed got none but husbands kin to leave it to its poor work when thats all youve got to pinch yourself for not as im one o those as ud like to die without leaving more money out at interest than other folks had reckoned but its a poor tale when it must go out o your own family  im sure sister said mrs pullet who had recovered sufficiently to take off her veil and fold it carefully its a nice sort o man as mrs sutton has left her money to for hes troubled with the asthmy and goes to bed every night at eight oclock he told me about it himselfas free as could beone sunday when he came to our church he wears a hareskin on his chest and has a trembling in his talkquite a gentleman sort o man i told him there wasnt many months in the year as i wasnt under the doctors hands and he said mrs pullet i can feel for you that was what he saidthe very words ah sighed mrs pullet shaking her head at the idea that there were but few who could enter fully into her experiences in pink mixture and white mixture strong stuff in small bottles and weak stuff in large bottles damp boluses at a shilling and draughts at eighteenpence sister i may as well go and take my bonnet off now did you see as the capbox was put out she added turning to her husband  mr pullet by an unaccountable lapse of memory had forgotten it and hastened out with a stricken conscience to remedy the omission  theyll bring it upstairs sister said mrs tulliver wishing to go at once lest mrs glegg should begin to explain her feelings about sophys being the first dodson who ever ruined her constitution with doctors stuff  mrs tulliver was fond of going upstairs with her sister pullet and looking thoroughly at her cap before she put it on her head and discussing millinery in general this was part of bessys weakness that stirred mrs gleggs sisterly compassion bessy went far too well dressed considering and she was too proud to dress her child in the good clothing her sister glegg gave her from the primeval strata of her wardrobe it was a sin and a shame to buy anything to dress that child if it wasnt a pair of shoes in this particular however mrs glegg did her sister bessy some injustice for mrs tulliver had really made great efforts to induce maggie to wear a leghorn bonnet and a dyed silk frock made out of her aunt gleggs but the results had been such that mrs tulliver was obliged to bury them in her maternal bosom for maggie declaring that the frock smelt of nasty dye had taken an opportunity of basting it together with the roast beef the first sunday she wore it and finding this scheme answer she had subsequently pumped on the bonnet with its green ribbons so as to give it a general resemblance to a sage cheese garnished with withered lettuces i must urge in excuse for maggie that tom had laughed at her in the bonnet and said she looked like an old judy aunt pullet too made presents of clothes but these were always pretty enough to please maggie as well as her mother of all her sisters mrs tulliver certainly preferred her sister pullet not without a return of preference but mrs pullet was sorry bessy had those naughty awkward children she would do the best she could by them but it was a pity they werent as good and as pretty as sister deanes child maggie and tom on their part thought their aunt pullet tolerable chiefly because she was not their aunt glegg tom always declined to go more than once during his holidays to see either of them both his uncles tipped him that once of course but at his aunt pullets there were a great many toads to pelt in the cellararea so that he preferred the visit to her maggie shuddered at the toads and dreamed of them horribly but she liked her uncle pullets musical snuffbox still it was agreed by the sisters in mrs tullivers absence that the tulliver blood did not mix well with the dodson blood that in fact poor bessys children were tullivers and that tom notwithstanding he had the dodson complexion was likely to be as contrairy as his father as for maggie she was the picture of her aunt moss mr tullivers sistera largeboned woman who had married as poorly as could be had no china and had a husband who had much ado to pay his rent but when mrs pullet was alone with mrs tulliver upstairs the remarks were naturally to the disadvantage of mrs glegg and they agreed in confidence that there was no knowing what sort of fright sister jane would come out next but their têteàtête was curtailed by the appearance of mrs deane with little lucy and mrs tulliver had to look on with a silent pang while lucys blond curls were adjusted it was quite unaccountable that mrs deane the thinnest and sallowest of all the miss dodsons should have had this child who might have been taken for mrs tullivers any day and maggie always looked twice as dark as usual when she was by the side of lucy  she did today when she and tom came in from the garden with their father and their uncle glegg maggie had thrown her bonnet off very carelessly and coming in with her hair rough as well as out of curl rushed at once to lucy who was standing by her mothers knee certainly the contrast between the cousins was conspicuous and to superficial eyes was very much to the disadvantage of maggie though a connoisseur might have seen points in her which had a higher promise for maturity than lucys natty completeness it was like the contrast between a rough dark overgrown puppy and a white kitten lucy put up the neatest little rosebud mouth to be kissed everything about her was neather little round neck with the row of coral beads her little straight nose not at all snubby her little clear eyebrows rather darker than her curls to match hazel eyes which looked up with shy pleasure at maggie taller by the head though scarcely a year older maggie always looked at lucy with delight  she was fond of fancying a world where the people never got any larger than children of their own age and she made the queen of it just like lucy with a little crown on her head and a little sceptre in her handonly the queen was maggie herself in lucys form  oh lucy she burst out after kissing her youll stay with tom and me wont you oh kiss her tom  tom too had come up to lucy but he was not going to kiss herno he came up to her with maggie because it seemed easier on the whole than saying how do you do to all those aunts and uncles he stood looking at nothing in particular with the blushing awkward air and semismile which are common to shy boys when in companyvery much as if they had come into the world by mistake and found it in a degree of undress that was quite embarrassing  heyday said aunt glegg with loud emphasis do little boys and gells come into a room without taking notice of their uncles and aunts that wasnt the way when i was a little gell  go and speak to your aunts and uncles my dears said mrs tulliver looking anxious and melancholy she wanted to whisper to maggie a command to go and have her hair brushed  well and how do you do and i hope youre good children are you said aunt glegg in the same loud emphatic way as she took their hands hurting them with her large rings and kissing their cheeks much against their desire look up tom look up boys as go to boardingschools should hold their heads up look at me now tom declined that pleasure apparently for he tried to draw his hand away put your hair behind your ears maggie and keep your frock on your shoulder  aunt glegg always spoke to them in this loud emphatic way as if she considered them deaf or perhaps rather idiotic it was a means she thought of making them feel that they were accountable creatures and might be a salutary check on naughty tendencies bessys children were so spoiledtheyd need have somebody to make them feel their duty  well my dears said aunt pullet in a compassionate voice you grow wonderful fast i doubt theyll outgrow their strength she added looking over their heads with a melancholy expression at their mother i think the gell has too much hair id have it thinned and cut shorter sister if i was you it isnt good for her health its that as makes her skin so brown i shouldnt wonder dont you think so sister deane  i cant say im sure sister said mrs deane shutting her lips close again and looking at maggie with a critical eye  no no said mr tulliver the childs healthy enough theres nothing ails her theres red wheat as well as white for that matter and some like the dark grain best but it ud be as well if bessy ud have the childs hair cut so as it ud lie smooth  a dreadful resolve was gathering in maggies breast but it was arrested by the desire to know from her aunt deane whether she would leave lucy behind aunt deane would hardly ever let lucy come to see them after various reasons for refusal mrs deane appealed to lucy herself  you wouldnt like to stay behind without mother should you lucy  yes please mother said lucy timidly blushing very pink all over her little neck  well done lucy let her stay mrs deane let her stay said mr deane a large but alertlooking man with a type of physique to be seen in all ranks of english societybald crown red whiskers full forehead and general solidity without heaviness you may see noblemen like mr deane and you may see grocers or daylaborers like him but the keenness of his brown eyes was less common than his contour  he held a silver snuffbox very tightly in his hand and now and then exchanged a pinch with mr tulliver whose box was only silvermounted so that it was naturally a joke between them that mr tulliver wanted to exchange snuffboxes also mr deanes box had been given him by the superior partners in the firm to which he belonged at the same time that they gave him a share in the business in acknowledgment of his valuable services as manager no man was thought more highly of in st oggs than mr deane and some persons were even of opinion that miss susan dodson who was once held to have made the worst match of all the dodson sisters might one day ride in a better carriage and live in a better house even than her sister pullet there was no knowing where a man would stop who had got his foot into a great millowning shipowning business like that of guest  co with a banking concern attached and mrs deane as her intimate female friends observed was proud and having enough she wouldnt let her husband stand still in the world for want of spurring  maggie said mrs tulliver beckoning maggie to her and whispering in her ear as soon as this point of lucys staying was settled go and get your hair brushed do for shame i told you not to come in without going to martha first you know i did  tom come out with me whispered maggie pulling his sleeve as she passed him and tom followed willingly enough  come upstairs with me tom she whispered when they were outside the door theres something i want to do before dinner  theres no time to play at anything before dinner said tom whose imagination was impatient of any intermediate prospect  oh yes there is time for this do come tom  tom followed maggie upstairs into her mothers room and saw her go at once to a drawer from which she took out a large pair of scissors  what are they for maggie said tom feeling his curiosity awakened  maggie answered by seizing her front locks and cutting them straight across the middle of her forehead  oh my buttons maggie youll catch it exclaimed tom youd better not cut any more off  snip went the great scissors again while tom was speaking and he couldnt help feeling it was rather good fun maggie would look so queer  here tom cut it behind for me said maggie excited by her own daring and anxious to finish the deed  youll catch it you know said tom nodding his head in an admonitory manner and hesitating a little as he took the scissors  never mind make haste said maggie giving a little stamp with her foot her cheeks were quite flushed  the black locks were so thick nothing could be more tempting to a lad who had already tasted the forbidden pleasure of cutting the ponys mane i speak to those who know the satisfaction of making a pair of scissors meet through a duly resisting mass of hair one delicious grinding snip and then another and another and the hinderlocks fell heavily on the floor and maggie stood cropped in a jagged uneven manner but with a sense of clearness and freedom as if she had emerged from a wood into the open plain  oh maggie said tom jumping round her and slapping his knees as he laughed oh my buttons what a queer thing you look look at yourself in the glass you look like the idiot we throw out nutshells to at school  maggie felt an unexpected pang she had thought beforehand chiefly at her own deliverance from her teasing hair and teasing remarks about it and something also of the triumph she should have over her mother and her aunts by this very decided course of action she didnt want her hair to look prettythat was out of the questionshe only wanted people to think her a clever little girl and not to find fault with her but now when tom began to laugh at her and say she was like an idiot the affair had quite a new aspect she looked in the glass and still tom laughed and clapped his hands and maggies cheeks began to pale and her lips to tremble a little  oh maggie youll have to go down to dinner directly said tom oh my  dont laugh at me tom said maggie in a passionate tone with an outburst of angry tears stamping and giving him a push  now then spitfire said tom what did you cut it off for then i shall go down i can smell the dinner going in  he hurried downstairs and left poor maggie to that bitter sense of the irrevocable which was almost an everyday experience of her small soul she could see clearly enough now the thing was done that it was very foolish and that she should have to hear and think more about her hair than ever for maggie rushed to her deeds with passionate impulse and then saw not only their consequences but what would have happened if they had not been done with all the detail and exaggerated circumstance of an active imagination tom never did the same sort of foolish things as maggie having a wonderful instinctive discernment of what would turn to his advantage or disadvantage and so it happened that though he was much more wilful and inflexible than maggie his mother hardly ever called him naughty but if tom did make a mistake of that sort he espoused it and stood by it he didnt mind if he broke the lash of his fathers gigwhip by lashing the gate he couldnt help itthe whip shouldnt have got caught in the hinge if tom tulliver whipped a gate he was convinced not that the whipping of gates by all boys was a justifiable act but that he tom tulliver was justifiable in whipping that particular gate and he wasnt going to be sorry but maggie as she stood crying before the glass felt it impossible that she should go down to dinner and endure the severe eyes and severe words of her aunts while tom and lucy and martha who waited at table and perhaps her father and her uncles would laugh at her for if tom had laughed at her of course every one else would and if she had only let her hair alone she could have sat with tom and lucy and had the apricot pudding and the custard what could she do but sob she sat as helpless and despairing among her black locks as ajax among the slaughtered sheep very trivial perhaps this anguish seems to weatherworn mortals who have to think of christmas bills dead loves and broken friendships but it was not less bitter to maggieperhaps it was even more bitterthan what we are fond of calling antithetically the real troubles of mature life ah my child you will have real troubles to fret about by and by is the consolation we have almost all of us had administered to us in our childhood and have repeated to other children since we have been grown up we have all of us sobbed so piteously standing with tiny bare legs above our little socks when we lost sight of our mother or nurse in some strange place but we can no longer recall the poignancy of that moment and weep over it as we do over the remembered sufferings of five or ten years ago every one of those keen moments has left its trace and lives in us still but such traces have blent themselves irrecoverably with the firmer texture of our youth and manhood and so it comes that we can look on at the troubles of our children with a smiling disbelief in the reality of their pain is there any one who can recover the experience of his childhood not merely with a memory of what he did and what happened to him of what he liked and disliked when he was in frock and trousers but with an intimate penetration a revived consciousness of what he felt then when it was so long from one midsummer to another what he felt when his school fellows shut him out of their game because he would pitch the ball wrong out of mere wilfulness or on a rainy day in the holidays when he didnt know how to amuse himself and fell from idleness into mischief from mischief into defiance and from defiance into sulkiness or when his mother absolutely refused to let him have a tailed coat that half although every other boy of his age had gone into tails already surely if we could recall that early bitterness and the dim guesses the strangely perspectiveless conception of life that gave the bitterness its intensity we should not poohpooh the griefs of our children  miss maggie youre to come down this minute said kezia entering the room hurriedly lawks what have you been adoing i never see such a fright  dont kezia said maggie angrily go away  but i tell you youre to come down miss this minute your mother says so said kezia going up to maggie and taking her by the hand to raise her from the floor  get away kezia i dont want any dinner said maggie resisting kezias arm i shant come  oh well i cant stay ive got to wait at dinner said kezia going out again  maggie you little silly said tom peeping into the room ten minutes after why dont you come and have your dinner theres lots o goodies and mother says youre to come what are you crying for you little spooney  oh it was dreadful tom was so hard and unconcerned if he had been crying on the floor maggie would have cried too and there was the dinner so nice and she was so hungry it was very bitter  but tom was not altogether hard he was not inclined to cry and did not feel that maggies grief spoiled his prospect of the sweets but he went and put his head near her and said in a lower comforting tone  wont you come then magsie shall i bring you a bit o pudding when ive had mine and a custard and things  yeees said maggie beginning to feel life a little more tolerable  very well said tom going away but he turned again at the door and said but youd better come you know theres the dessertnuts you know and cowslip wine  maggies tears had ceased and she looked reflective as tom left her his good nature had taken off the keenest edge of her suffering and nuts with cowslip wine began to assert their legitimate influence  slowly she rose from amongst her scattered locks and slowly she made her way downstairs then she stood leaning with one shoulder against the frame of the diningparlour door peeping in when it was ajar she saw tom and lucy with an empty chair between them and there were the custards on a sidetable it was too much she slipped in and went toward the empty chair but she had no sooner sat down than she repented and wished herself back again  mrs tulliver gave a little scream as she saw her and felt such a turn that she dropped the large gravyspoon into the dish with the most serious results to the tablecloth for kezia had not betrayed the reason of maggies refusal to come down not liking to give her mistress a shock in the moment of carving and mrs tulliver thought there was nothing worse in question than a fit of perverseness which was inflicting its own punishment by depriving maggie of half her dinner  mrs tullivers scream made all eyes turn towards the same point as her own and maggies cheeks and ears began to burn while uncle glegg a kindlooking whitehaired old gentleman said  heyday what little gells this why i dont know her is it some little gell youve picked up in the road kezia  why shes gone and cut her hair herself said mr tulliver in an undertone to mr deane laughing with much enjoyment did you ever know such a little hussy as it is  why little miss youve made yourself look very funny said uncle pullet and perhaps he never in his life made an observation which was felt to be so lacerating  fie for shame said aunt glegg in her loudest severest tone of reproof little gells as cut their own hair should be whipped and fed on bread and waternot come and sit down with their aunts and uncles  ay ay said uncle glegg meaning to give a playful turn to this denunciation she must be sent to jail i think and theyll cut the rest of her hair off there and make it all even  shes more like a gypsy nor ever said aunt pullet in a pitying tone its very bad luck sister as the gell should be so brown the boys fair enough i doubt itll stand in her way i life to be so brown  shes a naughty child asll break her mothers heart said mrs tulliver with the tears in her eyes  maggie seemed to be listening to a chorus of reproach and derision her first flush came from anger which gave her a transient power of defiance and tom thought she was braving it out supported by the recent appearance of the pudding and custard under this impression he whispered oh my maggie i told you youd catch it he meant to be friendly but maggie felt convinced that tom was rejoicing in her ignominy her feeble power of defiance left her in an instant her heart swelled and getting up from her chair she ran to her father hid her face on his shoulder and burst out into loud sobbing  come come my wench said her father soothingly putting his arm round her never mind you was i the right to cut it off if it plagued you give over crying fatherll take your part  delicious words of tenderness maggie never forgot any of these moments when her father took her part she kept them in her heart and thought of them long years after when every one else said that her father had done very ill by his children  how your husband does spoil that child bessy said mrs glegg in a loud aside to mrs tulliver itll be the ruin of her if you dont take care my father never brought his children up so else we should ha been a different sort o family to what we are  mrs tullivers domestic sorrows seemed at this moment to have reached the point at which insensibility begins she took no notice of her sisters remark but threw back her capstrings and dispensed the pudding in mute resignation  with the dessert there came entire deliverance for maggie for the children were told they might have their nuts and wine in the summerhouse since the day was so mild and they scampered out among the budding bushes of the garden with the alacrity of small animals getting from under a burning glass  mrs tulliver had her special reason for this permission now the dinner was despatched and every ones mind disengaged it was the right moment to communicate mr tullivers intention concerning tom and it would be as well for tom himself to be absent the children were used to hear themselves talked of as freely as if they were birds and could understand nothing however they might stretch their necks and listen but on this occasion mrs tulliver manifested an unusual discretion because she had recently had evidence that the going to school to a clergyman was a sore point with tom who looked at it as very much on a par with going to school to a constable mrs tulliver had a sighing sense that her husband would do as he liked whatever sister glegg said or sister pullet either but at least they would not be able to say if the thing turned out ill that bessy had fallen in with her husbands folly without letting her own friends know a word about it  mr tulliver she said interrupting her husband in his talk with mr deane its time now to tell the childrens aunts and uncles what youre thinking of doing with tom isnt it  very well said mr tulliver rather sharply ive no objections to tell anybody what i mean to do with him ive settled he added looking toward mr glegg and mr deaneive settled to send him to a mr stelling a parson down at kings lorton therean uncommon clever fellow i understand asll put him up to most things  there was a rustling demonstration of surprise in the company such as you may have observed in a country congregation when they hear an allusion to their weekday affairs from the pulpit it was equally astonishing to the aunts and uncles to find a parson introduced into mr tullivers family arrangements as for uncle pullet he could hardly have been more thoroughly obfuscated if mr tulliver had said that he was going to send tom to the lord chancellor for uncle pullet belonged to that extinct class of british yeoman who dressed in good broadcloth paid high rates and taxes went to church and ate a particularly good dinner on sunday without dreaming that the british constitution in church and state had a traceable origin any more than the solar system and the fixed stars  it is melancholy but true that mr pullet had the most confused idea of a bishop as a sort of a baronet who might or might not be a clergyman and as the rector of his own parish was a man of high family and fortune the idea that a clergyman could be a schoolmaster was too remote from mr pullets experience to be readily conceivable i know it is difficult for people in these instructed times to believe in uncle pullets ignorance but let them reflect on the remarkable results of a great natural faculty under favoring circumstances and uncle pullet had a great natural faculty for ignorance he was the first to give utterance to his astonishment  why what can you be going to send him to a parson for he said with an amazed twinkling in his eyes looking at mr glegg and mr deane to see if they showed any signs of comprehension  why because the parsons are the best schoolmasters by what i can make out said poor mr tulliver who in the maze of this puzzling world laid hold of any clue with great readiness and tenacity jacobs at th academys no parson and hes done very bad by the boy and i made up my mind if i send him to school again it should be to somebody different to jacobs and this mr stelling by what i can make out is the sort o man i want and i mean my boy to go to him at midsummer he concluded in a tone of decision tapping his snuffbox and taking a pinch  youll have to pay a swinging halfyearly bill then eh tulliver the clergymen have highish notions in general said mr deane taking snuff vigorously as he always did when wishing to maintain a neutral position  what do you think the parsonll teach him to know a good sample o wheat when he sees it neighbor tulliver said mr glegg who was fond of his jest and having retired from business felt that it was not only allowable but becoming in him to take a playful view of things  why you see ive got a plan i my head about tom said mr tulliver pausing after that statement and lifting up his glass  well if i may be allowed to speak and its seldom as i am said mrs glegg with a tone of bitter meaning i should like to know what good is to come to the boy by bringin him up above his fortin  why said mr tulliver not looking at mrs glegg but at the male part of his audience you see ive made up my mind not to bring tom up to my own business ive had my thoughts about it all along and i made up my mind by what i saw with garnett and his son i mean to put him to some business as he can go into without capital and i want to give him an eddication as hell be even wi the lawyers and folks and put me up to a notion now an then  mrs glegg emitted a long sort of guttural sound with closed lips that smiled in mingled pity and scorn  it ud be a fine deal better for some people she said after that introductory note if theyd let the lawyers alone  is he at the head of a grammar school then this clergyman such as that at market bewley said mr deane  no nothing of that said mr tulliver he wont take more than two or three pupils and so hell have the more time to attend to em you know  ah and get his eddication done the sooner they cant learn much at a time when theres so many of em said uncle pullet feeling that he was getting quite an insight into this difficult matter  but hell want the more pay i doubt said mr glegg  ay ay a cool hundred a year thats all said mr tulliver with some pride at his own spirited course but then you know its an investment toms eddication ull be so much capital to him  ay theres something in that said mr glegg well well neighbor tulliver you may be right you may be right    when land is gone and moneys spent   then learning is most excellent  i remember seeing those two lines wrote on a window at buxton but us that have got no learning had better keep our money eh neighbor pullet mr glegg rubbed his knees and looked very pleasant  mr glegg i wonder at you said his wife its very unbecoming in a man o your age and belongings  whats unbecoming mrs g said mr glegg winking pleasantly at the company my new blue coat as ive got on  i pity your weakness mr glegg i say its unbecoming to be making a joke when you see your own kin going headlongs to ruin  if you mean me by that said mr tulliver considerably nettled you neednt trouble yourself to fret about me i can manage my own affairs without troubling other folks  bless me said mr deane judiciously introducing a new idea why now i come to think of it somebody said wakem was going to send his sonthe deformed ladto a clergyman didnt they susan appealing to his wife  i can give no account of it im sure said mrs deane closing her lips very tightly again mrs deane was not a woman to take part in a scene where missiles were flying  well said mr tulliver speaking all the more cheerfully that mrs glegg might see he didnt mind her if wakem thinks o sending his son to a clergyman depend on it i shall make no mistake i sending tom to one wakems as big a scoundrel as old harry ever made but he knows the length of every mans foot hes got to deal with ay ay tell me whos wakems butcher and ill tell you where to get your meat  but lawyer wakems sons got a humpback said mrs pullet who felt as if the whole business had a funereal aspect its more natral to send him to a clergyman  yes said mr glegg interpreting mrs pullets observation with erroneous plausibility you must consider that neighbor tulliver wakems son isnt likely to follow any business wakem ull make a gentleman of him poor fellow  mr glegg said mrs g in a tone which implied that her indignation would fizz and ooze a little though she was determined to keep it corked up youd far better hold your tongue mr tulliver doesnt want to know your opinion nor mine either theres folks in the world as know better than everybody else  why i should think thats you if were to trust your own tale said mr tulliver beginning to boil up again  oh i say nothing said mrs glegg sarcastically my advice has never been asked and i dont give it  itll be the first time then said mr tulliver its the only thing youre overready at giving  ive been overready at lending then if i havent been overready at giving said mrs glegg theres folks ive lent money to as perhaps i shall repent o lending money to kin  come come come said mr glegg soothingly but mr tulliver was not to be hindered of his retort  youve got a bond for it i reckon he said and youve had your five per cent kin or no kin  sister said mrs tulliver pleadingly drink your wine and let me give you some almonds and raisins  bessy im sorry for you said mrs glegg very much with the feeling of a cur that seizes the opportunity of diverting his bark toward the man who carries no stick its poor work talking o almonds and raisins  lors sister glegg dont be so quarrelsome said mrs pullet beginning to cry a little you may be struck with a fit getting so red in the face after dinner and we are but just out o mourning all of usand all wi gowns craped alike and just put by its very bad among sisters  i should think it is bad said mrs glegg things are come to a fine pass when one sister invites the other to her house o purpose to quarrel with her and abuse her  softly softly jane be reasonable be reasonable said mr glegg  but while he was speaking mr tulliver who had by no means said enough to satisfy his anger burst out again  who wants to quarrel with you he said its you as cant let people alone but must be gnawing at em forever i should never want to quarrel with any woman if she kept her place  my place indeed said mrs glegg getting rather more shrill theres your betters mr tulliver as are dead and in their grave treated me with a different sort o respect to what you do though ive got a husband asll sit by and see me abused by them as ud never ha had the chance if there hadnt been them in our family as married worse than they might ha done  if you talk o that said mr tulliver my familys as good as yours and better for it hasnt got a damned illtempered woman in it  well said mrs glegg rising from her chair i dont know whether you think its a fine thing to sit by and hear me swore at mr glegg but im not going to stay a minute longer in this house you can stay behind and come home with the gig and ill walk home  dear heart dear heart said mr glegg in a melancholy tone as he followed his wife out of the room  mr tulliver how could you talk so said mrs tulliver with the tears in her eyes  let her go said mr tulliver too hot to be damped by any amount of tears let her go and the sooner the better she wont be trying to domineer over me again in a hurry  sister pullet said mrs tulliver helplessly do you think it ud be any use for you to go after her and try to pacify her  better not better not said mr deane youll make it up another day  then sisters shall we go and look at the children said mrs tulliver drying her eyes  no proposition could have been more seasonable mr tulliver felt very much as if the air had been cleared of obtrusive flies now the women were out of the room there were few things he liked better than a chat with mr deane whose close application to business allowed the pleasure very rarely mr deane he considered was the knowingest man of his acquaintance and he had besides a ready causticity of tongue that made an agreeable supplement to mr tullivers own tendency that way which had remained in rather an inarticulate condition and now the women were gone they could carry on their serious talk without frivolous interruption they could exchange their views concerning the duke of wellington whose conduct in the catholic question had thrown such an entirely new light on his character and speak slightingly of his conduct at the battle of waterloo which he would never have won if there hadnt been a great many englishmen at his back not to speak of blucher and the prussians who as mr tulliver had heard from a person of particular knowledge in that matter had come up in the very nick of time though here there was a slight dissidence mr deane remarking that he was not disposed to give much credit to the prussiansthe build of their vessels together with the unsatisfactory character of transactions in dantzic beer inclining him to form rather a low view of prussian pluck generally rather beaten on this ground mr tulliver proceeded to express his fears that the country could never again be what it used to be but mr deane attached to a firm of which the returns were on the increase naturally took a more lively view of the present and had some details to give concerning the state of the imports especially in hides and spelter which soothed mr tullivers imagination by throwing into more distant perspective the period when the country would become utterly the prey of papists and radicals and there would be no more chance for honest men  uncle pullet sat by and listened with twinkling eyes to these high matters he didnt understand politics himselfthought they were a natural giftbut by what he could make out this duke of wellington was no better than he should be    chapter viii  mr tulliver shows his weaker side   suppose sister glegg should call her money in it ud be very awkward for you to have to raise five hundred pounds now said mrs tulliver to her husband that evening as she took a plaintive review of the day  mrs tulliver had lived thirteen years with her husband yet she retained in all the freshness of her early married life a facility of saying things which drove him in the opposite direction to the one she desired some minds are wonderful for keeping their bloom in this way as a patriarchal goldfish apparently retains to the last its youthful illusion that it can swim in a straight line beyond the encircling glass mrs tulliver was an amiable fish of this kind and after running her head against the same resisting medium for thirteen years would go at it again today with undulled alacrity  this observation of hers tended directly to convince mr tulliver that it would not be at all awkward for him to raise five hundred pounds and when mrs tulliver became rather pressing to know how he would raise it without mortgaging the mill and the house which he had said he never would mortgage since nowadays people were none so ready to lend money without security mr tulliver getting warm declared that mrs glegg might do as she liked about calling in her money he should pay it in whether or not he was not going to be beholden to his wifes sisters when a man had married into a family where there was a whole litter of women he might have plenty to put up with if he chose but mr tulliver did not choose  mrs tulliver cried a little in a trickling quiet way as she put on her nightcap but presently sank into a comfortable sleep lulled by the thought that she would talk everything over with her sister pullet tomorrow when she was to take the children to garum firs to tea not that she looked forward to any distinct issue from that talk but it seemed impossible that past events should be so obstinate as to remain unmodified when they were complained against  her husband lay awake rather longer for he too was thinking of a visit he would pay on the morrow and his ideas on the subject were not of so vague and soothing a kind as those of his amiable partner  mr tulliver when under the influence of a strong feeling had a promptitude in action that may seem inconsistent with that painful sense of the complicated puzzling nature of human affairs under which his more dispassionate deliberations were conducted but it is really not improbable that there was a direct relation between these apparently contradictory phenomena since i have observed that for getting a strong impression that a skein is tangled there is nothing like snatching hastily at a single thread it was owing to this promptitude that mr tulliver was on horseback soon after dinner the next day he was not dyspeptic on his way to basset to see his sister moss and her husband for having made up his mind irrevocably that he would pay mrs glegg her loan of five hundred pounds it naturally occurred to him that he had a promissory note for three hundred pounds lent to his brotherinlaw moss and if the said brotherinlaw could manage to pay in the money within a given time it would go far to lessen the fallacious air of inconvenience which mr tullivers spirited step might have worn in the eyes of weak people who require to know precisely how a thing is to be done before they are strongly confident that it will be easy  for mr tulliver was in a position neither new nor striking but like other everyday things sure to have a cumulative effect that will be felt in the long run he was held to be a much more substantial man than he really was and as we are all apt to believe what the world believes about us it was his habit to think of failure and ruin with the same sort of remote pity with which a spare longnecked man hears that his plethoric shortnecked neighbor is stricken with apoplexy he had been always used to hear pleasant jokes about his advantages as a man who worked his own mill and owned a pretty bit of land and these jokes naturally kept up his sense that he was a man of considerable substance they gave a pleasant flavor to his glass on a marketday and if it had not been for the recurrence of halfyearly payments mr tulliver would really have forgotten that there was a mortgage of two thousand pounds on his very desirable freehold that was not altogether his own fault since one of the thousand pounds was his sisters fortune which he had to pay on her marriage and a man who has neighbors that will go to law with him is not likely to pay off his mortgages especially if he enjoys the good opinion of acquaintances who want to borrow a hundred pounds on security too lofty to be represented by parchment our friend mr tulliver had a goodnatured fibre in him and did not like to give harsh refusals even to his sister who had not only come in to the world in that superfluous way characteristic of sisters creating a necessity for mortgages but had quite thrown herself away in marriage and had crowned her mistakes by having an eighth baby on this point mr tulliver was conscious of being a little weak but he apologized to himself by saying that poor gritty had been a goodlooking wench before she married moss he would sometimes say this even with a slight tremulousness in his voice but this morning he was in a mood more becoming a man of business and in the course of his ride along the basset lanes with their deep rutslying so far away from a markettown that the labor of drawing produce and manure was enough to take away the best part of the profits on such poor land as that parish was made ofhe got up a due amount of irritation against moss as a man without capital who if murrain and blight were abroad was sure to have his share of them and who the more you tried to help him out of the mud would sink the further in it would do him good rather than harm now if he were obliged to raise this three hundred pounds it would make him look about him better and not act so foolishly about his wool this year as he did the last in fact mr tulliver had been too easy with his brotherinlaw and because he had let the interest run on for two years moss was likely enough to think that he should never be troubled about the principal but mr tulliver was determined not to encourage such shuffling people any longer and a ride along the basset lanes was not likely to enervate a mans resolution by softening his temper the deeptrodden hoofmarks made in the muddiest days of winter gave him a shake now and then which suggested a rash but stimulating snarl at the father of lawyers who whether by means of his hoof or otherwise had doubtless something to do with this state of the roads and the abundance of foul land and neglected fences that met his eye though they made no part of his brother mosss farm strongly contributed to his dissatisfaction with that unlucky agriculturist if this wasnt mosss fallow it might have been basset was all alike it was a beggarly parish in mr tullivers opinion and his opinion was certainly not groundless basset had a poor soil poor roads a poor nonresident landlord a poor nonresident vicar and rather less than half a curate also poor if any one strongly impressed with the power of the human mind to triumph over circumstances will contend that the parishioners of basset might nevertheless have been a very superior class of people i have nothing to urge against that abstract proposition i only know that in point of fact the basset mind was in strict keeping with its circumstances the muddy lanes green or clayey that seemed to the unaccustomed eye to lead nowhere but into each other did really lead with patience to a distant highroad but there were many feet in basset which they led more frequently to a centre of dissipation spoken of formerly as the markis o granby but among intimates as dickisons a large low room with a sanded floor a cold scent of tobacco modified by undetected beerdregs mr dickison leaning against the doorpost with a melancholy pimpled face looking as irrelevant to the daylight as a last nights guttered candleall this may not seem a very seductive form of temptation but the majority of men in basset found it fatally alluring when encountered on their road toward four oclock on a wintry afternoon and if any wife in basset wished to indicate that her husband was not a pleasureseeking man she could hardly do it more emphatically than by saying that he didnt spend a shilling at dickisons from one whitsuntide to another mrs moss had said so of her husband more than once when her brother was in a mood to find fault with him as he certainly was today and nothing could be less pacifying to mr tulliver than the behavior of the farmyard gate which he no sooner attempted to push open with his ridingstick than it acted as gates without the upper hinge are known to do to the peril of shins whether equine or human he was about to get down and lead his horse through the damp dirt of the hollow farmyard shadowed drearily by the large halftimbered buildings up to the long line of tumbledown dwellinghouses standing on a raised causeway but the timely appearance of a cowboy saved him that frustration of a plan he had determined onnamely not to get down from his horse during this visit if a man means to be hard let him keep in his saddle and speak from that height above the level of pleading eyes and with the command of a distant horizon mrs moss heard the sound of the horses feet and when her brother rode up was already outside the kitchen door with a halfweary smile on her face and a blackeyed baby in her arms mrs mosss face bore a faded resemblance to her brothers babys little fat hand pressed against her cheek seemed to show more strikingly that the cheek was faded  brother im glad to see you she said in an affectionate tone i didnt look for you today how do you do  oh pretty well mrs moss pretty well answered the brother with cool deliberation as if it were rather too forward of her to ask that question she knew at once that her brother was not in a good humor he never called her mrs moss except when he was angry and when they were in company but she thought it was in the order of nature that people who were poorly off should be snubbed mrs moss did not take her stand on the equality of the human race she was a patient prolific lovinghearted woman  your husband isnt in the house i suppose added mr tulliver after a grave pause during which four children had run out like chickens whose mother has been suddenly in eclipse behind the hencoop  no said mrs moss but hes only in the potatofield yonders georgy run to the far close in a minute and tell father your uncles come youll get down brother wont you and take something  no no i cant get down i must be going home again directly said mr tulliver looking at the distance  and hows mrs tulliver and the children said mrs moss humbly not daring to press her invitation  oh pretty well toms going to a new school at midsummera deal of expense to me its bad work for me lying out o my money  i wish youd be so good as let the children come and see their cousins some day my little uns want to see their cousin maggie so as never was and me her godmother and so fond of her theres nobody ud make a bigger fuss with her according to what theyve got and i know she likes to come for shes a loving child and how quick and clever she is to be sure  if mrs moss had been one of the most astute women in the world instead of being one of the simplest she could have thought of nothing more likely to propitiate her brother than this praise of maggie he seldom found any one volunteering praise of the little wench it was usually left entirely to himself to insist on her merits but maggie always appeared in the most amiable light at her aunt mosss it was her alsatia where she was out of the reach of lawif she upset anything dirtied her shoes or tore her frock these things were matters of course at her aunt mosss in spite of himself mr tullivers eyes got milder and he did not look away from his sister as he said  ay shes fonder o you than o the other aunts i think she takes after our family not a bit of her mothers in her  moss says shes just like what i used to be said mrs moss though i was never so quick and fond o the books but i think my lizzys like her shes sharp come here lizzy my dear and let your uncle see you he hardly knows you you grow so fast  lizzy a blackeyed child of seven looked very shy when her mother drew her forward for the small mosses were much in awe of their uncle from dorlcote mill she was inferior enough to maggie in fire and strength of expression to make the resemblance between the two entirely flattering to mr tullivers fatherly love  ay theyre a bit alike he said looking kindly at the little figure in the soiled pinafore they both take after our mother youve got enough o gells gritty he added in a tone half compassionate half reproachful  four of em bless em said mrs moss with a sigh stroking lizzys hair on each side of her forehead as many as theres boys theyve got a brother apiece  ah but they must turn out and fend for themselves said mr tulliver feeling that his severity was relaxing and trying to brace it by throwing out a wholesome hint they mustnt look to hanging on their brothers  no but i hope their brothers ull love the poor things and remember they came o one father and mother the lads ull never be the poorer for that said mrs moss flashing out with hurried timidity like a halfsmothered fire  mr tulliver gave his horse a little stroke on the flank then checked it and said angrily stand still with you much to the astonishment of that innocent animal  and the more there is of em the more they must love one another mrs moss went on looking at her children with a didactic purpose but she turned toward her brother again to say not but what i hope your boy ull allays be good to his sister though theres but two of em like you and me brother  the arrow went straight to mr tullivers heart he had not a rapid imagination but the thought of maggie was very near to him and he was not long in seeing his relation to his own sister side by side with toms relation to maggie would the little wench ever be poorly off and tom rather hard upon her  ay ay gritty said the miller with a new softness in his tone but ive allays done what i could for you he added as if vindicating himself from a reproach  im not denying that brother and im noways ungrateful said poor mrs moss too fagged by toil and children to have strength left for any pride but heres the father what a while youve been moss  while do you call it said mr moss feeling out of breath and injured ive been running all the way wont you light mr tulliver  well ill just get down and have a bit o talk with you in the garden said mr tulliver thinking that he should be more likely to show a due spirit of resolve if his sister were not present  he got down and passed with mr moss into the garden toward an old yewtree arbor while his sister stood tapping her baby on the back and looking wistfully after them  their entrance into the yewtree arbor surprised several fowls that were recreating themselves by scratching deep holes in the dusty ground and at once took flight with much pother and cackling mr tulliver sat down on the bench and tapping the ground curiously here and there with his stick as if he suspected some hollowness opened the conversation by observing with something like a snarl in his tone  why youve got wheat again in that corner close i see and never a bit o dressing on it youll do no good with it this year  mr moss who when he married miss tulliver had been regarded as the buck of basset now wore a beard nearly a week old and had the depressed unexpectant air of a machinehorse he answered in a patientgrumbling tone why poor farmers like me must do as they can they must leave it to them as have got money to play with to put half as much into the ground as they mean to get out of it  i dont know who should have money to play with if it isnt them as can borrow money without paying interest said mr tulliver who wished to get into a slight quarrel it was the most natural and easy introduction to calling in money  i know im behind with the interest said mr moss but i was so unlucky wi the wool last year and what with the missis being laid up so things have gone awkarder nor usual  ay snarled mr tulliver theres folks as things ull allays go awkard with empty sacks ull never stand upright  well i dont know what fault youve got to find wi me mr tulliver said mr moss deprecatingly i know there isnt a daylaborer works harder  whats the use o that said mr tulliver sharply when a man marries ands got no capital to work his farm but his wifes bit o fortin i was against it from the first but youd neither of you listen to me and i cant lie out o my money any longer for ive got to pay five hundred o mrs gleggs and therell be tom an expense to me i should find myself short even saying id got back all as is my own you must look about and see how you can pay me the three hundred pound  well if thats what you mean said mr moss looking blankly before him wed better be sold up and ha done with it i must part wi every head o stock ive got to pay you and the landlord too  poor relations are undeniably irritatingtheir existence is so entirely uncalled for on our part and they are almost always very faulty people mr tulliver had succeeded in getting quite as much irritated with mr moss as he had desired and he was able to say angrily rising from his seat  well you must do as you can i cant find money for everybody else as well as myself i must look to my own business and my own family i cant lie out o my money any longer you must raise it as quick as you can  mr tulliver walked abruptly out of the arbor as he uttered the last sentence and without looking round at mr moss went on to the kitchen door where the eldest boy was holding his horse and his sister was waiting in a state of wondering alarm which was not without its alleviations for baby was making pleasant gurgling sounds and performing a great deal of finger practice on the faded face mrs moss had eight children but could never overcome her regret that the twins had not lived mr moss thought their removal was not without its consolations wont you come in brother she said looking anxiously at her husband who was walking slowly up while mr tulliver had his foot already in the stirrup  no no goodby said he turning his horses head and riding away  no man could feel more resolute till he got outside the yard gate and a little way along the deeprutted lane but before he reached the next turning which would take him out of sight of the dilapidated farmbuildings he appeared to be smitten by some sudden thought he checked his horse and made it stand still in the same spot for two or three minutes during which he turned his head from side to side in a melancholy way as if he were looking at some painful object on more sides than one evidently after his fit of promptitude mr tulliver was relapsing into the sense that this is a puzzling world he turned his horse and rode slowly back giving vent to the climax of feeling which had determined this movement by saying aloud as he struck his horse poor little wench shell have nobody but tom belike when im gone  mr tullivers return into the yard was descried by several young mosses who immediately ran in with the exciting news to their mother so that mrs moss was again on the doorstep when her brother rode up she had been crying but was rocking baby to sleep in her arms now and made no ostentatious show of sorrow as her brother looked at her but merely said  the fathers gone to the field again if you want him brother  no gritty no said mr tulliver in a gentle tone dont you fretthats allill make a shift without the money a bit only you must be as clever and contriving as you can  mrs mosss tears came again at this unexpected kindness and she could say nothing  come comethe little wench shall come and see you ill bring her and tom some day before he goes to school you mustnt fret ill allays be a good brother to you  thank you for that word brother said mrs moss drying her tears then turning to lizzy she said run now and fetch the colored egg for cousin maggie lizzy ran in and quickly reappeared with a small paper parcel  its boiled hard brother and colored with thrums very pretty it was done o purpose for maggie will you please to carry it in your pocket  ay ay said mr tulliver putting it carefully in his side pocket goodby  and so the respectable miller returned along the basset lanes rather more puzzled than before as to ways and means but still with the sense of a danger escaped it had come across his mind that if he were hard upon his sister it might somehow tend to make tom hard upon maggie at some distant day when her father was no longer there to take her part for simple people like our friend mr tulliver are apt to clothe unimpeachable feelings in erroneous ideas and this was his confused way of explaining to himself that his love and anxiety for the little wench had given him a new sensibility toward his sister    chapter ix  to garum firs   while the possible troubles of maggies future were occupying her fathers mind she herself was tasting only the bitterness of the present childhood has no forebodings but then it is soothed by no memories of outlived sorrow  the fact was the day had begun ill with maggie the pleasure of having lucy to look at and the prospect of the afternoon visit to garum firs where she would hear uncle pullets musical box had been marred as early as eleven oclock by the advent of the hairdresser from st oggs who had spoken in the severest terms of the condition in which he had found her hair holding up one jagged lock after another and saying see here tut tut tut in a tone of mingled disgust and pity which to maggies imagination was equivalent to the strongest expression of public opinion mr rappit the hairdresser with his wellanointed coronal locks tending wavily upward like the simulated pyramid of flame on a monumental urn seemed to her at that moment the most formidable of her contemporaries into whose street at st oggs she would carefully refrain from entering through the rest of her life  moreover the preparation for a visit being always a serious affair in the dodson family martha was enjoined to have mrs tullivers room ready an hour earlier than usual that the laying out of the best clothes might not be deferred till the last moment as was sometimes the case in families of lax views where the ribbonstrings were never rolled up where there was little or no wrapping in silver paper and where the sense that the sunday clothes could be got at quite easily produced no shock to the mind already at twelve oclock mrs tulliver had on her visiting costume with a protective apparatus of brown holland as if she had been a piece of satin furniture in danger of flies maggie was frowning and twisting her shoulders that she might if possible shrink away from the prickliest of tuckers while her mother was remonstrating dont maggie my dear dont make yourself so ugly and toms cheeks were looking particularly brilliant as a relief to his best blue suit which he wore with becoming calmness having after a little wrangling effected what was always the one point of interest to him in his toilet he had transferred all the contents of his everyday pockets to those actually in wear  as for lucy she was just as pretty and neat as she had been yesterday no accidents ever happened to her clothes and she was never uncomfortable in them so that she looked with wondering pity at maggie pouting and writhing under the exasperating tucker maggie would certainly have torn it off if she had not been checked by the remembrance of her recent humiliation about her hair as it was she confined herself to fretting and twisting and behaving peevishly about the cardhouses which they were allowed to build till dinner as a suitable amusement for boys and girls in their best clothes tom could build perfect pyramids of houses but maggies would never bear the laying on the roof it was always so with the things that maggie made and tom had deduced the conclusion that no girls could ever make anything but it happened that lucy proved wonderfully clever at building she handled the cards so lightly and moved so gently that tom condescended to admire her houses as well as his own the more readily because she had asked him to teach her maggie too would have admired lucys houses and would have given up her own unsuccessful building to contemplate them without ill temper if her tucker had not made her peevish and if tom had not inconsiderately laughed when her houses fell and told her she was a stupid  dont laugh at me tom she burst out angrily im not a stupid i know a great many things you dont  oh i dare say miss spitfire id never be such a cross thing as you making faces like that lucy doesnt do so i like lucy better than you i wish lucy was my sister  then its very wicked and cruel of you to wish so said maggie starting up hurriedly from her place on the floor and upsetting toms wonderful pagoda she really did not mean it but the circumstantial evidence was against her and tom turned white with anger but said nothing he would have struck her only he knew it was cowardly to strike a girl and tom tulliver was quite determined he would never do anything cowardly  maggie stood in dismay and terror while tom got up from the floor and walked away pale from the scattered ruins of his pagoda and lucy looked on mutely like a kitten pausing from its lapping  oh tom said maggie at last going halfway toward him i didnt mean to knock it down indeed indeed i didnt  tom took no notice of her but took instead two or three hard peas out of his pocket and shot them with his thumbnail against the window vaguely at first but presently with the distinct aim of hitting a superannuated bluebottle which was exposing its imbecility in the spring sunshine clearly against the views of nature who had provided tom and the peas for the speedy destruction of this weak individual  thus the morning had been made heavy to maggie and toms persistent coldness to her all through their walk spoiled the fresh air and sunshine for her he called lucy to look at the halfbuilt birds nest without caring to show it maggie and peeled a willow switch for lucy and himself without offering one to maggie lucy had said maggie shouldnt you like one but tom was deaf  still the sight of the peacock opportunely spreading his tail on the stackyard wall just as they reached garum firs was enough to divert the mind temporarily from personal grievances and this was only the beginning of beautiful sights at garum firs all the farmyard life was wonderful therebantams speckled and topknotted friesland hens with their feathers all turned the wrong way guineafowls that flew and screamed and dropped their pretty spotted feathers pouterpigeons and a tame magpie nay a goat and a wonderful brindled dog half mastiff half bulldog as large as a lion then there were white railings and white gates all about and glittering weathercocks of various design and gardenwalks paved with pebbles in beautiful patternsnothing was quite common at garum firs and tom thought that the unusual size of the toads there was simply due to the general unusualness which characterized uncle pullets possessions as a gentleman farmer toads who paid rent were naturally leaner as for the house it was not less remarkable it had a receding centre and two wings with battlemented turrets and was covered with glittering white stucco  uncle pullet had seen the expected party approaching from the window and made haste to unbar and unchain the front door kept always in this fortified condition from fear of tramps who might be supposed to know of the glass case of stuffed birds in the hall and to contemplate rushing in and carrying it away on their heads aunt pullet too appeared at the doorway and as soon as her sister was within hearing said stop the children for gods sake bessy dont let em come up the doorsteps sallys bringing the old mat and the duster to rub their shoes  mrs pullets frontdoor mats were by no means intended to wipe shoes on the very scraper had a deputy to do its dirty work tom rebelled particularly against this shoewiping which he always considered in the light of an indignity to his sex he felt it as the beginning of the disagreeables incident to a visit at aunt pullets where he had once been compelled to sit with towels wrapped round his boots a fact which may serve to correct the toohasty conclusion that a visit to garum firs must have been a great treat to a young gentleman fond of animalsfond that is of throwing stones at them  the next disagreeable was confined to his feminine companions it was the mounting of the polished oak stairs which had very handsome carpets rolled up and laid by in a spare bedroom so that the ascent of these glossy steps might have served in barbarous times as a trial by ordeal from which none but the most spotless virtue could have come off with unbroken limbs sophys weakness about these polished stairs was always a subject of bitter remonstrance on mrs gleggs part but mrs tulliver ventured on no comment only thinking to herself it was a mercy when she and the children were safe on the landing  mrs gray has sent home my new bonnet bessy said mrs pullet in a pathetic tone as mrs tulliver adjusted her cap  has she sister said mrs tulliver with an air of much interest and how do you like it  its apt to make a mess with clothes taking em out and putting em in again said mrs pullet drawing a bunch of keys from her pocket and looking at them earnestly but it ud be a pity for you to go away without seeing it theres no knowing what may happen  mrs pullet shook her head slowly at this last serious consideration which determined her to single out a particular key  im afraid itll be troublesome to you getting it out sister said mrs tulliver but i should like to see what sort of a crown shes made you  mrs pullet rose with a melancholy air and unlocked one wing of a very bright wardrobe where you may have hastily supposed she would find a new bonnet not at all such a supposition could only have arisen from a toosuperficial acquaintance with the habits of the dodson family in this wardrobe mrs pullet was seeking something small enough to be hidden among layers of linenit was a doorkey  you must come with me into the best room said mrs pullet  may the children come too sister inquired mrs tulliver who saw that maggie and lucy were looking rather eager  well said aunt pullet reflectively itll perhaps be safer for em to come theyll be touching something if we leave em behind  so they went in procession along the bright and slippery corridor dimly lighted by the semilunar top of the window which rose above the closed shutter it was really quite solemn aunt pullet paused and unlocked a door which opened on something still more solemn than the passagea darkened room in which the outer light entering feebly showed what looked like the corpses of furniture in white shrouds everything that was not shrouded stood with its legs upward lucy laid hold of maggies frock and maggies heart beat rapidly  aunt pullet halfopened the shutter and then unlocked the wardrobe with a melancholy deliberateness which was quite in keeping with the funereal solemnity of the scene the delicious scent of roseleaves that issued from the wardrobe made the process of taking out sheet after sheet of silver paper quite pleasant to assist at though the sight of the bonnet at last was an anticlimax to maggie who would have preferred something more strikingly preternatural but few things could have been more impressive to mrs tulliver she looked all round it in silence for some moments and then said emphatically well sister ill never speak against the full crowns again  it was a great concession and mrs pullet felt it she felt something was due to it  youd like to see it on sister she said sadly ill open the shutter a bit further  well if you dont mind taking off your cap sister said mrs tulliver  mrs pullet took off her cap displaying the brown silk scalp with a jutting promontory of curls which was common to the more mature and judicious women of those times and placing the bonnet on her head turned slowly round like a drapers layfigure that mrs tulliver might miss no point of view  ive sometimes thought theres a loop too much o ribbon on this left side sister what do you think said mrs pullet  mrs tulliver looked earnestly at the point indicated and turned her head on one side well i think its best as it is if you meddled with it sister you might repent  thats true said aunt pullet taking off the bonnet and looking at it contemplatively  how much might she charge you for that bonnet sister said mrs tulliver whose mind was actively engaged on the possibility of getting a humble imitation of this chefdœuvre made from a piece of silk she had at home  mrs pullet screwed up her mouth and shook her head and then whispered pullet pays for it he said i was to have the best bonnet at garum church let the next best be whose it would  she began slowly to adjust the trimmings in preparation for returning it to its place in the wardrobe and her thoughts seemed to have taken a melancholy turn for she shook her head  ah she said at last i may never wear it twice sister who knows  dont talk o that sister answered mrs tulliver i hope youll have your health this summer  ah but there may come a death in the family as there did soon after i had my green satin bonnet cousin abbott may go and we cant think o wearing crape less nor half a year for him  that would be unlucky said mrs tulliver entering thoroughly into the possibility of an inopportune decease theres never so much pleasure i wearing a bonnet the second year especially when the crowns are so chancynever two summers alike  ah its the way i this world said mrs pullet returning the bonnet to the wardrobe and locking it up she maintained a silence characterized by headshaking until they had all issued from the solemn chamber and were in her own room again then beginning to cry she said sister if you should never see that bonnet again till im dead and gone youll remember i showed it you this day  mrs tulliver felt that she ought to be affected but she was a woman of sparse tears stout and healthy she couldnt cry so much as her sister pullet did and had often felt her deficiency at funerals her effort to bring tears into her eyes issued in an odd contraction of her face maggie looking on attentively felt that there was some painful mystery about her aunts bonnet which she was considered too young to understand indignantly conscious all the while that she could have understood that as well as everything else if she had been taken into confidence  when they went down uncle pullet observed with some acumen that he reckoned the missis had been showing her bonnetthat was what had made them so long upstairs with tom the interval had seemed still longer for he had been seated in irksome constraint on the edge of a sofa directly opposite his uncle pullet who regarded him with twinkling gray eyes and occasionally addressed him as young sir  well young sir what do you learn at school was a standing question with uncle pullet whereupon tom always looked sheepish rubbed his hands across his face and answered i dont know it was altogether so embarrassing to be seated têteàtête with uncle pullet that tom could not even look at the prints on the walls or the flycages or the wonderful flowerpots he saw nothing but his uncles gaiters not that tom was in awe of his uncles mental superiority indeed he had made up his mind that he didnt want to be a gentleman farmer because he shouldnt like to be such a thinlegged silly fellow as his uncle pulleta mollycoddle in fact a boys sheepishness is by no means a sign of overmastering reverence and while you are making encouraging advances to him under the idea that he is overwhelmed by a sense of your age and wisdom ten to one he is thinking you extremely queer the only consolation i can suggest to you is that the greek boys probably thought the same of aristotle it is only when you have mastered a restive horse or thrashed a drayman or have got a gun in your hand that these shy juniors feel you to be a truly admirable and enviable character at least i am quite sure of tom tullivers sentiments on these points in very tender years when he still wore a lace border under his outdoor cap he was often observed peeping through the bars of a gate and making minatory gestures with his small forefinger while he scolded the sheep with an inarticulate burr intended to strike terror into their astonished minds indicating thus early that desire for mastery over the inferior animals wild and domestic including cockchafers neighbors dogs and small sisters which in all ages has been an attribute of so much promise for the fortunes of our race now mr pullet never rode anything taller than a low pony and was the least predatory of men considering firearms dangerous as apt to go off of themselves by nobodys particular desire so that tom was not without strong reasons when in confidential talk with a chum he had described uncle pullet as a nincompoop taking care at the same time to observe that he was a very rich fellow  the only alleviating circumstance in a têteàtête with uncle pullet was that he kept a variety of lozenges and peppermintdrops about his person and when at a loss for conversation he filled up the void by proposing a mutual solace of this kind  do you like peppermints young sir required only a tacit answer when it was accompanied by a presentation of the article in question  the appearance of the little girls suggested to uncle pullet the further solace of small sweetcakes of which he also kept a stock under lock and key for his own private eating on wet days but the three children had no sooner got the tempting delicacy between their fingers than aunt pullet desired them to abstain from eating it till the tray and the plates came since with those crisp cakes they would make the floor all over crumbs lucy didnt mind that much for the cake was so pretty she thought it was rather a pity to eat it but tom watching his opportunity while the elders were talking hastily stowed it in his mouth at two bites and chewed it furtively as for maggie becoming fascinated as usual by a print of ulysses and nausicaa which uncle pullet had bought as a pretty scripture thing she presently let fall her cake and in an unlucky movement crushed it beneath her foota source of so much agitation to aunt pullet and conscious disgrace to maggie that she began to despair of hearing the musical snuffbox today till after some reflection it occurred to her that lucy was in high favor enough to venture on asking for a tune so she whispered to lucy and lucy who always did what she was desired to do went up quietly to her uncles knee and blushall over her neck while she fingered her necklace said will you please play us a tune uncle  lucy thought it was by reason of some exceptional talent in uncle pullet that the snuffbox played such beautiful tunes and indeed the thing was viewed in that light by the majority of his neighbors in garum mr pullet had bought the box to begin with and he understood winding it up and knew which tune it was going to play beforehand altogether the possession of this unique piece of music was a proof that mr pullets character was not of that entire nullity which might otherwise have been attributed to it but uncle pullet when entreated to exhibit his accomplishment never depreciated it by a tooready consent well see about it was the answer he always gave carefully abstaining from any sign of compliance till a suitable number of minutes had passed uncle pullet had a programme for all great social occasions and in this way fenced himself in from much painful confusion and perplexing freedom of will  perhaps the suspense did heighten maggies enjoyment when the fairy tune began for the first time she quite forgot that she had a load on her mind that tom was angry with her and by the time hush ye pretty warbling choir had been played her face wore that bright look of happiness while she sat immovable with her hands clasped which sometimes comforted her mother with the sense that maggie could look pretty now and then in spite of her brown skin but when the magic music ceased she jumped up and running toward tom put her arm round his neck and said oh tom isnt it pretty  lest you should think it showed a revolting insensibility in tom that he felt any new anger toward maggie for this uncalledfor and to him inexplicable caress i must tell you that he had his glass of cowslip wine in his hand and that she jerked him so as to make him spill half of it he must have been an extreme milksop not to say angrily look there now especially when his resentment was sanctioned as it was by general disapprobation of maggies behavior  why dont you sit still maggie her mother said peevishly  little gells mustnt come to see me if they behave in that way said aunt pullet  why youre too rough little miss said uncle pullet  poor maggie sat down again with the music all chased out of her soul and the seven small demons all in again  mrs tulliver foreseeing nothing but misbehavior while the children remained indoors took an early opportunity of suggesting that now they were rested after their walk they might go and play out of doors and aunt pullet gave permission only enjoining them not to go off the paved walks in the garden and if they wanted to see the poultry fed to view them from a distance on the horseblock a restriction which had been imposed ever since tom had been found guilty of running after the peacock with an illusory idea that fright would make one of its feathers drop off  mrs tullivers thoughts had been temporarily diverted from the quarrel with mrs glegg by millinery and maternal cares but now the great theme of the bonnet was thrown into perspective and the children were out of the way yesterdays anxieties recurred  it weighs on my mind so as never was she said by way of opening the subject sister gleggs leaving the house in that way im sure id no wish t offend a sister  ah said aunt pullet theres no accounting for what jane ull do i wouldnt speak of it out o the family if it wasnt to dr turnbull but its my belief jane lives too low ive said so to pullet often and often and he knows it  why you said so last monday was a week when we came away from drinking tea with em said mr pullet beginning to nurse his knee and shelter it with his pockethandkerchief as was his way when the conversation took an interesting turn  very like i did said mrs pullet for you remember when i said things better than i can remember myself hes got a wonderful memory pullet has she continued looking pathetically at her sister i should be poorly off if he was to have a stroke for he always remembers when ive got to take my doctors stuff and im taking three sorts now  theres the pills as before every other night and the new drops at eleven and four and the fervescing mixture when agreeable rehearsed mr pullet with a punctuation determined by a lozenge on his tongue  ah perhaps it ud be better for sister glegg if shed go to the doctor sometimes instead o chewing turkey rhubarb whenever theres anything the matter with her said mrs tulliver who naturally saw the wide subject of medicine chiefly in relation to mrs glegg  its dreadful to think on said aunt pullet raising her hands and letting them fall again people playing with their own insides in that way and its flying i the face o providence for what are the doctors for if we arent to call em in and when folks have got the money to pay for a doctor it isnt respectable as ive told jane many a time im ashamed of acquaintance knowing it  well weve no call to be ashamed said mr pullet for doctor turnbull hasnt got such another patient as you i this parish now old mrs suttons gone  pullet keeps all my physicbottles did you know bessy said mrs pullet he wont have one sold he says its nothing but right folks should see em when im gone they fill two o the long storeroom shelves aready but she added beginning to cry a little its well if they ever fill three i may go before ive made up the dozen o these last sizes the pillboxes are in the closet in my roomyoull remember that sisterbut theres nothing to show for the boluses if it isnt the bills  dont talk o your going sister said mrs tulliver i should have nobody to stand between me and sister glegg if you was gone and theres nobody but you can get her to make it up with mr tulliver for sister deanes never o my side and if she was its not to be looked for as she can speak like them as have got an independent fortin  well your husband is awkard you know bessy said mrs pullet goodnaturedly ready to use her deep depression on her sisters account as well as her own hes never behaved quite so pretty to our family as he should do and the children take after himthe boys very mischievous and runs away from his aunts and uncles and the gells rude and brown its your bad luck and im sorry for you bessy for you was allays my favorite sister and we allays liked the same patterns  i know tullivers hasty and says odd things said mrs tulliver wiping away one small tear from the corner of her eye but im sure hes never been the man since he married me to object to my making the friends o my side o the family welcome to the house  i dont want to make the worst of you bessy said mrs pullet compassionately for i doubt youll have trouble enough without that and your husbands got that poor sister and her children hanging on himand so given to lawing they say i doubt hell leave you poorly off when he dies not as id have it said out o the family  this view of her position was naturally far from cheering to mrs tulliver her imagination was not easily acted on but she could not help thinking that her case was a hard one since it appeared that other people thought it hard  im sure sister i cant help myself she said urged by the fear lest her anticipated misfortunes might be held retributive to take comprehensive review of her past conduct theres no woman strives more for her children and im sure at scouringtime this ladyday as ive had all the bedhangings taken down i did as much as the two gells put together and theres the last elderflower wine ive madebeautiful i allays offer it along with the sherry though sister glegg will have it im so extravagant and as for liking to have my clothes tidy and not go a fright about the house theres nobody in the parish can say anything against me in respect o backbiting and making mischief for i dont wish anybody any harm and nobody loses by sending me a porkpie for my pies are fit to show with the best o my neighbors and the linens so in order as if i was to die tomorrow i shouldnt be ashamed a woman can do no more nor she can  but its all o no use you know bessy said mrs pullet holding her head on one side and fixing her eyes pathetically on her sister if your husband makes away with his money not but what if you was sold up and other folks bought your furniture its a comfort to think as youve kept it well rubbed and theres the linen with your maiden mark on might go all over the country it ud be a sad pity for our family mrs pullet shook her head slowly  but what can i do sister said mrs tulliver mr tullivers not a man to be dictated tonot if i was to go to the parson and get by heart what i should tell my husband for the best and im sure i dont pretend to know anything about putting out money and all that i could never see into mens business as sister glegg does  well youre like me in that bessy said mrs pullet and i think it ud be a deal more becoming o jane if shed have that pierglass rubbed oftenerthere was ever so many spots on it last weekinstead o dictating to folks as have more comings in than she ever had and telling em what theyre to do with their money but jane and me were allays contrairy she would have striped things and i like spots you like a spot too bessy we allays hung together i that  yes sophy said mrs tulliver i remember our having a blue ground with a white spot both alikeive got a bit in a bedquilt now and if you would but go and see sister glegg and persuade her to make it up with tulliver i should take it very kind of you you was allays a good sister to me  but the right thing ud be for tulliver to go and make it up with her himself and say he was sorry for speaking so rash if hes borrowed money of her he shouldnt be above that said mrs pullet whose partiality did not blind her to principles she did not forget what was due to people of independent fortune  its no use talking o that said poor mrs tulliver almost peevishly if i was to go down on my bare knees on the gravel to tulliver hed never humble himself  well you cant expect me to persuade jane to beg pardon said mrs pullet her tempers beyond everything its well if it doesnt carry her off her mind though there never was any of our family went to a madhouse  im not thinking of her begging pardon said mrs tulliver but if shed just take no notice and not call her money in as its not so much for one sister to ask of another time ud mend things and tulliver ud forget all about it and theyd be friends again  mrs tulliver you perceive was not aware of her husbands irrevocable determination to pay in the five hundred pounds at least such a determination exceeded her powers of belief  well bessy said mrs pullet mournfully i dont want to help you on to ruin i wont be behindhand i doing you a good turn if it is to be done and i dont like it said among acquaintance as weve got quarrels in the family i shall tell jane that and i dont mind driving to janes tomorrow if pullet doesnt mind what do you say mr pullet  ive no objections said mr pullet who was perfectly contented with any course the quarrel might take so that mr tulliver did not apply to him for money mr pullet was nervous about his investments and did not see how a man could have any security for his money unless he turned it into land  after a little further discussion as to whether it would not be better for mrs tulliver to accompany them on a visit to sister glegg mrs pullet observing that it was teatime turned to reach from a drawer a delicate damask napkin which she pinned before her in the fashion of an apron the door did in fact soon open but instead of the teatray sally introduced an object so startling that both mrs pullet and mrs tulliver gave a scream causing uncle pullet to swallow his lozengefor the fifth time in his life as he afterward noted    chapter x  maggie behaves worse than she expected   the startling object which thus made an epoch for uncle pullet was no other than little lucy with one side of her person from her small foot to her bonnetcrown wet and discolored with mud holding out two tiny blackened hands and making a very piteous face to account for this unprecedented apparition in aunt pullets parlor we must return to the moment when the three children went to play out of doors and the small demons who had taken possession of maggies soul at an early period of the day had returned in all the greater force after a temporary absence all the disagreeable recollections of the morning were thick upon her when tom whose displeasure toward her had been considerably refreshed by her foolish trick of causing him to upset his cowslip wine said here lucy you come along with me and walked off to the area where the toads were as if there were no maggie in existence seeing this maggie lingered at a distance looking like a small medusa with her snakes cropped lucy was naturally pleased that cousin tom was so good to her and it was very amusing to see him tickling a fat toad with a piece of string when the toad was safe down the area with an iron grating over him still lucy wished maggie to enjoy the spectacle also especially as she would doubtless find a name for the toad and say what had been his past history for lucy had a delighted semibelief in maggies stories about the live things they came upon by accidenthow mrs earwig had a wash at home and one of her children had fallen into the hot copper for which reason she was running so fast to fetch the doctor tom had a profound contempt for this nonsense of maggies smashing the earwig at once as a superfluous yet easy means of proving the entire unreality of such a story but lucy for the life of her could not help fancying there was something in it and at all events thought it was very pretty makebelieve so now the desire to know the history of a very portly toad added to her habitual affectionateness made her run back to maggie and say oh there is such a big funny toad maggie do come and see  maggie said nothing but turned away from her with a deeper frown as long as tom seemed to prefer lucy to her lucy made part of his unkindness maggie would have thought a little while ago that she could never be cross with pretty little lucy any more than she could be cruel to a little white mouse but then tom had always been quite indifferent to lucy before and it had been left to maggie to pet and make much of her as it was she was actually beginning to think that she should like to make lucy cry by slapping or pinching her especially as it might vex tom whom it was of no use to slap even if she dared because he didnt mind it and if lucy hadnt been there maggie was sure he would have got friends with her sooner  tickling a fat toad who is not highly sensitive is an amusement that it is possible to exhaust and tom by and by began to look round for some other mode of passing the time but in so prim a garden where they were not to go off the paved walks there was not a great choice of sport the only great pleasure such a restriction suggested was the pleasure of breaking it and tom began to meditate an insurrectionary visit to the pond about a fields length beyond the garden  i say lucy he began nodding his head up and down with great significance as he coiled up his string again what do you think i mean to do  what tom said lucy with curiosity  i mean to go to the pond and look at the pike you may go with me if you like said the young sultan  oh tom dare you said lucy aunt said we mustnt go out of the garden  oh i shall go out at the other end of the garden said tom nobody ull see us besides i dont care if they doill run off home  but i couldnt run said lucy who had never before been exposed to such severe temptation  oh never mind they wont be cross with you said tom you say i took you  tom walked along and lucy trotted by his side timidly enjoying the rare treat of doing something naughtyexcited also by the mention of that celebrity the pike about which she was quite uncertain whether it was a fish or a fowl  maggie saw them leaving the garden and could not resist the impulse to follow anger and jealousy can no more bear to lose sight of their objects than love and that tom and lucy should do or see anything of which she was ignorant would have been an intolerable idea to maggie so she kept a few yards behind them unobserved by tom who was presently absorbed in watching for the pikea highly interesting monster he was said to be so very old so very large and to have such a remarkable appetite the pike like other celebrities did not show when he was watched for but tom caught sight of something in rapid movement in the water which attracted him to another spot on the brink of the pond  here lucy he said in a loud whisper come here take care keep on the grassdont step where the cows have been he added pointing to a peninsula of dry grass with trodden mud on each side of it for toms contemptuous conception of a girl included the attribute of being unfit to walk in dirty places  lucy came carefully as she was bidden and bent down to look at what seemed a golden arrowhead darting through the water it was a watersnake tom told her and lucy at last could see the serpentine wave of its body very much wondering that a snake could swim maggie had drawn nearer and nearer she must see it too though it was bitter to her like everything else since tom did not care about her seeing it at last she was close by lucy and tom who had been aware of her approach but would not notice it till he was obliged turned round and said  now get away maggie theres no room for you on the grass here nobody asked you to come  there were passions at war in maggie at that moment to have made a tragedy if tragedies were made by passion only but the essential greek text which was present in the passion was wanting to the action the utmost maggie could do with a fierce thrust of her small brown arm was to push poor little pinkandwhite lucy into the cowtrodden mud  then tom could not restrain himself and gave maggie two smart slaps on the arm as he ran to pick up lucy who lay crying helplessly maggie retreated to the roots of a tree a few yards off and looked on impenitently usually her repentance came quickly after one rash deed but now tom and lucy had made her so miserable she was glad to spoil their happinessglad to make everybody uncomfortable why should she be sorry tom was very slow to forgive her however sorry she might have been  i shall tell mother you know miss mag said tom loudly and emphatically as soon as lucy was up and ready to walk away it was not toms practice to tell but here justice clearly demanded that maggie should be visited with the utmost punishment not that tom had learned to put his views in that abstract form he never mentioned justice and had no idea that his desire to punish might be called by that fine name lucy was too entirely absorbed by the evil that had befallen herthe spoiling of her pretty best clothes and the discomfort of being wet and dirtyto think much of the cause which was entirely mysterious to her she could never have guessed what she had done to make maggie angry with her but she felt that maggie was very unkind and disagreeable and made no magnanimous entreaties to tom that he would not tell only running along by his side and crying piteously while maggie sat on the roots of the tree and looked after them with her small medusa face  sally said tom when they reached the kitchen door and sally looked at them in speechless amaze with a piece of breadandbutter in her mouth and a toastingfork in her handsally tell mother it was maggie pushed lucy into the mud  but lors ha massy how did you get near such mud as that said sally making a wry face as she stooped down and examined the corpus delicti  toms imagination had not been rapid and capacious enough to include this question among the foreseen consequences but it was no sooner put than he foresaw whither it tended and that maggie would not be considered the only culprit in the case he walked quietly away from the kitchen door leaving sally to that pleasure of guessing which active minds notoriously prefer to readymade knowledge  sally as you are aware lost no time in presenting lucy at the parlor door for to have so dirty an object introduced into the house at garum firs was too great a weight to be sustained by a single mind  goodness gracious aunt pullet exclaimed after preluding by an inarticulate scream keep her at the door sally dont bring her off the oilcloth whatever you do  why shes tumbled into some nasty mud said mrs tulliver going up to lucy to examine into the amount of damage to clothes for which she felt herself responsible to her sister deane  if you please um it was miss maggie as pushed her in said sally master toms been and said so and they must ha been to the pond for its only there they could ha got into such dirt  there it is bessy its what ive been telling you said mrs pullet in a tone of prophetic sadness its your childrentheres no knowing what theyll come to  mrs tulliver was mute feeling herself a truly wretched mother as usual the thought pressed upon her that people would think she had done something wicked to deserve her maternal troubles while mrs pullet began to give elaborate directions to sally how to guard the premises from serious injury in the course of removing the dirt meantime tea was to be brought in by the cook and the two naughty children were to have theirs in an ignominious manner in the kitchen mrs tulliver went out to speak to these naughty children supposing them to be close at hand but it was not until after some search that she found tom leaning with rather a hardened careless air against the white paling of the poultryyard and lowering his piece of string on the other side as a means of exasperating the turkeycock  tom you naughty boy wheres your sister said mrs tulliver in a distressed voice  i dont know said tom his eagerness for justice on maggie had diminished since he had seen clearly that it could hardly be brought about without the injustice of some blame on his own conduct  why where did you leave her said the mother looking round  sitting under the tree against the pond said tom apparently indifferent to everything but the string and the turkeycock  then go and fetch her in this minute you naughty boy and how could you think o going to the pond and taking your sister where there was dirt you know shell do mischief if theres mischief to be done  it was mrs tullivers way if she blamed tom to refer his misdemeanor somehow or other to maggie  the idea of maggie sitting alone by the pond roused an habitual fear in mrs tullivers mind and she mounted the horseblock to satisfy herself by a sight of that fatal child while tom walkednot very quicklyon his way toward her  theyre such children for the water mine are she said aloud without reflecting that there was no one to hear her theyll be brought in dead and drownded some day i wish that river was far enough  but when she not only failed to discern maggie but presently saw tom returning from the pool alone this hovering fear entered and took complete possession of her and she hurried to meet him  maggies nowhere about the pond mother said tom shes gone away  you may conceive the terrified search for maggie and the difficulty of convincing her mother that she was not in the pond mrs pullet observed that the child might come to a worse end if she lived there was no knowing and mr pullet confused and overwhelmed by this revolutionary aspect of thingsthe tea deferred and the poultry alarmed by the unusual running to and frotook up his spud as an instrument of search and reached down a key to unlock the goosepen as a likely place for maggie to lie concealed in  tom after a while started the idea that maggie was gone home without thinking it necessary to state that it was what he should have done himself under the circumstances and the suggestion was seized as a comfort by his mother  sister for goodness sake let em put the horse in the carriage and take me home we shall perhaps find her on the road lucy cant walk in her dirty clothes she said looking at that innocent victim who was wrapped up in a shawl and sitting with naked feet on the sofa  aunt pullet was quite willing to take the shortest means of restoring her premises to order and quiet and it was not long before mrs tulliver was in the chaise looking anxiously at the most distant point before her what the father would say if maggie was lost was a question that predominated over every other    chapter xi  maggie tries to run away from her shadow   maggies intentions as usual were on a larger scale than tom imagined the resolution that gathered in her mind after tom and lucy had walked away was not so simple as that of going home no she would run away and go to the gypsies and tom should never see her any more that was by no means a new idea to maggie she had been so often told she was like a gypsy and half wild that when she was miserable it seemed to her the only way of escaping opprobrium and being entirely in harmony with circumstances would be to live in a little brown tent on the commons the gypsies she considered would gladly receive her and pay her much respect on account of her superior knowledge she had once mentioned her views on this point to tom and suggested that he should stain his face brown and they should run away together but tom rejected the scheme with contempt observing that gypsies were thieves and hardly got anything to eat and had nothing to drive but a donkey today however maggie thought her misery had reached a pitch at which gypsydom was her refuge and she rose from her seat on the roots of the tree with the sense that this was a great crisis in her life she would run straight away till she came to dunlow common where there would certainly be gypsies and cruel tom and the rest of her relations who found fault with her should never see her any more she thought of her father as she ran along but she reconciled herself to the idea of parting with him by determining that she would secretly send him a letter by a small gypsy who would run away without telling where she was and just let him know that she was well and happy and always loved him very much  maggie soon got out of breath with running but by the time tom got to the pond again she was at the distance of three long fields and was on the edge of the lane leading to the highroad she stopped to pant a little reflecting that running away was not a pleasant thing until one had got quite to the common where the gypsies were but her resolution had not abated she presently passed through the gate into the lane not knowing where it would lead her for it was not this way that they came from dorlcote mill to garum firs and she felt all the safer for that because there was no chance of her being overtaken but she was soon aware not without trembling that there were two men coming along the lane in front of her she had not thought of meeting strangers she had been too much occupied with the idea of her friends coming after her the formidable strangers were two shabbylooking men with flushed faces one of them carrying a bundle on a stick over his shoulder but to her surprise while she was dreading their disapprobation as a runaway the man with the bundle stopped and in a halfwhining halfcoaxing tone asked her if she had a copper to give a poor man maggie had a sixpence in her pockether uncle gleggs presentwhich she immediately drew out and gave this poor man with a polite smile hoping he would feel very kindly toward her as a generous person thats the only money ive got she said apologetically thank you little miss said the man in a less respectful and grateful tone than maggie anticipated and she even observed that he smiled and winked at his companion she walked on hurriedly but was aware that the two men were standing still probably to look after her and she presently heard them laughing loudly suddenly it occurred to her that they might think she was an idiot tom had said that her cropped hair made her look like an idiot and it was too painful an idea to be readily forgotten besides she had no sleeves ononly a cape and bonnet it was clear that she was not likely to make a favorable impression on passengers and she thought she would turn into the fields again but not on the same side of the lane as before lest they should still be uncle pullets fields she turned through the first gate that was not locked and felt a delightful sense of privacy in creeping along by the hedgerows after her recent humiliating encounter she was used to wandering about the fields by herself and was less timid there than on the highroad sometimes she had to climb over high gates but that was a small evil she was getting out of reach very fast and she should probably soon come within sight of dunlow common or at least of some other common for she had heard her father say that you couldnt go very far without coming to a common she hoped so for she was getting rather tired and hungry and until she reached the gypsies there was no definite prospect of bread and butter it was still broad daylight for aunt pullet retaining the early habits of the dodson family took tea at halfpast four by the sun and at five by the kitchen clock so though it was nearly an hour since maggie started there was no gathering gloom on the fields to remind her that the night would come still it seemed to her that she had been walking a very great distance indeed and it was really surprising that the common did not come within sight hitherto she had been in the rich parish of garum where was a great deal of pastureland and she had only seen one laborer at a distance that was fortunate in some respects as laborers might be too ignorant to understand the propriety of her wanting to go to dunlow common yet it would have been better if she could have met some one who would tell her the way without wanting to know anything about her private business at last however the green fields came to an end and maggie found herself looking through the bars of a gate into a lane with a wide margin of grass on each side of it she had never seen such a wide lane before and without her knowing why it gave her the impression that the common could not be far off perhaps it was because she saw a donkey with a log to his foot feeding on the grassy margin for she had seen a donkey with that pitiable encumbrance on dunlow common when she had been across it in her fathers gig she crept through the bars of the gate and walked on with new spirit though not without haunting images of apollyon and a highwayman with a pistol and a blinking dwarf in yellow with a mouth from ear to ear and other miscellaneous dangers for poor little maggie had at once the timidity of an active imagination and the daring that comes from overmastering impulse she had rushed into the adventure of seeking her unknown kindred the gypsies and now she was in this strange lane she hardly dared look on one side of her lest she should see the diabolical blacksmith in his leathern apron grinning at her with arms akimbo it was not without a leaping of the heart that she caught sight of a small pair of bare legs sticking up feet uppermost by the side of a hillock they seemed something hideously preternaturala diabolical kind of fungus for she was too much agitated at the first glance to see the ragged clothes and the dark shaggy head attached to them it was a boy asleep and maggie trotted along faster and more lightly lest she should wake him it did not occur to her that he was one of her friends the gypsies who in all probability would have very genial manners but the fact was so for at the next bend in the lane maggie actually saw the little semicircular black tent with the blue smoke rising before it which was to be her refuge from all the blighting obloquy that had pursued her in civilized life she even saw a tall female figure by the column of smoke doubtless the gypsymother who provided the tea and other groceries it was astonishing to herself that she did not feel more delighted but it was startling to find the gypsies in a lane after all and not on a common indeed it was rather disappointing for a mysterious illimitable common where there were sandpits to hide in and one was out of everybodys reach had always made part of maggies picture of gypsy life she went on however and thought with some comfort that gypsies most likely knew nothing about idiots so there was no danger of their falling into the mistake of setting her down at the first glance as an idiot it was plain she had attracted attention for the tall figure who proved to be a young woman with a baby on her arm walked slowly to meet her maggie looked up in the new face rather tremblingly as it approached and was reassured by the thought that her aunt pullet and the rest were right when they called her a gypsy for this face with the bright dark eyes and the long hair was really something like what she used to see in the glass before she cut her hair off  my little lady where are you going to the gypsy said in a tone of coaxing deference  it was delightful and just what maggie expected the gypsies saw at once that she was a little lady and were prepared to treat her accordingly  not any farther said maggie feeling as if she were saying what she had rehearsed in a dream im come to stay with you please  thats pretty come then why what a nice little lady you are to be sure said the gypsy taking her by the hand maggie thought her very agreeable but wished she had not been so dirty  there was quite a group round the fire when she reached it an old gypsy woman was seated on the ground nursing her knees and occasionally poking a skewer into the round kettle that sent forth an odorous steam two small shockheaded children were lying prone and resting on their elbows something like small sphinxes and a placid donkey was bending his head over a tall girl who lying on her back was scratching his nose and indulging him with a bite of excellent stolen hay the slanting sunlight fell kindly upon them and the scene was really very pretty and comfortable maggie thought only she hoped they would soon set out the teacups everything would be quite charming when she had taught the gypsies to use a washingbasin and to feel an interest in books it was a little confusing though that the young woman began to speak to the old one in a language which maggie did not understand while the tall girl who was feeding the donkey sat up and stared at her without offering any salutation at last the old woman said  what my pretty lady are you come to stay with us sit ye down and tell us where you come from  it was just like a story maggie liked to be called pretty lady and treated in this way she sat down and said  im come from home because im unhappy and i mean to be a gypsy ill live with you if you like and i can teach you a great many things  such a clever little lady said the woman with the baby sitting down by maggie and allowing baby to crawl and such a pretty bonnet and frock she added taking off maggies bonnet and looking at it while she made an observation to the old woman in the unknown language the tall girl snatched the bonnet and put it on her own head hindforemost with a grin but maggie was determined not to show any weakness on this subject as if she were susceptible about her bonnet  i dont want to wear a bonnet she said id rather wear a red handkerchief like yours looking at her friend by her side my hair was quite long till yesterday when i cut it off but i dare say it will grow again very soon she added apologetically thinking it probable the gypsies had a strong prejudice in favor of long hair and maggie had forgotten even her hunger at that moment in the desire to conciliate gypsy opinion  oh what a nice little ladyand rich im sure said the old woman didnt you live in a beautiful house at home  yes my home is pretty and im very fond of the river where we go fishing but im often very unhappy i should have liked to bring my books with me but i came away in a hurry you know but i can tell you almost everything there is in my books ive read them so many times and that will amuse you and i can tell you something about geography toothats about the world we live invery useful and interesting did you ever hear about columbus  maggies eyes had begun to sparkle and her cheeks to flushshe was really beginning to instruct the gypsies and gaining great influence over them the gypsies themselves were not without amazement at this talk though their attention was divided by the contents of maggies pocket which the friend at her right hand had by this time emptied without attracting her notice  is that where you live my little lady said the old woman at the mention of columbus  oh no said maggie with some pity columbus was a very wonderful man who found out half the world and they put chains on him and treated him very badly you know its in my catechism of geography but perhaps its rather too long to tell before teai want my tea so  the last words burst from maggie in spite of herself with a sudden drop from patronizing instruction to simple peevishness  why shes hungry poor little lady said the younger woman give her some o the cold victual youve been walking a good way ill be bound my dear wheres your home  its dorlcote mill a good way off said maggie my father is mr tulliver but we mustnt let him know where i am else hell fetch me home again where does the queen of the gypsies live  what do you want to go to her my little lady said the younger woman the tall girl meanwhile was constantly staring at maggie and grinning her manners were certainly not agreeable  no said maggie im only thinking that if she isnt a very good queen you might be glad when she died and you could choose another if i was a queen id be a very good queen and kind to everybody  heres a bit o nice victual then said the old woman handing to maggie a lump of dry bread which she had taken from a bag of scraps and a piece of cold bacon  thank you said maggie looking at the food without taking it but will you give me some breadandbutter and tea instead i dont like bacon  weve got no tea nor butter said the old woman with something like a scowl as if she were getting tired of coaxing  oh a little bread and treacle would do said maggie  we hant got no treacle said the old woman crossly whereupon there followed a sharp dialogue between the two women in their unknown tongue and one of the small sphinxes snatched at the breadandbacon and began to eat it at this moment the tall girl who had gone a few yards off came back and said something which produced a strong effect the old woman seeming to forget maggies hunger poked the skewer into the pot with new vigor and the younger crept under the tent and reached out some platters and spoons maggie trembled a little and was afraid the tears would come into her eyes meanwhile the tall girl gave a shrill cry and presently came running up the boy whom maggie had passed as he was sleepinga rough urchin about the age of tom he stared at maggie and there ensued much incomprehensible chattering she felt very lonely and was quite sure she should begin to cry before long the gypsies didnt seem to mind her at all and she felt quite weak among them but the springing tears were checked by new terror when two men came up whose approach had been the cause of the sudden excitement the elder of the two carried a bag which he flung down addressing the women in a loud and scolding tone which they answered by a shower of treble sauciness while a black cur ran barking up to maggie and threw her into a tremor that only found a new cause in the curses with which the younger man called the dog off and gave him a rap with a great stick he held in his hand  maggie felt that it was impossible she should ever be queen of these people or ever communicate to them amusing and useful knowledge  both the men now seemed to be inquiring about maggie for they looked at her and the tone of the conversation became of that pacific kind which implies curiosity on one side and the power of satisfying it on the other at last the younger woman said in her previous deferential coaxing tone  this nice little ladys come to live with us arent you glad  ay very glad said the younger man who was looking at maggies silver thimble and other small matters that had been taken from her pocket he returned them all except the thimble to the younger woman with some observation and she immediately restored them to maggies pocket while the men seated themselves and began to attack the contents of the kettlea stew of meat and potatoeswhich had been taken off the fire and turned out into a yellow platter  maggie began to think that tom must be right about the gypsies they must certainly be thieves unless the man meant to return her thimble by and by she would willingly have given it to him for she was not at all attached to her thimble but the idea that she was among thieves prevented her from feeling any comfort in the revival of deference and attention toward her all thieves except robin hood were wicked people the women saw she was frightened  weve got nothing nice for a lady to eat said the old woman in her coaxing tone and shes so hungry sweet little lady  here my dear try if you can eat a bit o this said the younger woman handing some of the stew on a brown dish with an iron spoon to maggie who remembering that the old woman had seemed angry with her for not liking the breadandbacon dared not refuse the stew though fear had chased away her appetite if her father would but come by in the gig and take her up or even if jack the giantkiller or mr greatheart or st george who slew the dragon on the halfpennies would happen to pass that way but maggie thought with a sinking heart that these heroes were never seen in the neighborhood of st oggs nothing very wonderful ever came there  maggie tulliver you perceive was by no means that well trained wellinformed young person that a small female of eight or nine necessarily is in these days she had only been to school a year at st oggs and had so few books that she sometimes read the dictionary so that in travelling over her small mind you would have found the most unexpected ignorance as well as unexpected knowledge she could have informed you that there was such a word as polygamy and being also acquainted with polysyllable she had deduced the conclusion that poly mean many but she had had no idea that gypsies were not well supplied with groceries and her thoughts generally were the oddest mixture of cleareyed acumen and blind dreams  her ideas about the gypsies had undergone a rapid modification in the last five minutes from having considered them very respectful companions amenable to instruction she had begun to think that they meant perhaps to kill her as soon as it was dark and cut up her body for gradual cooking the suspicion crossed her that the fierceeyed old man was in fact the devil who might drop that transparent disguise at any moment and turn either into the grinning blacksmith or else a fieryeyed monster with dragons wings it was no use trying to eat the stew and yet the thing she most dreaded was to offend the gypsies by betraying her extremely unfavorable opinion of them and she wondered with a keenness of interest that no theologian could have exceeded whether if the devil were really present he would know her thoughts  what you dont like the smell of it my dear said the young woman observing that maggie did not even take a spoonful of the stew try a bit come  no thank you said maggie summoning all her force for a desperate effort and trying to smile in a friendly way i havent time i think it seems getting darker i think i must go home now and come again another day and then i can bring you a basket with some jamtarts and things  maggie rose from her seat as she threw out this illusory prospect devoutly hoping that apollyon was gullible but her hope sank when the old gypsywoman said stop a bit stop a bit little lady well take you home all safe when weve done supper you shall ride home like a lady  maggie sat down again with little faith in this promise though she presently saw the tall girl putting a bridle on the donkey and throwing a couple of bags on his back  now then little missis said the younger man rising and leading the donkey forward tell us where you live whats the name o the place  dorlcote mill is my home said maggie eagerly my father is mr tulliver he lives there  what a big mill a little way this side o st oggs  yes said maggie is it far off i think i should like to walk there if you please  no no itll be getting dark we must make haste and the donkeyll carry you as nice as can be youll see  he lifted maggie as he spoke and set her on the donkey she felt relieved that it was not the old man who seemed to be going with her but she had only a trembling hope that she was really going home  heres your pretty bonnet said the younger woman putting that recently despised but now welcome article of costume on maggies head and youll say weve been very good to you wont you and what a nice little lady we said you was  oh yes thank you said maggie im very much obliged to you but i wish youd go with me too she thought anything was better than going with one of the dreadful men alone it would be more cheerful to be murdered by a larger party  ah youre fondest o me arent you said the woman but i cant go youll go too fast for me  it now appeared that the man also was to be seated on the donkey holding maggie before him and she was as incapable of remonstrating against this arrangement as the donkey himself though no nightmare had ever seemed to her more horrible when the woman had patted her on the back and said goodby the donkey at a strong hint from the mans stick set off at a rapid walk along the lane toward the point maggie had come from an hour ago while the tall girl and the rough urchin also furnished with sticks obligingly escorted them for the first hundred yards with much screaming and thwacking  not leonore in that preternatural midnight excursion with her phantom lover was more terrified than poor maggie in this entirely natural ride on a shortpaced donkey with a gypsy behind her who considered that he was earning half a crown the red light of the setting sun seemed to have a portentous meaning with which the alarming bray of the second donkey with the log on its foot must surely have some connection two low thatched cottagesthe only houses they passed in this laneseemed to add to its dreariness they had no windows to speak of and the doors were closed it was probable that they were inhabitated by witches and it was a relief to find that the donkey did not stop there  at lastoh sight of joythis lane the longest in the world was coming to an end was opening on a broad highroad where there was actually a coach passing and there was a fingerpost at the cornershe had surely seen that fingerpost beforeto st oggs 2 miles the gypsy really meant to take her home then he was probably a good man after all and might have been rather hurt at the thought that she didnt like coming with him alone this idea became stronger as she felt more and more certain that she knew the road quite well and she was considering how she might open a conversation with the injured gypsy and not only gratify his feelings but efface the impression of her cowardice when as they reached a crossroad maggie caught sight of some one coming on a whitefaced horse  oh stop stop she cried out theres my father oh father father  the sudden joy was almost painful and before her father reached her she was sobbing great was mr tullivers wonder for he had made a round from basset and had not yet been home  why whats the meaning o this he said checking his horse while maggie slipped from the donkey and ran to her fathers stirrup  the little miss lost herself i reckon said the gypsy shed come to our tent at the far end o dunlow lane and i was bringing her where she said her home was its a good way to come after being on the tramp all day  oh yes father hes been very good to bring me home said maggiea very kind good man  here then my man said mr tulliver taking out five shillings its the best days work you ever did i couldnt afford to lose the little wench here lift her up before me  why maggie hows this hows this he said as they rode along while she laid her head against her father and sobbed how came you to be rambling about and lose yourself  oh father sobbed maggie i ran away because i was so unhappy tom was so angry with me i couldnt bear it  pooh pooh said mr tulliver soothingly you mustnt think o running away from father what ud father do without his little wench  oh no i never will again fathernever  mr tulliver spoke his mind very strongly when he reached home that evening and the effect was seen in the remarkable fact that maggie never heard one reproach from her mother or one taunt from tom about this foolish business of her running away to the gypsies maggie was rather awestricken by this unusual treatment and sometimes thought that her conduct had been too wicked to be alluded to    chapter xii  mr and mrs glegg at home   in order to see mr and mrs glegg at home we must enter the town of st oggsthat venerable town with the red fluted roofs and the broad warehouse gables where the black ships unlade themselves of their burthens from the far north and carry away in exchange the precious inland products the wellcrushed cheese and the soft fleeces which my refined readers have doubtless become acquainted with through the medium of the best classic pastorals  it is one of those old old towns which impress one as a continuation and outgrowth of nature as much as the nests of the bowerbirds or the winding galleries of the white ants a town which carries the traces of its long growth and history like a millennial tree and has sprung up and developed in the same spot between the river and the low hill from the time when the roman legions turned their backs on it from the camp on the hillside and the longhaired seakings came up the river and looked with fierce eager eyes at the fatness of the land it is a town familiar with forgotten years the shadow of the saxon heroking still walks there fitfully reviewing the scenes of his youth and lovetime and is met by the gloomier shadow of the dreadful heathen dane who was stabbed in the midst of his warriors by the sword of an invisible avenger and who rises on autumn evenings like a white mist from his tumulus on the hill and hovers in the court of the old hall by the riverside the spot where he was thus miraculously slain in the days before the old hall was built it was the normans who began to build that fine old hall which is like the town telling of the thoughts and hands of widely sundered generations but it is all so old that we look with loving pardon at its inconsistencies and are well content that they who built the stone oriel and they who built the gothic façade and towers of finest small brickwork with the trefoil ornament and the windows and battlements defined with stone did not sacreligiously pull down the ancient halftimbered body with its oakroofed banquetinghall  but older even than this old hall is perhaps the bit of wall now built into the belfry of the parish church and said to be a remnant of the original chapel dedicated to st ogg the patron saint of this ancient town of whose history i possess several manuscript versions i incline to the briefest since if it should not be wholly true it is at least likely to contain the least falsehood ogg the son of beorl says my private hagiographer was a boatman who gained a scanty living by ferrying passengers across the river floss and it came to pass one evening when the winds were high that there sat moaning by the brink of the river a woman with a child in her arms and she was clad in rags and had a worn and withered look and she craved to be rowed across the river and the men thereabout questioned her and said wherefore dost thou desire to cross the river tarry till the morning and take shelter here for the night so shalt thou be wise and not foolish still she went on to mourn and crave but ogg the son of beorl came up and said i will ferry thee across it is enough that thy heart needs it and he ferried her across and it came to pass when she stepped ashore that her rags were turned into robes of flowing white and her face became bright with exceeding beauty and there was a glory around it so that she shed a light on the water like the moon in its brightness and she said ogg the son of beorl thou art blessed in that thou didst not question and wrangle with the hearts need but wast smitten with pity and didst straightway relieve the same and from henceforth whoso steps into thy boat shall be in no peril from the storm and whenever it puts forth to the rescue it shall save the lives both of men and beasts and when the floods came many were saved by reason of that blessing on the boat but when ogg the son of beorl died behold in the parting of his soul the boat loosed itself from its moorings and was floated with the ebbing tide in great swiftness to the ocean and was seen no more yet it was witnessed in the floods of aftertime that at the coming on of eventide ogg the son of beorl was always seen with his boat upon the widespreading waters and the blessed virgin sat in the prow shedding a light around as of the moon in its brightness so that the rowers in the gathering darkness took heart and pulled anew  this legend one sees reflects from a faroff time the visitation of the floods which even when they left human life untouched were widely fatal to the helpless cattle and swept as sudden death over all smaller living things but the town knew worse troubles even than the floodstroubles of the civil wars when it was a continual fightingplace where first puritans thanked god for the blood of the loyalists and then loyalists thanked god for the blood of the puritans many honest citizens lost all their possessions for conscience sake in those times and went forth beggared from their native town doubtless there are many houses standing now on which those honest citizens turned their backs in sorrowquaintgabled houses looking on the river jammed between newer warehouses and penetrated by surprising passages which turn and turn at sharp angles till they lead you out on a muddy strand overflowed continually by the rushing tide everywhere the brick houses have a mellow look and in mrs gleggs day there was no incongruous newfashioned smartness no plateglass in shopwindows no fresh stuccofacing or other fallacious attempt to make fine old red st oggs wear the air of a town that sprang up yesterday the shopwindows were small and unpretending for the farmers wives and daughters who came to do their shopping on marketdays were not to be withdrawn from their regular wellknown shops and the tradesmen had no wares intended for customers who would go on their way and be seen no more ah even mrs gleggs day seems far back in the past now separated from us by changes that widen the years war and the rumor of war had then died out from the minds of men and if they were ever thought of by the farmers in drab greatcoats who shook the grain out of their samplebags and buzzed over it in the full marketplace it was as a state of things that belonged to a past golden age when prices were high surely the time was gone forever when the broad river could bring up unwelcome ships russia was only the place where the linseed came fromthe more the bettermaking grist for the great vertical millstones with their scythelike arms roaring and grinding and carefully sweeping as if an informing soul were in them the catholics bad harvests and the mysterious fluctuations of trade were the three evils mankind had to fear even the floods had not been great of late years the mind of st oggs did not look extensively before or after it inherited a long past without thinking of it and had no eyes for the spirits that walk the streets since the centuries when st ogg with his boat and the virgin mother at the prow had been seen on the wide water so many memories had been left behind and had gradually vanished like the receding hilltops and the present time was like the level plain where men lose their belief in volcanoes and earthquakes thinking tomorrow will be as yesterday and the giant forces that used to shake the earth are forever laid to sleep the days were gone when people could be greatly wrought upon by their faith still less change it the catholics were formidable because they would lay hold of government and property and burn men alive not because any sane and honest parishioner of st oggs could be brought to believe in the pope one aged person remembered how a rude multitude had been swayed when john wesley preached in the cattlemarket but for a long while it had not been expected of preachers that they should shake the souls of men an occasional burst of fervor in dissenting pulpits on the subject of infant baptism was the only symptom of a zeal unsuited to sober times when men had done with change protestantism sat at ease unmindful of schisms careless of proselytism dissent was an inheritance along with a superior pew and a business connection and churchmanship only wondered contemptuously at dissent as a foolish habit that clung greatly to families in the grocery and chandlering lines though not incompatible with prosperous wholesale dealing but with the catholic question had come a slight wind of controversy to break the calm the elderly rector had become occasionally historical and argumentative and mr spray the independent minister had begun to preach political sermons in which he distinguished with much subtlety between his fervent belief in the right of the catholics to the franchise and his fervent belief in their eternal perdition most of mr sprays hearers however were incapable of following his subtleties and many oldfashioned dissenters were much pained by his siding with the catholics while others thought he had better let politics alone public spirit was not held in high esteem at st oggs and men who busied themselves with political questions were regarded with some suspicion as dangerous characters they were usually persons who had little or no business of their own to manage or if they had were likely enough to become insolvent  this was the general aspect of things at st oggs in mrs gleggs day and at that particular period in her family history when she had had her quarrel with mr tulliver it was a time when ignorance was much more comfortable than at present and was received with all the honors in very good society without being obliged to dress itself in an elaborate costume of knowledge a time when cheap periodicals were not and when country surgeons never thought of asking their female patients if they were fond of reading but simply took it for granted that they preferred gossip a time when ladies in rich silk gowns wore large pockets in which they carried a muttonbone to secure them against cramp mrs glegg carried such a bone which she had inherited from her grandmother with a brocaded gown that would stand up empty like a suit of armor and a silverheaded walkingstick for the dodson family had been respectable for many generations  mrs glegg had both a front and a back parlor in her excellent house at st oggs so that she had two points of view from which she could observe the weakness of her fellowbeings and reinforce her thankfulness for her own exceptional strength of mind from her front window she could look down the tofton road leading out of st oggs and note the growing tendency to gadding about in the wives of men not retired from business together with a practice of wearing woven cotton stockings which opened a dreary prospect for the coming generation and from her back windows she could look down the pleasant garden and orchard which stretched to the river and observe the folly of mr glegg in spending his time among them flowers and vegetables for mr glegg having retired from active business as a woolstapler for the purpose of enjoying himself through the rest of his life had found this last occupation so much more severe than his business that he had been driven into amateur hard labor as a dissipation and habitually relaxed by doing the work of two ordinary gardeners the economizing of a gardeners wages might perhaps have induced mrs glegg to wink at this folly if it were possible for a healthy female mind even to simulate respect for a husbands hobby but it is well known that this conjugal complacency belongs only to the weaker portion of the sex who are scarcely alive to the responsibilities of a wife as a constituted check on her husbands pleasures which are hardly ever of a rational or commendable kind  mr glegg on his side too had a double source of mental occupation which gave every promise of being inexhaustible on the one hand he surprised himself by his discoveries in natural history finding that his piece of gardenground contained wonderful caterpillars slugs and insects which so far as he had heard had never before attracted human observation and he noticed remarkable coincidences between these zoological phenomena and the great events of that timeas for example that before the burning of york minster there had been mysterious serpentine marks on the leaves of the rosetrees together with an unusual prevalence of slugs which he had been puzzled to know the meaning of until it flashed upon him with this melancholy conflagration mr glegg had an unusual amount of mental activity which when disengaged from the wool business naturally made itself a pathway in other directions and his second subject of meditation was the contrairiness of the female mind as typically exhibited in mrs glegg that a creature madein a genealogical senseout of a mans rib and in this particular case maintained in the highest respectability without any trouble of her own should be normally in a state of contradiction to the blandest propositions and even to the most accommodating concessions was a mystery in the scheme of things to which he had often in vain sought a clew in the early chapters of genesis mr glegg had chosen the eldest miss dodson as a handsome embodiment of female prudence and thrift and being himself of a moneygetting moneykeeping turn had calculated on much conjugal harmony but in that curious compound the feminine character it may easily happen that the flavor is unpleasant in spite of excellent ingredients and a fine systematic stinginess may be accompanied with a seasoning that quite spoils its relish now good mr glegg himself was stingy in the most amiable manner his neighbors called him near which always means that the person in question is a lovable skinflint if you expressed a preference for cheeseparings mr glegg would remember to save them for you with a goodnatured delight in gratifying your palate and he was given to pet all animals which required no appreciable keep there was no humbug or hypocrisy about mr glegg his eyes would have watered with true feeling over the sale of a widows furniture which a fivepound note from his side pocket would have prevented but a donation of five pounds to a person in a small way of life would have seemed to him a mad kind of lavishness rather than charity which had always presented itself to him as a contribution of small aids not a neutralizing of misfortune and mr glegg was just as fond of saving other peoples money as his own he would have ridden as far round to avoid a turnpike when his expenses were to be paid for him as when they were to come out of his own pocket and was quite zealous in trying to induce indifferent acquaintances to adopt a cheap substitute for blacking this inalienable habit of saving as an end in itself belonged to the industrious men of business of a former generation who made their fortunes slowly almost as the tracking of the fox belongs to the harrierit constituted them a race which is nearly lost in these days of rapid moneygetting when lavishness comes close on the back of want in oldfashioned times an independence was hardly ever made without a little miserliness as a condition and you would have found that quality in every provincial district combined with characters as various as the fruits from which we can extract acid the true harpagons were always marked and exceptional characters not so the worthy taxpayers who having once pinched from real necessity retained even in the midst of their comfortable retirement with their wallfruit and winebins the habit of regarding life as an ingenious process of nibbling out ones livelihood without leaving any perceptible deficit and who would have been as immediately prompted to give up a newly taxed luxury when they had had their clear five hundred a year as when they had only five hundred pounds of capital mr glegg was one of these men found so impracticable by chancellors of the exchequer and knowing this you will be the better able to understand why he had not swerved from the conviction that he had made an eligible marriage in spite of the toopungent seasoning that nature had given to the eldest miss dodsons virtues a man with an affectionate disposition who finds a wife to concur with his fundamental idea of life easily comes to persuade himself that no other woman would have suited him so well and does a little daily snapping and quarrelling without any sense of alienation mr glegg being of a reflective turn and no longer occupied with wool had much wondering meditation on the peculiar constitution of the female mind as unfolded to him in his domestic life and yet he thought mrs gleggs household ways a model for her sex it struck him as a pitiable irregularity in other women if they did not roll up their tablenapkins with the same tightness and emphasis as mrs glegg did if their pastry had a less leathery consistence and their damson cheese a less venerable hardness than hers nay even the peculiar combination of grocery and druglike odors in mrs gleggs private cupboard impressed him as the only right thing in the way of cupboard smells i am not sure that he would not have longed for the quarrelling again if it had ceased for an entire week and it is certain that an acquiescent mild wife would have left his meditations comparatively jejune and barren of mystery  mr gleggs unmistakable kindheartedness was shown in this that it pained him more to see his wife at variance with otherseven with dolly the servantthan to be in a state of cavil with her himself and the quarrel between her and mr tulliver vexed him so much that it quite nullified the pleasure he would otherwise have had in the state of his early cabbages as he walked in his garden before breakfast the next morning still he went in to breakfast with some slight hope that now mrs glegg had slept upon it her anger might be subdued enough to give way to her usually strong sense of family decorum she had been used to boast that there had never been any of those deadly quarrels among the dodsons which had disgraced other families that no dodson had ever been cut off with a shilling and no cousin of the dodsons disowned as indeed why should they be for they had no cousins who had not money out at use or some houses of their own at the very least  there was one eveningcloud which had always disappeared from mrs gleggs brow when she sat at the breakfasttable it was her fuzzy front of curls for as she occupied herself in household matters in the morning it would have been a mere extravagance to put on anything so superfluous to the making of leathery pastry as a fuzzy curled front by halfpast ten decorum demanded the front until then mrs glegg could economize it and society would never be any the wiser but the absence of that cloud only left it more apparent that the cloud of severity remained and mr glegg perceiving this as he sat down to his milkporridge which it was his old frugal habit to stem his morning hunger with prudently resolved to leave the first remark to mrs glegg lest to so delicate an article as a ladys temper the slightest touch should do mischief people who seem to enjoy their ill temper have a way of keeping it in fine condition by inflicting privations on themselves that was mrs gleggs way she made her tea weaker than usual this morning and declined butter it was a hard case that a vigorous mood for quarrelling so highly capable of using an opportunity should not meet with a single remark from mr glegg on which to exercise itself but by and by it appeared that his silence would answer the purpose for he heard himself apostrophized at last in that tone peculiar to the wife of ones bosom  well mr glegg its a poor return i get for making you the wife ive made you all these years if this is the way im to be treated id better ha known it before my poor father died and then when id wanted a home i should ha gone elsewhere as the choice was offered me  mr glegg paused from his porridge and looked up not with any new amazement but simply with that quiet habitual wonder with which we regard constant mysteries  why mrs g what have i done now  done now mr glegg done nowim sorry for you  not seeing his way to any pertinent answer mr glegg reverted to his porridge  theres husbands in the world continued mrs glegg after a pause as ud have known how to do something different to siding with everybody else against their own wives perhaps im wrong and you can teach me better but ive allays heard as its the husbands place to stand by the wife instead o rejoicing and triumphing when folks insult her  now what call have you to say that said mr glegg rather warmly for though a kind man he was not as meek as moses when did i rejoice or triumph over you  theres ways o doing things worse than speaking out plain mr glegg id sooner youd tell me to my face as you make light of me than try to make out as everybodys in the right but me and come to your breakfast in the morning as ive hardly slept an hour this night and sulk at me as if i was the dirt under your feet  sulk at you said mr glegg in a tone of angry facetiousness youre like a tipsy man as thinks everybodys had too much but himself  dont lower yourself with using coarse language to me mr glegg it makes you look very small though you cant see yourself said mrs glegg in a tone of energetic compassion a man in your place should set an example and talk more sensible  yes but will you listen to sense retorted mr glegg sharply the best sense i can talk to you is what i said last nightas youre i the wrong to think o calling in your money when its safe enough if youd let it alone all because of a bit of a tiff and i was in hopes youd ha altered your mind this morning but if youd like to call it in dont do it in a hurry now and breed more enmity in the family but wait till theres a pretty mortgage to be had without any trouble youd have to set the lawyer to work now to find an investment and make no end o expense  mrs glegg felt there was really something in this but she tossed her head and emitted a guttural interjection to indicate that her silence was only an armistice not a peace and in fact hostilities soon broke out again  ill thank you for my cup o tea now mrs g said mr glegg seeing that she did not proceed to give it him as usual when he had finished his porridge she lifted the teapot with a slight toss of the head and said  im glad to hear youll thank me mr glegg its little thanks i get for what i do for folks i this world though theres never a woman o your side o the family mr glegg as is fit to stand up with me and id say it if i was on my dying bed not but what ive allays conducted myself civil to your kin and there isnt one of em can say the contrary though my equils they arent and nobody shall make me say it  youd better leave finding fault wi my kin till youve left off quarrelling with you own mrs g said mr glegg with angry sarcasm ill trouble you for the milkjug  thats as false a word as ever you spoke mr glegg said the lady pouring out the milk with unusual profuseness as much as to say if he wanted milk he should have it with a vengeance and you know its false im not the woman to quarrel with my own kin you may for ive known you to do it  why what did you call it yesterday then leaving your sisters house in a tantrum  id no quarrel wi my sister mr glegg and its false to say it mr tullivers none o my blood and it was him quarrelled with me and drove me out o the house but perhaps youd have had me stay and be swore at mr glegg perhaps you was vexed not to hear more abuse and foul language poured out upo your own wife but let me tell you its your disgrace  did ever anybody hear the like i this parish said mr glegg getting hot a woman with everything provided for her and allowed to keep her own money the same as if it was settled on her and with a gig new stuffed and lined at no end o expense and provided for when i die beyond anything she could expectto go on i this way biting and snapping like a mad dog its beyond everything as god a mighty should ha made women so these last words were uttered in a tone of sorrowful agitation mr glegg pushed his tea from him and tapped the table with both his hands  well mr glegg if those are your feelings its best they should be known said mrs glegg taking off her napkin and folding it in an excited manner but if you talk o my being provided for beyond what i could expect i beg leave to tell you as id a right to expect a many things as i dont find and as to my being like a mad dog its well if youre not cried shame on by the county for your treatment of me for its what i cant bear and i wont bear  here mrs gleggs voice intimated that she was going to cry and breaking off from speech she rang the bell violently  sally she said rising from her chair and speaking in rather a choked voice light a fire upstairs and put the blinds down mr glegg youll please to order what youd like for dinner i shall have gruel  mrs glegg walked across the room to the small bookcase and took down baxters saints everlasting rest which she carried with her upstairs it was the book she was accustomed to lay open before her on special occasionson wet sunday mornings or when she heard of a death in the family or when as in this case her quarrel with mr glegg had been set an octave higher than usual  but mrs glegg carried something else upstairs with her which together with the saints rest and the gruel may have had some influence in gradually calming her feelings and making it possible for her to endure existence on the groundfloor shortly before teatime this was partly mr gleggs suggestion that she would do well to let her five hundred lie still until a good investment turned up and further his parenthetic hint at his handsome provision for her in case of his death mr glegg like all men of his stamp was extremely reticent about his will and mrs glegg in her gloomier moments had forebodings that like other husbands of whom she had heard he might cherish the mean project of heightening her grief at his death by leaving her poorly off in which case she was firmly resolved that she would have scarcely any weeper on her bonnet and would cry no more than if he had been a second husband but if he had really shown her any testamentary tenderness it would be affecting to think of him poor man when he was gone and even his foolish fuss about the flowers and gardenstuff and his insistence on the subject of snails would be touching when it was once fairly at an end to survive mr glegg and talk eulogistically of him as a man who might have his weaknesses but who had done the right thing by her notwithstanding his numerous poor relations to have sums of interest coming in more frequently and secrete it in various corners baffling to the most ingenious of thieves for to mrs gleggs mind banks and strongboxes would have nullified the pleasure of property she might as well have taken her food in capsules finally to be looked up to by her own family and the neighborhood so as no woman can ever hope to be who has not the præterite and present dignity comprised in being a widow well leftall this made a flattering and conciliatory view of the future so that when good mr glegg restored to good humor by much hoeing and moved by the sight of his wifes empty chair with her knitting rolled up in the corner went upstairs to her and observed that the bell had been tolling for poor mr morton mrs glegg answered magnanimously quite as if she had been an uninjured woman ah then therell be a good business for somebody to take to  baxter had been open at least eight hours by this time for it was nearly five oclock and if people are to quarrel often it follows as a corollary that their quarrels cannot be protracted beyond certain limits  mr and mrs glegg talked quite amicably about the tullivers that evening mr glegg went the length of admitting that tulliver was a sad man for getting into hot water and was like enough to run through his property and mrs glegg meeting this acknowledgment halfway declared that it was beneath her to take notice of such a mans conduct and that for her sisters sake she would let him keep the five hundred a while longer for when she put it out on a mortgage she should only get four per cent    chapter xiii  mr tulliver further entangles the skein of life   owing to this new adjustment of mrs gleggs thoughts mrs pullet found her task of mediation the next day surprisingly easy mrs glegg indeed checked her rather sharply for thinking it would be necessary to tell her elder sister what was the right mode of behavior in family matters mrs pullets argument that it would look ill in the neighborhood if people should have it in their power to say that there was a quarrel in the family was particularly offensive if the family name never suffered except through mrs glegg mrs pullet might lay her head on her pillow in perfect confidence  its not to be expected i suppose observed mrs glegg by way of winding up the subject as i shall go to the mill again before bessy comes to see me or as i shall go and fall down o my knees to mr tulliver and ask his pardon for showing him favors but i shall bear no malice and when mr tulliver speaks civil to me ill speak civil to him nobody has any call to tell me whats becoming  finding it unnecessary to plead for the tullivers it was natural that aunt pullet should relax a little in her anxiety for them and recur to the annoyance she had suffered yesterday from the offspring of that apparently illfated house mrs glegg heard a circumstantial narrative to which mr pullets remarkable memory furnished some items and while aunt pullet pitied poor bessys bad luck with her children and expressed a halfformed project of paying for maggies being sent to a distant boardingschool which would not prevent her being so brown but might tend to subdue some other vices in her aunt glegg blamed bessy for her weakness and appealed to all witnesses who should be living when the tulliver children had turned out ill that she mrs glegg had always said how it would be from the very first observing that it was wonderful to herself how all her words came true  then i may call and tell bessy youll bear no malice and everything be as it was before mrs pullet said just before parting  yes you may sophy said mrs glegg you may tell mr tulliver and bessy too as im not going to behave ill because folks behave ill to me i know its my place as the eldest to set an example in every respect and i do it nobody can say different of me if theyll keep to the truth  mrs glegg being in this state of satisfaction in her own lofty magnanimity i leave you to judge what effect was produced on her by the reception of a short letter from mr tulliver that very evening after mrs pullets departure informing her that she neednt trouble her mind about her five hundred pounds for it should be paid back to her in the course of the next month at farthest together with the interest due thereon until the time of payment and furthermore that mr tulliver had no wish to behave uncivilly to mrs glegg and she was welcome to his house whenever she liked to come but he desired no favors from her either for himself or his children  it was poor mrs tulliver who had hastened this catastrophe entirely through that irrepressible hopefulness of hers which led her to expect that similar causes may at any time produce different results it had very often occurred in her experience that mr tulliver had done something because other people had said he was not able to do it or had pitied him for his supposed inability or in any other way piqued his pride still she thought today if she told him when he came in to tea that sister pullet was gone to try and make everything up with sister glegg so that he neednt think about paying in the money it would give a cheerful effect to the meal mr tulliver had never slackened in his resolve to raise the money but now he at once determined to write a letter to mrs glegg which should cut off all possibility of mistake mrs pullet gone to beg and pray for him indeed mr tulliver did not willingly write a letter and found the relation between spoken and written language briefly known as spelling one of the most puzzling things in this puzzling world nevertheless like all fervid writing the task was done in less time than usual and if the spelling differed from mrs gleggswhy she belonged like himself to a generation with whom spelling was a matter of private judgment  mrs glegg did not alter her will in consequence of this letter and cut off the tulliver children from their sixth and seventh share in her thousand pounds for she had her principles no one must be able to say of her when she was dead that she had not divided her money with perfect fairness among her own kin in the matter of wills personal qualities were subordinate to the great fundamental fact of blood and to be determined in the distribution of your property by caprice and not make your legacies bear a direct ratio to degrees of kinship was a prospective disgrace that would have embittered her life this had always been a principle in the dodson family it was one form if that sense of honor and rectitude which was a proud tradition in such familiesa tradition which has been the salt of our provincial society  but though the letter could not shake mrs gleggs principles it made the family breach much more difficult to mend and as to the effect it produced on mrs gleggs opinion of mr tulliver she begged to be understood from that time forth that she had nothing whatever to say about him his state of mind apparently was too corrupt for her to contemplate it for a moment it was not until the evening before tom went to school at the beginning of august that mrs glegg paid a visit to her sister tulliver sitting in her gig all the while and showing her displeasure by markedly abstaining from all advice and criticism for as she observed to her sister deane bessy must bear the consequence o having such a husband though im sorry for her and mrs deane agreed that bessy was pitiable  that evening tom observed to maggie oh my maggie aunt gleggs beginning to come again im glad im going to school youll catch it all now  maggie was already so full of sorrow at the thought of toms going away from her that this playful exultation of his seemed very unkind and she cried herself to sleep that night  mr tullivers prompt procedure entailed on him further promptitude in finding the convenient person who was desirous of lending five hundred pounds on bond it must be no client of wakems he said to himself and yet at the end of a fortnight it turned out to the contrary not because mr tullivers will was feeble but because external fact was stronger wakems client was the only convenient person to be found mr tulliver had a destiny as well as Œdipus and in this case he might plead like Œdipus that his deed was inflicted on him rather than committed by him     book ii  schooltime    chapter i  toms first half   tom tullivers sufferings during the first quarter he was at kings lorton under the distinguished care of the rev walter stelling were rather severe at mr jacobs academy life had not presented itself to him as a difficult problem there were plenty of fellows to play with and tom being good at all active gamesfighting especiallyhad that precedence among them which appeared to him inseparable from the personality of tom tulliver mr jacobs himself familiarly known as old goggles from his habit of wearing spectacles imposed no painful awe and if it was the property of snuffy old hypocrites like him to write like copperplate and surround their signatures with arabesques to spell without forethought and to spout my name is norval without bungling tom for his part was glad he was not in danger of those mean accomplishments he was not going to be a snuffy schoolmaster he but a substantial man like his father who used to go hunting when he was younger and rode a capital black mareas pretty a bit of horseflesh as ever you saw tom had heard what her points were a hundred times he meant to go hunting too and to be generally respected when people were grown up he considered nobody inquired about their writing and spelling when he was a man he should be master of everything and do just as he liked it had been very difficult for him to reconcile himself to the idea that his schooltime was to be prolonged and that he was not to be brought up to his fathers business which he had always thought extremely pleasant for it was nothing but riding about giving orders and going to market and he thought that a clergyman would give him a great many scripture lessons and probably make him learn the gospel and epistle on a sunday as well as the collect but in the absence of specific information it was impossible for him to imagine that school and a schoolmaster would be something entirely different from the academy of mr jacobs so not to be at a deficiency in case of his finding genial companions he had taken care to carry with him a small box of percussioncaps not that there was anything particular to be done with them but they would serve to impress strange boys with a sense of his familiarity with guns thus poor tom though he saw very clearly through maggies illusions was not without illusions of his own which were to be cruelly dissipated by his enlarged experience at kings lorton  he had not been there a fortnight before it was evident to him that life complicated not only with the latin grammar but with a new standard of english pronunciation was a very difficult business made all the more obscure by a thick mist of bashfulness tom as you have observed was never an exception among boys for ease of address but the difficulty of enunciating a monosyllable in reply to mr or mrs stelling was so great that he even dreaded to be asked at table whether he would have more pudding as to the percussioncaps he had almost resolved in the bitterness of his heart that he would throw them into a neighboring pond for not only was he the solitary pupil but he began even to have a certain scepticism about guns and a general sense that his theory of life was undermined for mr stelling thought nothing of guns or horses either apparently and yet it was impossible for tom to despise mr stelling as he had despised old goggles if there were anything that was not thoroughly genuine about mr stelling it lay quite beyond toms power to detect it it is only by a wide comparison of facts that the wisest fullgrown man can distinguish wellrolled barrels from mere supernal thunder  mr stelling was a wellsized broadchested man not yet thirty with flaxen hair standing erect and large lightishgray eyes which were always very wide open he had a sonorous bass voice and an air of defiant selfconfidence inclining to brazenness he had entered on his career with great vigor and intended to make a considerable impression on his fellowmen the rev walter stelling was not a man who would remain among the inferior clergy all his life he had a true british determination to push his way in the worldas a schoolmaster in the first place for there were capital masterships of grammarschools to be had and mr stelling meant to have one of them but as a preacher also for he meant always to preach in a striking manner so as to have his congregation swelled by admirers from neighboring parishes and to produce a great sensation whenever he took occasional duty for a brother clergyman of minor gifts the style of preaching he had chosen was the extemporaneous which was held little short of the miraculous in rural parishes like kings lorton some passages of massillon and bourdaloue which he knew by heart were really very effective when rolled out in mr stellings deepest tones but as comparatively feeble appeals of his own were delivered in the same loud and impressive manner they were often thought quite as striking by his hearers mr stellings doctrine was of no particular school if anything it had a tinge of evangelicalism for that was the telling thing just then in the diocese to which kings lorton belonged in short mr stelling was a man who meant to rise in his profession and to rise by merit clearly since he had no interest beyond what might be promised by a problematic relationship to a great lawyer who had not yet become lord chancellor a clergyman who has such vigorous intentions naturally gets a little into debt at starting it is not to be expected that he will live in the meagre style of a man who means to be a poor curate all his life and if the few hundreds mr timpson advanced toward his daughters fortune did not suffice for the purchase of handsome furniture together with a stock of wine a grand piano and the laying out of a superior flowergarden it followed in the most rigorous manner either that these things must be procured by some other means or else that the rev mr stelling must go without them which last alternative would be an absurd procrastination of the fruits of success where success was certain mr stelling was so broadchested and resolute that he felt equal to anything he would become celebrated by shaking the consciences of his hearers and he would by and by edit a greek play and invent several new readings he had not yet selected the play for having been married little more than two years his leisure time had been much occupied with attentions to mrs stelling but he had told that fine woman what he meant to do some day and she felt great confidence in her husband as a man who understood everything of that sort  but the immediate step to future success was to bring on tom tulliver during this first halfyear for by a singular coincidence there had been some negotiation concerning another pupil from the same neighborhood and it might further a decision in mr stellings favor if it were understood that young tulliver who mr stelling observed in conjugal privacy was rather a rough cub had made prodigious progress in a short time it was on this ground that he was severe with tom about his lessons he was clearly a boy whose powers would never be developed through the medium of the latin grammar without the application of some sternness not that mr stelling was a harshtempered or unkind man quite the contrary he was jocose with tom at table and corrected his provincialisms and his deportment in the most playful manner but poor tom was only the more cowed and confused by this double novelty for he had never been used to jokes at all like mr stellings and for the first time in his life he had a painful sense that he was all wrong somehow when mr stelling said as the roastbeef was being uncovered now tulliver which would you rather decline roastbeef or the latin for it tom to whom in his coolest moments a pun would have been a hard nut was thrown into a state of embarrassed alarm that made everything dim to him except the feeling that he would rather not have anything to do with latin of course he answered roastbeef whereupon there followed much laughter and some practical joking with the plates from which tom gathered that he had in some mysterious way refused beef and in fact made himself appear a silly if he could have seen a fellowpupil undergo these painful operations and survive them in good spirits he might sooner have taken them as a matter of course but there are two expensive forms of education either of which a parent may procure for his son by sending him as solitary pupil to a clergyman one is the enjoyment of the reverend gentlemans undivided neglect the other is the endurance of the reverend gentlemans undivided attention it was the latter privilege for which mr tulliver paid a high price in toms initiatory months at kings lorton  that respectable miller and maltster had left tom behind and driven homeward in a state of great mental satisfaction he considered that it was a happy moment for him when he had thought of asking rileys advice about a tutor for tom mr stellings eyes were so wide open and he talked in such an offhand matteroffact way answering every difficult slow remark of mr tullivers with i see my good sir i see to be sure to be sure you want your son to be a man who will make his way in the worldthat mr tulliver was delighted to find in him a clergyman whose knowledge was so applicable to the everyday affairs of this life except counsellor wylde whom he had heard at the last sessions mr tulliver thought the rev mr stelling was the shrewdest fellow he had ever met withnot unlike wylde in fact he had the same way of sticking his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat mr tulliver was not by any means an exception in mistaking brazenness for shrewdness most laymen thought stelling shrewd and a man of remarkable powers generally it was chiefly by his clerical brethren that he was considered rather a full fellow but he told mr tulliver several stories about swing and incendiarism and asked his advice about feeding pigs in so thoroughly secular and judicious a manner with so much polished glibness of tongue that the miller thought here was the very thing he wanted for tom he had no doubt this firstrate man was acquainted with every branch of information and knew exactly what tom must learn in order to become a match for the lawyers which poor mr tulliver himself did not know and so was necessarily thrown for selfdirection on this wide kind of inference it is hardly fair to laugh at him for i have known much more highly instructed persons than he make inferences quite as wide and not at all wiser  as for mrs tulliver finding that mrs stellings views as to the airing of linen and the frequent recurrence of hunger in a growing boy entirely coincided with her own moreover that mrs stelling though so young a woman and only anticipating her second confinement had gone through very nearly the same experience as herself with regard to the behavior and fundamental character of the monthly nurseshe expressed great contentment to her husband when they drove away at leaving tom with a woman who in spite of her youth seemed quite sensible and motherly and asked advice as prettily as could be  they must be very well off though said mrs tulliver for everythings as nice as can be all over the house and that watered silk she had on cost a pretty penny sister pullet has got one like it  ah said mr tulliver hes got some income besides the curacy i reckon perhaps her father allows em something theres tom ull be another hundred to him and not much trouble either by his own account he says teaching comes natural to him thats wonderful now added mr tulliver turning his head on one side and giving his horse a meditative tickling on the flank  perhaps it was because teaching came naturally to mr stelling that he set about it with that uniformity of method and independence of circumstances which distinguish the actions of animals understood to be under the immediate teaching of nature mr broderips amiable beaver as that charming naturalist tells us busied himself as earnestly in constructing a dam in a room up three pair of stairs in london as if he had been laying his foundation in a stream or lake in upper canada it was binnys function to build the absence of water or of possible progeny was an accident for which he was not accountable with the same unerring instinct mr stelling set to work at his natural method of instilling the eton grammar and euclid into the mind of tom tulliver this he considered was the only basis of solid instruction all other means of education were mere charlatanism and could produce nothing better than smatterers fixed on this firm basis a man might observe the display of various or special knowledge made by irregularly educated people with a pitying smile all that sort of thing was very well but it was impossible these people could form sound opinions in holding this conviction mr stelling was not biassed as some tutors have been by the excessive accuracy or extent of his own scholarship and as to his views about euclid no opinion could have been freer from personal partiality mr stelling was very far from being led astray by enthusiasm either religious or intellectual on the other hand he had no secret belief that everything was humbug he thought religion was a very excellent thing and aristotle a great authority and deaneries and prebends useful institutions and great britain the providential bulwark of protestantism and faith in the unseen a great support to afflicted minds he believed in all these things as a swiss hotelkeeper believes in the beauty of the scenery around him and in the pleasure it gives to artistic visitors and in the same way mr stelling believed in his method of education he had no doubt that he was doing the very best thing for mr tullivers boy of course when the miller talked of mapping and summing in a vague and diffident manner mr stelling had set his mind at rest by an assurance that he understood what was wanted for how was it possible the good man could form any reasonable judgment about the matter mr stellings duty was to teach the lad in the only right wayindeed he knew no other he had not wasted his time in the acquirement of anything abnormal  he very soon set down poor tom as a thoroughly stupid lad for though by hard labor he could get particular declensions into his brain anything so abstract as the relation between cases and terminations could by no means get such a lodgment there as to enable him to recognize a chance genitive or dative this struck mr stelling as something more than natural stupidity he suspected obstinacy or at any rate indifference and lectured tom severely on his want of thorough application you feel no interest in what youre doing sir mr stelling would say and the reproach was painfully true tom had never found any difficulty in discerning a pointer from a setter when once he had been told the distinction and his perceptive powers were not at all deficient i fancy they were quite as strong as those of the rev mr stelling for tom could predict with accuracy what number of horses were cantering behind him he could throw a stone right into the centre of a given ripple he could guess to a fraction how many lengths of his stick it would take to reach across the playground and could draw almost perfect squares on his slate without any measurement but mr stelling took no note of these things he only observed that toms faculties failed him before the abstractions hideously symbolized to him in the pages of the eton grammar and that he was in a state bordering on idiocy with regard to the demonstration that two given triangles must be equal though he could discern with great promptitude and certainty the fact that they were equal whence mr stelling concluded that toms brain being peculiarly impervious to etymology and demonstrations was peculiarly in need of being ploughed and harrowed by these patent implements it was his favorite metaphor that the classics and geometry constituted that culture of the mind which prepared it for the reception of any subsequent crop i say nothing against mr stellings theory if we are to have one regimen for all minds his seems to me as good as any other i only know it turned out as uncomfortably for tom tulliver as if he had been plied with cheese in order to remedy a gastric weakness which prevented him from digesting it it is astonishing what a different result one gets by changing the metaphor once call the brain an intellectual stomach and ones ingenious conception of the classics and geometry as ploughs and harrows seems to settle nothing but then it is open to some one else to follow great authorities and call the mind a sheet of white paper or a mirror in which case ones knowledge of the digestive process becomes quite irrelevant it was doubtless an ingenious idea to call the camel the ship of the desert but it would hardly lead one far in training that useful beast o aristotle if you had had the advantage of being the freshest modern instead of the greatest ancient would you not have mingled your praise of metaphorical speech as a sign of high intelligence with a lamentation that intelligence so rarely shows itself in speech without metaphorthat we can so seldom declare what a thing is except by saying it is something else  tom tulliver being abundant in no form of speech did not use any metaphor to declare his views as to the nature of latin he never called it an instrument of torture and it was not until he had got on some way in the next halfyear and in the delectus that he was advanced enough to call it a bore and beastly stuff at present in relation to this demand that he should learn latin declensions and conjugations tom was in a state of as blank unimaginativeness concerning the cause and tendency of his sufferings as if he had been an innocent shrewmouse imprisoned in the split trunk of an ashtree in order to cure lameness in cattle it is doubtless almost incredible to instructed minds of the present day that a boy of twelve not belonging strictly to the masses who are now understood to have the monopoly of mental darkness should have had no distinct idea how there came to be such a thing as latin on this earth yet so it was with tom it would have taken a long while to make conceivable to him that there ever existed a people who bought and sold sheep and oxen and transacted the everyday affairs of life through the medium of this language and still longer to make him understand why he should be called upon to learn it when its connection with those affairs had become entirely latent so far as tom had gained any acquaintance with the romans at mr jacobs academy his knowledge was strictly correct but it went no farther than the fact that they were in the new testament and mr stelling was not the man to enfeeble and emasculate his pupils mind by simplifying and explaining or to reduce the tonic effect of etymology by mixing it with smattering extraneous information such as is given to girls  yet strange to say under this vigorous treatment tom became more like a girl than he had ever been in his life before he had a large share of pride which had hitherto found itself very comfortable in the world despising old goggles and reposing in the sense of unquestioned rights but now this same pride met with nothing but bruises and crushings tom was too clearsighted not to be aware that mr stellings standard of things was quite different was certainly something higher in the eyes of the world than that of the people he had been living amongst and that brought in contact with it he tom tulliver appeared uncouth and stupid he was by no means indifferent to this and his pride got into an uneasy condition which quite nullified his boyish selfsatisfaction and gave him something of the girls susceptibility he was a very firm not to say obstinate disposition but there was no brutelike rebellion and recklessness in his nature the human sensibilities predominated and if it had occurred to him that he could enable himself to show some quickness at his lessons and so acquire mr stellings approbation by standing on one leg for an inconvenient length of time or rapping his head moderately against the wall or any voluntary action of that sort he would certainly have tried it but no tom had never heard that these measures would brighten the understanding or strengthen the verbal memory and he was not given to hypothesis and experiment it did occur to him that he could perhaps get some help by praying for it but as the prayers he said every evening were forms learned by heart he rather shrank from the novelty and irregularity of introducing an extempore passage on a topic of petition for which he was not aware of any precedent but one day when he had broken down for the fifth time in the supines of the third conjugation and mr stelling convinced that this must be carelessness since it transcended the bounds of possible stupidity had lectured him very seriously pointing out that if he failed to seize the present golden opportunity of learning supines he would have to regret it when he became a mantom more miserable than usual determined to try his sole resource and that evening after his usual form of prayer for his parents and little sister he had begun to pray for maggie when she was a baby and that he might be able always to keep gods commandments he added in the same low whisper and please to make me always remember my latin he paused a little to consider how he should pray about euclidwhether he should ask to see what it meant or whether there was any other mental state which would be more applicable to the case but at last he added and make mr stelling say i shant do euclid any more amen  the fact that he got through his supines without mistake the next day encouraged him to persevere in this appendix to his prayers and neutralized any scepticism that might have arisen from mr stellings continued demand for euclid but his faith broke down under the apparent absence of all help when he got into the irregular verbs it seemed clear that toms despair under the caprices of the present tense did not constitute a nodus worthy of interference and since this was the climax of his difficulties where was the use of praying for help any longer he made up his mind to this conclusion in one of his dull lonely evenings which he spent in the study preparing his lessons for the morrow his eyes were apt to get dim over the page though he hated crying and was ashamed of it he couldnt help thinking with some affection even of spouncer whom he used to fight and quarrel with he would have felt at home with spouncer and in a condition of superiority and then the mill and the river and yap pricking up his ears ready to obey the least sign when tom said hoigh would all come before him in a sort of calenture when his fingers played absently in his pocket with his great knife and his coil of whipcord and other relics of the past  tom as i said had never been so much like a girl in his life before and at that epoch of irregular verbs his spirit was further depressed by a new means of mental development which had been thought of for him out of school hours mrs stelling had lately had her second baby and as nothing could be more salutary for a boy than to feel himself useful mrs stelling considered she was doing tom a service by setting him to watch the little cherub laura while the nurse was occupied with the sickly baby it was quite a pretty employment for tom to take little laura out in the sunniest hour of the autumn day it would help to make him feel that lorton parsonage was a home for him and that he was one of the family the little cherub laura not being an accomplished walker at present had a ribbon fastened round her waist by which tom held her as if she had been a little dog during the minutes in which she chose to walk but as these were rare he was for the most part carrying this fine child round and round the garden within sight of mrs stellings window according to orders if any one considers this unfair and even oppressive toward tom i beg him to consider that there are feminine virtues which are with difficulty combined even if they are not incompatible when the wife of a poor curate contrives under all her disadvantages to dress extremely well and to have a style of coiffure which requires that her nurse shall occasionally officiate as ladysmaid when moreover her dinnerparties and her drawingroom show that effort at elegance and completeness of appointment to which ordinary women might imagine a large income necessary it would be unreasonable to expect of her that she should employ a second nurse or even act as a nurse herself mr stelling knew better he saw that his wife did wonders already and was proud of her it was certainly not the best thing in the world for young tullivers gait to carry a heavy child but he had plenty of exercise in long walks with himself and next halfyear mr stelling would see about having a drillingmaster among the many means whereby mr stelling intended to be more fortunate than the bulk of his fellowmen he had entirely given up that of having his own way in his own house what then he had married as kind a little soul as ever breathed according to mr riley who had been acquainted with mrs stellings blond ringlets and smiling demeanor throughout her maiden life and on the strength of that knowledge would have been ready any day to pronounce that whatever domestic differences might arise in her married life must be entirely mr stellings fault  if tom had had a worse disposition he would certainly have hated the little cherub laura but he was too kindhearted a lad for that there was too much in him of the fibre that turns to true manliness and to protecting pity for the weak i am afraid he hated mrs stelling and contracted a lasting dislike to pale blond ringlets and broad plaits as directly associated with haughtiness of manner and a frequent reference to other peoples duty but he couldnt help playing with little laura and liking to amuse her he even sacrificed his percussioncaps for her sake in despair of their ever serving a greater purposethinking the small flash and bang would delight her and thereby drawing down on himself a rebuke from mrs stelling for teaching her child to play with fire laura was a sort of playfellowand oh how tom longed for playfellows in his secret heart he yearned to have maggie with him and was almost ready to dote on her exasperating acts of forgetfulness though when he was at home he always represented it as a great favor on his part to let maggie trot by his side on his pleasure excursions  and before this dreary halfyear was ended maggie actually came mrs stelling had given a general invitation for the little girl to come and stay with her brother so when mr tulliver drove over to kings lorton late in october maggie came too with the sense that she was taking a great journey and beginning to see the world it was mr tullivers first visit to see tom for the lad must learn not to think too much about home  well my lad he said to tom when mr stelling had left the room to announce the arrival to his wife and maggie had begun to kiss tom freely you look rarely school agrees with you  tom wished he had looked rather ill  i dont think i am well father said tom i wish youd ask mr stelling not to let me do euclid it brings on the toothache i think  the toothache was the only malady to which tom had ever been subject  euclid my ladwhy whats that said mr tulliver  oh i dont know its definitions and axioms and triangles and things its a book ive got to learn intheres no sense in it  go go said mr tulliver reprovingly you mustnt say so you must learn what your master tells you he knows what its right for you to learn  ill help you now tom said maggie with a little air of patronizing consolation im come to stay ever so long if mrs stelling asks me ive brought my box and my pinafores havent i father  you help me you silly little thing said tom in such high spirits at this announcement that he quite enjoyed the idea of confounding maggie by showing her a page of euclid i should like to see you doing one of my lessons why i learn latin too girls never learn such things theyre too silly  i know what latin is very well said maggie confidently latins a language there are latin words in the dictionary theres bonus a gift  now youre just wrong there miss maggie said tom secretly astonished you think youre very wise but bonus means good as it happensbonus bona bonum  well thats no reason why it shouldnt mean gift said maggie stoutly it may mean several things almost every word does theres lawnit means the grassplot as well as the stuff pockethandkerchiefs are made of  well done little un said mr tulliver laughing while tom felt rather disgusted with maggies knowingness though beyond measure cheerful at the thought that she was going to stay with him her conceit would soon be overawed by the actual inspection of his books  mrs stelling in her pressing invitation did not mention a longer time than a week for maggies stay but mr stelling who took her between his knees and asked her where she stole her dark eyes from insisted that she must stay a fortnight maggie thought mr stelling was a charming man and mr tulliver was quite proud to leave his little wench where she would have an opportunity of showing her cleverness to appreciating strangers so it was agreed that she should not be fetched home till the end of the fortnight  now then come with me into the study maggie said tom as their father drove away what do you shake and toss your head now for you silly he continued for though her hair was now under a new dispensation and was brushed smoothly behind her ears she seemed still in imagination to be tossing it out of her eyes it makes you look as if you were crazy  oh i cant help it said maggie impatiently dont tease me tom oh what books she exclaimed as she saw the bookcases in the study how i should like to have as many books as that  why you couldnt read one of em said tom triumphantly theyre all latin  no they arent said maggie i can read the back of thishistory of the decline and fall of the roman empire  well what does that mean you dont know said tom wagging his head  but i could soon find out said maggie scornfully  why how  i should look inside and see what it was about  youd better not miss maggie said tom seeing her hand on the volume mr stelling lets nobody touch his books without leave and i shall catch it if you take it out  oh very well let me see all your books then said maggie turning to throw her arms round toms neck and rub his cheek with her small round nose  tom in the gladness of his heart at having dear old maggie to dispute with and crow over again seized her round the waist and began to jump with her round the large library table away they jumped with more and more vigor till maggies hair flew from behind her ears and twirled about like an animated mop but the revolutions round the table became more and more irregular in their sweep till at last reaching mr stellings reading stand they sent it thundering down with its heavy lexicons to the floor happily it was the groundfloor and the study was a onestoried wing to the house so that the downfall made no alarming resonance though tom stood dizzy and aghast for a few minutes dreading the appearance of mr or mrs stelling  oh i say maggie said tom at last lifting up the stand we must keep quiet here you know if we break anything mrs stellingll make us cry peccavi  whats that said maggie  oh its the latin for a good scolding said tom not without some pride in his knowledge  is she a cross woman said maggie  i believe you said tom with an emphatic nod  i think all women are crosser than men said maggie aunt gleggs a great deal crosser than uncle glegg and mother scolds me more than father does  well youll be a woman some day said tom so you neednt talk  but i shall be a clever woman said maggie with a toss  oh i dare say and a nasty conceited thing everybodyll hate you  but you oughtnt to hate me tom itll be very wicked of you for i shall be your sister  yes but if youre a nasty disagreeable thing i shall hate you  oh but tom you wont i shant be disagreeable i shall be very good to you and i shall be good to everybody you wont hate me really will you tom  oh bother never mind come its time for me to learn my lessons see here what ive got to do said tom drawing maggie toward him and showing her his theorem while she pushed her hair behind her ears and prepared herself to prove her capability of helping him in euclid she began to read with full confidence in her own powers but presently becoming quite bewildered her face flushed with irritation it was unavoidable she must confess her incompetency and she was not fond of humiliation  its nonsense she said and very ugly stuff nobody need want to make it out  ah there now miss maggie said tom drawing the book away and wagging his head at her you see youre not so clever as you thought you were  oh said maggie pouting i dare say i could make it out if id learned what goes before as you have  but thats what you just couldnt miss wisdom said tom for its all the harder when you know what goes before for then youve got to say what definition 3 is and what axiom v is but get along with you now i must go on with this heres the latin grammar see what you can make of that  maggie found the latin grammar quite soothing after her mathematical mortification for she delighted in new words and quickly found that there was an english key at the end which would make her very wise about latin at slight expense she presently made up her mind to skip the rules in the syntax the examples became so absorbing these mysterious sentences snatched from an unknown contextlike strange horns of beasts and leaves of unknown plants brought from some faroff regiongave boundless scope to her imagination and were all the more fascinating because they were in a peculiar tongue of their own which she could learn to interpret it was really very interesting the latin grammar that tom had said no girls could learn and she was proud because she found it interesting the most fragmentary examples were her favourites mors omnibus est communis would have been jejune only she liked to know the latin but the fortunate gentleman whom every one congratulated because he had a son endowed with such a disposition afforded her a great deal of pleasant conjecture and she was quite lost in the thick grove penetrable by no star when tom called out  now then magsie give us the grammar  oh tom its such a pretty book she said as she jumped out of the large armchair to give it him its much prettier than the dictionary i could learn latin very soon i dont think its at all hard  oh i know what youve been doing said tom youve been reading the english at the end any donkey can do that  tom seized the book and opened it with a determined and businesslike air as much as to say that he had a lesson to learn which no donkeys would find themselves equal to maggie rather piqued turned to the bookcases to amuse herself with puzzling out the titles  presently tom called to her here magsie come and hear if i can say this stand at that end of the table where mr stelling sits when he hears me  maggie obeyed and took the open book  where do you begin tom  oh i begin at appellativa arborum because i say all over again what ive been learning this week  tom sailed along pretty well for three lines and maggie was beginning to forget her office of prompter in speculating as to what mas could mean which came twice over when he stuck fast at sunt etiam volucrum  dont tell me maggie sunt etiam volucrumsunt etiam volucrumut ostrea cetus  no said maggie opening her mouth and shaking her head  sunt etiam volucrum said tom very slowly as if the next words might be expected to come sooner when he gave them this strong hint that they were waited for  c e u said maggie getting impatient  oh i knowhold your tongue said tom ceu passer hirundo ferarumferarum tom took his pencil and made several hard dots with it on his bookcoverferarum  oh dear oh dear tom said maggie what a time you are ut  ut ostrea  no no said maggie ut tigris  oh yes now i can do said tom it was tigris vulpes id forgotten ut tigris volupes et piscium  with some further stammering and repetition tom got through the next few lines  now then he said the next is what ive just learned for tomorrow give me hold of the book a minute  after some whispered gabbling assisted by the beating of his fist on the table tom returned the book  mascula nomina in a he began  no tom said maggie that doesnt come next its nomen non creskens genittivo  creskens genittivo exclaimed tom with a derisive laugh for tom had learned this omitted passage for his yesterdays lesson and a young gentleman does not require an intimate or extensive acquaintance with latin before he can feel the pitiable absurdity of a false quantity creskens genittivo what a little silly you are maggie  well you neednt laugh tom for you didnt remember it at all im sure its spelt so how was i to know  pheeeeh i told you girls couldnt learn latin its nomen non crescens genitivo  very well then said maggie pouting i can say that as well as you can and you dont mind your stops for you ought to stop twice as long at a semicolon as you do at a comma and you make the longest stops where there ought to be no stop at all  oh well dont chatter let me go on  they were presently fetched to spend the rest of the evening in the drawingroom and maggie became so animated with mr stelling who she felt sure admired her cleverness that tom was rather amazed and alarmed at her audacity but she was suddenly subdued by mr stellings alluding to a little girl of whom he had heard that she once ran away to the gypsies  what a very odd little girl that must be said mrs stelling meaning to be playful but a playfulness that turned on her supposed oddity was not at all to maggies taste she feared that mr stelling after all did not think much of her and went to bed in rather low spirits mrs stelling she felt looked at her as if she thought her hair was very ugly because it hung down straight behind  nevertheless it was a very happy fortnight to maggie this visit to tom she was allowed to be in the study while he had his lessons and in her various readings got very deep into the examples in the latin grammar the astronomer who hated women generally caused her so much puzzling speculation that she one day asked mr stelling if all astronomers hated women or whether it was only this particular astronomer but forestalling his answer she said  i suppose its all astronomers because you know they live up in high towers and if the women came there they might talk and hinder them from looking at the stars  mr stelling liked her prattle immensely and they were on the best terms she told tom she should like to go to school to mr stelling as he did and learn just the same things she knew she could do euclid for she had looked into it again and she saw what a b c meant they were the names of the lines  im sure you couldnt do it now said tom and ill just ask mr stelling if you could  i dont mind said the little conceited minx ill ask him myself  mr stelling she said that same evening when they were in the drawingroom couldnt i do euclid and all toms lessons if you were to teach me instead of him  no you couldnt said tom indignantly girls cant do euclid can they sir  they can pick up a little of everything i dare say said mr stelling theyve a great deal of superficial cleverness but they couldnt go far into anything theyre quick and shallow  tom delighted with this verdict telegraphed his triumph by wagging his head at maggie behind mr stellings chair as for maggie she had hardly ever been so mortified she had been so proud to be called quick all her little life and now it appeared that this quickness was the brand of inferiority it would have been better to be slow like tom  ha ha miss maggie said tom when they were alone you see its not such a fine thing to be quick youll never go far into anything you know  and maggie was so oppressed by this dreadful destiny that she had no spirit for a retort  but when this small apparatus of shallow quickness was fetched away in the gig by luke and the study was once more quite lonely for tom he missed her grievously he had really been brighter and had got through his lessons better since she had been there and she had asked mr stelling so many questions about the roman empire and whether there really ever was a man who said in latin i would not buy it for a farthing or a rotten nut or whether that had only been turned into latin that tom had actually come to a dim understanding of the fact that there had once been people upon the earth who were so fortunate as to know latin without learning it through the medium of the eton grammar this luminous idea was a great addition to his historical acquirements during this halfyear which were otherwise confined to an epitomized history of the jews  but the dreary halfyear did come to an end how glad tom was to see the last yellow leaves fluttering before the cold wind the dark afternoons and the first december snow seemed to him far livelier than the august sunshine and that he might make himself the surer about the flight of the days that were carrying him homeward he stuck twentyone sticks deep in a corner of the garden when he was three weeks from the holidays and pulled one up every day with a great wrench throwing it to a distance with a vigor of will which would have carried it to limbo if it had been in the nature of sticks to travel so far  but it was worth purchasing even at the heavy price of the latin grammar the happiness of seeing the bright light in the parlor at home as the gig passed noiselessly over the snowcovered bridge the happiness of passing from the cold air to the warmth and the kisses and the smiles of that familiar hearth where the pattern of the rug and the grate and the fireirons were first ideas that it was no more possible to criticise than the solidity and extension of matter there is no sense of ease like the ease we felt in those scenes where we were born where objects became dear to us before we had known the labor of choice and where the outer world seemed only an extension of our own personality we accepted and loved it as we accepted our own sense of existence and our own limbs very commonplace even ugly that furniture of our early home might look if it were put up to auction an improved taste in upholstery scorns it and is not the striving after something better and better in our surroundings the grand characteristic that distinguishes man from the brute or to satisfy a scrupulous accuracy of definition that distinguishes the british man from the foreign brute but heaven knows where that striving might lead us if our affections had not a trick of twining round those old inferior things if the loves and sanctities of our life had no deep immovable roots in memory ones delight in an elderberry bush overhanging the confused leafage of a hedgerow bank as a more gladdening sight than the finest cistus or fuchsia spreading itself on the softest undulating turf is an entirely unjustifiable preference to a nurserygardener or to any of those regulated minds who are free from the weakness of any attachment that does not rest on a demonstrable superiority of qualities and there is no better reason for preferring this elderberry bush than that it stirs an early memory that it is no novelty in my life speaking to me merely through my present sensibilities to form and color but the long companion of my existence that wove itself into my joys when joys were vivid    chapter ii  the christmas holidays   fine old christmas with the snowy hair and ruddy face had done his duty that year in the noblest fashion and had set off his rich gifts of warmth and color with all the heightening contrast of frost and snow  snow lay on the croft and riverbank in undulations softer than the limbs of infancy it lay with the neatliest finished border on every sloping roof making the darkred gables stand out with a new depth of color it weighed heavily on the laurels and firtrees till it fell from them with a shuddering sound it clothed the rough turnipfield with whiteness and made the sheep look like dark blotches the gates were all blocked up with the sloping drifts and here and there a disregarded fourfooted beast stood as if petrified in unrecumbent sadness there was no gleam no shadow for the heavens too were one still pale cloud no sound or motion in anything but the dark river that flowed and moaned like an unresting sorrow but old christmas smiled as he laid this cruelseeming spell on the outdoor world for he meant to light up home with new brightness to deepen all the richness of indoor color and give a keener edge of delight to the warm fragrance of food he meant to prepare a sweet imprisonment that would strengthen the primitive fellowship of kindred and make the sunshine of familiar human faces as welcome as the hidden daystar his kindness fell but hardly on the homelessfell but hardly on the homes where the hearth was not very warm and where the food had little fragrance where the human faces had had no sunshine in them but rather the leaden blankeyed gaze of unexpectant want but the fine old season meant well and if he has not learned the secret how to bless men impartially it is because his father time with everunrelenting unrelenting purpose still hides that secret in his own mighty slowbeating heart  and yet this christmas day in spite of toms fresh delight in home was not he thought somehow or other quite so happy as it had always been before the red berries were just as abundant on the holly and he and maggie had dressed all the windows and mantlepieces and pictureframes on christmas eve with as much taste as ever wedding the thickset scarlet clusters with branches of the blackberried ivy there had been singing under the windows after midnightsupernatural singing maggie always felt in spite of toms contemptuous insistence that the singers were old patch the parish clerk and the rest of the church choir she trembled with awe when their carolling broke in upon her dreams and the image of men in fustian clothes was always thrust away by the vision of angels resting on the parted cloud the midnight chant had helped as usual to lift the morning above the level of common days and then there were the smell of hot toast and ale from the kitchen at the breakfast hour the favorite anthem the green boughs and the short sermon gave the appropriate festal character to the churchgoing and aunt and uncle moss with all their seven children were looking like so many reflectors of the bright parlorfire when the churchgoers came back stamping the snow from their feet the plumpudding was of the same handsome roundness as ever and came in with the symbolic blue flames around it as if it had been heroically snatched from the nether fires into which it had been thrown by dyspeptic puritans the dessert was as splendid as ever with its golden oranges brown nuts and the crystalline light and dark of applejelly and damson cheese in all these things christmas was as it had always been since tom could remember it was only distinguished it by anything by superior sliding and snowballs  christmas was cheery but not so mr tulliver he was irate and defiant and tom though he espoused his fathers quarrels and shared his fathers sense of injury was not without some of the feeling that oppressed maggie when mr tulliver got louder and more angry in narration and assertion with the increased leisure of dessert the attention that tom might have concentrated on his nuts and wine was distracted by a sense that there were rascally enemies in the world and that the business of grownup life could hardly be conducted without a good deal of quarrelling now tom was not fond of quarrelling unless it could soon be put an end to by a fair standup fight with an adversary whom he had every chance of thrashing and his fathers irritable talk made him uncomfortable though he never accounted to himself for the feeling or conceived the notion that his father was faulty in this respect  the particular embodiment of the evil principle now exciting mr tullivers determined resistance was mr pivart who having lands higher up the ripple was taking measures for their irrigation which either were or would be or were bound to be on the principle that water was water an infringement on mr tullivers legitimate share of waterpower dix who had a mill on the stream was a feeble auxiliary of old harry compared with pivart dix had been brought to his senses by arbitration and wakems advice had not carried him far no dix mr tulliver considered had been as good as nowhere in point of law and in the intensity of his indignation against pivart his contempt for a baffled adversary like dix began to wear the air of a friendly attachment he had no male audience today except mr moss who knew nothing as he said of the natur o mills and could only assent to mr tullivers arguments on the a priori ground of family relationship and monetary obligation but mr tulliver did not talk with the futile intention of convincing his audience he talked to relieve himself while good mr moss made strong efforts to keep his eyes wide open in spite of the sleepiness which an unusually good dinner produced in his hardworked frame mrs moss more alive to the subject and interested in everything that affected her brother listened and put in a word as often as maternal preoccupations allowed  why pivarts a new name hereabout brother isnt it she said he didnt own the land in fathers time nor yours either before i was married  new name yes i should think it is a new name said mr tulliver with angry emphasis dorlcote mills been in our family a hundred year and better and nobody ever heard of a pivart meddling with the river till this fellow came and bought bincomes farm out of hand before anybody else could so much as say snap but ill pivart him added mr tulliver lifting his glass with a sense that he had defined his resolution in an unmistakable manner  you wont be forced to go to law with him i hope brother said mrs moss with some anxiety  i dont know what i shall be forced to but i know what i shall force him to with his dikes and erigations if theres any law to be brought to bear o the right side i know well enough whos at the bottom of it hes got wakem to back him and egg him on i know wakem tells him the law cant touch him for it but theres folks can handle the law besides wakem it takes a big raskil to beat him but theres bigger to be found as know more o th ins and outs o the law else how came wakem to lose brumleys suit for him  mr tulliver was a strictly honest man and proud of being honest but he considered that in law the ends of justice could only be achieved by employing a stronger knave to frustrate a weaker law was a sort of cockfight in which it was the business of injured honesty to get a game bird with the best pluck and the strongest spurs  gores no fool you neednt tell me that he observed presently in a pugnacious tone as if poor gritty had been urging that lawyers capabilities but you see he isnt up to the law as wakem is and waters a very particular thing you cant pick it up with a pitchfork thats why its been nuts to old harry and the lawyers its plain enough whats the rights and the wrongs of water if you look at it straightforrard for a rivers a river and if youve got a mill you must have water to turn it and its no use telling me pivarts erigation and nonsense wont stop my wheel i know what belongs to water better than that talk to me o what th engineers say i say its common sense as pivarts dikes must do me an injury but if thats their engineering ill put tom to it byandby and he shall see if he cant find a bit more sense in th engineering business than what that comes to  tom looking round with some anxiety at this announcement of his prospects unthinkingly withdrew a small rattle he was amusing baby moss with whereupon she being a baby that knew her own mind with remarkable clearness instantaneously expressed her sentiments in a piercing yell and was not to be appeased even by the restoration of the rattle feeling apparently that the original wrong of having it taken from her remained in all its force mrs moss hurried away with her into another room and expressed to mrs tulliver who accompanied her the conviction that the dear child had good reasons for crying implying that if it was supposed to be the rattle that baby clamored for she was a misunderstood baby the thoroughly justifiable yell being quieted mrs moss looked at her sisterinlaw and said  im sorry to see brother so put out about this water work  its your brothers way mrs moss id never anything o that sort before i was married said mrs tulliver with a halfimplied reproach she always spoke of her husband as your brother to mrs moss in any case when his line of conduct was not matter of pure admiration amiable mrs tulliver who was never angry in her life had yet her mild share of that spirit without which she could hardly have been at once a dodson and a woman being always on the defensive toward her own sisters it was natural that she should be keenly conscious of her superiority even as the weakest dodson over a husbands sister who besides being poorly off and inclined to hang on her brother had the goodnatured submissiveness of a large easytempered untidy prolific woman with affection enough in her not only for her own husband and abundant children but for any number of collateral relations  i hope and pray he wont go to law said mrs moss for theres never any knowing where thatll end and the right doesnt allays win this mr pivarts a rich man by what i can make out and the rich mostly get things their own way  as to that said mrs tulliver stroking her dress down ive seen what riches are in my own family for my sisters have got husbands as can afford to do pretty much what they like but i think sometimes i shall be drove off my head with the talk about this law and erigation and my sisters lay all the fault to me for they dont know what it is to marry a man like your brother how should they sister pullet has her own way from morning till night  well said mrs moss i dont think i should like my husband if he hadnt got any wits of his own and i had to find headpiece for him its a deal easier to do what pleases ones husband than to be puzzling what else one should do  if people come to talk o doing what pleases their husbands said mrs tulliver with a faint imitation of her sister glegg im sure your brother might have waited a long while before hed have found a wife that ud have let him have his say in everything as i do its nothing but law and erigation now from when we first get up in the morning till we go to bed at night and i never contradict him i only say well mr tulliver do as you like but whativer you do dont go to law  mrs tulliver as we have seen was not without influence over her husband no woman is she can always incline him to do either what she wishes or the reverse and on the composite impulses that were threatening to hurry mr tulliver into law mrs tullivers monotonous pleading had doubtless its share of force it might even be comparable to that proverbial feather which has the credit or discredit of breaking the camels back though on a strictly impartial view the blame ought rather to lie with the previous weight of feathers which had already placed the back in such imminent peril that an otherwise innocent feather could not settle on it without mischief not that mrs tullivers feeble beseeching could have had this feathers weight in virtue of her single personality but whenever she departed from entire assent to her husband he saw in her the representative of the dodson family and it was a guiding principle with mr tulliver to let the dodsons know that they were not to domineer over him ormore specificallythat a male tulliver was far more than equal to four female dodsons even though one of them was mrs glegg  but not even a direct argument from that typical dodson female herself against his going to law could have heightened his disposition toward it so much as the mere thought of wakem continually freshened by the sight of the too able attorney on marketdays wakem to his certain knowledge was metaphorically speaking at the bottom of pivarts irrigation wakem had tried to make dix stand out and go to law about the dam it was unquestionably wakem who had caused mr tulliver to lose the suit about the right of road and the bridge that made a thoroughfare of his land for every vagabond who preferred an opportunity of damaging private property to walking like an honest man along the highroad all lawyers were more or less rascals but wakems rascality was of that peculiarly aggravated kind which placed itself in opposition to that form of right embodied in mr tullivers interests and opinions and as an extra touch of bitterness the injured miller had recently in borrowing the five hundred pounds been obliged to carry a little business to wakems office on his own account a hooknosed glib fellow as cool as a cucumberalways looking so sure of his game and it was vexatious that lawyer gore was not more like him but was a bald roundfeatured man with bland manners and fat hands a gamecock that you would be rash to bet upon against wakem gore was a sly fellow his weakness did not lie on the side of scrupulosity but the largest amount of winking however significant is not equivalent to seeing through a stone wall and confident as mr tulliver was in his principle that water was water and in the direct inference that pivart had not a leg to stand on in this affair of irrigation he had an uncomfortable suspicion that wakem had more law to show against this rationally irrefragable inference than gore could show for it but then if they went to law there was a chance for mr tulliver to employ counsellor wylde on his side instead of having that admirable bully against him and the prospect of seeing a witness of wakems made to perspire and become confounded as mr tullivers witness had once been was alluring to the love of retributive justice  much rumination had mr tulliver on these puzzling subjects during his rides on the gray horse much turning of the head from side to side as the scales dipped alternately but the probable result was still out of sight only to be reached through much hot argument and iteration in domestic and social life that initial stage of the dispute which consisted in the narration of the case and the enforcement of mr tullivers views concerning it throughout the entire circle of his connections would necessarily take time and at the beginning of february when tom was going to school again there were scarcely any new items to be detected in his fathers statement of the case against pivart or any more specific indication of the measures he was bent on taking against that rash contravener of the principle that water was water iteration like friction is likely to generate heat instead of progress and mr tullivers heat was certainly more and more palpable if there had been no new evidence on any other point there had been new evidence that pivart was as thick as mud with wakem  father said tom one evening near the end of the holidays uncle glegg says lawyer wakem is going to send his son to mr stelling it isnt true what they said about his going to be sent to france you wont like me to go to school with wakems son shall you  its no matter for that my boy said mr tulliver dont you learn anything bad of him thats all the lads a poor deformed creatur and takes after his mother in the face i think there isnt much of his father in him its a sign wakem thinks high o mr sterling as he sends his son to him and wakem knows meal from bran  mr tulliver in his heart was rather proud of the fact that his son was to have the same advantages as wakems but tom was not at all easy on the point it would have been much clearer if the lawyers son had not been deformed for then tom would have had the prospect of pitching into him with all that freedom which is derived from a high moral sanction    chapter iii  the new schoolfellow   it was a cold wet january day on which tom went back to school a day quite in keeping with this severe phase of his destiny if he had not carried in his pocket a parcel of sugarcandy and a small dutch doll for little laura there would have been no ray of expected pleasure to enliven the general gloom but he liked to think how laura would put out her lips and her tiny hands for the bits of sugarcandy and to give the greater keenness to these pleasures of imagination he took out the parcel made a small hole in the paper and bit off a crystal or two which had so solacing an effect under the confined prospect and damp odors of the gigumbrella that he repeated the process more than once on his way  well tulliver were glad to see you again said mr stelling heartily take off your wrappings and come into the study till dinner youll find a bright fire there and a new companion  tom felt in an uncomfortable flutter as he took off his woollen comforter and other wrappings he had seen philip wakem at st oggs but had always turned his eyes away from him as quickly as possible he would have disliked having a deformed boy for his companion even if philip had not been the son of a bad man and tom did not see how a bad mans son could be very good his own father was a good man and he would readily have fought any one who said the contrary he was in a state of mingled embarrassment and defiance as he followed mr stelling to the study  here is a new companion for you to shake hands with tulliver said that gentleman on entering the studymaster philip wakem i shall leave you to make acquaintance by yourselves you already know something of each other i imagine for you are neighbors at home  tom looked confused and awkward while philip rose and glanced at him timidly tom did not like to go up and put out his hand and he was not prepared to say how do you do on so short a notice  mr stelling wisely turned away and closed the door behind him boys shyness only wears off in the absence of their elders  philip was at once too proud and too timid to walk toward tom he thought or rather felt that tom had an aversion to looking at him every one almost disliked looking at him and his deformity was more conspicuous when he walked so they remained without shaking hands or even speaking while tom went to the fire and warmed himself every now and then casting furtive glances at philip who seemed to be drawing absently first one object and then another on a piece of paper he had before him he had seated himself again and as he drew was thinking what he could say to tom and trying to overcome his own repugnance to making the first advances  tom began to look oftener and longer at philips face for he could see it without noticing the hump and it was really not a disagreeable facevery oldlooking tom thought he wondered how much older philip was than himself an anatomisteven a mere physiognomist would have seen that the deformity of philips spine was not a congenital hump but the result of an accident in infancy but you do not expect from tom any acquaintance with such distinctions to him philip was simply a humpback he had a vague notion that the deformity of wakems son had some relation to the lawyers rascality of which he had so often heard his father talk with hot emphasis and he felt too a halfadmitted fear of him as probably a spiteful fellow who not being able to fight you had cunning ways of doing you a mischief by the sly there was a humpbacked tailor in the neighborhood of mr jacobss academy who was considered a very unamiable character and was much hooted after by publicspirited boys solely on the ground of his unsatisfactory moral qualities so that tom was not without a basis of fact to go upon still no face could be more unlike that ugly tailors than this melancholy boys facethe brown hair round it waved and curled at the ends like a girls tom thought that truly pitiable this wakem was a pale puny fellow and it was quite clear he would not be able to play at anything worth speaking of but he handled his pencil in an enviable manner and was apparently making one thing after another without any trouble what was he drawing tom was quite warm now and wanted something new to be going forward it was certainly more agreeable to have an illnatured humpback as a companion than to stand looking out of the study window at the rain and kicking his foot against the washboard in solitude something would happen every day a quarrel or something and tom thought he should rather like to show philip that he had better not try his spiteful tricks on him he suddenly walked across the hearth and looked over philips paper  why thats a donkey with panniers and a spaniel and partridges in the corn he exclaimed his tongue being completely loosed by surprise and admiration oh my buttons i wish i could draw like that im to learn drawing this half i wonder if i shall learn to make dogs and donkeys  oh you can do them without learning said philip i never learned drawing  never learned said tom in amazement why when i make dogs and horses and those things the heads and the legs wont come right though i can see how they ought to be very well i can make houses and all sorts of chimneyschimneys going all down the walland windows in the roof and all that but i dare say i could do dogs and horses if i was to try more he added reflecting that philip might falsely suppose that he was going to knock under if he were too frank about the imperfection of his accomplishments  oh yes said philip its very easy youve only to look well at things and draw them over and over again what you do wrong once you can alter the next time  but havent you been taught anything said tom beginning to have a puzzled suspicion that philips crooked back might be the source of remarkable faculties i thought youd been to school a long while  yes said philip smiling ive been taught latin and greek and mathematics and writing and such things  oh but i say you dont like latin though do you said tom lowering his voice confidentially  pretty well i dont care much about it said philip  ah but perhaps you havent got into the propria quæ maribus said tom nodding his head sideways as much as to say that was the test it was easy talking till you came to that  philip felt some bitter complacency in the promising stupidity of this wellmade activelooking boy but made polite by his own extreme sensitiveness as well as by his desire to conciliate he checked his inclination to laugh and said quietly  ive done with the grammar i dont learn that any more  then you wont have the same lessons as i shall said tom with a sense of disappointment  no but i dare say i can help you i shall be very glad to help you if i can  tom did not say thank you for he was quite absorbed in the thought that wakems son did not seem so spiteful a fellow as might have been expected  i say he said presently do you love your father  yes said philip coloring deeply dont you love yours  oh yesi only wanted to know said tom rather ashamed of himself now he saw philip coloring and looking uncomfortable he found much difficulty in adjusting his attitude of mind toward the son of lawyer wakem and it had occurred to him that if philip disliked his father that fact might go some way toward clearing up his perplexity  shall you learn drawing now he said by way of changing the subject  no said philip my father wishes me to give all my time to other things now  what latin and euclid and those things said tom  yes said philip who had left off using his pencil and was resting his head on one hand while tom was learning forward on both elbows and looking with increasing admiration at the dog and the donkey  and you dont mind that said tom with strong curiosity  no i like to know what everybody else knows i can study what i like byandby  i cant think why anybody should learn latin said tom its no good  its part of the education of a gentleman said philip all gentlemen learn the same things  what do you think sir john crake the master of the harriers knows latin said tom who had often thought he should like to resemble sir john crake  he learned it when he was a boy of course said philip but i dare say hes forgotten it  oh well i can do that then said tom not with any epigrammatic intention but with serious satisfaction at the idea that as far as latin was concerned there was no hindrance to his resembling sir john crake only youre obliged to remember it while youre at school else youve got to learn ever so many lines of speaker mr stellings very particulardid you know hell have you up ten times if you say nam for jamhe wont let you go a letter wrong i can tell you  oh i dont mind said philip unable to choke a laugh i can remember things easily and there are some lessons im very fond of im very fond of greek history and everything about the greeks i should like to have been a greek and fought the persians and then have come home and have written tragedies or else have been listened to by everybody for my wisdom like socrates and have died a grand death philip you perceive was not without a wish to impress the wellmade barbarian with a sense of his mental superiority  why were the greeks great fighters said tom who saw a vista in this direction is there anything like david and goliath and samson in the greek history those are the only bits i like in the history of the jews  oh there are very fine stories of that sort about the greeksabout the heroes of early times who killed the wild beasts as samson did and in the odysseythats a beautiful poemtheres a more wonderful giant than goliathpolypheme who had only one eye in the middle of his forehead and ulysses a little fellow but very wise and cunning got a redhot pinetree and stuck it into this one eye and made him roar like a thousand bulls  oh what fun said tom jumping away from the table and stamping first with one leg and then the other i say can you tell me all about those stories because i shant learn greek you know shall i he added pausing in his stamping with a sudden alarm lest the contrary might be possible does every gentleman learn greek will mr stelling make me begin with it do you think  no i should think not very likely not said philip but you may read those stories without knowing greek ive got them in english  oh but i dont like reading id sooner have you tell them me but only the fighting ones you know my sister maggie is always wanting to tell me stories but theyre stupid things girls stories always are can you tell a good many fighting stories  oh yes said philip lots of them besides the greek stories i can tell you about richard cœurdelion and saladin and about william wallace and robert bruce and james douglasi know no end  youre older than i am arent you said tom  why how old are you im fifteen  im only going in fourteen said tom but i thrashed all the fellows at jacobsthats where i was before i came here and i beat em all at bandy and climbing and i wish mr stelling would let us go fishing i could show you how to fish you could fish couldnt you its only standing and sitting still you know  tom in his turn wished to make the balance dip in his favor this hunchback must not suppose that his acquaintance with fighting stories put him on a par with an actual fighting hero like tom tulliver philip winced under this allusion to his unfitness for active sports and he answered almost peevishly  i cant bear fishing i think people look like fools sitting watching a line hour after hour or else throwing and throwing and catching nothing  ah but you wouldnt say they looked like fools when they landed a big pike i can tell you said tom who had never caught anything that was big in his life but whose imagination was on the stretch with indignant zeal for the honor of sport wakems son it was plain had his disagreeable points and must be kept in due check happily for the harmony of this first interview they were now called to dinner and philip was not allowed to develop farther his unsound views on the subject of fishing but tom said to himself that was just what he should have expected from a hunchback    chapter iv  the young idea   the alterations of feeling in that first dialogue between tom and philip continued to make their intercourse even after many weeks of schoolboy intimacy tom never quite lost the feeling that philip being the son of a rascal was his natural enemy never thoroughly overcame his repulsion to philips deformity he was a boy who adhered tenaciously to impressions once received as with all minds in which mere perception predominates over thought and emotion the external remained to him rigidly what it was in the first instance but then it was impossible not to like philips company when he was in a good humor he could help one so well in ones latin exercises which tom regarded as a kind of puzzle that could only be found out by a lucky chance and he could tell such wonderful fighting stories about hal of the wynd for example and other heroes who were especial favorites with tom because they laid about them with heavy strokes he had small opinion of saladin whose cimeter could cut a cushion in two in an instant who wanted to cut cushions that was a stupid story and he didnt care to hear it again but when robert bruce on the black pony rose in his stirrups and lifting his good battleaxe cracked at once the helmet and the skull of the too hasty knight at bannockburn then tom felt all the exaltation of sympathy and if he had had a cocoanut at hand he would have cracked it at once with the poker philip in his happier moods indulged tom to the top of his bent heightening the crash and bang and fury of every fight with all the artillery of epithets and similes at his command but he was not always in a good humor or happy mood the slight spurt of peevish susceptibility which had escaped him in their first interview was a symptom of a perpetually recurring mental ailment half of it nervous irritability half of it the heartbitterness produced by the sense of his deformity in these fits of susceptibility every glance seemed to him to be charged either with offensive pity or with illrepressed disgust at the very least it was an indifferent glance and philip felt indifference as a child of the south feels the chill air of a northern spring poor toms blundering patronage when they were out of doors together would sometimes make him turn upon the wellmeaning lad quite savagely and his eyes usually sad and quiet would flash with anything but playful lightning no wonder tom retained his suspicions of the humpback  but philips selftaught skill in drawing was another link between them for tom found to his disgust that his new drawingmaster gave him no dogs and donkeys to draw but brooks and rustic bridges and ruins all with a general softness of blacklead surface indicating that nature if anything was rather satiny and as toms feeling for the picturesque in landscape was at present quite latent it is not surprising that mr goodrichs productions seemed to him an uninteresting form of art mr tulliver having a vague intention that tom should be put to some business which included the drawing out of plans and maps had complained to mr riley when he saw him at mudport that tom seemed to be learning nothing of that sort whereupon that obliging adviser had suggested that tom should have drawinglessons mr tulliver must not mind paying extra for drawing let tom be made a good draughtsman and he would be able to turn his pencil to any purpose so it was ordered that tom should have drawinglessons and whom should mr stelling have selected as a master if not mr goodrich who was considered quite at the head of his profession within a circuit of twelve miles round kings lorton by which means tom learned to make an extremely fine point to his pencil and to represent landscape with a broad generality which doubtless from a narrow tendency in his mind to details he thought extremely dull  all this you remember happened in those dark ages when there were no schools of design before schoolmasters were invariably men of scrupulous integrity and before the clergy were all men of enlarged minds and varied culture in those less favored days it is no fable that there were other clergymen besides mr stelling who had narrow intellects and large wants and whose income by a logical confusion to which fortune being a female as well as blindfold is peculiarly liable was proportioned not to their wants but to their intellect with which income has clearly no inherent relation the problem these gentlemen had to solve was to readjust the proportion between their wants and their income and since wants are not easily starved to death the simpler method appeared to be to raise their income there was but one way of doing this any of those low callings in which men are obliged to do good work at a low price were forbidden to clergymen was it their fault if their only resource was to turn out very poor work at a high price besides how should mr stelling be expected to know that education was a delicate and difficult business any more than an animal endowed with a power of boring a hole through a rock should be expected to have wide views of excavation mr stellings faculties had been early trained to boring in a straight line and he had no faculty to spare but among toms contemporaries whose fathers cast their sons on clerical instruction to find them ignorant after many days there were many far less lucky than tom tulliver education was almost entirely a matter of luckusually of illluckin those distant days the state of mind in which you take a billiardcue or a dicebox in your hand is one of sober certainty compared with that of oldfashioned fathers like mr tulliver when they selected a school or a tutor for their sons excellent men who had been forced all their lives to spell on an impromptuphonetic system and having carried on a successful business in spite of this disadvantage had acquired money enough to give their sons a better start in life than they had had themselves must necessarily take their chance as to the conscience and the competence of the schoolmaster whose circular fell in their way and appeared to promise so much more than they would ever have thought of asking for including the return of linen fork and spoon it was happy for them if some ambitious draper of their acquaintance had not brought up his son to the church and if that young gentleman at the age of fourandtwenty had not closed his college dissipations by an imprudent marriage otherwise these innocent fathers desirous of doing the best for their offspring could only escape the drapers son by happening to be on the foundation of a grammarschool as yet unvisited by commissioners where two or three boys could have all to themselves the advantages of a large and lofty building together with a headmaster toothless dimeyed and deaf whose erudite indistinctness and inattention were engrossed by them at the rate of three hundred pounds aheada ripe scholar doubtless when first appointed but all ripeness beneath the sun has a further stage less esteemed in the market  tom tulliver then compared with many other british youths of his time who have since had to scramble through life with some fragments of more or less relevant knowledge and a great deal of strictly relevant ignorance was not so very unlucky mr stelling was a broadchested healthy man with the bearing of a gentleman a conviction that a growing boy required a sufficiency of beef and a certain hearty kindness in him that made him like to see tom looking well and enjoying his dinner not a man of refined conscience or with any deep sense of the infinite issues belonging to everyday duties not quite competent to his high offices but incompetent gentlemen must live and without private fortune it is difficult to see how they could all live genteelly if they had nothing to do with education or government besides it was the fault of toms mental constitution that his faculties could not be nourished on the sort of knowledge mr stelling had to communicate a boy born with a deficient power of apprehending signs and abstractions must suffer the penalty of his congenital deficiency just as if he had been born with one leg shorter than the other a method of education sanctioned by the long practice of our venerable ancestors was not to give way before the exceptional dulness of a boy who was merely living at the time then present and mr stelling was convinced that a boy so stupid at signs and abstractions must be stupid at everything else even if that reverend gentleman could have taught him everything else it was the practice of our venerable ancestors to apply that ingenious instrument the thumbscrew and to tighten and tighten it in order to elicit nonexistent facts they had a fixed opinion to begin with that the facts were existent and what had they to do but to tighten the thumbscrew in like manner mr stelling had a fixed opinion that all boys with any capacity could learn what it was the only regular thing to teach if they were slow the thumbscrew must be tightenedthe exercises must be insisted on with increased severity and a page of virgil be awarded as a penalty to encourage and stimulate a too languid inclination to latin verse  the thumbscrew was a little relaxed however during this second halfyear philip was so advanced in his studies and so apt that mr stelling could obtain credit by his facility which required little help much more easily than by the troublesome process of overcoming toms dulness gentlemen with broad chests and ambitious intentions do sometimes disappoint their friends by failing to carry the world before them perhaps it is that high achievements demand some other unusual qualification besides an unusual desire for high prizes perhaps it is that these stalwart gentlemen are rather indolent their divinæ particulum auræ being obstructed from soaring by a too hearty appetite some reason or other there was why mr stelling deferred the execution of many spirited projectswhy he did not begin the editing of his greek play or any other work of scholarship in his leisure hours but after turning the key of his private study with much resolution sat down to one of theodore hooks novels tom was gradually allowed to shuffle through his lessons with less rigor and having philip to help him he was able to make some show of having applied his mind in a confused and blundering way without being crossexamined into a betrayal that his mind had been entirely neutral in the matter he thought school much more bearable under this modification of circumstances and he went on contentedly enough picking up a promiscuous education chiefly from things that were not intended as education at all what was understood to be his education was simply the practice of reading writing and spelling carried on by an elaborate appliance of unintelligible ideas and by much failure in the effort to learn by rote  nevertheless there was a visible improvement in tom under this training perhaps because he was not a boy in the abstract existing solely to illustrate the evils of a mistaken education but a boy made of flesh and blood with dispositions not entirely at the mercy of circumstances  there was a great improvement in his bearing for example and some credit on this score was due to mr poulter the village schoolmaster who being an old peninsular soldier was employed to drill toma source of high mutual pleasure mr poulter who was understood by the company at the black swan to have once struck terror into the hearts of the french was no longer personally formidable he had rather a shrunken appearance and was tremulous in the mornings not from age but from the extreme perversity of the kings lorton boys which nothing but gin could enable him to sustain with any firmness still he carried himself with martial erectness had his clothes scrupulously brushed and his trousers tightly strapped and on the wednesday and saturday afternoons when he came to tom he was always inspired with gin and old memories which gave him an exceptionally spirited air as of a superannuated charger who hears the drum the drillinglessons were always protracted by episodes of warlike narrative much more interesting to tom than philips stories out of the iliad for there were no cannon in the iliad and besides tom had felt some disgust on learning that hector and achilles might possibly never have existed but the duke of wellington was really alive and bony had not been long dead therefore mr poulters reminiscences of the peninsular war were removed from all suspicion of being mythical mr poulter it appeared had been a conspicuous figure at talavera and had contributed not a little to the peculiar terror with which his regiment of infantry was regarded by the enemy on afternoons when his memory was more stimulated than usual he remembered that the duke of wellington had in strict privacy lest jealousies should be awakened expressed his esteem for that fine fellow poulter the very surgeon who attended him in the hospital after he had received his gunshotwound had been profoundly impressed with the superiority of mr poulters fleshno other flesh would have healed in anything like the same time on less personal matters connected with the important warfare in which he had been engaged mr poulter was more reticent only taking care not to give the weight of his authority to any loose notions concerning military history any one who pretended to a knowledge of what occurred at the siege of badajos was especially an object of silent pity to mr poulter he wished that prating person had been run down and had the breath trampled out of him at the first gooff as he himself hadhe might talk about the siege of badajos then tom did not escape irritating his drillingmaster occasionally by his curiosity concerning other military matters than mr poulters personal experience  and general wolfe mr poulterwasnt he a wonderful fighter said tom who held the notion that all the martial heroes commemorated on the publichouse signs were engaged in the war with bony  not at all said mr poulter contemptuously nothing o the sort heads up he added in a tone of stern command which delighted tom and made him feel as if he were a regiment in his own person  no no mr poulter would continue on coming to a pause in his discipline theyd better not talk to me about general wolfe he did nothing but die of his wound thats a poor haction i consider any other man ud have died o the wounds ive had one of my swordcuts ud ha killed a fellow like general wolfe  mr poulter tom would say at any allusion to the sword i wish youd bring your sword and do the swordexercise  for a long while mr poulter only shook his head in a significant manner at this request and smiled patronizingly as jupiter may have done when semele urged her too ambitious request but one afternoon when a sudden shower of heavy rain had detained mr poulter twenty minutes longer than usual at the black swan the sword was broughtjust for tom to look at  and this is the real sword you fought with in all the battles mr poulter said tom handling the hilt has it ever cut a frenchmans head off  head off ah and would if hed had three heads  but you had a gun and bayonet besides said tom i should like the gun and bayonet best because you could shoot em first and spear em after bang pssss tom gave the requisite pantomime to indicate the double enjoyment of pulling the trigger and thrusting the spear  ah but the swords the thing when you come to close fighting said mr poulter involuntarily falling in with toms enthusiasm and drawing the sword so suddenly that tom leaped back with much agility  oh but mr poulter if youre going to do the exercise said tom a little conscious that he had not stood his ground as became an englishman let me go and call philip hell like to see you you know  what the humpbacked lad said mr poulter contemptuously whats the use of his looking on  oh but he knows a great deal about fighting said tom and how they used to fight with bows and arrows and battleaxes  let him come then ill show him something different from his bows and arrows said mr poulter coughing and drawing himself up while he gave a little preliminary play to his wrist  tom ran in to philip who was enjoying his afternoons holiday at the piano in the drawingroom picking out tunes for himself and singing them he was supremely happy perched like an amorphous bundle on the high stool with his head thrown back his eyes fixed on the opposite cornice and his lips wide open sending forth with all his might impromptu syllables to a tune of arnes which had hit his fancy  come philip said tom bursting in dont stay roaring la la there come and see old poulter do his swordexercise in the carriagehouse  the jar of this interruption the discord of toms tones coming across the notes to which philip was vibrating in soul and body would have been enough to unhinge his temper even if there had been no question of poulter the drillingmaster and tom in the hurry of seizing something to say to prevent mr poulter from thinking he was afraid of the sword when he sprang away from it had alighted on this proposition to fetch philip though he knew well enough that philip hated to hear him mention his drillinglessons tom would never have done so inconsiderate a thing except under the severe stress of his personal pride  philip shuddered visibly as he paused from his music then turning red he said with violent passion  get away you lumbering idiot dont come bellowing at me youre not fit to speak to anything but a carthorse  it was not the first time philip had been made angry by him but tom had never before been assailed with verbal missiles that he understood so well  im fit to speak to something better than you you poorspirited imp said tom lighting up immediately at philips fire you know i wont hit you because youre no better than a girl but im an honest mans son and your fathers a rogue everybody says so  tom flung out of the room and slammed the door after him made strangely heedless by his anger for to slam doors within the hearing of mrs stelling who was probably not far off was an offence only to be wiped out by twenty lines of virgil in fact that lady did presently descend from her room in double wonder at the noise and the subsequent cessation of philips music she found him sitting in a heap on the hassock and crying bitterly  whats the matter wakem what was that noise about who slammed the door  philip looked up and hastily dried his eyes it was tulliver who came into ask me to go out with him  and what are you in trouble about said mrs stelling  philip was not her favorite of the two pupils he was less obliging than tom who was made useful in many ways still his father paid more than mr tulliver did and she meant him to feel that she behaved exceedingly well to him philip however met her advances toward a good understanding very much as a caressed mollusk meets an invitation to show himself out of his shell mrs stelling was not a loving tenderhearted woman she was a woman whose skirt sat well who adjusted her waist and patted her curls with a preoccupied air when she inquired after your welfare these things doubtless represent a great social power but it is not the power of love and no other power could win philip from his personal reserve  he said in answer to her question my toothache came on and made me hysterical again  this had been the fact once and philip was glad of the recollection it was like an inspiration to enable him to excuse his crying he had to accept eaudecologne and to refuse creosote in consequence but that was easy  meanwhile tom who had for the first time sent a poisoned arrow into philips heart had returned to the carriagehouse where he found mr poulter with a fixed and earnest eye wasting the perfections of his swordexercise on probably observant but inappreciative rats but mr poulter was a host in himself that is to say he admired himself more than a whole army of spectators could have admired him he took no notice of toms return being too entirely absorbed in the cut and thrustthe solemn one two three four and tom not without a slight feeling of alarm at mr poulters fixed eye and hungrylooking sword which seemed impatient for something else to cut besides the air admired the performance from as great a distance as possible it was not until mr poulter paused and wiped the perspiration from his forehead that tom felt the full charm of the swordexercise and wished it to be repeated  mr poulter said tom when the sword was being finally sheathed i wish youd lend me your sword a little while to keep  no no young gentleman said mr poulter shaking his head decidedly you might do yourself some mischief with it  no im sure i wouldnt im sure id take care and not hurt myself i shouldnt take it out of the sheath much but i could ground arms with it and all that  no no it wont do i tell you it wont do said mr poulter preparing to depart what ud mr stelling say to me  oh i say do mr poulter id give you my fiveshilling piece if youd let me keep the sword a week look here said tom reaching out the attractively large round of silver the young dog calculated the effect as well as if he had been a philosopher  well said mr poulter with still deeper gravity you must keep it out of sight you know  oh yes ill keep it under the bed said tom eagerly or else at the bottom of my large box  and let me see now whether you can draw it out of the sheath without hurting yourself that process having been gone through more than once mr poulter felt that he had acted with scrupulous conscientiousness and said well now master tulliver if i take the crownpiece it is to make sure as youll do no mischief with the sword  oh no indeed mr poulter said tom delightedly handing him the crownpiece and grasping the sword which he thought might have been lighter with advantage  but if mr stelling catches you carrying it in said mr poulter pocketing the crownpiece provisionally while he raised this new doubt  oh he always keeps in his upstairs study on saturday afternoon said tom who disliked anything sneaking but was not disinclined to a little stratagem in a worthy cause so he carried off the sword in triumph mixed with dreaddread that he might encounter mr or mrs stellingto his bedroom where after some consideration he hid it in the closet behind some hanging clothes that night he fell asleep in the thought that he would astonish maggie with it when she cametie it round his waist with his red comforter and make her believe that the sword was his own and that he was going to be a soldier there was nobody but maggie who would be silly enough to believe him or whom he dared allow to know he had a sword and maggie was really coming next week to see tom before she went to a boardingschool with lucy  if you think a lad of thirteen would have been so childish you must be an exceptionally wise man who although you are devoted to a civil calling requiring you to look bland rather than formidable yet never since you had a beard threw yourself into a martial attitude and frowned before the lookingglass it is doubtful whether our soldiers would be maintained if there were not pacific people at home who like to fancy themselves soldiers war like other dramatic spectacles might possibly cease for want of a public    chapter v  maggies second visit   this last breach between the two lads was not readily mended and for some time they spoke to each other no more than was necessary their natural antipathy of temperament made resentment an easy passage to hatred and in philip the transition seemed to have begun there was no malignity in his disposition but there was a susceptibility that made him peculiarly liable to a strong sense of repulsion the oxwe may venture to assert it on the authority of a great classicis not given to use his teeth as an instrument of attack and tom was an excellent bovine lad who ran at questionable objects in a truly ingenious bovine manner but he had blundered on philips tenderest point and had caused him as much acute pain as if he had studied the means with the nicest precision and the most envenomed spite tom saw no reason why they should not make up this quarrel as they had done many others by behaving as if nothing had happened for though he had never before said to philip that his father was a rogue this idea had so habitually made part of his feeling as to the relation between himself and his dubious schoolfellow who he could neither like nor dislike that the mere utterance did not make such an epoch to him as it did to philip and he had a right to say so when philip hectored over him and called him names but perceiving that his first advances toward amity were not met he relapsed into his least favorable disposition toward philip and resolved never to appeal to him either about drawing or exercise again they were only so far civil to each other as was necessary to prevent their state of feud from being observed by mr stelling who would have put down such nonsense with great vigor  when maggie came however she could not help looking with growing interest at the new schoolfellow although he was the son of that wicked lawyer wakem who made her father so angry she had arrived in the middle of schoolhours and had sat by while philip went through his lessons with mr stelling tom some weeks ago had sent her word that philip knew no end of storiesnot stupid stories like hers and she was convinced now from her own observation that he must be very clever she hoped he would think her rather clever too when she came to talk to him maggie moreover had rather a tenderness for deformed things she preferred the wrynecked lambs because it seemed to her that the lambs which were quite strong and well made wouldnt mind so much about being petted and she was especially fond of petting objects that would think it very delightful to be petted by her she loved tom very dearly but she often wished that he cared more about her loving him  i think philip wakem seems a nice boy tom she said when they went out of the study together into the garden to pass the interval before dinner he couldnt choose his father you know and ive read of very bad men who had good sons as well as good parents who had bad children and if philip is good i think we ought to be the more sorry for him because his father is not a good man you like him dont you  oh hes a queer fellow said tom curtly and hes as sulky as can be with me because i told him his father was a rogue and id a right to tell him so for it was true and he began it with calling me names but you stop here by yourself a bit maggie will you ive got something i want to do upstairs  cant i go too said maggie who in this first day of meeting again loved toms shadow  no its something ill tell you about byandby not yet said tom skipping away  in the afternoon the boys were at their books in the study preparing the morrows lessons that they might have a holiday in the evening in honor of maggies arrival tom was hanging over his latin grammar moving his lips inaudibly like a strict but impatient catholic repeating his tale of paternosters and philip at the other end of the room was busy with two volumes with a look of contented diligence that excited maggies curiosity he did not look at all as if he were learning a lesson she sat on a low stool at nearly a right angle with the two boys watching first one and then the other and philip looking off his book once toward the fireplace caught the pair of questioning dark eyes fixed upon him he thought this sister of tullivers seemed a nice little thing quite unlike her brother he wished he had a little sister what was it he wondered that made maggies dark eyes remind him of the stories about princesses being turned into animals i think it was that her eyes were full of unsatisfied intelligence and unsatisfied beseeching affection  i say magsie said tom at last shutting his books and putting them away with the energy and decision of a perfect master in the art of leaving off ive done my lessons now come upstairs with me  what is it said maggie when they were outside the door a slight suspicion crossing her mind as she remembered toms preliminary visit upstairs it isnt a trick youre going to play me now  no no maggie said tom in his most coaxing tone its something youll like ever so  he put his arm round her neck and she put hers round his waist and twined together in this way they went upstairs  i say magsie you must not tell anybody you know said tom else i shall get fifty lines  is it alive said maggie whose imagination had settled for the moment on the idea that tom kept a ferret clandestinely  oh i shant tell you said he now you go into that corner and hide your face while i reach it out he added as he locked the bedroom door behind them ill tell you when to turn round you mustnt squeal out you know  oh but if you frighten me i shall said maggie beginning to look rather serious  you wont be frightened you silly thing said tom go and hide your face and mind you dont peep  of course i shant peep said maggie disdainfully and she buried her face in the pillow like a person of strict honor  but tom looked round warily as he walked to the closet then he stepped into the narrow space and almost closed the door maggie kept her face buried without the aid of principle for in that dreamsuggestive attitude she had soon forgotten where she was and her thoughts were busy with the poor deformed boy who was so clever when tom called out now then magsie  nothing but long meditation and preconcerted arrangement of effects would have enabled tom to present so striking a figure as he did to maggie when she looked up dissatisfied with the pacific aspect of a face which had no more than the faintest hint of flaxen eyebrow together with a pair of amiable bluegray eyes and round pink cheeks that refused to look formidable let him frown as he would before the lookingglass philip had once told him of a man who had a horseshoe frown and tom had tried with all his frowning might to make a horseshoe on his forehead he had had recourse to that unfailing source of the terrible burnt cork and had made himself a pair of black eyebrows that met in a satisfactory manner over his nose and were matched by a less carefully adjusted blackness about the chin he had wound a red handkerchief round his cloth cap to give it the air of a turban and his red comforter across his breast as a scarfan amount of red which with the tremendous frown on his brow and the decision with which he grasped the sword as he held it with its point resting on the ground would suffice to convey an approximate idea of his fierce and bloodthirsty disposition  maggie looked bewildered for a moment and tom enjoyed that moment keenly but in the next she laughed clapped her hands together and said oh tom youve made yourself like bluebeard at the show  it was clear she had not been struck with the presence of the swordit was not unsheathed her frivolous mind required a more direct appeal to its sense of the terrible and tom prepared for his masterstroke frowning with a double amount of intention if not of corrugation he carefully drew the sword from its sheath and pointed it at maggie  oh tom please dont exclaimed maggie in a tone of suppressed dread shrinking away from him into the opposite corner i shall screamim sure i shall oh dont i wish id never come upstairs  the corners of toms mouth showed an inclination to a smile of complacency that was immediately checked as inconsistent with the severity of a great warrior slowly he let down the scabbard on the floor lest it should make too much noise and then said sternly  im the duke of wellington march stamping forward with the right leg a little bent and the sword still pointing toward maggie who trembling and with tearfilled eyes got upon the bed as the only means of widening the space between them  tom happy in this spectator of his military performances even though the spectator was only maggie proceeded with the utmost exertion of his force to such an exhibition of the cut and thrust as would necessarily be expected of the duke of wellington  tom i will not bear it i will scream said maggie at the first movement of the sword youll hurt yourself youll cut your head off  onetwo said tom resolutely though at two his wrist trembled a little three came more slowly and with it the sword swung downward and maggie gave a loud shriek the sword had fallen with its edge on toms foot and in a moment after he had fallen too maggie leaped from the bed still shrieking and immediately there was a rush of footsteps toward the room mr stelling from his upstairs study was the first to enter he found both the children on the floor tom had fainted and maggie was shaking him by the collar of his jacket screaming with wild eyes she thought he was dead poor child and yet she shook him as if that would bring him back to life in another minute she was sobbing with joy because tom opened his eyes she couldnt sorrow yet that he had hurt his foot it seemed as if all happiness lay in his being alive    chapter vi  a lovescene   poor tom bore his severe pain heroically and was resolute in not telling of mr poulter more than was unavoidable the fiveshilling piece remained a secret even to maggie but there was a terrible dread weighing on his mind so terrible that he dared not even ask the question which might bring the fatal yes he dared not ask the surgeon or mr stelling shall i be lame sir he mastered himself so as not to cry out at the pain but when his foot had been dressed and he was left alone with maggie seated by his bedside the children sobbed together with their heads laid on the same pillow tom was thinking of himself walking about on crutches like the wheelwrights son and maggie who did not guess what was in his mind sobbed for company it had not occurred to the surgeon or to mr stelling to anticipate this dread in toms mind and to reassure him by hopeful words but philip watched the surgeon out of the house and waylaid mr stelling to ask the very question that tom had not dared to ask for himself  i beg your pardon sirbut does mr askern say tulliver will be lame  oh no oh no said mr stelling not permanently only for a little while  did he tell tulliver so sir do you think  no nothing was said to him on the subject  then may i go and tell him sir  yes to be sure now you mention it i dare say he may be troubling about that go to his bedroom but be very quiet at present  it had been philips first thought when he heard of the accidentwill tulliver be lame it will be very hard for him if he is and toms hitherto unforgiven offences were washed out by that pity philip felt that they were no longer in a state of repulsion but were being drawn into a common current of suffering and sad privation his imagination did not dwell on the outward calamity and its future effect on toms life but it made vividly present to him the probable state of toms feeling philip had only lived fourteen years but those years had most of them been steeped in the sense of a lot irremediably hard  mr askern says youll soon be all right again tulliver did you know he said rather timidly as he stepped gently up to toms bed ive just been to ask mr stelling and he says youll walk as well as ever again byandday  tom looked up with that momentary stopping of the breath which comes with a sudden joy then he gave a long sigh and turned his bluegray eyes straight on philips face as he had not done for a fortnight or more as for maggie this intimation of a possibility she had not thought of before affected her as a new trouble the bare idea of toms being always lame overpowered the assurance that such a misfortune was not likely to befall him and she clung to him and cried afresh  dont be a little silly magsie said tom tenderly feeling very brave now i shall soon get well  goodby tulliver said philip putting out his small delicate hand which tom clasped immediately with his more substantial fingers  i say said tom ask mr stelling to let you come and sit with me sometimes till i get up again wakem and tell me about robert bruce you know  after that philip spent all his time out of schoolhours with tom and maggie tom liked to hear fighting stories as much as ever but he insisted strongly on the fact that those great fighters who did so many wonderful things and came off unhurt wore excellent armor from head to foot which made fighting easy work he considered he should not have hurt his foot if he had had an iron shoe on he listened with great interest to a new story of philips about a man who had a very bad wound in his foot and cried out so dreadfully with the pain that his friends could bear with him no longer but put him ashore on a desert island with nothing but some wonderful poisoned arrows to kill animals with for food  i didnt roar out a bit you know tom said and i dare say my foot was as bad as his its cowardly to roar  but maggie would have it that when anything hurt you very much it was quite permissible to cry out and it was cruel of people not to bear it she wanted to know if philoctetes had a sister and why she didnt go with him on the desert island and take care of him  one day soon after philip had told this story he and maggie were in the study alone together while toms foot was being dressed philip was at his books and maggie after sauntering idly round the room not caring to do anything in particular because she would soon go to tom again went and leaned on the table near philip to see what he was doing for they were quite old friends now and perfectly at home with each other  what are you reading about in greek she said its poetry i can see that because the lines are so short  its about philoctetes the lame man i was telling you of yesterday he answered resting his head on his hand and looking at her as if he were not at all sorry to be interrupted maggie in her absent way continued to lean forward resting on her arms and moving her feet about while her dark eyes got more and more fixed and vacant as if she had quite forgotten philip and his book  maggie said philip after a minute or two still leaning on his elbow and looking at her if you had had a brother like me do you think you should have loved him as well as tom  maggie started a little on being roused from her reverie and said what philip repeated his question  oh yes better she answered immediately no not better because i dont think i could love you better than tom but i should be so sorryso sorry for you  philip colored he had meant to imply would she love him as well in spite of his deformity and yet when she alluded to it so plainly he winced under her pity maggie young as she was felt her mistake hitherto she had instinctively behaved as if she were quite unconscious of philips deformity her own keen sensitiveness and experience under family criticism sufficed to teach her this as well as if she had been directed by the most finished breeding  but you are so very clever philip and you can play and sing she added quickly i wish you were my brother im very fond of you and you would stay at home with me when tom went out and you would teach me everything wouldnt yougreek and everything  but youll go away soon and go to school maggie said philip and then youll forget all about me and not care for me any more and then i shall see you when youre grown up and youll hardly take any notice of me  oh no i shant forget you im sure said maggie shaking her head very seriously i never forget anything and i think about everybody when im away from them i think about poor yap hes got a lump in his throat and luke says hell die only dont you tell tom because it will vex him so you never saw yap hes a queer little dognobody cares about him but tom and me  do you care as much about me as you do about yap maggie said philip smiling rather sadly  oh yes i should think so said maggie laughing  im very fond of you maggie i shall never forget you said philip and when im very unhappy i shall always think of you and wish i had a sister with dark eyes just like yours  why do you like my eyes said maggie well pleased she had never heard any one but her father speak of her eyes as if they had merit  i dont know said philip theyre not like any other eyes they seem trying to speaktrying to speak kindly i dont like other people to look at me much but i like you to look at me maggie  why i think youre fonder of me than tom is said maggie rather sorrowfully then wondering how she could convince philip that she could like him just as well although he was crooked she said  should you like me to kiss you as i do tom i will if you like  yes very much nobody kisses me  maggie put her arm round his neck and kissed him quite earnestly  there now she said i shall always remember you and kiss you when i see you again if its ever so long but ill go now because i think mr askerns done with toms foot  when their father came the second time maggie said to him oh father philip wakem is so very good to tom he is such a clever boy and i do love him and you love him too tom dont you say you love him she added entreatingly  tom colored a little as he looked at his father and said i shant be friends with him when i leave school father but weve made it up now since my foot has been bad and hes taught me to play at draughts and i can beat him  well well said mr tulliver if hes good to you try and make him amends and be good to him hes a poor crooked creature and takes after his dead mother but dont you be getting too thick with him hes got his fathers blood in him too ay ay the gray colt may chance to kick like his black sire  the jarring natures of the two boys effected what mr tullivers admonition alone might have failed to effect in spite of philips new kindness and toms answering regard in this time of his trouble they never became close friends when maggie was gone and when tom byandby began to walk about as usual the friendly warmth that had been kindled by pity and gratitude died out by degrees and left them in their old relation to each other philip was often peevish and contemptuous and toms more specific and kindly impressions gradually melted into the old background of suspicion and dislike toward him as a queer fellow a humpback and the son of a rogue if boys and men are to be welded together in the glow of transient feeling they must be made of metal that will mix else they inevitably fall asunder when the heat dies out    chapter vii  the golden gates are passed   so tom went on even to the fifth halfyeartill he was turned sixteenat kings lorton while maggie was growing with a rapidity which her aunts considered highly reprehensible at miss firnisss boardingschool in the ancient town of laceham on the floss with cousin lucy for her companion in her early letters to tom she had always sent her love to philip and asked many questions about him which were answered by brief sentences about toms toothache and a turfhouse which he was helping to build in the garden with other items of that kind she was pained to hear tom say in the holidays that philip was as queer as ever again and often cross they were no longer very good friends she perceived and when she reminded tom that he ought always to love philip for being so good to him when his foot was bad he answered well it isnt my fault i dont do anything to him she hardly ever saw philip during the remainder of their schoollife in the midsummer holidays he was always away at the seaside and at christmas she could only meet him at long intervals in the street of st oggs when they did meet she remembered her promise to kiss him but as a young lady who had been at a boardingschool she knew now that such a greeting was out of the question and philip would not expect it the promise was void like so many other sweet illusory promises of our childhood void as promises made in eden before the seasons were divided and when the starry blossoms grew side by side with the ripening peachimpossible to be fulfilled when the golden gates had been passed  but when their father was actually engaged in the longthreatened lawsuit and wakem as the agent at once of pivart and old harry was acting against him even maggie felt with some sadness that they were not likely ever to have any intimacy with philip again the very name of wakem made her father angry and she had once heard him say that if that crookbacked son lived to inherit his fathers illgotten gains there would be a curse upon him have as little to do with him at school as you can my lad he said to tom and the command was obeyed the more easily because mr sterling by this time had two additional pupils for though this gentlemans rise in the world was not of that meteorlike rapidity which the admirers of his extemporaneous eloquence had expected for a preacher whose voice demanded so wide a sphere he had yet enough of growing prosperity to enable him to increase his expenditure in continued disproportion to his income  as for toms school course it went on with milllike monotony his mind continuing to move with a slow halfstifled pulse in a medium uninteresting or unintelligible ideas but each vacation he brought home larger and larger drawings with the satiny rendering of landscape and watercolors in vivid greens together with manuscript books full of exercises and problems in which the handwriting was all the finer because he gave his whole mind to it each vacation he brought home a new book or two indicating his progress through different stages of history christian doctrine and latin literature and that passage was not entirely without results besides the possession of the books toms ear and tongue had become accustomed to a great many words and phrases which are understood to be signs of an educated condition and though he had never really applied his mind to any one of his lessons the lessons had left a deposit of vague fragmentary ineffectual notions mr tulliver seeing signs of acquirement beyond the reach of his own criticism thought it was probably all right with toms education he observed indeed that there were no maps and not enough summing but he made no formal complaint to mr stelling it was a puzzling business this schooling and if he took tom away where could he send him with better effect  by the time tom had reached his last quarter at kings lorton the years had made striking changes in him since the day we saw him returning from mr jacobss academy he was a tall youth now carrying himself without the least awkwardness and speaking without more shyness than was a becoming symptom of blended diffidence and pride he wore his tailcoat and his standup collars and watched the down on his lip with eager impatience looking every day at his virgin razor with which he had provided himself in the last holidays philip had already leftat the autumn quarterthat he might go to the south for the winter for the sake of his health and this change helped to give tom the unsettled exultant feeling that usually belongs to the last months before leaving school this quarter too there was some hope of his fathers lawsuit being decided that made the prospect of home more entirely pleasurable for tom who had gathered his view of the case from his fathers conversation had no doubt that pivart would be beaten  tom had not heard anything from home for some weeksa fact which did not surprise him for his father and mother were not apt to manifest their affection in unnecessary letterswhen to his great surprise on the morning of a dark cold day near the end of november he was told soon after entering the study at nine oclock that his sister was in the drawingroom it was mrs stelling who had come into the study to tell him and she left him to enter the drawingroom alone  maggie too was tall now with braided and coiled hair she was almost as tall as tom though she was only thirteen and she really looked older than he did at that moment she had thrown off her bonnet her heavy braids were pushed back from her forehead as if it would not bear that extra load and her young face had a strangely worn look as her eyes turned anxiously toward the door when tom entered she did not speak but only went up to him put her arms round his neck and kissed him earnestly he was used to various moods of hers and felt no alarm at the unusual seriousness of her greeting  why how is it youre come so early this cold morning maggie did you come in the gig said tom as she backed toward the sofa and drew him to her side  no i came by the coach ive walked from the turnpike  but how is it youre not at school the holidays have not begun yet  father wanted me at home said maggie with a slight trembling of the lip i came home three or four days ago  isnt my father well said tom rather anxiously  not quite said maggie hes very unhappy tom the lawsuit is ended and i came to tell you because i thought it would be better for you to know it before you came home and i didnt like only to send you a letter  my father hasnt lost said tom hastily springing from the sofa and standing before maggie with his hands suddenly thrust into his pockets  yes dear tom said maggie looking up at him with trembling  tom was silent a minute or two with his eyes fixed on the floor then he said  my father will have to pay a good deal of money then  yes said maggie rather faintly  well it cant be helped said tom bravely not translating the loss of a large sum of money into any tangible results but my fathers very much vexed i dare say he added looking at maggie and thinking that her agitated face was only part of her girlish way of taking things  yes said maggie again faintly then urged to fuller speech by toms freedom from apprehension she said loudly and rapidly as if the words would burst from her oh tom he will lose the mill and the land and everything he will have nothing left  toms eyes flashed out one look of surprise at her before he turned pale and trembled visibly he said nothing but sat down on the sofa again looking vaguely out of the opposite window  anxiety about the future had never entered toms mind his father had always ridden a good horse kept a good house and had the cheerful confident air of a man who has plenty of property to fall back upon tom had never dreamed that his father would fail that was a form of misfortune which he had always heard spoken of as a deep disgrace and disgrace was an idea that he could not associate with any of his relations least of all with his father a proud sense of family respectability was part of the very air tom had been born and brought up in he knew there were people in st oggs who made a show without money to support it and he had always heard such people spoken of by his own friends with contempt and reprobation he had a strong belief which was a lifelong habit and required no definite evidence to rest on that his father could spend a great deal of money if he chose and since his education at mr stellings had given him a more expensive view of life he had often thought that when he got older he would make a figure in the world with his horse and dogs and saddle and other accoutrements of a fine young man and show himself equal to any of his contemporaries at st oggs who might consider themselves a grade above him in society because their fathers were professional men or had large oilmills as to the prognostics and headshaking of his aunts and uncles they had never produced the least effect on him except to make him think that aunts and uncles were disagreeable society he had heard them find fault in much the same way as long as he could remember his father knew better than they did  the down had come on toms lip yet his thoughts and expectations had been hitherto only the reproduction in changed forms of the boyish dreams in which he had lived three years ago he was awakened now with a violent shock  maggie was frightened at toms pale trembling silence there was something else to tell himsomething worse she threw her arms round him at last and said with a half sob  oh tomdear dear tom dont fret too much try and bear it well  tom turned his cheek passively to meet her entreating kisses and there gathered a moisture in his eyes which he just rubbed away with his hand the action seemed to rouse him for he shook himself and said i shall go home with you maggie didnt my father say i was to go  no tom father didnt wish it said maggie her anxiety about his feeling helping her to master her agitation what would he do when she told him all but mother wants you to comepoor mothershe cries so oh tom its very dreadful at home  maggies lips grew whiter and she began to tremble almost as tom had done the two poor things clung closer to each other both tremblingthe one at an unshapen fear the other at the image of a terrible certainty when maggie spoke it was hardly above a whisper  andandpoor father  maggie could not utter it but the suspense was intolerable to tom a vague idea of going to prison as a consequence of debt was the shape his fears had begun to take  wheres my father he said impatiently tell me maggie  hes at home said maggie finding it easier to reply to that question but she added after a pause not himselfhe fell off his horse he has known nobody but me ever sincehe seems to have lost his senses o father father  with these last words maggies sobs burst forth with the more violence for the previous struggle against them tom felt that pressure of the heart which forbids tears he had no distinct vision of their troubles as maggie had who had been at home he only felt the crushing weight of what seemed unmitigated misfortune he tightened his arm almost convulsively round maggie as she sobbed but his face looked rigid and tearless his eyes blankas if a black curtain of cloud had suddenly fallen on his path  but maggie soon checked herself abruptly a single thought had acted on her like a startling sound  we must set out tom we must not stay father will miss me we must be at the turnpike at ten to meet the coach she said this with hasty decision rubbing her eyes and rising to seize her bonnet  tom at once felt the same impulse and rose too wait a minute maggie he said i must speak to mr stelling and then well go  he thought he must go to the study where the pupils were but on his way he met mr stelling who had heard from his wife that maggie appeared to be in trouble when she asked for her brother and now that he thought the brother and sister had been alone long enough was coming to inquire and offer his sympathy  please sir i must go home tom said abruptly as he met mr stelling in the passage i must go back with my sister directly my fathers lost his lawsuithes lost all his propertyand hes very ill  mr stelling felt like a kindhearted man he foresaw a probable money loss for himself but this had no appreciable share in his feeling while he looked with grave pity at the brother and sister for whom youth and sorrow had begun together when he knew how maggie had come and how eager she was to get home again he hurried their departure only whispering something to mrs stelling who had followed him and who immediately left the room  tom and maggie were standing on the doorstep ready to set out when mrs stelling came with a little basket which she hung on maggies arm saying do remember to eat something on the way dear maggies heart went out toward this woman whom she had never liked and she kissed her silently it was the first sign within the poor child of that new sense which is the gift of sorrowthat susceptibility to the bare offices of humanity which raises them into a bond of loving fellowship as to haggard men among the icebergs the mere presence of an ordinary comrade stirs the deep fountains of affection  mr stelling put his hand on toms shoulder and said god bless you my boy let me know how you get on then he pressed maggies hand but there were no audible goodbyes tom had so often thought how joyful he should be the day he left school for good and now his school years seemed like a holiday that had come to an end  the two slight youthful figures soon grew indistinct on the distant roadwere soon lost behind the projecting hedgerow  they had gone forth together into their life of sorrow and they would never more see the sunshine undimmed by remembered cares they had entered the thorny wilderness and the golden gates of their childhood had forever closed behind them     book iii  the downfall    chapter i  what had happened at home   when mr tulliver first knew the fact that the lawsuit was decided against him and that pivart and wakem were triumphant every one who happened to observe him at the time thought that for so confident and hottempered a man he bore the blow remarkably well he thought so himself he thought he was going to show that if wakem or anybody else considered him crushed they would find themselves mistaken he could not refuse to see that the costs of this protracted suit would take more than he possessed to pay them but he appeared to himself to be full of expedients by which he could ward off any results but such as were tolerable and could avoid the appearance of breaking down in the world all the obstinacy and defiance of his nature driven out of their old channel found a vent for themselves in the immediate formation of plans by which he would meet his difficulties and remain mr tulliver of dorlcote mill in spite of them there was such a rush of projects in his brain that it was no wonder his face was flushed when he came away from his talk with his attorney mr gore and mounted his horse to ride home from lindum there was furley who held the mortgage on the landa reasonable fellow who would see his own interest mr tulliver was convinced and who would be glad not only to purchase the whole estate including the mill and homestead but would accept mr tulliver as tenant and be willing to advance money to be repaid with high interest out of the profits of the business which would be made over to him mr tulliver only taking enough barely to maintain himself and his family who would neglect such a profitable investment certainly not furley for mr tulliver had determined that furley should meet his plans with the utmost alacrity and there are men whoses brains have not yet been dangerously heated by the loss of a lawsuit who are apt to see in their own interest or desires a motive for other mens actions there was no doubt in the millers mind that furley would do just what was desirable and if he didwhy things would not be so very much worse mr tulliver and his family must live more meagrely and humbly but it would only be till the profits of the business had paid off furleys advances and that might be while mr tulliver had still a good many years of life before him it was clear that the costs of the suit could be paid without his being obliged to turn out of his old place and look like a ruined man it was certainly an awkward moment in his affairs there was that suretyship for poor riley who had died suddenly last april and left his friend saddled with a debt of two hundred and fifty poundsa fact which had helped to make mr tullivers banking book less pleasant reading than a man might desire toward christmas well he had never been one of those poorspirited sneaks who would refuse to give a helping hand to a fellowtraveller in this puzzling world the really vexatious business was the fact that some months ago the creditor who had lent him the five hundred pounds to repay mrs glegg had become uneasy about his money set on by wakem of course and mr tulliver still confident that he should gain his suit and finding it eminently inconvenient to raise the said sum until that desirable issue had taken place had rashly acceded to the demand that he should give a bill of sale on his household furniture and some other effects as security in lieu of the bond it was all one he had said to himself he should soon pay off the money and there was no harm in giving that security any more than another but now the consequences of this bill of sale occurred to him in a new light and he remembered that the time was close at hand when it would be enforced unless the money were repaid two months ago he would have declared stoutly that he would never be beholden to his wifes friends but now he told himself as stoutly that it was nothing but right and natural that bessy should go to the pullets and explain the thing to them they would hardly let bessys furniture be sold and it might be security to pullet if he advanced the moneythere would after all be no gift or favor in the matter mr tulliver would never have asked for anything from so poorspirited a fellow for himself but bessy might do so if she liked  it is precisely the proudest and most obstinate men who are the most liable to shift their position and contradict themselves in this sudden manner everything is easier to them than to face the simple fact that they have been thoroughly defeated and must begin life anew and mr tulliver you perceive though nothing more than a superior miller and maltster was as proud and obstinate as if he had been a very lofty personage in whom such dispositions might be a source of that conspicuous farechoing tragedy which sweeps the stage in regal robes and makes the dullest chronicler sublime the pride and obstinacy of millers and other insignificant people whom you pass unnoticingly on the road every day have their tragedy too but it is of that unwept hidden sort that goes on from generation to generation and leaves no recordsuch tragedy perhaps as lies in the conflicts of young souls hungry for joy under a lot made suddenly hard to them under the dreariness of a home where the morning brings no promise with it and where the unexpectant discontent of worn and disappointed parents weighs on the children like a damp thick air in which all the functions of life are depressed or such tragedy as lies in the slow or sudden death that follows on a bruised passion though it may be a death that finds only a parish funeral there are certain animals to which tenacity of position is a law of lifethey can never flourish again after a single wrench and there are certain human beings to whom predominance is a law of lifethey can only sustain humiliation so long as they can refuse to believe in it and in their own conception predominate still  mr tulliver was still predominating in his own imagination as he approached st oggs through which he had to pass on his way homeward but what was it that suggested to him as he saw the laceham coach entering the town to follow it to the coachoffice and get the clerk there to write a letter requiring maggie to come home the very next day mr tullivers own hand shook too much under his excitement for him to write himself and he wanted the letter to be given to the coachman to deliver at miss firnisss school in the morning there was a craving which he would not account for to himself to have maggie near him without delayshe must come back by the coach tomorrow  to mrs tulliver when he got home he would admit no difficulties and scolded down her burst of grief on hearing that the lawsuit was lost by angry assertions that there was nothing to grieve about he said nothing to her that night about the bill of sale and the application to mrs pullet for he had kept her in ignorance of the nature of that transaction and had explained the necessity for taking an inventory of the goods as a matter connected with his will the possession of a wife conspicuously ones inferior in intellect is like other high privileges attended with a few inconveniences and among the rest with the occasional necessity for using a little deception  the next day mr tulliver was again on horseback in the afternoon on his way to mr gores office at st oggs gore was to have seen furley in the morning and to have sounded him in relation to mr tullivers affairs but he had not gone halfway when he met a clerk from mr gores office who was bringing a letter to mr tulliver mr gore had been prevented by a sudden call of business from waiting at his office to see mr tulliver according to appointment but would be at his office at eleven tomorrow morning and meanwhile had sent some important information by letter  oh said mr tulliver taking the letter but not opening it then tell gore ill see him tomorrow at eleven and he turned his horse  the clerk struck with mr tullivers glistening excited glance looked after him for a few moments and then rode away the reading of a letter was not the affair of an instant to mr tulliver he took in the sense of a statement very slowly through the medium of written or even printed characters so he had put the letter in his pocket thinking he would open it in his armchair at home but byandby it occurred to him that there might be something in the letter mrs tulliver must not know about and if so it would be better to keep it out of her sight altogether he stopped his horse took out the letter and read it it was only a short letter the substance was that mr gore had ascertained on secret but sure authority that furley had been lately much straitened for money and had parted with his securitiesamong the rest the mortgage on mr tullivers property which he had transferred towakem  in half an hour after this mr tullivers own wagoner found him lying by the roadside insensible with an open letter near him and his gray horse snuffing uneasily about him  when maggie reached home that evening in obedience to her fathers call he was no longer insensible about an hour before he had become conscious and after vague vacant looks around him had muttered something about a letter which he presently repeated impatiently at the instance of mr turnbull the medical man gores letter was brought and laid on the bed and the previous impatience seemed to be allayed the stricken man lay for some time with his eyes fixed on the letter as if he were trying to knit up his thoughts by its help but presently a new wave of memory seemed to have come and swept the other away he turned his eyes from the letter to the door and after looking uneasily as if striving to see something his eyes were too dim for he said the little wench  he repeated the words impatiently from time to time appearing entirely unconscious of everything except this one importunate want and giving no sign of knowing his wife or any one else and poor mrs tulliver her feeble faculties almost paralyzed by this sudden accumulation of troubles went backward and forward to the gate to see if the laceham coach were coming though it was not yet time  but it came at last and set down the poor anxious girl no longer the little wench except to her fathers fond memory  oh mother what is the matter maggie said with pale lips as her mother came toward her crying she didnt think her father was ill because the letter had come at his dictation from the office at st oggs  but mr turnbull came now to meet her a medical man is the good angel of the troubled house and maggie ran toward the kind old friend whom she remembered as long as she could remember anything with a trembling questioning look  dont alarm yourself too much my dear he said taking her hand your father has had a sudden attack and has not quite recovered his memory but he has been asking for you and it will do him good to see you keep as quiet as you can take off your things and come upstairs with me  maggie obeyed with that terrible beating of the heart which makes existence seem simply a painful pulsation the very quietness with which mr turnbull spoke had frightened her susceptible imagination her fathers eyes were still turned uneasily toward the door when she entered and met the strange yearning helpless look that had been seeking her in vain with a sudden flash and movement he raised himself in the bed she rushed toward him and clasped him with agonized kisses  poor child it was very early for her to know one of those supreme moments in life when all we have hoped or delighted in all we can dread or endure falls away from our regard as insignificant is lost like a trivial memory in that simple primitive love which knits us to the beings who have been nearest to us in their times of helplessness or of anguish  but that flash of recognition had been too great a strain on the fathers bruised enfeebled powers he sank back again in renewed insensibility and rigidity which lasted for many hours and was only broken by a flickering return of consciousness in which he took passively everything that was given to him and seemed to have a sort of infantine satisfaction in maggies near presencesuch satisfaction as a baby has when it is returned to the nurses lap  mrs tulliver sent for her sisters and there was much wailing and lifting up of hands below stairs both uncles and aunts saw that the ruin of bessy and her family was as complete as they had ever foreboded it and there was a general family sense that a judgment had fallen on mr tulliver which it would be an impiety to counteract by too much kindness but maggie heard little of this scarcely ever leaving her fathers bedside where she sat opposite him with her hand on his mrs tulliver wanted to have tom fetched home and seemed to be thinking more of her boy even than of her husband but the aunts and uncles opposed this tom was better at school since mr turnbull said there was no immediate danger he believed but at the end of the second day when maggie had become more accustomed to her fathers fits of insensibility and to the expectation that he would revive from them the thought of tom had become urgent with her too and when her mother sate crying at night and saying my poor ladits nothing but right he should come home maggie said let me go for him and tell him mother ill go tomorrow morning if father doesnt know me and want me it would be so hard for tom to come home and not know anything about it beforehand  and the next morning maggie went as we have seen sitting on the coach on their way home the brother and sister talked to each other in sad interrupted whispers  they say mr wakem has got a mortgage or something on the land tom said maggie it was the letter with that news in it that made father ill they think  i believe that scoundrels been planning all along to ruin my father said tom leaping from the vaguest impressions to a definite conclusion ill make him feel for it when im a man mind you never speak to philip again  oh tom said maggie in a tone of sad remonstrance but she had no spirit to dispute anything then still less to vex tom by opposing him    chapter ii  mrs tullivers teraphim or household gods   when the coach set down tom and maggie it was five hours since she had started from home and she was thinking with some trembling that her father had perhaps missed her and asked for the little wench in vain she thought of no other change that might have happened  she hurried along the gravelwalk and entered the house before tom but in the entrance she was startled by a strong smell of tobacco the parlor door was ajar that was where the smell came from it was very strange could any visitor be smoking at a time like this was her mother there if so she must be told that tom was come maggie after this pause of surprise was only in the act of opening the door when tom came up and they both looked into the parlor together  there was a coarse dingy man of whose face tom had some vague recollection sitting in his fathers chair smoking with a jug and glass beside him  the truth flashed on toms mind in an instant to have the bailiff in the house and to be sold up were phrases which he had been used to even as a little boy they were part of the disgrace and misery of failing of losing all ones money and being ruinedsinking into the condition of poor working people it seemed only natural this should happen since his father had lost all his property and he thought of no more special cause for this particular form of misfortune than the loss of the lawsuit but the immediate presence of this disgrace was so much keener an experience to tom than the worst form of apprehension that he felt at this moment as if his real trouble had only just begin it was a touch on the irritated nerve compared with its spontaneous dull aching  how do you do sir said the man taking the pipe out of his mouth with rough embarrassed civility the two young startled faces made him a little uncomfortable  but tom turned away hastily without speaking the sight was too hateful maggie had not understood the appearance of this stranger as tom had she followed him whispering who can it be tom what is the matter then with a sudden undefined dread lest this stranger might have something to do with a change in her father she rushed upstairs checking herself at the bedroom door to throw off her bonnet and enter on tiptoe all was silent there her father was lying heedless of everything around him with his eyes closed as when she had left him a servant was there but not her mother  wheres my mother she whispered the servant did not know  maggie hastened out and said to tom father is lying quiet let us go and look for my mother i wonder where she is  mrs tulliver was not downstairs not in any of the bedrooms there was but one room below the attic which maggie had left unsearched it was the storeroom where her mother kept all her linen and all the precious best things that were only unwrapped and brought out on special occasions  tom preceding maggie as they returned along the passage opened the door of this room and immediately said mother  mrs tulliver was seated there with all her laidup treasures one of the linen chests was open the silver teapot was unwrapped from its many folds of paper and the best china was laid out on the top of the closed linenchest spoons and skewers and ladles were spread in rows on the shelves and the poor woman was shaking her head and weeping with a bitter tension of the mouth over the mark elizabeth dodson on the corner of some tablecloths she held in her lap  she dropped them and started up as tom spoke  oh my boy my boy she said clasping him round the neck to think as i should live to see this day were ruinedeverythings going to be sold upto think as your father should ha married me to bring me to this weve got nothingwe shall be beggarswe must go to the workhouse  she kissed him then seated herself again and took another tablecloth on her lap unfolding it a little way to look at the pattern while the children stood by in mute wretchedness their minds quite filled for the moment with the words beggars and workhouse  to think o these cloths as i spun myself she went on lifting things out and turning them over with an excitement all the more strange and piteous because the stout blond woman was usually so passiveif she had been ruffled before it was at the surface merelyand job haxey wove em and brought the piece home on his back as i remember standing at the door and seeing him come before i ever thought o marrying your father and the pattern as i chose myself and bleached so beautiful and i marked em so as nobody ever saw such markingthey must cut the cloth to get it out for its a particular stitch and theyre all to be sold and go into strange peoples houses and perhaps be cut with the knives and wore out before im dead youll never have one of em my boy she said looking up at tom with her eyes full of tears and i meant em for you i wanted you to have all o this pattern maggie could have had the large checkit never shows so well when the dishes are on it  tom was touched to the quick but there was an angry reaction immediately his face flushed as he said  but will my aunts let them be sold mother do they know about it theyll never let your linen go will they havent you sent to them  yes i sent luke directly theyd put the bailies in and your aunt pullets beenand oh dear oh dear she cries so and says your fathers disgraced my family and made it the talk o the country and shell buy the spotted cloths for herself because shes never had so many as she wanted o that pattern and they shant go to strangers but shes got more checks aready nor she can do with here mrs tulliver began to lay back the tablecloths in the chest folding and stroking them automatically and your uncle gleggs been too and he says things must be bought in for us to lie down on but he must talk to your aunt and theyre all coming to consult but i know theyll none of em take my chany she added turning toward the cups and saucers for they all found fault with em when i bought em cause o the small gold sprig all over em between the flowers but theres none of em got better chany not even your aunt pullet herself and i bought it wi my own money as id saved ever since i was turned fifteen and the silver teapot tooyour father never paid for em and to think as he should ha married me and brought me to this  mrs tulliver burst out crying afresh and she sobbed with her handkerchief at her eyes a few moments but then removing it she said in a deprecating way still half sobbing as if she were called upon to speak before she could command her voice  and i did say to him times and times whativer you do dont go to law and what more could i do ive had to sit by while my own fortins been spent and what should ha been my childrens too youll have niver a penny my boybut it isnt your poor mothers fault  she put out one arm toward tom looking up at him piteously with her helpless childish blue eyes the poor lad went to her and kissed her and she clung to him for the first time tom thought of his father with some reproach his natural inclination to blame hitherto kept entirely in abeyance toward his father by the predisposition to think him always right simply on the ground that he was tom tullivers father was turned into this new channel by his mothers plaints and with his indignation against wakem there began to mingle some indignation of another sort perhaps his father might have helped bringing them all down in the world and making people talk of them with contempt but no one should talk long of tom tulliver with contempt  the natural strength and firmness of his nature was beginning to assert itself urged by the double stimulus of resentment against his aunts and the sense that he must behave like a man and take care of his mother  dont fret mother he said tenderly i shall soon be able to get money ill get a situation of some sort  bless you my boy said mrs tulliver a little soothed then looking round sadly but i shouldnt ha minded so much if we could ha kept the things wi my name on em  maggie had witnessed this scene with gathering anger the implied reproaches against her fatherher father who was lying there in a sort of living deathneutralized all her pity for griefs about tablecloths and china and her anger on her fathers account was heightened by some egoistic resentment at toms silent concurrence with her mother in shutting her out from the common calamity she had become almost indifferent to her mothers habitual depreciation of her but she was keenly alive to any sanction of it however passive that she might suspect in tom poor maggie was by no means made up of unalloyed devotedness but put forth large claims for herself where she loved strongly she burst out at last in an agitated almost violent tone mother how can you talk so as if you cared only for things with your name on and not for what has my fathers name too and to care about anything but dear father himselfwhen hes lying there and may never speak to us again tom you ought to say so too you ought not to let any one find fault with my father  maggie almost choked with mingled grief and anger left the room and took her old place on her fathers bed her heart went out to him with a stronger movement than ever at the thought that people would blame him maggie hated blame she had been blamed all her life and nothing had come of it but evil tempers  her father had always defended and excused her and her loving remembrance of his tenderness was a force within her that would enable her to do or bear anything for his sake  tom was a little shocked at maggies outbursttelling him as well as his mother what it was right to do she ought to have learned better than have those hectoring assuming manners by this time but he presently went into his fathers room and the sight there touched him in a way that effaced the slighter impressions of the previous hour when maggie saw how he was moved she went to him and put her arm round his neck as he sat by the bed and the two children forgot everything else in the sense that they had one father and one sorrow    chapter iii  the family council   it was at eleven oclock the next morning that the aunts and uncles came to hold their consultation the fire was lighted in the large parlor and poor mrs tulliver with a confused impression that it was a great occasion like a funeral unbagged the bellrope tassels and unpinned the curtains adjusting them in proper folds looking round and shaking her head sadly at the polished tops and legs of the tables which sister pullet herself could not accuse of insufficient brightness  mr deane was not coming he was away on business but mrs deane appeared punctually in that handsome new gig with the head to it and the liveryservant driving it which had thrown so clear a light on several traits in her character to some of her female friends in st oggs mr deane had been advancing in the world as rapidly as mr tulliver had been going down in it and in mrs deanes house the dodson linen and plate were beginning to hold quite a subordinate position as a mere supplement to the handsomer articles of the same kind purchased in recent yearsa change which had caused an occasional coolness in the sisterly intercourse between her and mrs glegg who felt that susan was getting like the rest and there would soon be little of the true dodson spirit surviving except in herself and it might be hoped in those nephews who supported the dodson name on the family land far away in the wolds  people who live at a distance are naturally less faulty than those immediately under our own eyes and it seems superfluous when we consider the remote geographical position of the ethiopians and how very little the greeks had to do with them to inquire further why homer calls them blameless  mrs deane was the first to arrive and when she had taken her seat in the large parlor mrs tulliver came down to her with her comely face a little distorted nearly as it would have been if she had been crying she was not a woman who could shed abundant tears except in moments when the prospect of losing her furniture became unusually vivid but she felt how unfitting it was to be quite calm under present circumstances  oh sister what a world this is she exclaimed as she entered what trouble oh dear  mrs deane was a thinlipped woman who made small wellconsidered speeches on peculiar occasions repeating them afterward to her husband and asking him if she had not spoken very properly  yes sister she said deliberately this is a changing world and we dont know today what may happen tomorrow but its right to be prepared for all things and if troubles sent to remember as it isnt sent without a cause im very sorry for you as a sister and if the doctor orders jelly for mr tulliver i hope youll let me know ill send it willingly for it is but right he should have proper attendance while hes ill  thank you susan said mrs tulliver rather faintly withdrawing her fat hand from her sisters thin one but theres been no talk o jelly yet then after a moments pause she added theres a dozen o cut jellyglasses upstairsi shall never put jelly into em no more  her voice was rather agitated as she uttered the last words but the sound of wheels diverted her thoughts mr and mrs glegg were come and were almost immediately followed by mr and mrs pullet  mrs pullet entered crying as a compendious mode at all times of expressing what were her views of life in general and what in brief were the opinions she held concerning the particular case before her  mrs glegg had on her fuzziest front and garments which appeared to have had a recent resurrection from rather a creasy form of burial a costume selected with the high moral purpose of instilling perfect humility into bessy and her children  mrs g wont you come nearer the fire said her husband unwilling to take the more comfortable seat without offering it to her  you see ive seated myself here mr glegg returned this superior woman you can roast yourself if you like  well said mr glegg seating himself goodhumoredly and hows the poor man upstairs  dr turnbull thought him a deal better this morning said mrs tulliver he took more notice and spoke to me but hes never known tom yetlooks at the poor lad as if he was a stranger though he said something once about tom and the pony the doctor says his memorys gone a long way back and he doesnt know tom because hes thinking of him when he was little eh dear eh dear  i doubt its the water got on his brain said aunt pullet turning round from adjusting her cap in a melancholy way at the pierglass its much if he ever gets up again and if he does hell most like be childish as mr carr was poor man they fed him with a spoon as if hed been a babby for three year hed quite lost the use of his limbs but then hed got a bath chair and somebody to draw him and thats what you wont have i doubt bessy  sister pullet said mrs glegg severely if i understand right weve come together this morning to advise and consult about whats to be done in this disgrace as has fallen upon the family and not to talk o people as dont belong to us mr carr was none of our blood nor noways connected with us as ive ever heared  sister glegg said mrs pullet in a pleading tone drawing on her gloves again and stroking the fingers in an agitated manner if youve got anything disrespectful to say o mr carr i do beg of you as you wont say it to me i know what he was she added with a sigh his breath was short to that degree as you could hear him two rooms off  sophy said mrs glegg with indignant disgust you do talk o peoples complaints till its quite undecent but i say again as i said before i didnt come away from home to talk about acquaintances whether theyd short breath or long if we arent come together for one to hear what the other ull do to save a sister and her children from the parish i shall go back one cant act without the other i suppose it isnt to be expected as i should do everything  well jane said mrs pullet i dont see as youve been so very forrard at doing so far as i know this is the first time as here youve been since its been known as the bailiffs in the house and i was here yesterday and looked at all bessys linen and things and i told her id buy in the spotted tablecloths i couldnt speak fairer for as for the teapot as she doesnt want to go out o the family it stands to sense i cant do with two silver teapots not if it hadnt a straight spout but the spotted damask i was allays fond on  i wish it could be managed so as my teapot and chany and the best castors neednt be put up for sale said poor mrs tulliver beseechingly and the sugartongs the first things ever i bought  but that cant be helped you know said mr glegg if one o the family chooses to buy em in they can but one thing must be bid for as well as another  and it isnt to be looked for said uncle pullet with unwonted independence of idea as your own family should pay more for things nor theyll fetch they may go for an old song by auction  oh dear oh dear said mrs tulliver to think o my chany being sold i that way and i bought it when i was married just as you did yours jane and sophy and i know you didnt like mine because o the sprig but i was fond of it and theres never been a bit broke for ive washed it myself and theres the tulips on the cups and the roses as anybody might go and look at em for pleasure you wouldnt like your chany to go for an old song and be broke to pieces though yours has got no color in it janeits all white and fluted and didnt cost so much as mine and theres the castors sister deane i cant think but youd like to have the castors for ive heard you say theyre pretty  well ive no objection to buy some of the best things said mrs deane rather loftily we can do with extra things in our house  best things exclaimed mrs glegg with severity which had gathered intensity from her long silence it drives me past patience to hear you all talking o best things and buying in this that and the other such as silver and chany you must bring your mind to your circumstances bessy and not be thinking o silver and chany but whether you shall get so much as a flockbed to lie on and a blanket to cover you and a stool to sit on you must remember if you get em itll be because your friends have bought em for you for youre dependent upon them for everything for your husband lies there helpless and hasnt got a penny i the world to call his own and its for your own good i say this for its right you should feel what your state is and what disgrace your husbands brought on your own family as youve got to look to for everything and be humble in your mind  mrs glegg paused for speaking with much energy for the good of others is naturally exhausting  mrs tulliver always borne down by the family predominance of sister jane who had made her wear the yoke of a younger sister in very tender years said pleadingly  im sure sister ive never asked anybody to do anything only buy things as it ud be a pleasure to em to have so as they mightnt go and be spoiled i strange houses i never asked anybody to buy the things in for me and my children though theres the linen i spun and i thought when tom was borni thought one o the first things when he was lying i the cradle as all the things id bought wi my own money and been so careful of ud go to him but ive said nothing as i wanted my sisters to pay their money for me what my husband has done for his sisters unknown and we should ha been better off this day if it hadnt been as hes lent money and never asked for it again  come come said mr glegg kindly dont let us make things too dark whats done cant be undone we shall make a shift among us to buy whats sufficient for you though as mrs g says they must be useful plain things we mustnt be thinking o whats unnecessary a table and a chair or two and kitchen things and a good bed and suchlike why ive seen the day when i shouldnt ha known myself if id lain on sacking istead o the floor we get a deal o useless things about us only because weve got the money to spend  mr glegg said mrs g if youll be kind enough to let me speak istead o taking the words out o my mouthi was going to say bessy as its fine talking for you to say as youve never asked us to buy anything for you let me tell you you ought to have asked us pray how are you to be purvided for if your own family dont help you you must go to the parish if they didnt and you ought to know that and keep it in mind and ask us humble to do what we can for you istead o saying and making a boast as youve never asked us for anything  you talked o the mosses and what mr tullivers done for em said uncle pullet who became unusually suggestive where advances of money were concerned havent they been anear you they ought to do something as well as other folks and if hes lent em money they ought to be made to pay it back  yes to be sure said mrs deane ive been thinking so how is it mr and mrs moss arent here to meet us it is but right they should do their share  oh dear said mrs tulliver i never sent em word about mr tulliver and they live so backard among the lanes at basset they niver hear anything only when mr moss comes to market but i niver gave em a thought i wonder maggie didnt though for she was allays so fond of her aunt moss  why dont your children come in bessy said mrs pullet at the mention of maggie they should hear what their aunts and uncles have got to say and maggiewhen its me as have paid for half her schooling she ought to think more of her aunt pullet than of aunt moss i may go off sudden when i get home today theres no telling  if id had my way said mrs glegg the children ud ha been in the room from the first its time they knew who theyve to look to and its right as somebody should talk to em and let em know their condition i life and what theyre come down to and make em feel as theyve got to suffer for their fathers faults  well ill go and fetch em sister said mrs tulliver resignedly she was quite crushed now and thought of the treasures in the storeroom with no other feeling than blank despair  she went upstairs to fetch tom and maggie who were both in their fathers room and was on her way down again when the sight of the storeroom door suggested a new thought to her she went toward it and left the children to go down by themselves  the aunts and uncles appeared to have been in warm discussion when the brother and sister enteredboth with shrinking reluctance for though tom with a practical sagacity which had been roused into activity by the strong stimulus of the new emotions he had undergone since yesterday had been turning over in his mind a plan which he meant to propose to one of his aunts or uncles he felt by no means amicably toward them and dreaded meeting them all at once as he would have dreaded a large dose of concentrated physic which was but just endurable in small draughts as for maggie she was peculiarly depressed this morning she had been called up after brief rest at three oclock and had that strange dreamy weariness which comes from watching in a sickroom through the chill hours of early twilight and breaking dayin which the outside daylight life seems to have no importance and to be a mere margin to the hours in the darkened chamber their entrance interrupted the conversation the shaking of hands was a melancholy and silent ceremony till uncle pullet observed as tom approached him  well young sir weve been talking as we should want your pen and ink you can write rarely now after all your schooling i should think  ay ay said uncle glegg with admonition which he meant to be kind we must look to see the good of all this schooling as your fathers sunk so much money in now    when land is gone and moneys spent   then learning is most excellent  nows the time tom to let us see the good o your learning let us see whether you can do better than i can as have made my fortin without it but i began wi doing with little you see i could live on a basin o porridge and a crust o breadandcheese but i doubt high living and high learning ull make it harder for you young man nor it was for me  but he must do it interposed aunt glegg energetically whether its hard or no he hasnt got to consider whats hard he must consider as he isnt to trusten to his friends to keep him in idleness and luxury hes got to bear the fruits of his fathers misconduct and bring his mind to fare hard and to work hard and he must be humble and grateful to his aunts and uncles for what theyre doing for his mother and father as must be turned out into the streets and go to the workhouse if they didnt help em and his sister too continued mrs glegg looking severely at maggie who had sat down on the sofa by her aunt deane drawn to her by the sense that she was lucys mother she must make up her mind to be humble and work for therell be no servants to wait on her any moreshe must remember that she must do the work o the house and she must respect and love her aunts as have done so much for her and saved their money to leave to their nepheys and nieces  tom was still standing before the table in the centre of the group there was a heightened color in his face and he was very far from looking humbled but he was preparing to say in a respectful tone something he had previously meditated when the door opened and his mother reentered  poor mrs tulliver had in her hands a small tray on which she had placed her silver teapot a specimen teacup and saucer the castors and sugartongs  see here sister she said looking at mrs deane as she set the tray on the table i thought perhaps if you looked at the teapot againits a good while since you saw ityou might like the pattern better it makes beautiful tea and theres a stand and everything you might use it for every day or else lay it by for lucy when she goes to housekeeping i should be so loath for em to buy it at the golden lion said the poor woman her heart swelling and the tears comingmy teapot as i bought when i was married and to think of its being scratched and set before the travellers and folks and my letters on itsee here e dand everybody to see em  ah dear dear said aunt pullet shaking her head with deep sadness its very badto think o the family initials going about everywhereit niver was so before youre a very unlucky sister bessy but whats the use o buying the teapot when theres the linen and spoons and everything to go and some of em with your full nameand when its got that straight spout too  as to disgrace o the family said mrs glegg that cant be helped wi buying teapots the disgrace is for one o the family to ha married a man as has brought her to beggary the disgrace is as theyre to be sold up we cant hinder the country from knowing that  maggie had started up from the sofa at the allusion to her father but tom saw her action and flushed face in time to prevent her from speaking be quiet maggie he said authoritatively pushing her aside it was a remarkable manifestation of selfcommand and practical judgment in a lad of fifteen that when his aunt glegg ceased he began to speak in a quiet and respectful manner though with a good deal of trembling in his voice for his mothers words had cut him to the quick  then aunt he said looking straight at mrs glegg if you think its a disgrace to the family that we should be sold up wouldnt it be better to prevent it altogether and if you and aunt pullet he continued looking at the latter think of leaving any money to me and maggie wouldnt it be better to give it now and pay the debt were going to be sold up for and save my mother from parting with her furniture  there was silence for a few moments for every one including maggie was astonished at toms sudden manliness of tone uncle glegg was the first to speak  ay ay young man come now you show some notion o things but theres the interest you must remember your aunts get five per cent on their money and theyd lose that if they advanced it you havent thought o that  i could work and pay that every year said tom promptly id do anything to save my mother from parting with her things  well done said uncle glegg admiringly he had been drawing tom out rather than reflecting on the practicability of his proposal but he had produced the unfortunate result of irritating his wife  yes mr glegg said that lady with angry sarcasm its pleasant work for you to be giving my money away as youve pretended to leave at my own disposal and my money as was my own fathers gift and not yours mr glegg and ive saved it and added to it myself and had more to put out almost every year and its to go and be sunk in other folks furniture and encourage em in luxury and extravagance as theyve no means of supporting and im to alter my will or have a codicil made and leave two or three hundred less behind me when i dieme as have allays done right and been careful and the eldest o the family and my moneys to go and be squandered on them as have had the same chance as me only theyve been wicked and wasteful sister pullet you may do as you like and you may let your husband rob you back again o the money hes given you but that isnt my sperrit  la jane how fiery you are said mrs pullet im sure youll have the blood in your head and have to be cupped im sorry for bessy and her childrenim sure i think of em o nights dreadful for i sleep very bad wi this new medicinebut its no use for me to think o doing anything if you wont meet me halfway  why theres this to be considered said mr glegg its no use to pay off this debt and save the furniture when theres all the law debts behind as ud take every shilling and more than could be made out o land and stock for ive made that out from lawyer gore wed need save our money to keep the poor man with instead o spending it on furniture as he can neither eat nor drink you will be so hasty jane as if i didnt know what was reasonable  then speak accordingly mr glegg said his wife with slow loud emphasis bending her head toward him significantly  toms countenance had fallen during this conversation and his lip quivered but he was determined not to give way he would behave like a man maggie on the contrary after her momentary delight in toms speech had relapsed into her state of trembling indignation her mother had been standing close by toms side and had been clinging to his arm ever since he had last spoken maggie suddenly started up and stood in front of them her eyes flashing like the eyes of a young lioness  why do you come then she burst out talking and interfering with us and scolding us if you dont mean to do anything to help my poor motheryour own sisterif youve no feeling for her when shes in trouble and wont part with anything though you would never miss it to save her from pain keep away from us then and dont come to find fault with my fatherhe was better than any of you he was kindhe would have helped you if you had been in trouble tom and i dont ever want to have any of your money if you wont help my mother wed rather not have it well do without you  maggie having hurled her defiance at aunts and uncles in this way stood still with her large dark eyes glaring at them as if she were ready to await all consequences  mrs tulliver was frightened there was something portentous in this mad outbreak she did not see how life could go on after it tom was vexed it was no use to talk so the aunts were silent with surprise for some moments at length in a case of aberration such as this comment presented itself as more expedient than any answer  you havent seen the end o your trouble wi that child bessy said mrs pullet shes beyond everything for boldness and unthankfulness its dreadful i might ha let alone paying for her schooling for shes worse nor ever  its no more than what ive allays said followed mrs glegg other folks may be surprised but im not ive said over and over againyears ago ive saidmark my words that child ull come to no good there isnt a bit of our family in her and as for her having so much schooling i never thought well o that id my reasons when i said i wouldnt pay anything toward it  come come said mr glegg lets waste no more time in talkinglets go to business tom now get the pen and ink  while mr glegg was speaking a tall dark figure was seen hurrying past the window  why theres mrs moss said mrs tulliver the bad news must ha reached her then and she went out to open the door maggie eagerly following her  thats fortunate said mrs glegg she can agree to the list o things to be bought in its but right she should do her share when its her own brother  mrs moss was in too much agitation to resist mrs tullivers movement as she drew her into the parlor automatically without reflecting that it was hardly kind to take her among so many persons in the first painful moment of arrival the tall worn darkhaired woman was a strong contrast to the dodson sisters as she entered in her shabby dress with her shawl and bonnet looking as if they had been hastily huddled on and with that entire absence of selfconsciousness which belongs to keenly felt trouble maggie was clinging to her arm and mrs moss seemed to notice no one else except tom whom she went straight up to and took by the hand  oh my dear children she burst out youve no call to think well o me im a poor aunt to you for im one o them as take all and give nothing hows my poor brother  mr turnbull thinks hell get better said maggie sit down aunt gritty dont fret  oh my sweet child i feel torn i two said mrs moss allowing maggie to lead her to the sofa but still not seeming to notice the presence of the rest weve three hundred pounds o my brothers money and now he wants it and you all want it poor thingsand yet we must be sold up to pay it and theres my poor childreneight of em and the little un of all cant speak plain and i feel as if i was a robber but im sure id no thought as my brother  the poor woman was interrupted by a rising sob  three hundred pounds oh dear dear said mrs tulliver who when she had said that her husband had done unknown things for his sister had not had any particular sum in her mind and felt a wifes irritation at having been kept in the dark  what madness to be sure said mrs glegg a man with a family hed no right to lend his money i that way and without security ill be bound if the truth was known  mrs gleggs voice had arrested mrs mosss attention and looking up she said  yes there was security my husband gave a note for it were not that sort o people neither of us as ud rob my brothers children and we looked to paying back the money when the times got a bit better  well but now said mr glegg gently hasnt your husband no way o raising this money because it ud be a little fortin like for these folks if we can do without tullivers being made a bankrupt your husbands got stock it is but right he should raise the money as it seems to menot but what im sorry for you mrs moss  oh sir you dont know what bad luck my husbands had with his stock the farms suffering so as never was for want o stock and weve sold all the wheat and were behind with our rentnot but what wed like to do whats right and id sit up and work half the night if it ud be any good but theres them poor childrenfour of em such little uns  dont cry so aunt dont fret whispered maggie who had kept hold of mrs mosss hand  did mr tulliver let you have the money all at once said mrs tulliver still lost in the conception of things which had been going on without her knowledge  no at twice said mrs moss rubbing her eyes and making an effort to restrain her tears the last was after my bad illness four years ago as everything went wrong and there was a new note made then what with illness and bad luck ive been nothing but cumber all my life  yes mrs moss said mrs glegg with decision yours is a very unlucky family the mores the pity for my sister  i set off in the cart as soon as ever i heard o what had happened said mrs moss looking at mrs tulliver i should never ha stayed away all this while if youd thought well to let me know and it isnt as im thinking all about ourselves and nothing about my brother only the money was so on my mind i couldnt help speaking about it and my husband and me desire to do the right thing sir she added looking at mr glegg and well make shift and pay the money come what will if thats all my brothers got to trust to weve been used to trouble and dont look for much else its only the thought o my poor children pulls me i two  why theres this to be thought on mrs moss said mr glegg and its right to warn youif tullivers made a bankrupt and hes got a noteofhand of your husbands for three hundred pounds youll be obliged to pay it th assignees ull come on you for it  oh dear oh dear said mrs tulliver thinking of the bankruptcy and not of mrs mosss concern in it poor mrs moss herself listened in trembling submission while maggie looked with bewildered distress at tom to see if he showed any signs of understanding this trouble and caring about poor aunt moss tom was only looking thoughtful with his eyes on the tablecloth  and if he isnt made bankrupt continued mr glegg as i said before three hundred pounds ud be a little fortin for him poor man we dont know but what he may be partly helpless if he ever gets up again im very sorry if it goes hard with you mrs moss but my opinion is looking at it one way itll be right for you to raise the money and looking at it th other way youll be obliged to pay it you wont think ill o me for speaking the truth  uncle said tom looking up suddenly from his meditative view of the tablecloth i dont think it would be right for my aunt moss to pay the money if it would be against my fathers will for her to pay it would it  mr glegg looked surprised for a moment or two before he said why no perhaps not tom but then hed ha destroyed the note you know we must look for the note what makes you think it ud be against his will  why said tom coloring but trying to speak firmly in spite of a boyish tremor i remember quite well before i went to school to mr stelling my father said to me one night when we were sitting by the fire together and no one else was in the room  tom hesitated a little and then went on  he said something to me about maggie and then he said ive always been good to my sister though she married against my will and ive lent moss money but i shall never think of distressing him to pay it id rather lose it my children must not mind being the poorer for that and now my fathers ill and not able to speak for himself i shouldnt like anything to be done contrary to what he said to me  well but then my boy said uncle glegg whose good feeling led him to enter into toms wish but who could not at once shake off his habitual abhorrence of such recklessness as destroying securities or alienating anything important enough to make an appreciable difference in a mans property we should have to make away wi the note you know if were to guard against what may happen supposing your fathers made bankrupt  mr glegg interrupted his wife severely mind what youre saying youre putting yourself very forrard in other folkss business if you speak rash dont say it was my fault  thats such a thing as i never heared of before said uncle pullet who had been making haste with his lozenge in order to express his amazementmaking away with a note i should think anybody could set the constable on you for it  well but said mrs tulliver if the notes worth all that money why cant we pay it away and save my things from going away weve no call to meddle with your uncle and aunt moss tom if you think your father ud be angry when he gets well  mrs tulliver had not studied the question of exchange and was straining her mind after original ideas on the subject  pooh pooh pooh you women dont understand these things said uncle glegg theres no way o making it safe for mr and mrs moss but destroying the note  then i hope youll help me do it uncle said tom earnestly if my father shouldnt get well i should be very unhappy to think anything had been done against his will that i could hinder and im sure he meant me to remember what he said that evening i ought to obey my fathers wish about his property  even mrs glegg could not withhold her approval from toms words she felt that the dodson blood was certainly speaking in him though if his father had been a dodson there would never have been this wicked alienation of money maggie would hardly have restrained herself from leaping on toms neck if her aunt moss had not prevented her by herself rising and taking toms hand while she said with rather a choked voice  youll never be the poorer for this my dear boy if theres a god above and if the moneys wanted for your father moss and me ull pay it the same as if there was ever such security well do as wed be done by for if my children have got no other luck theyve got an honest father and mother  well said mr glegg who had been meditating after toms words we shouldnt be doing any wrong by the creditors supposing your father was bankrupt ive been thinking o that for ive been a creditor myself and seen no end o cheating if he meant to give your aunt the money before ever he got into this sad work o lawing its the same as if hed made away with the note himself for hed made up his mind to be that much poorer but theres a deal o things to be considered young man mr glegg added looking admonishingly at tom when you come to money business and you may be taking one mans dinner away to make another mans breakfast you dont understand that i doubt  yes i do said tom decidedly i know if i owe money to one man ive no right to give it to another but if my father had made up his mind to give my aunt the money before he was in debt he had a right to do it  well done young man i didnt think youd been so sharp said uncle glegg with much candor but perhaps your father did make away with the note let us go and see if we can find it in the chest  its in my fathers room let us go too aunt gritty whispered maggie    chapter iv  a vanishing gleam   mr tulliver even between the fits of spasmodic rigidity which had recurred at intervals ever since he had been found fallen from his horse was usually in so apathetic a condition that the exits and entrances into his room were not felt to be of great importance he had lain so still with his eyes closed all this morning that maggie told her aunt moss she must not expect her father to take any notice of them  they entered very quietly and mrs moss took her seat near the head of the bed while maggie sat in her old place on the bed and put her hand on her fathers without causing any change in his face  mr glegg and tom had also entered treading softly and were busy selecting the key of the old oak chest from the bunch which tom had brought from his fathers bureau they succeeded in opening the chestwhich stood opposite the foot of mr tullivers bedand propping the lid with the iron holder without much noise  theres a tin box whispered mr glegg hed most like put a small thing like a note in there lift it out tom but ill just lift up these deedstheyre the deeds o the house and mill i supposeand see what there is under em  mr glegg had lifted out the parchments and had fortunately drawn back a little when the iron holder gave way and the heavy lid fell with a loud bang that resounded over the house  perhaps there was something in that sound more than the mere fact of the strong vibration that produced the instantaneous effect on the frame of the prostrate man and for the time completely shook off the obstruction of paralysis the chest had belonged to his father and his fathers father and it had always been rather a solemn business to visit it all longknown objects even a mere window fastening or a particular doorlatch have sounds which are a sort of recognized voice to usa voice that will thrill and awaken when it has been used to touch deeplying fibres in the same moment when all the eyes in the room were turned upon him he started up and looked at the chest the parchments in mr gleggs hand and tom holding the tin box with a glance of perfect consciousness and recognition  what are you going to do with those deeds he said in his ordinary tone of sharp questioning whenever he was irritated come here tom what do you do going to my chest  tom obeyed with some trembling it was the first time his father had recognized him but instead of saying anything more to him his father continued to look with a growing distinctness of suspicion at mr glegg and the deeds  whats been happening then he said sharply what are you meddling with my deeds for is wakem laying hold of everything why dont you tell me what youve been adoing he added impatiently as mr glegg advanced to the foot of the bed before speaking  no no friend tulliver said mr glegg in a soothing tone nobodys getting hold of anything as yet we only came to look and see what was in the chest youve been ill you know and weve had to look after things a bit but lets hope youll soon be well enough to attend to everything yourself  mr tulliver looked around him meditatively at tom at mr glegg and at maggie then suddenly appearing aware that some one was seated by his side at the head of the bed he turned sharply round and saw his sister  eh gritty he said in the halfsad affectionate tone in which he had been wont to speak to her what youre there are you how could you manage to leave the children  oh brother said good mrs moss too impulsive to be prudent im thankful im come now to see you yourself again i thought youd never know us any more  what have i had a stroke said mr tulliver anxiously looking at mr glegg  a fall from your horseshook you a bitthats all i think said mr glegg but youll soon get over it lets hope  mr tulliver fixed his eyes on the bedclothes and remained silent for two or three minutes a new shadow came over his face he looked up at maggie first and said in a lower tone you got the letter then my wench  yes father she said kissing him with a full heart she felt as if her father were come back to her from the dead and her yearning to show him how she had always loved him could be fulfilled  wheres your mother he said so preoccupied that he received the kiss as passively as some quiet animal might have received it  shes downstairs with my aunts father shall i fetch her  ay ay poor bessy and his eyes turned toward tom as maggie left the room  youll have to take care of em both if i die you know tom youll be badly off i doubt but you must see and pay everybody and mindtheres fifty pound o lukes as i put into the businesshe gave me a bit at a time and hes got nothing to show for it you must pay him first thing  uncle glegg involuntarily shook his head and looked more concerned than ever but tom said firmly  yes father and havent you a note from my uncle moss for three hundred pounds we came to look for that what do you wish to be done about it father  ah im glad you thought o that my lad said mr tulliver i allays meant to be easy about that money because o your aunt you mustnt mind losing the money if they cant pay itand its like enough they cant the notes in that box mind i allays meant to be good to you gritty said mr tulliver turning to his sister but you know you aggravated me when you would have moss  at this moment maggie reentered with her mother who came in much agitated by the news that her husband was quite himself again  well bessy he said as she kissed him you must forgive me if youre worse off than you ever expected to be but its the fault o the lawits none o mine he added angrily its the fault o raskills tom you mind this if ever youve got the chance you make wakem smart if you dont youre a goodfornothing son you might horsewhip him but hed set the law on youthe laws made to take care o raskills  mr tulliver was getting excited and an alarming flush was on his face mr glegg wanted to say something soothing but he was prevented by mr tullivers speaking again to his wife theyll make a shift to pay everything bessy he said and yet leave you your furniture and your sistersll do something for youand tomll grow upthough what hes to be i dont knowive done what i couldive given him a eddicationand theres the little wench shell get marriedbut its a poor tale  the sanative effect of the strong vibration was exhausted and with the last words the poor man fell again rigid and insensible though this was only a recurrence of what had happened before it struck all present as if it had been death not only from its contrast with the completeness of the revival but because his words had all had reference to the possibility that his death was near but with poor tulliver death was not to be a leap it was to be a long descent under thickening shadows  mr turnbull was sent for but when he heard what had passed he said this complete restoration though only temporary was a hopeful sign proving that there was no permanent lesion to prevent ultimate recovery  among the threads of the past which the stricken man had gathered up he had omitted the bill of sale the flash of memory had only lit up prominent ideas and he sank into forgetfulness again with half his humiliation unlearned  but tom was clear upon two pointsthat his uncle mosss note must be destroyed and that lukes money must be paid if in no other way out of his own and maggies money now in the savings bank there were subjects you perceive on which tom was much quicker than on the niceties of classical construction or the relations of a mathematical demonstration    chapter v  tom applies his knife to the oyster   the next day at ten oclock tom was on his way to st oggs to see his uncle deane who was to come home last night his aunt had said and tom had made up his mind that his uncle deane was the right person to ask for advice about getting some employment he was in a great way of business he had not the narrow notions of uncle glegg and he had risen in the world on a scale of advancement which accorded with toms ambition  it was a dark chill misty morning likely to end in rainone of those mornings when even happy people take refuge in their hopes and tom was very unhappy he felt the humiliation as well as the prospective hardships of his lot with all the keenness of a proud nature and with all his resolute dutifulness toward his father there mingled an irrepressible indignation against him which gave misfortune the less endurable aspect of a wrong since these were the consequences of going to law his father was really blamable as his aunts and uncles had always said he was and it was a significant indication of toms character that though he thought his aunts ought to do something more for his mother he felt nothing like maggies violent resentment against them for showing no eager tenderness and generosity there were no impulses in tom that led him to expect what did not present itself to him as a right to be demanded why should people give away their money plentifully to those who had not taken care of their own money tom saw some justice in severity and all the more because he had confidence in himself that he should never deserve that just severity it was very hard upon him that he should be put at this disadvantage in life by his fathers want of prudence but he was not going to complain and to find fault with people because they did not make everything easy for him he would ask no one to help him more than to give him work and pay him for it poor tom was not without his hopes to take refuge in under the chill damp imprisonment of the december fog which seemed only like a part of his home troubles at sixteen the mind that has the strongest affinity for fact cannot escape illusion and selfflattery and tom in sketching his future had no other guide in arranging his facts than the suggestions of his own brave selfreliance both mr glegg and mr deane he knew had been very poor once he did not want to save money slowly and retire on a moderate fortune like his uncle glegg but he would be like his uncle deaneget a situation in some great house of business and rise fast he had scarcely seen anything of his uncle deane for the last three yearsthe two families had been getting wider apart but for this very reason tom was the more hopeful about applying to him his uncle glegg he felt sure would never encourage any spirited project but he had a vague imposing idea of the resources at his uncle deanes command he had heard his father say long ago how deane had made himself so valuable to guest  co that they were glad enough to offer him a share in the business that was what tom resolved he would do it was intolerable to think of being poor and looked down upon all ones life he would provide for his mother and sister and make every one say that he was a man of high character he leaped over the years in this way and in the haste of strong purpose and strong desire did not see how they would be made up of slow days hours and minutes  by the time he had crossed the stone bridge over the floss and was entering st oggs he was thinking that he would buy his fathers mill and land again when he was rich enough and improve the house and live there he should prefer it to any smarter newer place and he could keep as many horses and dogs as he liked  walking along the street with a firm rapid step at this point in his reverie he was startled by some one who had crossed without his notice and who said to him in a rough familiar voice  why master tom hows your father this morning it was a publican of st oggs one of his fathers customers  tom disliked being spoken to just then but he said civilly hes still very ill thank you  ay its been a sore chance for you young man hasnt itthis lawsuit turning out against him said the publican with a confused beery idea of being goodnatured  tom reddened and passed on he would have felt it like the handling of a bruise even if there had been the most polite and delicate reference to his position  thats tullivers son said the publican to a grocer standing on the adjacent doorstep  ah said the grocer i thought i knew his features he takes after his mothers family she was a dodson hes a fine straight youth whats he been brought up to  oh to turn up his nose at his fathers customers and be a fine gentlemannot much else i think  tom roused from his dream of the future to a thorough consciousness of the present made all the greater haste to reach the warehouse offices of guest  co where he expected to find his uncle deane but this was mr deanes morning at the band a clerk told him and with some contempt for his ignorance mr deane was not to be found in river street on a thursday morning  at the bank tom was admitted into the private room where his uncle was immediately after sending in his name mr deane was auditing accounts but he looked up as tom entered and putting out his hand said well tom nothing fresh the matter at home i hope hows your father  much the same thank you uncle said tom feeling nervous but i want to speak to you please when youre at liberty  sit down sit down said mr deane relapsing into his accounts in which he and the managingclerk remained so absorbed for the next halfhour that tom began to wonder whether he should have to sit in this way till the bank closedthere seemed so little tendency toward a conclusion in the quiet monotonous procedure of these sleek prosperous men of business would his uncle give him a place in the bank it would be very dull prosy work he thought writing there forever to the loud ticking of a timepiece he preferred some other way of getting rich but at last there was a change his uncle took a pen and wrote something with a flourish at the end  youll just step up to torrys now mr spence will you said mr deane and the clock suddenly became less loud and deliberate in toms ears  well tom said mr deane when they were alone turning his substantial person a little in his chair and taking out his snuffbox whats the business my boy whats the business mr deane who had heard from his wife what had passed the day before thought tom was come to appeal to him for some means of averting the sale  i hope youll excuse me for troubling you uncle said tom coloring but speaking in a tone which though tremulous had a certain proud independence in it but i thought you were the best person to advise me what to do  ah said mr deane reserving his pinch of snuff and looking at tom with new attention let us hear  i want to get a situation uncle so that i may earn some money said tom who never fell into circumlocution  a situation said mr deane and then took his pinch of snuff with elaborate justice to each nostril tom thought snufftaking a most provoking habit  why let me see how old are you said mr deane as he threw himself backward again  sixteen i mean i am going in seventeen said tom hoping his uncle noticed how much beard he had  let me see your father had some notion of making you an engineer i think  but i dont think i could get any money at that for a long while could i  thats true but people dont get much money at anything my boy when theyre only sixteen youve had a good deal of schooling however i suppose youre pretty well up in accounts eh you understand book keeping  no said tom rather falteringly i was in practice but mr stelling says i write a good hand uncle thats my writing added tom laying on the table a copy of the list he had made yesterday  ah thats good thats good but you see the best hand in the worldll not get you a better place than a copyingclerks if you know nothing of bookkeepingnothing of accounts and a copyingclerks a cheap article but what have you been learning at school then  mr deane had not occupied himself with methods of education and had no precise conception of what went forward in expensive schools  we learned latin said tom pausing a little between each item as if he were turning over the books in his schooldesk to assist his memorya good deal of latin and the last year i did themes one week in latin and one in english and greek and roman history and euclid and i began algebra but i left it off again and we had one day every week for arithmetic then i used to have drawinglessons and there were several other books we either read or learned out ofenglish poetry and horæ pauliné and blairs rhetoric the last half  mr deane tapped his snuffbox again and screwed up his mouth he felt in the position of many estimable persons when they had read the new tariff and found how many commodities were imported of which they knew nothing like a cautious man of business he was not going to speak rashly of a raw material in which he had had no experience but the presumption was that if it had been good for anything so successful a man as himself would hardly have been ignorant of it  about latin he had an opinion and thought that in case of another war since people would no longer wear hairpowder it would be well to put a tax upon latin as a luxury much run upon by the higher classes and not telling at all on the shipowning department but for what he knew the horé pauliné might be something less neutral on the whole this list of acquirements gave him a sort of repulsion toward poor tom  well he said at last in rather a cold sardonic tone youve had three years at these thingsyou must be pretty strong in em hadnt you better take up some line where theyll come in handy  tom colored and burst out with new energy  id rather not have any employment of that sort uncle i dont like latin and those things i dont know what i could do with them unless i went as usher in a school and i dont know them well enough for that besides i would as soon carry a pair of panniers i dont want to be that sort of person i should like to enter into some business where i can get ona manly business where i should have to look after things and get credit for what i did and i shall want to keep my mother and sister  ah young gentleman said mr deane with that tendency to repress youthful hopes which stout and successful men of fifty find one of their easiest duties thats sooner said than donesooner said than done  but didnt you get on in that way uncle said tom a little irritated that mr deane did not enter more rapidly into his views i mean didnt you rise from one place to another through your abilities and good conduct  ay ay sir said mr deane spreading himself in his chair a little and entering with great readiness into a retrospect of his own career but ill tell you how i got on it wasnt by getting astride a stick and thinking it would turn into a horse if i sat on it long enough i kept my eyes and ears open sir and i wasnt too fond of my own back and i made my masters interest my own why with only looking into what went on in the mill i found out how there was a waste of five hundred ayear that might be hindered why sir i hadnt more schooling to begin with than a charity boy but i saw pretty soon that i couldnt get on far enough without mastering accounts and i learned em between working hours after id been unlading look here mr deane opened a book and pointed to the page i write a good hand enough and ill match anybody at all sorts of reckoning by the head and i got it all by hard work and paid for it out of my own earningsoften out of my own dinner and supper and i looked into the nature of all the things we had to do in the business and picked up knowledge as i went about my work and turned it over in my head why im no mechanici never pretended to bebut ive thought of a thing or two that the mechanics never thought of and its made a fine difference in our returns and there isnt an article shipped or unshipped at our wharf but i know the quality of it if i got places sir it was because i made myself fit for em if you want to slip into a round hole you must make a ball of yourself thats where it is  mr deane tapped his box again he had been led on by pure enthusiasm in his subject and had really forgotten what bearing this retrospective survey had on his listener he had found occasion for saying the same thing more than once before and was not distinctly aware that he had not his portwine before him  well uncle said tom with a slight complaint in his tone thats what i should like to do cant i get on in the same way  in the same way said mr deane eyeing tom with quiet deliberation there go two or three questions to that master tom that depends on what sort of material you are to begin with and whether youve been put into the right mill but ill tell you what it is your poor father went the wrong way to work in giving you an education it wasnt my business and i didnt interfere but it is as i thought it would be youve had a sort of learning thats all very well for a young fellow like our mr stephen guest wholl have nothing to do but sign checks all his life and may as well have latin inside his head as any other sort of stuffing  but uncle said tom earnestly i dont see why the latin need hinder me from getting on in business i shall soon forget it all it makes no difference to me i had to do my lessons at school but i always thought theyd never be of any use to me afterward i didnt care about them  ay ay thats all very well said mr deane but it doesnt alter what i was going to say your latin and rigmarole may soon dry off you but youll be but a bare stick after that besides its whitened your hands and taken the rough work out of you and what do you know why you know nothing about bookkeeping to begin with and not so much of reckoning as a common shopman youll have to begin at a low round of the ladder let me tell you if you mean to get on in life its no use forgetting the education your fathers been paying for if you dont give yourself a new un  tom bit his lips hard he felt as if the tears were rising and he would rather die than let them  you want me to help you to a situation mr deane went on well ive no fault to find with that im willing to do something for you but you youngsters nowadays think youre to begin with living well and working easy youve no notion of running afoot before you get horseback now you must remember what you areyoure a lad of sixteen trained to nothing particular theres heaps of your sort like so many pebbles made to fit in nowhere well you might be apprenticed to some businessa chemists and druggists perhaps your latin might come in a bit there  tom was going to speak but mr deane put up his hand and said  stop hear what ive got to say you dont want to be a prenticei know i knowyou want to make more haste and you dont want to stand behind a counter but if youre a copyingclerk youll have to stand behind a desk and stare at your ink and paper all day there isnt much outlook there and you wont be much wiser at the end of the year than at the beginning the world isnt made of pen ink and paper and if youre to get on in the world young man you must know what the worlds made of now the best chance for you ud be to have a place on a wharf or in a warehouse where youd learn the smell of things but you wouldnt like that ill be bound youd have to stand cold and wet and be shouldered about by rough fellows youre too fine a gentleman for that  mr deane paused and looked hard at tom who certainly felt some inward struggle before he could reply  i would rather do what will be best for me in the end sir i would put up with what was disagreeable  thats well if you can carry it out but you must remember it isnt only laying hold of a rope you must go on pulling its the mistake you lads make that have got nothing either in your brains or your pocket to think youve got a better start in the world if you stick yourselves in a place where you can keep your coats clean and have the shopwenches take you for fine gentlemen that wasnt the way i started young man when i was sixteen my jacket smelt of tar and i wasnt afraid of handling cheeses thats the reason i can wear good broadcloth now and have my legs under the same table with the head of the best firms in st oggs  uncle deane tapped his box and seemed to expand a little under his waistcoat and gold chain as he squared his shoulders in the chair  is there any place at liberty that you know of now uncle that i should do for i should like to set to work at once said tom with a slight tremor in his voice  stop a bit stop a bit we mustnt be in too great a hurry you must bear in mind if i put you in a place youre a bit young for because you happen to be my nephew i shall be responsible for you and theres no better reason you know than your being my nephew because it remains to be seen whether youre good for anything  i hope i shall never do you any discredit uncle said tom hurt as all boys are at the statement of the unpleasant truth that people feel no ground for trusting them i care about my own credit too much for that  well done tom well done thats the right spirit and i never refuse to help anybody if theyve a mind to do themselves justice theres a young man of twoandtwenty ive got my eye on now i shall do what i can for that young man hes got some pith in him but then you see hes made good use of his timea firstrate calculator can tell you the cubic contents of anything in no time and put me up the other day to a new market for swedish bark hes uncommonly knowing in manufactures that young fellow  id better set about learning bookkeeping hadnt i uncle said tom anxious to prove his readiness to exert himself  yes yes you cant do amiss there butah spence youre back again well tom theres nothing more to be said just now i think and i must go to business again goodby remember me to your mother  mr deane put out his hand with an air of friendly dismissal and tom had not courage to ask another question especially in the presence of mr spence so he went out again into the cold damp air he had to call at his uncle gleggs about the money in the savings bank and by the time he set out again the mist had thickened and he could not see very far before him but going along river street again he was startled when he was within two yards of the projecting side of a shopwindow by the words dorlcote mill in large letters on a handbill placed as if on purpose to stare at him it was the catalogue of the sale to take place the next week it was a reason for hurrying faster out of the town  poor tom formed no visions of the distant future as he made his way homeward he only felt that the present was very hard it seemed a wrong toward him that his uncle deane had no confidence in himdid not see at once that he should acquit himself well which tom himself was as certain of as of the daylight apparently he tom tulliver was likely to be held of small account in the world and for the first time he felt a sinking of heart under the sense that he really was very ignorant and could do very little who was that enviable young man that could tell the cubic contents of things in no time and make suggestions about swedish bark tom had been used to be so entirely satisfied with himself in spite of his breaking down in a demonstration and construing nunc illas promite vires as now promise those men but now he suddenly felt at a disadvantage because he knew less than some one else knew there must be a world of things connected with that swedish bark which if he only knew them might have helped him to get on it would have been much easier to make a figure with a spirited horse and a new saddle  two hours ago as tom was walking to st oggs he saw the distant future before him as he might have seen a tempting stretch of smooth sandy beach beyond a belt of flinty shingles he was on the grassy bank then and thought the shingles might soon be passed but now his feet were on the sharp stones the belt of shingles had widened and the stretch of sand had dwindled into narrowness  what did my uncle deane say tom said maggie putting her arm through toms as he was warming himself rather drearily by the kitchen fire did he say he would give you a situation  no he didnt say that he didnt quite promise me anything he seemed to think i couldnt have a very good situation im too young  but didnt he speak kindly tom  kindly pooh whats the use of talking about that i wouldnt care about his speaking kindly if i could get a situation but its such a nuisance and bother ive been at school all this while learning latin and thingsnot a bit of good to meand now my uncle says i must set about learning bookkeeping and calculation and those things he seems to make out im good for nothing  toms mouth twitched with a bitter expression as he looked at the fire  oh what a pity we havent got dominie sampson said maggie who couldnt help mingling some gayety with their sadness if he had taught me bookkeeping by double entry and after the italian method as he did lucy bertram i could teach you tom  you teach yes i dare say thats always the tone you take said tom  dear tom i was only joking said maggie putting her cheek against his coatsleeve  but its always the same maggie said tom with the little frown he put on when he was about to be justifiably severe youre always setting yourself up above me and every one else and ive wanted to tell you about it several times you ought not to have spoken as you did to my uncles and aunts you should leave it to me to take care of my mother and you and not put yourself forward you think you know better than any one but youre almost always wrong i can judge much better than you can  poor tom he had just come from being lectured and made to feel his inferiority the reaction of his strong selfasserting nature must take place somehow and here was a case in which he could justly show himself dominant maggies cheek flushed and her lip quivered with conflicting resentment and affection and a certain awe as well as admiration of toms firmer and more effective character she did not answer immediately very angry words rose to her lips but they were driven back again and she said at last  you often think im conceited tom when i dont mean what i say at all in that way i dont mean to put myself above you i know you behaved better than i did yesterday but you are always so harsh to me tom  with the last words the resentment was rising again  no im not harsh said tom with severe decision im always kind to you and so i shall be i shall always take care of you but you must mind what i say  their mother came in now and maggie rushed away that her burst of tears which she felt must come might not happen till she was safe upstairs they were very bitter tears everybody in the world seemed so hard and unkind to maggie there was no indulgence no fondness such as she imagined when she fashioned the world afresh in her own thoughts in books there were people who were always agreeable or tender and delighted to do things that made one happy and who did not show their kindness by finding fault the world outside the books was not a happy one maggie felt it seemed to be a world where people behaved the best to those they did not pretend to love and that did not belong to them and if life had no love in it what else was there for maggie nothing but poverty and the companionship of her mothers narrow griefs perhaps of her fathers heartcutting childish dependence there is no hopelessness so sad as that of early youth when the soul is made up of wants and has no long memories no superadded life in the life of others though we who looked on think lightly of such premature despair as if our vision of the future lightened the blind sufferers present  maggie in her brown frock with her eyes reddened and her heavy hair pushed back looking from the bed where her father lay to the dull walls of this sad chamber which was the centre of her world was a creature full of eager passionate longings for all that was beautiful and glad thirsty for all knowledge with an ear straining after dreamy music that died away and would not come near to her with a blind unconscious yearning for something that would link together the wonderful impressions of this mysterious life and give her soul a sense of home in it  no wonder when there is this contrast between the outward and the inward that painful collisions come of it    chapter vi  tending to refute the popular prejudice against the present of a pocketknife   in that dark time of december the sale of the household furniture lasted beyond the middle of the second day mr tulliver who had begun in his intervals of consciousness to manifest an irritability which often appeared to have as a direct effect the recurrence of spasmodic rigidity and insensibility had lain in this living death throughout the critical hours when the noise of the sale came nearest to his chamber mr turnbull had decided that it would be a less risk to let him remain where he was than to remove him to lukes cottagea plan which the good luke had proposed to mrs tulliver thinking it would be very bad if the master were to waken up at the noise of the sale and the wife and children had sat imprisoned in the silent chamber watching the large prostrate figure on the bed and trembling lest the blank face should suddenly show some response to the sounds which fell on their own ears with such obstinate painful repetition  but it was over at last that time of importunate certainty and eyestraining suspense the sharp sound of a voice almost as metallic as the rap that followed it had ceased the tramping of footsteps on the gravel had died out mrs tullivers blond face seemed aged ten years by the last thirty hours the poor womans mind had been busy divining when her favorite things were being knocked down by the terrible hammer her heart had been fluttering at the thought that first one thing and then another had gone to be identified as hers in the hateful publicity of the golden lion and all the while she had to sit and make no sign of this inward agitation such things bring lines in wellrounded faces and broaden the streaks of white among the hairs that once looked as if they had been dipped in pure sunshine already at three oclock kezia the goodhearted badtempered housemaid who regarded all people that came to the sale as her personal enemies the dirt on whose feet was of a peculiarly vile quality had begun to scrub and swill with an energy much assisted by a continual low muttering against folks as came to buy up other folks things and made light of scrazing the tops of mahogany tables over which better folks than themselves had had tosuffer a waste of tissue through evaporation she was not scrubbing indiscriminately for there would be further dirt of the same atrocious kind made by people who had still to fetch away their purchases but she was bent on bringing the parlor where that pipesmoking pig the bailiff had sat to such an appearance of scant comfort as could be given to it by cleanliness and the few articles of furniture bought in for the family her mistress and the young folks should have their tea in it that night kezia was determined  it was between five and six oclock near the usual teatime when she came upstairs and said that master tom was wanted the person who wanted him was in the kitchen and in the first moments by the imperfect fire and candle light tom had not even an indefinite sense of any acquaintance with the rather broadset but active figure perhaps two years older than himself that looked at him with a pair of blue eyes set in a disc of freckles and pulled some curly red locks with a strong intention of respect a lowcrowned oilskincovered hat and a certain shiny deposit of dirt on the rest of the costume as of tablets prepared for writing upon suggested a calling that had to do with boats but this did not help toms memory  sarvant master tom said he of the red locks with a smile which seemed to break through a selfimposed air of melancholy you dont know me again i doubt he went on as tom continued to look at him inquiringly but id like to talk to you by yourself a bit please  theres a fire i the parlor master tom said kezia who objected to leaving the kitchen in the crisis of toasting  come this way then said tom wondering if this young fellow belonged to guest  cos wharf for his imagination ran continually toward that particular spot and uncle deane might any time be sending for him to say that there was a situation at liberty  the bright fire in the parlor was the only light that showed the few chairs the bureau the carpetless floor and the one tableno not the one table there was a second table in a corner with a large bible and a few other books upon it it was this new strange bareness that tom felt first before he thought of looking again at the face which was also lit up by the fire and which stole a halfshy questioning glance at him as the entirely strange voice said  why you dont remember bob then as you gen the pocketknife to mr tom  the roughhandled pocketknife was taken out in the same moment and the largest blade opened by way of irresistible demonstration  what bob jakin said tom not with any cordial delight for he felt a little ashamed of that early intimacy symbolized by the pocketknife and was not at all sure that bobs motives for recalling it were entirely admirable  ay ay bob jakin if jakin it must be cause theres so many bobs as you went arter the squerrils with that day as i plumped right down from the bough and bruised my shins a good unbut i got the squerril tight for all that an a scratter it was an this littlish blades broke you see but i wouldnt hev a new un put in cause they might be cheatin me an givin me another knife instid for there isnt such a blade i the countryits got used to my hand like an there was niver nobody else gen me nothin but what i got by my own sharpness only you mr tom if it wasnt bill fawks as gen me the terrier pup istid o drowndint it an i had to jaw him a good un afore hed give it me  bob spoke with a sharp and rather treble volubility and got through his long speech with surprising despatch giving the blade of his knife an affectionate rub on his sleeve when he had finished  well bob said tom with a slight air of patronage the foregoing reminscences having disposed him to be as friendly as was becoming though there was no part of his acquaintance with bob that he remembered better than the cause of their parting quarrel is there anything i can do for you  why no mr tom answered bob shutting up his knife with a click and returning it to his pocket where he seemed to be feeling for something else i shouldnt ha come back upon you now yere i trouble an folks say as the master as i used to frighten the birds for an he flogged me a bit for fun when he catched me eatin the turnip as they say hell niver lift up his head no morei shouldnt ha come now to ax you to gi me another knife cause you gen me one afore if a chap gives me one black eye thats enough for me i shant ax him for another afore i sarve him out an a good turns worth as much as a bad un anyhow i shall niver grow downards again mr tom an you war the little chap as i liked the best when i war a little chap for all you leathered me and wouldnt look at me again theres dick brumby there i could leather him as much as id a mind but lors you get tired o leatherin a chap when you can niver make him see what you want him to shy at in seen chaps as ud stand starin at a bough till their eyes shot out afore theyd see as a birds tail warnt a leaf its poor work goin wi such raff but you war allays a rare un at shying mr tom an i could trusten to you for droppin down wi your stick in the nick o time at a runnin rat or a stoat or that when i war abeatin the bushes  bob had drawn out a dirty canvas bag and would perhaps not have paused just then if maggie had not entered the room and darted a look of surprise and curiosity at him whereupon he pulled his red locks again with due respect but the next moment the sense of the altered room came upon maggie with a force that overpowered the thought of bobs presence her eyes had immediately glanced from him to the place where the bookcase had hung there was nothing now but the oblong unfaded space on the wall and below it the small table with the bible and the few other books  oh tom she burst out clasping her hands where are the books i thought my uncle glegg said he would buy them didnt he are those all theyve left us  i suppose so said tom with a sort of desperate indifference why should they buy many books when they bought so little furniture  oh but tom said maggie her eyes filling with tears as she rushed up to the table to see what books had been rescued our dear old pilgrims progress that you colored with your little paints and that picture of pilgrim with a mantle on looking just like a turtleoh dear maggie went on half sobbing as she turned over the few books i thought we should never part with that while we lived everything is going away from us the end of our lives will have nothing in it like the beginning  maggie turned away from the table and threw herself into a chair with the big tears ready to roll down her cheeks quite blinded to the presence of bob who was looking at her with the pursuant gaze of an intelligent dumb animal with perceptions more perfect than his comprehension  well bob said tom feeling that the subject of the books was unseasonable i suppose you just came to see me because were in trouble that was very goodnatured of you  ill tell you how it is master tom said bob beginning to untwist his canvas bag you see in been with a barge this two ear thats how in been gettin my livinif it wasnt when i was tentin the furnace between whiles at torrys mill but a fortnit ago id a rare bit o lucki allays thought i was a lucky chap for i niver set a trap but what i catched something but this wasnt trap it was a fire i torrys mill an i doused it else

there war a many trades id thought on for as for the barge im clean tired out wit for it pulls the days out till theyre as long as pigs chitterlings an i thought first id ha ferrets an dogs an be a ratcatcher an then i thought as i should like a bigger way o life as i didnt know so well for in seen to the bottom o ratcatching an i thought an thought till at last i settled id be a packmanfor theyre knowin fellers the packmen arean id carry the lightest things i could i my pack an thered be a use for a fellers tongue as is no use neither wi rats nor barges an i should go about the country far an wide an come round the women wi my tongue an get my dinner hot at the publiclors it ud be a lovely life  bob paused and then said with defiant decision as if resolutely turning his back on that paradisaic picture  but i dont mind about it not a chip an in changed one o the suvreigns to buy my mother a goose for dinner an in bought a blue plush wescoat an a sealskin capfor if i meant to be a packman id do it respectable but i dont mind about it not a chip my yead isnt a turnip an i shall praps have a chance o dousing another fire afore long im a lucky chap so ill thank you to take the nine suvreigns mr tom and set yoursen up with em somehow if its true as the masters broke they maynt go fur enough but theyll help  tom was touched keenly enough to forget his pride and suspicion  youre a very kind fellow bob he said coloring with that little diffident tremor in his voice which gave a certain charm even to toms pride and severity and i shant forget you again though i didnt know you this evening but i cant take the nine sovereigns i should be taking your little fortune from you and they wouldnt do me much good either  wouldnt they mr tom said bob regretfully now dont say so cause you think i want em i arent a poor chap my mother gets a good pennorth wi picking feathers an things an if she eats nothin but breadanwater it runs to fat an im such a lucky chap an i doubt you arent quite so lucky mr tomth old master isnt anyhowan so you might take a slice o my luck an no harm done lors i found a leg o pork i the river one day it had tumbled out o one o them roundsterned dutchmen ill be bound come think better on it mr tom for old quinetance sake else i shall think you bear me a grudge  bob pushed the sovereigns forward but before tom could speak maggie clasping her hands and looking penitently at bob said  oh im so sorry bob i never thought you were so good why i think youre the kindest person in the world  bob had not been aware of the injurious opinion for which maggie was performing an inward act of penitence but he smiled with pleasure at this handsome eulogyespecially from a young lass who as he informed his mother that evening had such uncommon eyes they looked somehow as they made him feel nohow  no indeed bob i cant take them said tom but dont think i feel your kindness less because i say no i dont want to take anything from anybody but to work my own way and those sovereigns wouldnt help me muchthey wouldnt reallyif i were to take them let me shake hands with you instead  tom put out his pink palm and bob was not slow to place his hard grimy hand within it  let me put the sovereigns in the bag again said maggie and youll come and see us when youve bought your pack bob  its like as if id come out o make believe o purpose to show em you said bob with an air of discontent as maggie gave him the bag again ataking em back i this way i am a bit of a do you know but it isnt that sort o doits ony when a fellers a big rogue or a big flat i like to let him in a bit thats all  now dont you be up to any tricks bob said tom else youll get transported some day  no no not me mr tom said bob with an air of cheerful confidence theres no law again fleabites if i wasnt to take a fool in now and then hed niver get any wiser but lors hev a suvreign to buy you and miss summat ony for a tokenjust to match my pocketknife  while bob was speaking he laid down the sovereign and resolutely twisted up his bag again tom pushed back the gold and said no indeed bob thank you heartily but i cant take it and maggie taking it between her fingers held it up to bob and said more persuasively  not now but perhaps another time if ever tom or my father wants help that you can give well let you know wont we tom thats what you would liketo have us always depend on you as a friend that we can go toisnt it bob  yes miss and thank you said bob reluctantly taking the money thats what id like anything as you like an i wish you goodby miss and goodluck mr tom and thank you for shaking hands wi me though you wouldnt take the money  kezias entrance with very black looks to inquire if she shouldnt bring in the tea now or whether the toast was to get hardened to a brick was a seasonable check on bobs flux of words and hastened his parting bow    chapter vii  how a hen takes to stratagem   the days passed and mr tulliver showed at least to the eyes of the medical man stronger and stronger symptoms of a gradual return to his normal condition the paralytic obstruction was little by little losing its tenacity and the mind was rising from under it with fitful struggles like a living creature making its way from under a great snowdrift that slides and slides again and shuts up the newly made opening  time would have seemed to creep to the watchers by the bed if it had only been measured by the doubtful distant hope which kept count of the moments within the chamber but it was measured for them by a fastapproaching dread which made the nights come too quickly while mr tulliver was slowly becoming himself again his lot was hastening toward its moment of most palpable change the taxingmasters had done their work like any respectable gunsmith conscientiously preparing the musket that duly pointed by a brave arm will spoil a life or two allocaturs filing of bills in chancery decrees of sale are legal chainshot or bombshells that can never hit a solitary mark but must fall with widespread shattering so deeply inherent is it in this life of ours that men have to suffer for each others sins so inevitably diffusive is human suffering that even justice makes its victims and we can conceive no retribution that does not spread beyond its mark in pulsations of unmerited pain  by the beginning of the second week in january the bills were out advertising the sale under a decree of chancery of mr tullivers farming and other stock to be followed by a sale of the mill and land held in the proper afterdinner hour at the golden lion the miller himself unaware of the lapse of time fancied himself still in that first stage of his misfortunes when expedients might be thought of and often in his conscious hours talked in a feeble disjointed manner of plans he would carry out when he got well the wife and children were not without hope of an issue that would at least save mr tulliver from leaving the old spot and seeking an entirely strange life for uncle deane had been induced to interest himself in this stage of the business it would not he acknowledged be a bad speculation for guest  co to buy dorlcote mill and carry on the business which was a good one and might be increased by the addition of steam power in which case tulliver might be retained as manager still mr deane would say nothing decided about the matter the fact that wakem held the mortgage on the land might put it into his head to bid for the whole estate and further to outbid the cautious firm of guest co who did not carry on business on sentimental grounds mr deane was obliged to tell mrs tulliver something to that effect when he rode over to the mill to inspect the books in company with mrs glegg for she had observed that if guest co would only think about it mr tullivers father and grandfather had been carrying on dorlcote mill long before the oilmill of that firm had been so much as thought of  mr deane in reply doubted whether that was precisely the relation between the two mills which would determine their value as investments as for uncle glegg the thing lay quite beyond his imagination the goodnatured man felt sincere pity for the tulliver family but his money was all locked up in excellent mortgages and he could run no risk that would be unfair to his own relatives but he had made up his mind that tulliver should have some new flannel waistcoats which he had himself renounced in favor of a more elastic commodity and that he would buy mrs tulliver a pound of tea now and then it would be a journey which his benevolence delighted in beforehand to carry the tea and see her pleasure on being assured it was the best black  still it was clear that mr deane was kindly disposed toward the tullivers one day he had brought lucy who was come home for the christmas holidays and the little blond angelhead had pressed itself against maggies darker cheek with many kisses and some tears these fair slim daughters keep up a tender spot in the heart of many a respectable partner in a respectable firm and perhaps lucys anxious pitying questions about her poor cousins helped to make uncle deane more prompt in finding tom a temporary place in the warehouse and in putting him in the way of getting evening lessons in bookkeeping and calculation  that might have cheered the lad and fed his hopes a little if there had not come at the same time the muchdreaded blow of finding that his father must be a bankrupt after all at least the creditors must be asked to take less than their due which to toms untechnical mind was the same thing as bankruptcy his father must not only be said to have lost his property but to have failedthe word that carried the worst obloquy to toms mind for when the defendants claim for costs had been satisfied there would remain the friendly bill of mr gore and the deficiency at the bank as well as the other debts which would make the assets shrink into unequivocal disproportion not more than ten or twelve shillings in the pound predicted mr deane in a decided tone tightening his lips and the words fell on tom like a scalding liquied leaving a continual smart  he was sadly in want of something to keep up his spirits a little in the unpleasant newness of his positionsuddenly transported from the easy carpeted ennui of studyhours at mr stellings and the busy idleness of castlebuilding in a last half at school to the companionship of sacks and hides and bawling men thundering down heavy weights at his elbow the first step toward getting on in the world was a chill dusty noisy affair and implied going without ones tea in order to stay in st oggs and have an evening lesson from a onearmed elderly clerk in a room smelling strongly of bad tobacco toms young pinkandwhite face had its colors very much deadened by the time he took off his hat at home and sat down with keen hunger to his supper no wonder he was a little cross if his mother or maggie spoke to him  but all this while mrs tulliver was brooding over a scheme by which she and no one else would avert the result most to be dreaded and prevent wakem from entertaining the purpose of bidding for the mill imagine a truly respectable and amiable hen by some portentous anomaly taking to reflection and inventing combinations by which she might prevail on hodge not to wring her neck or send her and her chicks to market the result could hardly be other than much cackling and fluttering mrs tulliver seeing that everything had gone wrong had begun to think she had been too passive in life and that if she had applied her mind to business and taken a strong resolution now and then it would have been all the better for her and her family nobody it appeared had thought of going to speak to wakem on this business of the mill and yet mrs tulliver reflected it would have been quite the shortest method of securing the right end it would have been of no use to be sure for mr tulliver to goeven if he had been able and willingfor he had been going to law against wakem and abusing him for the last ten years wakem was always likely to have a spite against him and now that mrs tulliver had come to the conclusion that her husband was very much in the wrong to bring her into this trouble she was inclined to think that his opinion of wakem was wrong too to be sure wakem had put the bailies in the house and sold them up but she supposed he did that to please the man that lent mr tulliver the money for a lawyer had more folks to please than one and he wasnt likely to put mr tulliver who had gone to law with him above everybody else in the world the attorney might be a very reasonable man why not he had married a miss clint and at the time mrs tulliver had heard of that marriage the summer when she wore her blue satin spencer and had not yet any thoughts of mr tulliver she knew no harm of wakem and certainly toward herself whom he knew to have been a miss dodson it was out of all possibility that he could entertain anything but goodwill when it was once brought home to his observation that she for her part had never wanted to go to law and indeed was at present disposed to take mr wakems view of all subjects rather than her husbands in fact if that attorney saw a respectable matron like herself disposed to give him good words why shouldnt he listen to her representations for she would put the matter clearly before him which had never been done yet and he would never go and bid for the mill on purpose to spite her an innocent woman who thought it likely enough that she had danced with him in their youth at squire darleighs for at those big dances she had often and often danced with young men whose names she had forgotten  mrs tulliver hid these reasonings in her own bosom for when she had thrown out a hint to mr deane and mr glegg that she wouldnt mind going to speak to wakem herself they had said no no no and pooh pooh and let wakem alone in the tone of men who were not likely to give a candid attention to a more definite exposition of her project still less dared she mention the plan to tom and maggie for the children were always so against everything their mother said and tom she observed was almost as much set against wakem as his father was but this unusual concentration of thought naturally gave mrs tulliver an unusual power of device and determination and a day or two before the sale to be held at the golden lion when there was no longer any time to be lost she carried out her plan by a stratagem there were pickles in question a large stock of pickles and ketchup which mrs tulliver possessed and which mr hyndmarsh the grocer would certainly purchase if she could transact the business in a personal interview so she would walk with tom to st oggs that morning and when tom urged that she might let the pickles be at presenthe didnt like her to go about just yetshe appeared so hurt at this conduct in her son contradicting her about pickles which she had made after the family receipts inherited from his own grandmother who had died when his mother was a little girl that he gave way and they walked together until she turned toward danish street where mr hyndmarsh retailed his grocery not far from the offices of mr wakem  that gentleman was not yet come to his office would mrs tulliver sit down by the fire in his private room and wait for him she had not long to wait before the punctual attorney entered knitting his brow with an examining glance at the stout blond woman who rose curtsying deferentiallya tallish man with an aquiline nose and abundant irongray hair you have never seen mr wakem before and are possibly wondering whether he was really as eminent a rascal and as crafty bitter an enemy of honest humanity in general and of mr tulliver in particular as he is represented to be in that eidolon or portrait of him which we have seen to exist in the millers mind  it is clear that the irascible miller was a man to interpret any chanceshot that grazed him as an attempt on his own life and was liable to entanglements in this puzzling world which due consideration had to his own infallibility required the hypothesis of a very active diabolical agency to explain them it is still possible to believe that the attorney was not more guilty toward him than an ingenious machine which performs its work with much regularity is guilty toward the rash man who venturing too near it is caught up by some flywheel or other and suddenly converted into unexpected mincemeat  but it is really impossible to decide this question by a glance at his person the lines and lights of the human countenance are like other symbolsnot always easy to read without a key on an a priori view of wakems aquiline nose which offended mr tulliver there was not more rascality than in the shape of his stiff shirtcollar though this too along with his nose might have become fraught with damnatory meaning when once the rascality was ascertained  mrs tulliver i think said mr wakem  yes sir miss elizabeth dodson as was  pray be seated you have some business with me  well sir yes said mrs tulliver beginning to feel alarmed at her own courage now she was really in presence of the formidable man and reflecting that she had not settled with herself how she should begin mr wakem felt in his waistcoat pockets and looked at her in silence  i hope sir she began at lasti hope sir youre not athinking as i bear you any illwill because o my husbands losing his lawsuit and the bailies being put in and the linen being soldoh dearfor i wasnt brought up in that way im sure you remember my father sir for he was close friends with squire darleigh and we allays went to the dances there the miss dodsonsnobody could be more looked onand justly for there was four of us and youre quite aware as mrs glegg and mrs deane are my sisters and as for going to law and losing money and having sales before youre dead i never saw anything o that before i was married nor for a long while after and im not to be answerable for my bad luck i marrying out o my own family into one where the goingson was different and as for being drawn in t abuse you as other folks abuse you sir that i niver was and nobody can say it of me  mrs tulliver shook her head a little and looked at the hem of her pockethandkerchief  ive no doubt of what you say mrs tulliver said mr wakem with cold politeness but you have some question to ask me  well sir yes but thats what ive said to myselfive said youd had some natral feeling and as for my husband as hasnt been himself for this two months im not adefending him in no way for being so hot about th erigationnot but what theres worse men for he never wronged nobody of a shilling nor a penny not willingly and as for his fieriness and lawing what could i do and him struck as if it was with death when he got the letter as said youd the hold upo the land but i cant believe but what youll behave as a gentleman  what does all this mean mrs tulliver said mr wakem rather sharply what do you want to ask me  why sir if youll be so good said mrs tulliver starting a little and speaking more hurriedlyif youll be so good not to buy the mill an the landthe land wouldnt so much matter only my husband ull be like mad at your having it  something like a new thought flashed across mr wakems face as he said who told you i meant to buy it  why sir its none o my inventing and i should never ha thought of it for my husband as ought to know about the law he allays used to say as lawyers had never no call to buy anythingeither lands or housesfor they allays got em into their hands other ways an i should think that ud be the way with you sir and i niver said as youd be the man to do contrairy to that  ah well who was it that did say so said wakem opening his desk and moving things about with the accompaniment of an almost inaudible whistle  why sir it was mr glegg and mr deane as have all the management and mr deane thinks as guest co ud buy the mill and let mr tulliver work it for em if you didnt bid for it and raise the price and it ud be such a thing for my husband to stay where he is if he could get his living for it was his fathers before him the mill was and his grandfather built it though i wasnt fond o the noise of it when first i was married for there was no mills in our familynot the dodsonsand if id known as the mills had so much to do with the law it wouldnt have been me as ud have been the first dodson to marry one but i went into it blindfold that i did erigation and everything  what guest co would keep the mill in their own hands i suppose and pay your husband wages  oh dear sir its hard to think of said poor mrs tulliver a little tear making its way as my husband should take wage but it ud look more like what used to be to stay at the mill than to go anywhere else and if youll only thinkif you was to bid for the mill and buy it my husband might be struck worse than he was before and niver get better again as hes getting now  well but if i bought the mill and allowed your husband to act as my manager in the same way how then said mr wakem  oh sir i doubt he could niver be got to do it not if the very mill stood still to beg and pray of him for your names like poison to him its so as never was and he looks upon it as youve been the ruin of him all along ever since you set the law on him about the road through the meadowthats eight year ago and hes been going on ever sinceas ive allays told him he was wrong  hes a pigheaded foulmouthed fool burst out mr wakem forgetting himself  oh dear sir said mrs tulliver frightened at a result so different from the one she had fixed her mind on i wouldnt wish to contradict you but its like enough hes changed his mind with this illnesshes forgot a many things he used to talk about and you wouldnt like to have a corpse on your mind if he was to die and they do say as its allays unlucky when dorlcote mill changes hands and the water might all run away and thennot as im wishing you any illluck sir for i forgot to tell you as i remember your wedding as if it was yesterday mrs wakem was a miss clint i know that and my boy as there isnt a nicer handsomer straighter boy nowhere went to school with your son  mr wakem rose opened the door and called to one of his clerks  you must excuse me for interrupting you mrs tulliver i have business that must be attended to and i think there is nothing more necessary to be said  but if you would bear it in mind sir said mrs tulliver rising and not run against me and my children and im not denying mr tullivers been in the wrong but hes been punished enough and theres worse men for its been giving to other folks has been his fault hes done nobody any harm but himself and his familythe mores the pityand i go and look at the bare shelves every day and think where all my things used to stand  yes yes ill bear it in mind said mr wakem hastily looking toward the open door  and if youd please not to say as ive been to speak to you for my son ud be very angry with me for demeaning myself i know he would and ive trouble enough without being scolded by my children  poor mrs tullivers voice trembled a little and she could make no answer to the attorneys good morning but curtsied and walked out in silence  which day is it that dorlcote mill is to be sold wheres the bill said mr wakem to his clerk when they were alone  next friday is the dayfriday at six oclock  oh just run to winships the auctioneer and see if hes at home i have some business for him ask him to come up  although when mr wakem entered his office that morning he had had no intention of purchasing dorlcote mill his mind was already made up mrs tulliver had suggested to him several determining motives and his mental glance was very rapid he was one of those men who can be prompt without being rash because their motives run in fixed tracks and they have no need to reconcile conflicting aims  to suppose that wakem had the same sort of inveterate hatred toward tulliver that tulliver had toward him would be like supposing that a pike and a roach can look at each other from a similar point of view the roach necessarily abhors the mode in which the pike gets his living and the pike is likely to think nothing further even of the most indignant roach than that he is excellent good eating it could only be when the roach choked him that the pike could entertain a strong personal animosity if mr tulliver had ever seriously injured or thwarted the attorney wakem would not have refused him the distinction of being a special object of his vindictiveness but when mr tulliver called wakem a rascal at the market dinnertable the attorneys clients were not a whit inclined to withdraw their business from him and if when wakem himself happened to be present some jocose cattlefeeder stimulated by opportunity and brandy made a thrust at him by alluding to old ladies wills he maintained perfect sang froid and knew quite well that the majority of substantial men then present were perfectly contented with the fact that wakem was wakem that is to say a man who always knew the steppingstones that would carry him through very muddy bits of practice a man who had made a large fortune had a handsome house among the trees at tofton and decidedly the finest stock of portwine in the neighborhood of st oggs was likely to feel himself on a level with public opinion and i am not sure that even honest mr tulliver himself with his general view of law as a cockpit might not under opposite circumstances have seen a fine appropriateness in the truth that wakem was wakem since i have understood from persons versed in history that mankind is not disposed to look narrowly into the conduct of great victors when their victory is on the right side tulliver then could be no obstruction to wakem on the contrary he was a poor devil whom the lawyer had defeated several times a hottempered fellow who would always give you a handle against him wakems conscience was not uneasy because he had used a few tricks against the miller why should he hate that unsuccessful plaintiff that pitiable furious bull entangled in the meshes of a net  still among the various excesses to which human nature is subject moralists have never numbered that of being too fond of the people who openly revile us the successful yellow candidate for the borough of old topping perhaps feels no pursuant meditative hatred toward the blue editor who consoles his subscribers with vituperative rhetoric against yellow men who sell their country and are the demons of private life but he might not be sorry if law and opportunity favored to kick that blue editor to a deeper shade of his favorite color prosperous men take a little vengeance now and then as they take a diversion when it comes easily in their way and is no hindrance to business and such small unimpassioned revenges have an enormous effect in life running through all degrees of pleasant infliction blocking the fit men out of places and blackening characters in unpremeditated talk still more to see people who have been only insignificantly offensive to us reduced in life and humiliated without any special effort of ours is apt to have a soothing flattering influence providence or some other prince of this world it appears has undertaken the task of retribution for us and really by an agreeable constitution of things our enemies somehow dont prosper  wakem was not without this parenthetic vindictiveness toward the uncomplimentary miller and now mrs tulliver had put the notion into his head it presented itself to him as a pleasure to do the very thing that would cause mr tulliver the most deadly mortification and a pleasure of a complex kind not made up of crude malice but mingling with it the relish of selfapprobation to see an enemy humiliated gives a certain contentment but this is jejune compared with the highly blent satisfaction of seeing him humiliated by your benevolent action or concession on his behalf that is a sort of revenge which falls into the scale of virtue and wakem was not without an intention of keeping that scale respectably filled he had once had the pleasure of putting an old enemy of his into one of the st oggs almshouses to the rebuilding of which he had given a large subscription and here was an opportunity of providing for another by making him his own servant such things give a completeness to prosperity and contribute elements of agreeable consciousness that are not dreamed of by that shortsighted overheated vindictiveness which goes out its way to wreak itself in direct injury and tulliver with his rough tongue filed by a sense of obligation would make a better servant than any chancefellow who was capinhand for a situation tulliver was known to be a man of proud honesty and wakem was too acute not to believe in the existence of honesty he was given too observing individuals not to judging of them according to maxims and no one knew better than he that all men were not like himself besides he intended to overlook the whole business of land and mill pretty closely he was fond of these practical rural matters but there were good reasons for purchasing dorlcote mill quite apart from any benevolent vengeance on the miller it was really a capital investment besides guest co were going to bid for it mr guest and mr wakem were on friendly dining terms and the attorney liked to predominate over a shipowner and millowner who was a little too loud in the town affairs as well as in his tabletalk for wakem was not a mere man of business he was considered a pleasant fellow in the upper circles of st oggschatted amusingly over his portwine did a little amateur farming and had certainly been an excellent husband and father at church when he went there he sat under the handsomest of mural monuments erected to the memory of his wife most men would have married again under his circumstances but he was said to be more tender to his deformed son than most men were to their bestshapen offspring not that mr wakem had not other sons beside philip but toward them he held only a chiaroscuro parentage and provided for them in a grade of life duly beneath his own in this fact indeed there lay the clenching motive to the purchase of dorlcote mill while mrs tulliver was talking it had occurred to the rapidminded lawyer among all the other circumstances of the case that this purchase would in a few years to come furnish a highly suitable position for a certain favorite lad whom he meant to bring on in the world  these were the mental conditions on which mrs tulliver had undertaken to act persuasively and had failed a fact which may receive some illustration from the remark of a great philosopher that flyfishers fail in preparing their bait so as to make it alluring in the right quarter for want of a due acquaintance with the subjectivity of fishes    chapter viii  daylight on the wreck   it was a clear frosty january day on which mr tulliver first came downstairs the bright sun on the chestnut boughs and the roofs opposite his window had made him impatiently declare that he would be caged up no longer he thought everywhere would be more cheery under this sunshine than his bedroom for he knew nothing of the bareness below which made the flood of sunshine importunate as if it had an unfeeling pleasure in showing the empty places and the marks where wellknown objects once had been the impression on his mind that it was but yesterday when he received the letter from mr gore was so continually implied in his talk and the attempts to convey to him the idea that many weeks had passed and much had happened since then had been so soon swept away by recurrent forgetfulness that even mr turnbull had begun to despair of preparing him to meet the facts by previous knowledge the full sense of the present could only be imparted gradually by new experiencenot by mere words which must remain weaker than the impressions left by the old experience this resolution to come downstairs was heard with trembling by the wife and children mrs tulliver said tom must not go to st oggs at the usual hour he must wait and see his father downstairs and tom complied though with an intense inward shrinking from the painful scene the hearts of all three had been more deeply dejected than ever during the last few days for guest  co had not bought the mill both mill and land had been knocked down to wakem who had been over the premises and had laid before mr deane and mr glegg in mrs tullivers presence his willingness to employ mr tulliver in case of his recovery as a manager of the business this proposition had occasioned much family debating uncles and aunts were almost unanimously of opinion that such an offer ought not to be rejected when there was nothing in the way but a feeling in mr tullivers mind which as neither aunts nor uncles shared it was regarded as entirely unreasonable and childishindeed as a transferring toward wakem of that indignation and hatred which mr tulliver ought properly to have directed against himself for his general quarrelsomeness and his special exhibition of it in going to law here was an opportunity for mr tulliver to provide for his wife and daughter without any assistance from his wifes relations and without that too evident descent into pauperism which makes it annoying to respectable people to meet the degraded member of the family by the wayside mr tulliver mrs glegg considered must be made to feel when he came to his right mind that he could never humble himself enough for that had come which she had always foreseen would come of his insolence in time past to them as were the best friends hed got to look to mr glegg and mr deane were less stern in their views but they both of them thought tulliver had done enough harm by his hottempered crotchets and ought to put them out of the question when a livelihood was offered him wakem showed a right feeling about the matterhe had no grudge against tulliver  tom had protested against entertaining the proposition he shouldnt like his father to be under wakem he thought it would look meanspirited but his mothers main distress was the utter impossibility of ever turning mr tulliver round about wakem or getting him to hear reason no they would all have to go and live in a pigsty on purpose to spite wakem who spoke so as nobody could be fairer indeed mrs tullivers mind was reduced to such confusion by living in this strange medium of unaccountable sorrow against which she continually appealed by asking oh dear what have i done to deserve worse than other women that maggie began to suspect her poor mothers wits were quite going  tom she said when they were out of their fathers room together we must try to make father understand a little of what has happened before he goes downstairs but we must get my mother away she will say something that will do harm ask kezia to fetch her down and keep her engaged with something in the kitchen  kezia was equal to the task having declared her intention of staying till the master could get about again wage or no wage she had found a certain recompense in keeping a strong hand over her mistress scolding her for moithering herself and going about all day without changing her cap and looking as if she was mushed altogether this time of trouble was rather a saturnalian time to kezia she could scold her betters with unreproved freedom on this particular occasion there were drying clothes to be fetched in she wished to know if one pair of hands could do everything indoors and out and observed that she should have thought it would be good for mrs tulliver to put on her bonnet and get a breath of fresh air by doing that needful piece of work poor mrs tulliver went submissively downstairs to be ordered about by a servant was the last remnant of her household dignitiesshe would soon have no servant to scold her mr tulliver was resting in his chair a little after the fatigue of dressing and maggie and tom were seated near him when luke entered to ask if he should help master downstairs  ay ay luke stop a bit sit down said mr tulliver pointing his stick toward a chair and looking at him with that pursuant gaze which convalescent persons often have for those who have tended them reminding one of an infant gazing about after its nurse for luke had been a constant nightwatcher by his masters bed  hows the water now eh luke said mr tulliver dix hasnt been choking you up again eh  no sir its all right  ay i thought not he wont be in a hurry at that again now rileys been to settle him that was what i said to riley yesterdayi said  mr tulliver leaned forward resting his elbows on the armchair and looking on the ground as if in search of something striving after vanishing images like a man struggling against a doze maggie looked at tom in mute distress their fathers mind was so far off the present which would byandby thrust itself on his wandering consciousness tom was almost ready to rush away with that impatience of painful emotion which makes one of the differences between youth and maiden man and woman  father said maggie laying her hand on his dont you remember that mr riley is dead  dead said mr tulliver sharply looking in her face with a strange examining glance  yes he died of apoplexy nearly a year ago i remember hearing you say you had to pay money for him and he left his daughters badly off one of them is underteacher at miss firnisss where ive been to school you know  ah said her father doubtfully still looking in her face but as soon as tom began to speak he turned to look at him with the same inquiring glances as if he were rather surprised at the presence of these two young people whenever his mind was wandering in the far past he fell into this oblivion of their actual faces they were not those of the lad and the little wench who belonged to that past  its a long while since you had the dispute with dix father said tom i remember your talking about it three years ago before i went to school at mr stellings ive been at school there three years dont you remember  mr tulliver threw himself backward again losing the childlike outward glance under a rush of new ideas which diverted him from external impressions  ay ay he said after a minute or two ive paid a deal o moneyi was determined my son should have a good eddication id none myself and ive felt the miss of it and hell want no other fortin thats what i sayif wakem was to get the better of me again  the thought of wakem roused new vibrations and after a moments pause he began to look at the coat he had on and to feel in his sidepocket then he turned to tom and said in his old sharp way where have they put gores letter  it was close at hand in a drawer for he had often asked for it before  you know what there is in the letter father said tom as he gave it to him  to be sure i do said mr tulliver rather angrily what o that if furley cant take to the property somebody else can theres plenty o people in the world besides furley but its hinderingmy not being wellgo and tell em to get the horse in the gig luke i can get down to st oggs well enoughgores expecting me  no dear father maggie burst out entreatingly its a very long while since all that youve been ill a great many weeksmore than two months everything is changed  mr tulliver looked at them all three alternately with a startled gaze the idea that much had happened of which he knew nothing had often transiently arrested him before but it came upon him now with entire novelty  yes father said tom in answer to the gaze you neednt trouble your mind about business until you are quite well everything is settled about that for the presentabout the mill and the land and the debts  whats settled then said his father angrily  dont you take on too much bout it sir said luke youd ha paid iverybody if you couldthats what i said to master tomi said youd ha paid iverybody if you could  good luke felt after the manner of contented hardworking men whose lives have been spent in servitude that sense of natural fitness in rank which made his masters downfall a tragedy to him he was urged in his slow way to say something that would express his share in the family sorrow and these words which he had used over and over again to tom when he wanted to decline the full payment of his fifty pounds out of the childrens money were the most ready to his tongue they were just the words to lay the most painful hold on his masters bewildered mind  paid everybody he said with vehement agitation his face flushing and his eye lighting up whywhathave they made me a bankrupt  oh father dear father said maggie who thought that terrible word really represented the fact bear it well because we love you your children will always love you tom will pay them all he says he will when hes a man  she felt her father beginning to tremble his voice trembled too as he said after a few moments  ay my little wench but i shall never live twice oer  but perhaps you will live to see me pay everybody father said tom speaking with a great effort  ah my lad said mr tulliver shaking his head slowly but whats broke can never be whole again it ud be your doing not mine then looking up at him youre only sixteen its an uphill fight for you but you mustnt throw it at your father the raskills have been too many for him ive given you a good eddicationthatll start you  something in his throat half choked the last words the flush which had alarmed his children because it had so often preceded a recurrence of paralysis had subsided and his face looked pale and tremulous tom said nothing he was still struggling against his inclination to rush away his father remained quiet a minute or two but his mind did not seem to be wandering again  have they sold me up then he said more clamly as if he were possessed simply by the desire to know what had happened  everything is sold father but we dont know all about the mill and the land yet said tom anxious to ward off any question leading to the fact that wakem was the purchaser  you must not be surprised to see the room look very bare downstairs father said maggie but theres your chair and the bureau theyre not gone  let us go help me down lukeill go and see everything said mr tulliver leaning on his stick and stretching out his other hand toward luke  ay sir said luke as he gave his arm to his master youll make up your mind tot a bit better when youve seen iverything youll get used tot thats what my mother says about her shortness o breathshe says shes made friends wit now though she fought again it sore when it just come on  maggie ran on before to see that all was right in the dreary parlor where the fire dulled by the frosty sunshine seemed part of the general shabbiness she turned her fathers chair and pushed aside the table to make an easy way for him and then stood with a beating heart to see him enter and look round for the first time tom advanced before him carrying the legrest and stood beside maggie on the hearth of those two young hearts toms suffered the most unmixed pain for maggie with all her keen susceptibility yet felt as if the sorrow made larger room for her love to flow in and gave breathingspace to her passionate nature no true boy feels that he would rather go and slay the nemean lion or perform any round of heroic labors than endure perpetual appeals to his pity for evils over which he can make no conquest  mr tulliver paused just inside the door resting on luke and looking round him at all the bare places which for him were filled with the shadows of departed objectsthe daily companions of his life his faculties seemed to be renewing their strength from getting a footing on this demonstration of the senses  ah he said slowly moving toward his chair theyve sold me uptheyve sold me up  then seating himself and laying down his stick while luke left the room he looked round again  theyve left the big bible he said its got everything inwhen i was born and married bring it me tom  the quarto bible was laid open before him at the flyleaf and while he was reading with slowly travelling eyes mrs tulliver entered the room but stood in mute surprise to find her husband down already and with the great bible before him  ah he said looking at a spot where his finger rested my mother was margaret beaton she died when she was fortysevenhers wasnt a longlived family were our mothers children gritty and me arewe shall go to our last bed before long  he seemed to be pausing over the record of his sisters birth and marriage as if it were suggesting new thoughts to him then he suddenly looked up at tom and said in a sharp tone of alarm  they havent come upo moss for the money as i lent him have they  no father said tom the note was burnt  mr tulliver turned his eyes on the page again and presently said  ahelizabeth dodsonits eighteen year since i married her  come next ladyday said mrs tulliver going up to his side and looking at the page  her husband fixed his eyes earnestly on her face  poor bessy he said you was a pretty lass theneverybody said soand i used to think you kept your good looks rarely but youre sorely aged dont you bear me illwilli meant to do well by youwe promised one another for better or for worse  but i never thought it ud be so for worse as this said poor mrs tulliver with the strange scared look that had come over her of late and my poor father gave me awayand to come on so all at once  oh mother said maggie dont talk in that way  no i know you wont let your poor mother speakthats been the way all my lifeyour father never minded what i saidit ud have been o no use for me to beg and prayand it ud be no use now not if i was to go down o my hands and knees  dont say so bessy said mr tulliver whose pride in these first moments of humiliation was in abeyance to the sense of some justice in his wifes reproach it theres anything left as i could do to make you amends i wouldnt say you nay  then we might stay here and get a living and i might keep among my own sistersand me been such a good wife to you and never crossed you from weeks end to weeks endand they all say sothey say it ud be nothing but right only youre so turned against wakem  mother said tom severely this is not the time to talk about that  let her be said mr tulliver say what you mean bessy  why now the mill and the lands all wakems and hes got everything in his hands whats the use o setting your face against him when he says you may stay here and speaks as fair as can be and says you may manage the business and have thirty shillings aweek and a horse to ride about to market and where have we got to put our heads we must go into one o the cottages in the villageand me and my children brought down to thatand all because you must set your mind against folks till theres no turning you  mr tulliver had sunk back in his chair trembling  you may do as you like wi me bessy he said in a low voice ive been the bringing of you to povertythis worlds too many for meim nought but a bankrupt its no use standing up for anything now  father said tom i dont agree with my mother or my uncles and i dont think you ought to submit to be under wakem i get a pound aweek now and you can find something else to do when you get well  say no more tom say no more ive had enough for this day give me a kiss bessy and let us bear one another no illwill we shall never be young againthis worlds been too many for me    chapter ix  an item added to the family register   that first moment of renunciation and submission was followed by days of violent struggle in the millers mind as the gradual access of bodily strength brought with it increasing ability to embrace in one view all the conflicting conditions under which he found himself feeble limbs easily resign themselves to be tethered and when we are subdued by sickness it seems possible to us to fulfil pledges which the old vigor comes back and breaks there were times when poor tulliver thought the fulfilment of his promise to bessy was something quite too hard for human nature he had promised her without knowing what she was going to sayshe might as well have asked him to carry a ton weight on his back but again there were many feelings arguing on her side besides the sense that life had been made hard to her by having married him he saw a possibility by much pinching of saving money out of his salary toward paying a second dividend to his creditors and it would not be easy elsewhere to get a situation such as he could fill  he had led an easy life ordering much and working little and had no aptitude for any new business he must perhaps take to daylabor and his wife must have help from her sistersa prospect doubly bitter to him now they had let all bessys precious things be sold probably because they liked to set her against him by making her feel that he had brought her to that pass he listened to their admonitory talk when they came to urge on him what he was bound to do for poor bessys sake with averted eyes that every now and then flashed on them furtively when their backs were turned nothing but the dread of needing their help could have made it an easier alternative to take their advice  but the strongest influence of all was the love of the old premises where he had run about when he was a boy just as tom had done after him the tullivers had lived on this spot for generations and he had sat listening on a low stool on winter evenings while his father talked of the old halftimbered mill that had been there before the last great floods which damaged it so that his grandfather pulled it down and built the new one it was when he got able to walk about and look at all the old objects that he felt the strain of his clinging affection for the old home as part of his life part of himself he couldnt bear to think of himself living on any other spot than this where he knew the sound of every gate door and felt that the shape and color of every roof and weatherstain and broken hillock was good because his growing senses had been fed on them our instructed vagrancy which was hardly time to linger by the hedgerows but runs away early to the tropics and is at home with palms and banyanswhich is nourished on books of travel and stretches the theatre of its imagination to the zambesican hardly get a dim notion of what an oldfashioned man like tulliver felt for this spot where all his memories centred and where life seemed like a familiar smoothhandled tool that the fingers clutch with loving ease and just now he was living in that freshened memory of the faroff time which comes to us in the passive hours of recovery from sickness  ay luke he said one afternoon as he stood looking over the orchard gate i remember the day they planted those appletrees my father was a huge man for plantingit was like a merrymaking to him to get a cart full o young trees and i used to stand i the cold with him and follow him about like a dog  then he turned round and leaning against the gatepost looked at the opposite buildings  the old mill ud miss me i think luke theres a story as when the mill changes hands the rivers angry ive heard my father say it many a time theres no telling whether there maynt be summat in the story for this is a puzzling world and old harrys got a finger in itits been too many for me i know  ay sir said luke with soothing sympathy what wi the rust on the wheat an the firin o the ricks an that as ive seen i my timethings often looks comical theres the bacon fat wi our last pig run away like butterit leaves nought but a scratchin  its just as if it was yesterday now mr tulliver went on when my father began the malting i remember the day they finished the malthouse i thought summat great was to come of it for wed a plumpudding that day and a bit of a feast and i said to my mothershe was a fine darkeyed woman my mother wasthe little wench ull be as like her as two peas here mr tulliver put his stick between his legs and took out his snuffbox for the greater enjoyment of this anecdote which dropped from him in fragments as if he every other moment lost narration in vision i was a little chap no higher much than my mothers kneeshe was sore fond of us children gritty and meand so i said to her mother i said shall we have plumpudding every day because o the malthouse she used to tell me o that till her dying day she was but a young woman when she died my mother was but its forty good year since they finished the malthouse and it isnt many days out of em all as i havent looked out into the yard there the first thing in the morningall weathers from years end to years end i should go off my head in a new place i should be like as if id lost my way its all hard whichever way i look at itthe harness ull gall me but it ud be summat to draw along the old road instead of a new un  ay sir said luke youd be a deal better here nor in some new place i cant abide new places mysen things is allays awkardnarrowwheeled waggins belike and the stiles all another sort an oatcake i some places towrt th head o the floss there its poor work changing your countryside  but i doubt luke theyll be for getting rid o ben and making you do with a lad and i must help a bit wi the mill youll have a worse place  neer mind sir said luke i shant plague mysen in been wi you twenty year an you cant get twenty year wi whistlin for em no more nor you can make the trees grow you mun wait till god amighty sends em i cant abide new victual nor new faces i cantyou niver know but what theyll gripe you  the walk was finished in silence after this for luke had disburthened himself of thoughts to an extent that left his conversational resources quite barren and mr tulliver had relapsed from his recollections into a painful meditation on the choice of hardships before him maggie noticed that he was unusually absent that evening at tea and afterward he sat leaning forward in his chair looking at the ground moving his lips and shaking his head from time to time then he looked hard at mrs tulliver who was knitting opposite him then at maggie who as she bent over her sewing was intensely conscious of some drama going forward in her fathers mind suddenly he took up the poker and broke the large coal fiercely  dear heart mr tulliver what can you be thinking of said his wife looking up in alarm its very wasteful breaking the coal and weve got hardly any large coal left and i dont know where the rest is to come from  i dont think youre quite so well tonight are you father said maggie you seem uneasy  why how is it tom doesnt come said mr tulliver impatiently  dear heart is it time i must go and get his supper said mrs tulliver laying down her knitting and leaving the room  its nigh upon halfpast eight said mr tulliver hell be here soon go go and get the big bible and open it at the beginning where everythings set down and get the pen and ink  maggie obeyed wondering but her father gave no further orders and only sat listening for toms footfall on the gravel apparently irritated by the wind which had risen and was roaring so as to drown all other sounds there was a strange light in his eyes that rather frightened maggie she began to wish that tom would come too  there he is then said mr tulliver in an excited way when the knock came at last maggie went to open the door but her mother came out of the kitchen hurriedly saying stop a bit maggie ill open it  mrs tulliver had begun to be a little frightened at her boy but she was jealous of every office others did for him  your suppers ready by the kitchenfire my boy she said as he took off his hat and coat you shall have it by yourself just as you like and i wont speak to you  i think my father wants tom mother said maggie he must come into the parlor first  tom entered with his usual saddened evening face but his eyes fell immediately on the open bible and the inkstand and he glanced with a look of anxious surprise at his father who was saying  come come youre late i want you  is there anything the matter father said tom  you sit down all of you said mr tulliver peremptorily  and tom sit down here ive got something for you to write i the bible  they all three sat down looking at him he began to speak slowly looking first at his wife  ive made up my mind bessy and ill be as good as my word to you therell be the same grave made for us to lie down in and we mustnt be bearing one another illwill ill stop in the old place and ill serve under wakem and ill serve him like an honest man theres no tulliver but whats honest mind that tomhere his voice rosetheyll have it to throw up against me as i paid a dividend but it wasnt my fault it was because theres raskills in the world theyve been too many for me and i must give in ill put my neck in harnessfor youve a right to say as ive brought you into trouble bessyand ill serve him as honest as if he was no raskill im an honest man though i shall never hold my head up no more im a tree as is brokea tree as is broke  he paused and looked on the ground then suddenly raising his head he said in a louder yet deeper tone  but i wont forgive him i know what they say he never meant me any harm thats the way old harry props up the rascals hes been at the bottom of everything but hes a fine gentlemani know i know i shouldnt ha gone to law they say but who made it so as there was no arbitratin and no justice to be got it signifies nothing to him i know that hes one o them fine gentlemen as get money by doing business for poorer folks and when hes made beggars of em hell give em charity i wont forgive him i wish he might be punished with shame till his own son ud like to forget him i wish he may do summat as theyd make him work at the treadmill but he wonthes too big a raskill to let the law lay hold on him and you mind this tomyou never forgive him neither if you mean to be my son therell maybe come a time when you may make him feel itll never come to me in got my head under the yoke now writewrite it i the bible  oh father what said maggie sinking down by his knee pale and trembling its wicked to curse and bear malice  it isnt wicked i tell you said her father fiercely its wicked as the raskills should prosper its the devils doing do as i tell you tom write  what am i to write said tom with gloomy submission  write as your father edward tulliver took service under john wakem the man as had helped to ruin him because id promised my wife to make her what amends i could for her trouble and because i wanted to die in th old place where i was born and my father was born put that i the right wordsyou know howand then write as i dont forgive wakem for all that and for all ill serve him honest i wish evil may befall him write that  there was a dead silence as toms pen moved along the paper mrs tulliver looked scared and maggie trembled like a leaf  now let me hear what youve wrote said mr tulliver tom read aloud slowly  now writewrite as youll remember what wakems done to your father and youll make him and his feel it if ever the day comes and sign your name thomas tulliver  oh no father dear father said maggie almost choked with fear you shouldnt make tom write that  be quiet maggie said tom i shall write it     book iv  the valley of humiliation    chapter i  a variation of protestantism unknown to bossuet   journeying down the rhone on a summers day you have perhaps felt the sunshine made dreary by those ruined villages which stud the banks in certain parts of its course telling how the swift river once rose like an angry destroying god sweeping down the feeble generations whose breath is in their nostrils and making their dwellings a desolation strange contrast you may have thought between the effect produced on us by these dismal remnants of commonplace houses which in their best days were but the sign of a sordid life belonging in all its details to our own vulgar era and the effect produced by those ruins on the castled rhine which have crumbled and mellowed into such harmony with the green and rocky steeps that they seem to have a natural fitness like the mountainpine nay even in the day when they were built they must have had this fitness as if they had been raised by an earthborn race who had inherited from their mighty parent a sublime instinct of form and that was a day of romance if those robberbarons were somewhat grim and drunken ogres they had a certain grandeur of the wild beast in themthey were forest boars with tusks tearing and rending not the ordinary domestic grunter they represented the demon forces forever in collision with beauty virtue and the gentle uses of life they made a fine contrast in the picture with the wandering minstrel the softlipped princess the pious recluse and the timid israelite that was a time of color when the sunlight fell on glancing steel and floating banners a time of adventure and fierce strugglenay of living religious art and religious enthusiasm for were not cathedrals built in those days and did not great emperors leave their western palaces to die before the infidel strongholds in the sacred east therefore it is that these rhine castles thrill me with a sense of poetry they belong to the grand historic life of humanity and raise up for me the vision of an echo but these deadtinted holloweyed angular skeletons of villages on the rhone oppress me with the feeling that human lifevery much of itis a narrow ugly grovelling existence which even calamity does not elevate but rather tends to exhibit in all its bare vulgarity of conception and i have a cruel conviction that the lives these ruins are the traces of were part of a gross sum of obscure vitality that will be swept into the same oblivion with the generations of ants and beavers  perhaps something akin to this oppressive feeling may have weighed upon you in watching this oldfashioned family life on the banks of the floss which even sorrow hardly suffices to lift above the level of the tragicomic it is a sordid life you say this of the tullivers and dodsons irradiated by no sublime principles no romantic visions no active selfrenouncing faith moved by none of those wild uncontrollable passions which create the dark shadows of misery and crime without that primitive rough simplicity of wants that hard submissive illpaid toil that childlike spellingout of what nature has written which gives its poetry to peasant life here one has conventional worldly notions and habits without instruction and without polish surely the most prosaic form of human life proud respectability in a gig of unfashionable build worldliness without sidedishes observing these people narrowly even when the iron hand of misfortune has shaken them from their unquestioning hold on the world one sees little trace of religion still less of a distinctively christian creed their belief in the unseen so far as it manifests itself at all seems to be rather a pagan kind their moral notions though held with strong tenacity seem to have no standard beyond hereditary custom you could not live among such people you are stifled for want of an outlet toward something beautiful great or noble you are irritated with these dull men and women as a kind of population out of keeping with the earth on which they livewith this rich plain where the great river flows forever onward and links the small pulse of the old english town with the beatings of the worlds mighty heart a vigorous superstition that lashes its gods or lashes its own back seems to be more congruous with the mystery of the human lot than the mental condition of these emmetlike dodsons and tullivers  i share with you this sense of oppressive narrowness but it is necessary that we should feel it if we care to understand how it acted on the lives of tom and maggiehow it has acted on young natures in many generations that in the onward tendency of human things have risen above the mental level of the generation before them to which they have been nevertheless tied by the strongest fibres of their hearts the suffering whether of martyr or victim which belongs to every historical advance of mankind is represented in this way in every town and by hundreds of obscure hearths and we need not shrink from this comparison of small things with great for does not science tell us that its highest striving is after the ascertainment of a unity which shall bind the smallest things with the greatest in natural science i have understood there is nothing petty to the mind that has a large vision of relations and to which every single object suggests a vast sum of conditions it is surely the same with the observation of human life  certainly the religious and moral ideas of the dodsons and tullivers were of too specific a kind to be arrived at deductively from the statement that they were part of the protestant population of great britain their theory of life had its core of soundness as all theories must have on which decent and prosperous families have been reared and have flourished but it had the very slightest tincture of theology if in the maiden days of the dodson sisters their bibles opened more easily at some parts than others it was because of dried tulippetals which had been distributed quite impartially without preference for the historical devotional or doctrinal their religion was of a simple semipagan kind but there was no heresy in itif heresy properly means choicefor they didnt know there was any other religion except that of chapelgoers which appeared to run in families like asthma how should they know the vicar of their pleasant rural parish was not a controversialist but a good hand at whist and one who had a joke always ready for a blooming female parishioner the religion of the dodsons consisted in revering whatever was customary and respectable it was necessary to be baptized else one could not be buried in the churchyard and to take the sacrament before death as a security against more dimly understood perils but it was of equal necessity to have the proper pallbearers and wellcured hams at ones funeral and to leave an unimpeachable will a dodson would not be taxed with the omission of anything that was becoming or that belonged to that eternal fitness of things which was plainly indicated in the practice of the most substantial parishioners and in the family traditionssuch as obedience to parents faithfulness to kindred industry rigid honesty thrift the thorough scouring of wooden and copper utensils the hoarding of coins likely to disappear from the currency the production of firstrate commodities for the market and the general preference of whatever was homemade the dodsons were a very proud race and their pride lay in the utter frustration of all desire to tax them with a breach of traditional duty or propriety a wholesome pride in many respects since it identified honor with perfect integrity thoroughness of work and faithfulness to admitted rules and society owes some worthy qualities in many of her members to mothers of the dodson class who made their butter and their fromenty well and would have felt disgraced to make it otherwise to be honest and poor was never a dodson motto still less to seem rich though being poor rather the family badge was to be honest and rich and not only rich but richer than was supposed to live respected and have the proper bearers at your funeral was an achievement of the ends of existence that would be entirely nullified if on the reading of your will you sank in the opinion of your fellowmen either by turning out to be poorer than they expected or by leaving your money in a capricious manner without strict regard to degrees of kin the right thing must always be done toward kindred the right thing was to correct them severely if they were other than a credit to the family but still not to alienate from them the smallest rightful share in the family shoebuckles and other property a conspicuous quality in the dodson character was its genuineness its vices and virtues alike were phases of a proud honest egoism which had a hearty dislike to whatever made against its own credit and interest and would be frankly hard of speech to inconvenient kin but would never forsake or ignore themwould not let them want bread but only require them to eat it with bitter herbs  the same sort of traditional belief ran in the tulliver veins but it was carried in richer blood having elements of generous imprudence warm affection and hottempered rashness mr tullivers grandfather had been heard to say that he was descended from one ralph tulliver a wonderfully clever fellow who had ruined himself it is likely enough that the clever ralph was a high liver rode spirited horses and was very decidedly of his own opinion on the other hand nobody had ever heard of a dodson who had ruined himself it was not the way of that family  if such were the views of life on which the dodsons and tullivers had been reared in the praiseworthy past of pitt and high prices you will infer from what you already know concerning the state of society in st oggs that there had been no highly modifying influence to act on them in their maturer life it was still possible even in that later time of anticatholic preaching for people to hold many pagan ideas and believe themselves good churchpeople notwithstanding so we need hardly feel any surprise at the fact that mr tulliver though a regular churchgoer recorded his vindictiveness on the flyleaf of his bible it was not that any harm could be said concerning the vicar of that charming rural parish to which dorlcote mill belonged he was a man of excellent family an irreproachable bachelor of elegant pursuitshad taken honors and held a fellowship mr tulliver regarded him with dutiful respect as he did everything else belonging to the churchservice but he considered that church was one thing and commonsense another and he wanted nobody to tell him what commonsense was certain seeds which are required to find a nidus for themselves under unfavorable circumstances have been supplied by nature with an apparatus of hooks so that they will get a hold on very unreceptive surfaces the spiritual seed which had been scattered over mr tulliver had apparently been destitute of any corresponding provision and had slipped off to the winds again from a total absence of hooks    chapter ii  the torn nest is pierced by the thorns   there is something sustaining in the very agitation that accompanies the first shocks of trouble just as an acute pain is often a stimulus and produces an excitement which is transient strength it is in the slow changed life that follows in the time when sorrow has become stale and has no longer an emotive intensity that counteracts its pain in the time when day follows day in dull unexpectant sameness and trial is a dreary routineit is then that despair threatens it is then that the peremptory hunger of the soul is felt and eye and ear are strained after some unlearned secret of our existence which shall give to endurance the nature of satisfaction  this time of utmost need was come to maggie with her short span of thirteen years to the usual precocity of the girl she added that early experience of struggle of conflict between the inward impulse and outward fact which is the lot of every imaginative and passionate nature and the years since she hammered the nails into her wooden fetish among the wormeaten shelves of the attic had been filled with so eager a life in the triple world of reality books and waking dreams that maggie was strangely old for her years in everything except in her entire want of that prudence and selfcommand which were the qualities that made tom manly in the midst of his intellectual boyishness and now her lot was beginning to have a still sad monotony which threw her more than ever on her inward self her father was able to attend to business again his affairs were settled and he was acting as wakems manager on the old spot tom went to and fro every morning and evening and became more and more silent in the short intervals at home what was there to say one day was like another and toms interest in life driven back and crushed on every other side was concentrating itself into the one channel of ambitious resistance to misfortune the peculiarities of his father and mother were very irksome to him now they were laid bare of all the softening accompaniments of an easy prosperous home for tom had very clear prosaic eyes not apt to be dimmed by mists of feeling or imagination poor mrs tulliver it seemed would never recover her old self her placid household activity how could she the objects among which her mind had moved complacently were all goneall the little hopes and schemes and speculations all the pleasant little cares about her treasures which had made the world quite comprehensible to her for a quarter of a century since she had made her first purchase of the sugartongs had been suddenly snatched away from her and she remained bewildered in this empty life why that should have happened to her which had not happened to other women remained an insoluble question by which she expressed her perpetual ruminating comparison of the past with the present it was piteous to see the comely woman getting thinner and more worn under a bodily as well as mental restlessness which made her often wander about the empty house after her work was done until maggie becoming alarmed about her would seek her and bring her down by telling her how it vexed tom that she was injuring her health by never sitting down and resting herself yet amidst this helpless imbecility there was a touching trait of humble selfdevoting maternity which made maggie feel tenderly toward her poor mother amidst all the little wearing griefs caused by her mental feebleness she would let maggie do none of the work that was heaviest and most soiling to the hands and was quite peevish when maggie attempted to relieve her from her gratebrushing and scouring let it alone my dear your hands ull get as hard as hard she would say its your mothers place to do that i cant do the sewingmy eyes fail me and she would still brush and carefully tend maggies hair which she had become reconciled to in spite of its refusal to curl now it was so long and massy maggie was not her pet child and in general would have been much better if she had been quite different yet the womanly heart so bruised in its small personal desires found a future to rest on in the life of this young thing and the mother pleased herself with wearing out her own hands to save the hands that had so much more life in them  but the constant presence of her mothers regretful bewilderment was less painful to maggie than that of her fathers sullen incommunicative depression as long as the paralysis was upon him and it seemed as if he might always be in a childlike condition of dependenceas long as he was still only half awakened to his troublemaggie had felt the strong tide of pitying love almost as an inspiration a new power that would make the most difficult life easy for his sake but now instead of childlike dependence there had come a taciturn hard concentration of purpose in strange contrast with his old vehement communicativeness and high spirit and this lasted from day to day and from week to week the dull eye never brightening with any eagerness or any joy it is something cruelly incomprehensible to youthful natures this sombre sameness in middleaged and elderly people whose life has resulted in disappointment and discontent to whose faces a smile becomes so strange that the sad lines all about the lips and brow seem to take no notice of it and it hurries away again for want of a welcome why will they not kindle up and be glad sometimes thinks young elasticity it would be so easy if they only liked to do it and these leaden clouds that never part are apt to create impatience even in the filial affection that streams forth in nothing but tenderness and pity in the time of more obvious affliction  mr tulliver lingered nowhere away from home he hurried away from market he refused all invitations to stay and chat as in old times in the houses where he called on business he could not be reconciled with his lot there was no attitude in which his pride did not feel its bruises and in all behavior toward him whether kind or cold he detected an allusion to the change in his circumstances even the days on which wakem came to ride round the land and inquire into the business were not so black to him as those marketdays on which he had met several creditors who had accepted a composition from him to save something toward the repayment of those creditors was the object toward which he was now bending all his thoughts and efforts and under the influence of this allcompelling demand of his nature the somewhat profuse man who hated to be stinted or to stint any one else in his own house was gradually metamorphosed into the keeneyed grudger of morsels mrs tulliver could not economize enough to satisfy him in their food and firing and he would eat nothing himself but what was of the coarsest quality tom though depressed and strongly repelled by his fathers sullenness and the dreariness of home entered thoroughly into his fathers feelings about paying the creditors and the poor lad brought his first quarters money with a delicious sense of achievement and gave it to his father to put into the tin box which held the savings the little store of sovereigns in the tin box seemed to be the only sight that brought a faint beam of pleasure into the millers eyesfaint and transient for it was soon dispelled by the thought that the time would be longperhaps longer than his lifebefore the narrow savings could remove the hateful incubus of debt a deficit of more than five hundred pounds with the accumulating interest seemed a deep pit to fill with the savings from thirty shillings aweek even when toms probable savings were to be added on this one point there was entire community of feeling in the four widely differing beings who sat round the dying fire of sticks which made a cheap warmth for them on the verge of bedtime mrs tulliver carried the proud integrity of the dodsons in her blood and had been brought up to think that to wrong people of their money which was another phrase for debt was a sort of moral pillory it would have been wickedness to her mind to have run counter to her husbands desire to do the right thing and retrieve his name she had a confused dreamy notion that if the creditors were all paid her plate and linen ought to come back to her but she had an inbred perception that while people owed money they were unable to pay they couldnt rightly call anything their own she murmured a little that mr tulliver so peremptorily refused to receive anything in repayment from mr and mrs moss but to all his requirements of household economy she was submissive to the point of denying herself the cheapest indulgences of mere flavor her only rebellion was to smuggle into the kitchen something that would make rather a better supper than usual for tom  these narrow notions about debt held by the old fashioned tullivers may perhaps excite a smile on the faces of many readers in these days of wide commercial views and wide philosophy according to which everything rights itself without any trouble of ours the fact that my tradesman is out of pocket by me is to be looked at through the serene certainty that somebody elses tradesman is in pocket by somebody else and since there must be bad debts in the world why it is mere egoism not to like that we in particular should make them instead of our fellowcitizens i am telling the history of very simple people who had never had any illuminating doubts as to personal integrity and honor  under all this grim melancholy and narrowing concentration of desire mr tulliver retained the feeling toward his little wench which made her presence a need to him though it would not suffice to cheer him she was still the desire of his eyes but the sweet spring of fatherly love was now mingled with bitterness like everything else when maggie laid down her work at night it was her habit to get a low stool and sit by her fathers knee leaning her cheek against it how she wished he would stroke her head or give some sign that he was soothed by the sense that he had a daughter who loved him but now she got no answer to her little caresses either from her father or from tomthe two idols of her life tom was weary and abstracted in the short intervals when he was at home and her father was bitterly preoccupied with the thought that the girl was growing up was shooting up into a woman and how was she to do well in life she had a poor chance for marrying down in the world as they were and he hated the thought of her marrying poorly as her aunt gritty had done that would be a thing to make him turn in his gravethe little wench so pulled down by children and toil as her aunt moss was when uncultured minds confined to a narrow range of personal experience are under the pressure of continued misfortune their inward life is apt to become a perpetually repeated round of sad and bitter thoughts the same words the same scenes are revolved over and over again the same mood accompanies them the end of the year finds them as much what they were at the beginning as if they were machines set to a recurrent series of movements  the sameness of the days was broken by few visitors uncles and aunts paid only short visits now of course they could not stay to meals and the constraint caused by mr tullivers savage silence which seemed to add to the hollow resonance of the bare uncarpeted room when the aunts were talking heightened the unpleasantness of these family visits on all sides and tended to make them rare as for other acquaintances there is a chill air surrounding those who are down in the world and people are glad to get away from them as from a cold room human beings mere men and women without furniture without anything to offer you who have ceased to count as anybody present an embarrassing negation of reasons for wishing to see them or of subjects on which to converse with them at that distant day there was a dreary isolation in the civilized christian society of these realms for families that had dropped below their original level unless they belonged to a sectarian church which gets some warmth of brotherhood by walling in the sacred fire    chapter iii  a voice from the past   one afternoon when the chestnuts were coming into flower maggie had brought her chair outside the front door and was seated there with a book on her knees her dark eyes had wandered from the book but they did not seem to be enjoying the sunshine which pierced the screen of jasmine on the projecting porch at her right and threw leafy shadows on her pale round cheek they seemed rather to be searching for something that was not disclosed by the sunshine it had been a more miserable day than usual her father after a visit of wakems had had a paroxysm of rage in which for some trifling fault he had beaten the boy who served in the mill once before since his illness he had had a similar paroxysm in which he had beaten his horse and the scene had left a lasting terror in maggies mind the thought had risen that some time or other he might beat her mother if she happened to speak in her feeble way at the wrong moment the keenest of all dread with her was lest her father should add to his present misfortune the wretchedness of doing something irretrievably disgraceful the battered schoolbook of toms which she held on her knees could give her no fortitude under the pressure of that dread and again and again her eyes had filled with tears as they wandered vaguely seeing neither the chestnuttrees nor the distant horizon but only future scenes of homesorrow  suddenly she was roused by the sound of the opening gate and of footsteps on the gravel it was not tom who was entering but a man in a sealskin cap and a blue plush waistcoat carrying a pack on his back and followed closely by a bullterrier of brindled coat and defiant aspect  oh bob its you said maggie starting up with a smile of pleased recognition for there had been no abundance of kind acts to efface the recollection of bobs generosity im so glad to see you  thank you miss said bob lifting his cap and showing a delighted face but immediately relieving himself of some accompanying embarrassment by looking down at his dog and saying in a tone of disgust get out wi you you thunderin sawney  my brother is not at home yet bob said maggie he is always at st oggs in the daytime  well miss said bob i should be glad to see mr tom but that isnt just what im come forlook here  bob was in the act of depositing his pack on the doorstep and with it a row of small books fastened together with string  apparently however they were not the object to which he wished to call maggies attention but rather something which he had carried under his arm wrapped in a red handkerchief  see here he said again laying the red parcel on the others and unfolding it you wont think im amakin too free miss i hope but i lighted on these books and i thought they might make up to you a bit for them as youve lost for i heared you speak o pictursan as for picturs look here  the opening of the red handkerchief had disclosed a superannuated keepsake and six or seven numbers of a portrait gallery in royal octavo and the emphatic request to look referred to a portrait of george the fourth in all the majesty of his depressed cranium and voluminous neckcloth  theres all sorts o genelmen here bob went on turning over the leaves with some excitement wi all sorts o nonesan some bald an some wi wigsparlament genelmen i reckon an here he added opening the keepsakeheres

ever did such a kind thing for me before i havent many friends who care for me  hev a dog misstheyre better friends nor any christian said bob laying down his pack again which he had taken up with the intention of hurrying away for he felt considerable shyness in talking to a young lass like maggie though as he usually said of himself his tongue overrun him when he began to speak i cant give you mumps cause hed break his heart to go away from meeh mumps what do you say you riffraff mumps declined to express himself more diffusely than by a single affirmative movement of his tail but id get you a pup miss an welcome  no thank you bob we have a yard dog and i maynt keep a dog of my own  eh thats a pity else theres a pupif you didnt mind about it not being thoroughbred its mother acts in

not but i like a bit o breed myself but i cant abide to see one cur grinnin at another i wish you good evenin miss said bob abruptly taking up his pack again under the consciousness that his tongue was acting in an undisciplined manner  wont you come in the evening some time and see my brother bob said maggie  yes miss thank youanother time youll give my duty to him if you please eh hes a fine growed chap mr tom is he took to growin i the legs an i didnt  the pack was down again now the hook of the stick having somehow gone wrong  you dont call mumps a cur i suppose said maggie divining that any interest she showed in mumps would be gratifying to his master  no miss a fine way off that said bob with pitying smile mumps is as fine a cross as youll see anywhere along the floss an in been up it wi the barge times enow why the gentry stops to look at him but you wont catch mumps alooking at the gentry muchhe minds his own business he does  the expression of mumps face which seemed to be tolerating the superfluous existence of objects in general was strongly confirmatory of this high praise  he looks dreadfully surly said maggie would he let me pat him  ay that would he and thank you he knows his company mumps does he isnt a dog as ull be caught wi gingerbread hed smell a thief a good deal stronger nor the gingerbread he would lors i talk to him by th hour together when im walking i lone places and if in done a bit o mischief i allays tell him in got no secrets but what mumps knows em he knows about my big thumb he does  your big thumbwhats that bob said maggie  thats what it is miss said bob quickly exhibiting a singularly broad specimen of that difference between the man and the monkey it tells i measuring out the flannel you see i carry flannel cause its light for my pack an its dear stuff you see so a big thumb tells i clap my thumb at the end o the yard and cut o the hither side of it and the old women arent up tot  but bob said maggie looking

miss but it ud be a pity it would i couldnt find another trick so goodan what ud be the use o havin a big thumb it might as well ha been narrow  maggie thus exalted into bobs exalting madonna laughed in spite of herself at which her worshippers blue eyes twinkled too and under these favoring auspices he touched his cap and walked away  the days of chivalry are not gone notwithstanding burkes grand dirge over them they live still in that faroff worship paid by many a youth and man to the woman of whom he never dreams that he shall touch so much as her little finger or the hem of her robe bob with the pack on his back had as respectful an adoration for this darkeyed maiden as if he had been a knight in armor calling aloud on her name as he pricked on to the fight  that gleam of merriment soon died away from maggies face and perhaps only made the returning gloom deeper by contrast she was too dispirited even to like answering questions about bobs present of books and she carried them away to her bedroom laying them down there and seating herself on her one stool without caring to look at them just yet she leaned her cheek against the windowframe and thought that the lighthearted bob had a lot much happier than hers  maggies sense of loneliness and utter privation of joy had deepened with the brightness of advancing spring all the favorite outdoor nooks about home which seemed to have done their part with her parents in nurturing and cherishing her were now mixed up with the homesadness and gathered no smile from the sunshine every affection every delight the poor child had had was like an aching nerve to her there was no music for her any moreno piano no harmonized voices no delicious stringed instruments with their passionate cries of imprisoned spirits sending a strange vibration through her frame and of all her schoollife there was nothing left her now but her little collection of schoolbooks which she turned over with a sickening sense that she knew them all and they were all barren of comfort even at school she had often wished for books with more in them everything she learned there seemed like the ends of long threads that snapped immediately and nowwithout the indirect charm of schoolemulationtélémaque was mere bran so were the hard dry questions on christian doctrine there was no flavor in them no strength sometimes maggie thought she could have been contented with absorbing fancies if she could have had all scotts novels and all byrons poemsthen perhaps she might have found happiness enough to dull her sensibility to her actual daily life and yet they were hardly what she wanted she could make dreamworlds of her own but no dreamworld would satisfy her now she wanted some explanation of this hard real lifethe unhappylooking father seated at the dull breakfasttable the childish bewildered mother the little sordid tasks that filled the hours or the more oppressive emptiness of weary joyless leisure the need of some tender demonstrative love the cruel sense that tom didnt mind what she thought or felt and that they were no longer playfellows together the privation of all pleasant things that had come to her more than to othersshe wanted some key that would enable her to understand and in understanding to endure the heavy weight that had fallen on her young heart if she had been taught real learning and wisdom such as great men knew she thought she should have held the secrets of life if she had only books that she might learn for herself what wise men knew saints and martyrs had never interested maggie so much as sages and poets she knew little of saints and martyrs and had gathered as a general result of her teaching that they were a temporary provision against the spread of catholicism and had all died at smithfield  in one of these meditations it occurred to her that she had forgotten toms schoolbooks which had been sent home in his trunk but she found the stock unaccountably shrunk down to the few old ones which had been well thumbedthe latin dictionary and grammar a delectus a torn eutropius the wellworn virgil aldrichs logic and the exasperating euclid still latin euclid and logic would surely be a considerable step in masculine wisdomin that knowledge which made men contented and even glad to live not that the yearning for effectual wisdom was quite unmixed a certain mirage would now and then rise on the desert of the future in which she seemed to see herself honored for her surprising attainments and so the poor child with her souls hunger and her illusions of selfflattery began to nibble at this thickrinded fruit of the tree of knowledge filling her vacant hours with latin geometry and the forms of the syllogism and feeling a gleam of triumph now and then that her understanding was quite equal to these peculiarly masculine studies for a week or two she went on resolutely enough though with an occasional sinking of heart as if she had set out toward the promised land alone and found it a thirsty trackless uncertain journey in the severity of her early resolution she would take aldrich out into the fields and then look off her book toward the sky where the lark was twinkling or to the reeds and bushes by the river from which the waterfowl rustled forth on its anxious awkward flightwith a startled sense that the relation between aldrich and this living world was extremely remote for her the discouragement deepened as the days went on and the eager heart gained faster and faster on the patient mind somehow when she sat at the window with her book her eyes would fix themselves blankly on the outdoor sunshine then they would fill with tears and sometimes if her mother was not in the room the studies would all end in sobbing she rebelled against her lot she fainted under its loneliness and fits even of anger and hatred toward her father and mother who were so unlike what she would have them to be toward tom who checked her and met her thought or feeling always by some thwarting differencewould flow out over her affections and conscience like a lava stream and frighten her with a sense that it was not difficult for her to become a demon then her brain would be busy with wild romances of a flight from home in search of something less sordid and dreary she would go to some great manwalter scott perhapsand tell him how wretched and how clever she was and he would surely do something for her but in the middle of her vision her father would perhaps enter the room for the evening and surprised that she sat still without noticing him would say complainingly come am i to fetch my slippers myself the voice pierced through maggie like a sword there was another sadness besides her own and she had been thinking of turning her back on it and forsaking it  this afternoon the sight of bobs cheerful freckled face had given her discontent a new direction she thought it was part of the hardship of her life that there was laid upon her the burthen of larger wants than others seemed to feelthat she had to endure this wide hopeless yearning for that something whatever it was that was greatest and best on this earth she wished she could have been like bob with his easily satisfied ignorance or like tom who had something to do on which he could fix his mind with a steady purpose and disregard everything else poor child as she leaned her head against the windowframe with her hands clasped tighter and tighter and her foot beating the ground she was as lonely in her trouble as if she had been the only gril in the civilized world of that day who had come out of her schoollife with a soul untrained for inevitable struggles with no other part of her inherited share in the hardwon treasures of thought which generations of painful toil have laid up for the race of men than shreds and patches of feeble literature and false history with much futile information about saxon and other kings of doubtful example but unhappily quite without that knowledge of the irreversible laws within and without her which governing the habits becomes morality and developing the feelings of submission and dependence becomes religionas lonely in her trouble as if every other girl besides herself had been cherished and watched over by elder minds not forgetful of their own early time when need was keen and impulse strong  at last maggies eyes glanced down on the books that lay on the windowshelf and she half forsook her reverie to turn over listlessly the leaves of the portrait gallery but she soon pushed this aside to examine the little row of books tied together with string beauties of the spectator rasselas economy of human life gregorys lettersshe knew the sort of matter that was inside all these the christian yearthat seemed to be a hymnbook and she laid it down again but thomas à kempisthe name had come across her in her reading and she felt the satisfaction which every one knows of getting some ideas to attach to a name that strays solitary in the memory she took up the little old clumsy book with some curiosity it had the corners turned down in many places and some hand now forever quiet had made at certain passages strong penandink marks long since browned by time maggie turned from leaf to leaf and read where the quiet hand pointed know that the love of thyself doth hurt thee more than anything in the world if thou seekest this or that and wouldst be here or there to enjoy thy own will and pleasure thou shalt never be quiet nor free from care for in everything somewhat will be wanting and in every place there will be some that will cross thee both above and below which way soever thou dost turn thee everywhere thou shalt find the cross and everywhere of necessity thou must have patience if thou wilt have inward peace and enjoy an everlasting crown if thou desirest to mount unto this height thou must set out courageously and lay the axe to the root that thou mayest pluck up and destroy that hidden inordinate inclination to thyself and unto all private and earthly good on this sin that a man inordinately loveth himself almost all dependeth whatsoever is thoroughly to be overcome which evil being once overcome and subdued there will presently ensue great peace and tranquillity it is but little thou sufferest in comparison of them that have suffered so much were so strongly tempted so grievously afflicted so many ways tried and exercised thou oughtest therefore to call to mind the more heavy sufferings of others that thou mayest the easier bear thy little adversities and if they seem not little unto thee beware lest thy impatience be the cause thereof blessed are those ears that receive the whispers of the divine voice and listen not to the whisperings of the world blessed are those ears which hearken not unto the voice which soundeth outwardly but unto the truth which teacheth inwardly  a strange thrill of awe passed through maggie while she read as if she had been wakened in the night by a strain of solemn music telling of beings whose souls had been astir while hers was in stupor she went on from one brown mark to another where the quiet hand seemed to point hardly conscious that she was reading seeming rather to listen while a low voice said  why dost thou here gaze about since this is not the place of thy rest in heaven ought to be thy dwelling and all earthly things are to be looked on as they forward thy journey thither all things pass away and thou together with them beware thou cleavest not unto them lest thou be entangled and perish if a man should give all his substance yet it is as nothing and if he should do great penances yet are they but little and if he should attain to all knowledge he is yet far off and if he should be of great virtue and very fervent devotion yet is there much wanting to wit one thing which is most necessary for him what is that that having left all he leave himself and go wholly out of himself and retain nothing of selflove i have often said unto thee and now again i say the same forsake thyself resign thyself and thou shalt enjoy much inward peace then shall all vain imaginations evil perturbations and superfluous cares fly away then shall immoderate fear leave thee and inordinate love shall die  maggie drew a long breath and pushed her heavy hair back as if to see a sudden vision more clearly here then was a secret of life that would enable her to renounce all other secrets here was a sublime height to be reached without the help of outward things here was insight and strength and conquest to be won by means entirely within her own soul where a supreme teacher was waiting to be heard it flashed through her like the suddenly apprehended solution of a problem that all the miseries of her young life had come from fixing her heart on her own pleasure as if that were the central necessity of the universe and for the first time she saw the possibility of shifting the position from which she looked at the gratification of her own desiresof taking her stand out of herself and looking at her own life as an insignificant part of a divinely guided whole she read on and on in the old book devouring eagerly the dialogues with the invisible teacher the pattern of sorrow the source of all strength returning to it after she had been called away and reading till the sun went down behind the willows with all the hurry of an imagination that could never rest in the present she sat in the deepening twilight forming plans of selfhumiliation and entire devotedness and in the ardor of first discovery renunciation seemed to her the entrance into that satisfaction which she had so long been craving in vain she had not perceivedhow could she until she had lived longerthe inmost truth of the old monks outpourings that renunciation remains sorrow though a sorrow borne willingly maggie was still panting for happiness and was in ecstasy because she had found the key to it she knew nothing of doctrines and systems of mysticism or quietism but this voice out of the faroff middle ages was the direct communication of a human souls belief and experience and came to maggie as an unquestioned message  i suppose that is the reason why the small oldfashioned book for which you need only pay sixpence at a bookstall works miracles to this day turning bitter waters into sweetness while expensive sermons and treatises newly issued leave all things as they were before it was written down by a hand that waited for the hearts prompting it is the chronicle of a solitary hidden anguish struggle trust and triumph not written on velvet cushions to teach endurance to those who are treading with bleeding feet on the stones and so it remains to all time a lasting record of human needs and human consolations the voice of a brother who ages ago felt and suffered and renouncedin the cloister perhaps with serge gown and tonsured head with much chanting and long fasts and with a fashion of speech different from oursbut under the same silent faroff heavens and with the same passionate desires the same strivings the same failures the same weariness  in writing the history of unfashionable families one is apt to fall into a tone of emphasis which is very far from being the tone of good society where principles and beliefs are not only of an extremely moderate kind but are always presupposed no subjects being eligible but such as can be touched with a light and graceful irony but then good society has its claret and its velvet carpets its dinnerengagements six weeks deep its opera and its faëry ballrooms rides off its ennui on thoroughbred horses lounges at the club has to keep clear of crinoline vortices gets its science done by faraday and its religion by the superior clergy who are to be met in the best houseshow should it have time or need for belief and emphasis but good society floated on gossamer wings of light irony is of very expensive production requiring nothing less than a wide and arduous national life condensed in unfragrant deafening factories cramping itself in mines sweating at furnaces grinding hammering weaving under more or less oppression of carbonic acid or else spread over sheepwalks and scattered in lonely houses and huts on the clayey or chalky cornlands where the rainy days look dreary this wide national life is based entirely on emphasisthe emphasis of want which urges it into all the activities necessary for the maintenance of good society and light irony it spends its heavy years often in a chill uncarpeted fashion amidst family discord unsoftened by long corridors under such circumstances there are many among its myriads of souls who have absolutely needed an emphatic belief life in this unpleasurable shape demanding some solution even to unspeculative mindsjust as you inquire into the stuffing of your couch when anything galls you there whereas eiderdown and perfect french springs excite no question some have an emphatic belief in alcohol and seek their ekstasis or outside standingground in gin but the rest require something that good society calls enthusiasm something that will present motives in an entire absence of high prizes something that will give patience and feed human love when the limbs ache with weariness and human looks are hard upon us something clearly that lies outside personal desires that includes resignation for ourselves and active love for what is not ourselves now and then that sort of enthusiasm finds a farechoing voice that comes from an experience springing out of the deepest need and it was by being brought within the long lingering vibrations of such a voice that maggie with her girls face and unnoted sorrows found an effort and a hope that helped her through years of loneliness making out a faith for herself without the aid of established authorities and appointed guides for they were not at hand and her need was pressing from what you know of her you will not be surprised that she threw some exaggeration and wilfulness some pride and impetuosity even into her selfrenunciation her own life was still a drama for her in which she demanded of herself that her part should be played with intensity and so it came to pass that she often lost the spirit of humility by being excessive in the outward act she often strove after too high a flight and came down with her poor little halffledged wings dabbled in the mud for example she not only determined to work at plain sewing that she might contribute something toward the fund in the tin box but she went in the first instance in her zeal of selfmortification to ask for it at a linen shop in st oggs instead of getting it in a more quiet and indirect way and could see nothing but what was entirely wrong and unkind nay persecuting in toms reproof of her for this unnecessary act i dont like my sister to do such things said tom ill take care that the debts are paid without your lowering yourself in that way surely there was some tenderness and bravery mingled with the worldliness and selfassertion of that little speech but maggie held it as dross overlooking the grains of gold and took toms rebuke as one of her outward crosses tom was very hard to her she used to think in her long nightwatchingsto her who had always loved him so and then she strove to be contented with that hardness and to require nothing that is the path we all like when we set out on our abandonment of egoismthe path of martyrdom and endurance where the palmbranches grow rather than the steep highway of tolerance just allowance and selfblame where there are no leafy honors to be gathered and worn  the old books virgil euclid and aldrichthat wrinkled fruit of the tree of knowledgehad been all laid by for maggie had turned her back on the vain ambition to share the thoughts of the wise in her first ardor she flung away the books with a sort of triumph that she had risen above the need of them and if they had been her own she would have burned them believing that she would never repent she read so eagerly and constantly in her three books the bible thomas à kempis and the christian year no longer rejected as a hymnbook that they filled her mind with a continual stream of rhythmic memories and she was too ardently learning to see all nature and life in the light of her new faith to need any other material for her mind to work on as she sat with her wellplied needle making shirts and other complicated stitchings falsely called plainby no means plain to maggie since wristband and sleeve and the like had a capability of being sewed in wrong side outward in moments of mental wandering  hanging diligently over her sewing maggie was a sight any one might have been pleased to look at that new inward life of hers notwithstanding some volcanic upheavings of imprisoned passions yet shone out in her face with a tender soft light that mingled itself as added loveliness with the gradually enriched color and outline of her blossoming youth her mother felt the change in her with a sort of puzzled wonder that maggie should be growing up so good it was amazing that this once contrairy child was become so submissive so backward to assert her own will maggie used to look up from her work and find her mothers eyes fixed upon her they were watching and waiting for the large young glance as if her elder frame got some needful warmth from it the mother was getting fond of her tall brown girlthe only bit of furniture now on which she could bestow her anxiety and pride and maggie in spite of her own ascetic wish to have no personal adornment was obliged to give way to her mother about her hair and submit to have the abundant black locks plaited into a coronet on the summit of her head after the pitiable fashion of those antiquated times  let your mother have that bit o pleasure my dear said mrs tulliver id trouble enough with your hair once  so maggie glad of anything that would soothe her mother and cheer their long day together consented to the vain decoration and showed a queenly head above her old frocks steadily refusing however to look at herself in the glass mrs tulliver liked to call the fathers attention to maggies hair and other unexpected virtues but he had a brusk reply to give  i knew well enough what shed be before nowits nothing new to me but its a pity she isnt made o commoner stuff shell be thrown away i doubttherell be nobody to marry her as is fit for her  and maggies graces of mind and body fed his gloom he sat patiently enough while she read him a chapter or said something timidly when they were alone together about trouble being turned into a blessing he took it all as part of his daughters goodness which made his misfortunes the sadder to him because they damaged her chance in life in a mind charged with an eager purpose and an unsatisfied vindictiveness there is no room for new feelings mr tulliver did not want spiritual consolationhe wanted to shake off the degradation of debt and to have his revenge     book v  wheat and tares    chapter i  in the red deeps   the family sittingroom was a long room with a window at each end one looking toward the croft and along the ripple to the banks of the floss the other into the millyard maggie was sitting with her work against the latter window when she saw mr wakem entering the yard as usual on his fine black horse but not alone as usual some one was with hima figure in a cloak on a handsome pony maggie had hardly time to feel that it was philip come back before they were in front of the window and he was raising his hat to her while his father catching the movement by a sideglance looked sharply round at them both  maggie hurried away from the window and carried her work upstairs for mr wakem sometimes came in and inspected the books and maggie felt that the meeting with philip would be robbed of all pleasure in the presence of the two fathers some day perhaps she could see him when they could just shake hands and she could tell him that she remembered his goodness to tom and the things he had said to her in the old days though they could never be friends any more it was not at all agitating to maggie to see philip again she retained her childish gratitude and pity toward him and remembered his cleverness and in the early weeks of her loneliness she had continually recalled the image of him among the people who had been kind to her in life often wishing she had him for a brother and a teacher as they had fancied it might have been in their talk together but that sort of wishing had been banished along with other dreams that savored of seeking her own will and she thought besides that philip might be altered by his life abroadhe might have become worldly and really not care about her saying anything to him now and yet his face was wonderfully little alteredit was only a larger more manly copy of the pale smallfeatured boys face with the gray eyes and the boyish waving brown hair there was the old deformity to awaken the old pity and after all her meditations maggie felt that she really should like to say a few words to him he might still be melancholy as he always used to be and like her to look at him kindly she wondered if he remembered how he used to like her eyes with that thought maggie glanced toward the square lookingglass which was condemned to hang with its face toward the wall and she half started from her seat to reach it down but she checked herself and snatched up her work trying to repress the rising wishes by forcing her memory to recall snatches of hymns until she saw philip and his father returning along the road and she could go down again  it was far on in june now and maggie was inclined to lengthen the daily walk which was her one indulgence but this day and the following she was so busy with work which must be finished that she never went beyond the gate and satisfied her need of the open air by sitting out of doors one of her frequent walks when she was not obliged to go to st oggs was to a spot that lay beyond what was called the hillan insignificant rise of ground crowned by trees lying along the side of the road which ran by the gates of dorlcote mill insignificant i call it because in height it was hardly more than a bank but there may come moments when nature makes a mere bank a means toward a fateful result and that is why i ask you to imagine this high bank crowned with trees making an uneven wall for some quarter of a mile along the left side of dorlcote mill and the pleasant fields behind it bounded by the murmuring ripple just where this line of bank sloped down again to the level a byroad turned off and led to the other side of the rise where it was broken into very capricious hollows and mounds by the working of an exhausted stonequarry so long exhausted that both mounds and hollows were now clothed with brambles and trees and here and there by a stretch of grass which a few sheep kept closenibbled in her childish days maggie held this place called the red deeps in very great awe and needed all her confidence in toms bravery to reconcile her to an excursion thithervisions of robbers and fierce animals haunting every hollow but now it had the charm for her which any broken ground any mimic rock and ravine have for the eyes that rest habitually on the level especially in summer when she could sit on a grassy hollow under the shadow of a branching ash stooping aslant from the steep above her and listen to the hum of insects like tiniest bells on the garment of silence or see the sunlight piercing the distant boughs as if to chase and drive home the truant heavenly blue of the wild hyacinths in this june time too the dogroses were in their glory and that was an additional reason why maggie should direct her walk to the red deeps rather than to any other spot on the first day she was free to wander at her willa pleasure she loved so well that sometimes in her ardors of renunciation she thought she ought to deny herself the frequent indulgence in it  you may see her now as she walks down the favorite turning and enters the deeps by a narrow path through a group of scotch firs her tall figure and old lavender gown visible through an hereditary black silk shawl of some widemeshed netlike material and now she is sure of being unseen she takes off her bonnet and ties it over her arm one would certainly suppose her to be farther on in life than her seventeenth yearperhaps because of the slow resigned sadness of the glance from which all search and unrest seem to have departed perhaps because her broadchested figure has the mould of early womanhood youth and health have withstood well the involuntary and voluntary hardships of her lot and the nights in which she has lain on the hard floor for a penance have left no obvious trace the eyes are liquid the brown cheek is firm and round the full lips are red with her dark coloring and jet crown surmounting her tall figure she seems to have a sort of kinship with the grand scotch firs at which she is looking up as if she loved them well yet one has a sense of uneasiness in looking at hera sense of opposing elements of which a fierce collision is imminent surely there is a hushed expression such as one often sees in older faces under borderless caps out of keeping with the resistant youth which one expects to flash out in a sudden passionate glance that will dissipate all the quietude like a damp fire leaping out again when all seemed safe  but maggie herself was not uneasy at this moment she was clamly enjoying the free air while she looked up at the old firtrees and thought that those broken ends of branches were the records of past storms which had only made the red stems soar higher but while her eyes were still turned upward she became conscious of a moving shadow cast by the evening sun on the grassy path before her and looked down with a startled gesture to see philip wakem who first raised his hat and then blushing deeply came forward to her and put out his hand maggie too colored with surprise which soon gave way to pleasure she put out her hand and looked down at the deformed figure before her with frank eyes filled for the moment with nothing but the memory of her childs feelingsa memory that was always strong in her she was the first to speak  you startled me she said smiling faintly i never meet any one here how came you to be walking here did you come to meet me  it was impossible not to perceive that maggie felt herself a child again  yes i did said philip still embarrassed i wished to see you very much i watched a long while yesterday on the bank near your house to see if you would come out but you never came then i watched again today and when i saw the way you took i kept you in sight and came down the bank behind there i hope you will not be displeased with me  no said maggie with simple seriousness walking on as if she meant philip to accompany her im very glad you came for i wished very much to have an opportunity of speaking to you ive never forgotten how good you were long ago to tom and me too but i was not sure that you would remember us so well tom and i have had a great deal of trouble since then and i think that makes one think more of what happened before the trouble came  i cant believe that you have thought of me so much as i have thought of you said philip timidly do you know when i was away i made a picture of you as you looked that morning in the study when you said you would not forget me  philip drew a large miniaturecase from his pocket and opened it maggie saw her old self leaning on a table with her black locks hanging down behind her ears looking into space with strange dreamy eyes it was a watercolor sketch of real merit as a portrait  oh dear said maggie smiling and flushed with pleasure what a queer little girl i was i remember myself with my hair in that way in that pink frock i really was like a gypsy i dare say i am now she added after a little pause am i like what you expected me to be  the words might have been those of a coquette but the full bright glance maggie turned on philip was not that of a coquette she really did hope he liked her face as it was now but it was simply the rising again of her innate delight in admiration and love philip met her eyes and looked at her in silence for a long moment before he said quietly no maggie  the light died out a little from maggies face and there was a slight trembling of the lip her eyelids fell lower but she did not turn away her head and philip continued to look at her then he said slowly  you are very much more beautiful than i thought you would be  am i said maggie the pleasure returning in a deeper flush she turned her face away from him and took some steps looking straight before her in silence as if she were adjusting her consciousness to this new idea girls are so accustomed to think of dress as the main ground of vanity that in abstaining from the lookingglass maggie had thought more of abandoning all care for adornment than of renouncing the contemplation of her face comparing herself with elegant wealthy young ladies it had not occurred to her that she could produce any effect with her person philip seemed to like the silence well he walked by her side watching her face as if that sight left no room for any other wish they had passed from among the firtrees and had now come to a green hollow almost surrounded by an amphitheatre of the pale pink dogroses but as the light about them had brightened maggies face had lost its glow  she stood still when they were in the hollows and looking at philip again she said in a serious sad voice  i wish we could have been friendsi mean if it would have been good and right for us but that is the trial i have to bear in everything i may not keep anything i used to love when i was little the old books went and tom is different and my father it is like death i must part with everything i cared for when i was a child and i must part with you we must never take any notice of each other again that was what i wanted to speak to you for i wanted to let you know that tom and i cant do as we like about such things and that if i behave as if i had forgotten all about you it is not out of envy or prideoror any bad feeling  maggie spoke with more and more sorrowful gentleness as she went on and her eyes began to fill with tears the deepening expression of pain on philips face gave him a stronger resemblance to his boyish self and made the deformity appeal more strongly to her pity  i know i see all that you mean he said in a voice that had become feebler from discouragement i know what there is to keep us apart on both sides but it is not right maggiedont you be angry with me i am so used to call you maggie in my thoughtsit is not right to sacrifice everything to other peoples unreasonable feelings i would give up a great deal for my father but i would not give up a friendship oror an attachment of any sort in obedience to any wish of his that i didnt recognize as right  i dont know said maggie musingly often when i have been angry and discontented it has seemed to me that i was not bound to give up anything and i have gone on thinking till it has seemed to me that i could think away all my duty but no good has ever come of that it was an evil state of mind im quite sure that whatever i might do i should wish in the end that i had gone without anything for myself rather than have made my fathers life harder to him  but would it make his life harder if we were to see each other sometimes said philip he was going to say something else but checked himself  oh im sure he wouldnt like it dont ask me why or anything about it said maggie in a distressed tone my father feels so strongly about some things he is not at all happy  no more am i said philip impetuously i am not happy  why said maggie gently at leasti ought not to askbut im very very sorry  philip turned to walk on as if he had not patience to stand still any longer and they went out of the hollow winding amongst the trees and bushes in silence after that last word of philips maggie could not bear to insist immediately on their parting  ive been a great deal happier she said at last timidly since i have given up thinking about what is easy and pleasant and being discontented because i couldnt have my own will our life is determined for us and it makes the mind very free when we give up wishing and only think of bearing what is laid upon us and doing what is given us to do  but i cant give up wishing said philip impatiently it seems to me we can never give up longing and wishing while we are thoroughly alive there are certain things we feel to be beautiful and good and we must hunger after them how can we ever be satisfied without them until our feelings are deadened i delight in fine pictures i long to be able to paint such i strive and strive and cant produce what i want that is pain to me and always will be pain until my faculties lose their keenness like aged eyes then there are many other things i long forhere philip hesitated a little and then saidthings that other men have and that will always be denied me my life will have nothing great or beautiful in it i would rather not have lived  oh philip said maggie i wish you didnt feel so but her heart began to beat with something of philips discontent  well then said he turning quickly round and fixing his gray eyes entreatingly on her face i should be contented to live if you would let me see you sometimes then checked by a fear which her face suggested he looked away again and said more calmly i have no friend to whom i can tell everything no one who cares enough about me and if i could only see you now and then and you would let me talk to you a little and show me that you cared for me and that we may always be friends in heart and help each other then i might come to be glad of life  but how can i see you philip said maggie falteringly could she really do him good it would be very hard to say goodby this day and not speak to him again here was a new interest to vary the days it was so much easier to renounce the interest before it came  if you would let me see you here sometimeswalk with you herei would be contented if it were only once or twice in a month that could injure no ones happiness and it would sweeten my life besides philip went on with all the inventive astuteness of love at oneandtwenty if there is any enmity between those who belong to us we ought all the more to try and quench it by our friendship i mean that by our influence on both sides we might bring about a healing of the wounds that have been made in the past if i could know everything about them and i dont believe there is any enmity in my own fathers mind i think he has proved the contrary  maggie shook her head slowly and was silent under conflicting thoughts it seemed to her inclination that to see philip now and then and keep up the bond of friendship with him was something not only innocent but good perhaps she might really help him to find contentment as she had found it the voice that said this made sweet music to maggie but athwart it there came an urgent monotonous warning from another voice which she had been learning to obeythe warning that such interviews implied secrecy implied doing something she would dread to be discovered in something that if discovered must cause anger and pain and that the admission of anything so near doubleness would act as a spiritual blight yet the music would swell out again like chimes borne onward by a recurrent breeze persuading her that the wrong lay all in the faults and weaknesses of others and that there was such a thing as futile sacrifice for one to the injury of another it was very cruel for philip that he should be shrunk from because of an unjustifiable vindictiveness toward his fatherpoor philip whom some people would shrink from only because he was deformed the idea that he might become her lover or that her meeting him could cause disapproval in that light had not occurred to her and philip saw the absence of this idea clearly enough saw it with a certain pang although it made her consent to his request the less unlikely there was bitterness to him in the perception that maggie was almost as frank and unconstrained toward him as when she was a child  i cant say either yes or no she said at last turning round and walking toward the way she come i must wait lest i should decide wrongly i must seek for guidance  may i come again then tomorrow or the next day or next week  i think i had better write said maggie faltering again i have to go to st oggs sometimes and i can put the letter in the post  oh no said philip eagerly that would not be so well my father might see the letterandhe has not any enmity i believe but he views things differently from me he thinks a great deal about wealth and position pray let me come here once more tell me when it shall be or if you cant tell me i will come as often as i can till i do see you  i think it must be so then said maggie for i cant be quite certain of coming here any particular evening  maggie felt a great relief in adjourning the decision she was free now to enjoy the minutes of companionship she almost thought she might linger a little the next time they met she should have to pain philip by telling him her determination  i cant help thinking she said looking smilingly at him after a few moments of silence how strange it is that we should have met and talked to each other just as if it had been only yesterday when we parted at lorton and yet we must both be very much altered in those five yearsi think it is five years how was it you seemed to have a sort of feeling that i was the same maggie i was not quite so sure that you would be the same i know you are so clever and you must have seen and learnt so much to fill your mind i was not quite sure you would care about me now  i have never had any doubt that you would be the same whenever i migh see you said philipi mean the same in everything that made me like you better than any one else i dont want to explain that i dont think any of the strongest effects our natures are susceptible of can ever be explained we can neither detect the process by which they are arrived at nor the mode in which they act on us the greatest of painters only once painted a mysteriously divine child he couldnt have told how he did it and we cant tell why we feel it to be divine i think there are stores laid up in our human nature that our understandings can make no complete inventory of certain strains of music affect me so strangely i can never hear them without their changing my whole attitude of mind for a time and if the effect would last i might be capable of heroisms  ah i know what you mean about music i feel so said maggie clasping her hands with her old impetuosity at least she added in a saddened tone i used to feel so when i had any music i never have any now except the organ at church  and you long for it maggie said philip looking at her with affectionate pity ah you can have very little that is beautiful in your life have you many books you were so fond of them when you were a little girl  they were come back to the hollow round which the dogroses grew and they both paused under the charm of the faëry evening light reflected from the pale pink clusters  no i have given up books said maggie quietly except a very very few  philip had already taken from his pocket a small volume and was looking at the back as he said  ah this is the second volume i see else you might have liked to take it home with you i put it in my pocket because i am studying a scene for a picture  maggie had looked at the back too and saw the title it revived an old impression with overmastering force  the pirate she said taking the book from philips hands oh i began that once i read to where minna is walking with cleveland and i could never get to read the rest i went on with it in my own head and i made several endings but they were all unhappy i could never make a happy ending out of that beginning poor minna i wonder what is the real end for a long while i couldnt get my mind away from the shetland islesi used to feel the wind blowing on me from the rough sea  maggie spoke rapidly with glistening eyes  take that volume home with you maggie said philip watching her with delight i dont want it now i shall make a picture of you insteadyou among the scotch firs and the slanting shadows  maggie had not heard a word he had said she was absorbed in a page at which she had opened but suddenly she closed the book and gave it back to philip shaking her head with a backward movement as if to say avaunt to floating visions  do keep it maggie said philip entreatingly it will give you pleasure  no thank you said maggie putting it aside with her hand and walking on it would make me in love with this world again as i used to be it would make me long to see and know many things it would make me long for a full life  but you will not always be shut up in your present lot why should you starve your mind in that way it is narrow asceticism i dont like to see you persisting in it maggie poetry and art and knowledge are sacred and pure  but not for me not for me said maggie walking more hurriedly because i should want too much i must wait this life will not last long  dont hurry away from me without saying goodby maggie said philip as they reached the group of scotch firs and she continued still to walk along without speaking i must not go any farther i think must i  oh no i forgot goodby said maggie pausing and putting out her hand to him the action brought her feeling back in a strong current to philip and after they had stood looking at each other in silence for a few moments with their hands clasped she said withdrawing her hand  im very grateful to you for thinking of me all those years it is very sweet to have people love us what a wonderful beautiful thing it seems that god should have made your heart so that you could care about a queer little girl whom you only knew for a few weeks i remember saying to you that i thought you cared for me more than tom did  ah maggie said philip almost fretfully you would never love me so well as you love your brother  perhaps not said maggie simply but then you know the first thing i ever remember in my life is standing with tom by the side of the floss while he held my hand everything before that is dark to me but i shall never forget you though we must keep apart  dont say so maggie said philip if i kept that little girl in my mind for five years didnt i earn some part in her she ought not to take herself quite away from me  not if i were free said maggie but i am not i must submit she hesitated a moment and then added and i wanted to say to you that you had better not take more notice of my brother than just bowing to him he once told me not to speak to you again and he doesnt change his mindoh dear the sun is set i am too long away goodby she gave him her hand once more  i shall come here as often as i can till i see you again maggie have some feeling for me as well as for others  yes yes i have said maggie hurrying away and quickly disappearing behind the last firtree though philips gaze after her remained immovable for minutes as if he saw her still  maggie went home with an inward conflict already begun philip went home to do nothing but remember and hope you can hardly help blaming him severely he was four or five years older than maggie and had a full consciousness of his feeling toward her to aid him in foreseeing the character his contemplated interviews with her would bear in the opinion of a third person but you must not suppose that he was capable of a gross selfishness or that he could have been satisfied without persuading himself that he was seeking to infuse some happiness into maggies lifeseeking this even more than any direct ends for himself he could give her sympathy he could give her help there was not the slightest promise of love toward him in her manner it was nothing more than the sweet girlish tenderness she had shown him when she was twelve perhaps she would never love him perhaps no woman ever could love him well then he would endure that he should at least have the happiness of seeing her of feeling some nearness to her and he clutched passionately the possibility that she might love him perhaps the feeling would grow if she could come to associate him with that watchful tenderness which her nature would be so keenly alive to if any woman could love him surely maggie was that woman there was such wealth of love in her and there was no one to claim it all then the pity of it that a mind like hers should be withering in its very youth like a young foresttree for want of the light and space it was formed to flourish in could he not hinder that by persuading her out of her system of privation he would be her guardian angel he would do anything bear anything for her sakeexcept not seeing her    chapter ii  aunt glegg learns the breadth of bobs thumb   while maggies lifestruggles had lain almost entirely within her own soul one shadowy army fighting another and the slain shadows forever rising again tom was engaged in a dustier noisier warfare grappling with more substantial obstacles and gaining more definite conquests so it has been since the days of hecuba and of hector tamer of horses inside the gates the women with streaming hair and uplifted hands offering prayers watching the worlds combat from afar filling their long empty days with memories and fears outside the men in fierce struggle with things divine and human quenching memory in the stronger light of purpose losing the sense of dread and even of wounds in the hurrying ardor of action  from what you have seen of tom i think he is not a youth of whom you would prophesy failure in anything he had thoroughly wished the wagers are likely to be on his side notwithstanding his small success in the classics for tom had never desired success in this field of enterprise and for getting a fine flourishing growth of stupidity there is nothing like pouring out on a mind a good amount of subjects in which it feels no interest but now toms strong will bound together his integrity his pride his family regrets and his personal ambition and made them one force concentrating his efforts and surmounting discouragements his uncle deane who watched him closely soon began to conceive hopes of him and to be rather proud that he had brought into the employment of the firm a nephew who appeared to be made of such good commercial stuff the real kindness of placing him in the warehouse first was soon evident to tom in the hints his uncle began to throw out that after a time he might perhaps be trusted to travel at certain seasons and buy in for the firm various vulgar commodities with which i need not shock refined ears in this place and it was doubtless with a view to this result that mr deane when he expected to take his wine alone would tell tom to step in and sit with him an hour and would pass that hour in much lecturing and catechising concerning articles of export and import with an occasional excursus of more indirect utility on the relative advantages to the merchants of st oggs of having goods brought in their own and in foreign bottomsa subject on which mr deane as a shipowner naturally threw off a few sparks when he got warmed with talk and wine  already in the second year toms salary was raised but all except the price of his dinner and clothes went home into the tin box and he shunned comradeship lest it should lead him into expenses in spite of himself not that tom was moulded on the spoony type of the industrious apprentice he had a very strong appetite for pleasurewould have liked to be a tamer of horses and to make a distinguished figure in all neighboring eyes dispensing treats and benefits to others with welljudged liberality and being pronounced one of the finest young fellows of those parts nay he determined to achieve these things sooner or later but his practical shrewdness told him that the means no such achievements could only lie for him in present abstinence and selfdenial there were certain milestones to be passed and one of the first was the payment of his fathers debts having made up his mind on that point he strode along without swerving contracting some rather saturnine sternness as a young man is likely to do who has a premature call upon him for selfreliance tom felt intensely that common cause with his father which springs from family pride and was bent on being irreproachable as a son but his growing experience caused him to pass much silent criticism on the rashness and imprudence of his fathers past conduct their dispositions were not in sympathy and toms face showed little radiance during his few home hours maggie had an awe of him against which she struggled as something unfair to her consciousness of wider thoughts and deeper motives but it was of no use to struggle a character at unity with itselfthat performs what it intends subdues every counteracting impulse and has no visions beyond the distinctly possibleis strong by its very negations  you may imagine that toms more and more obvious unlikeness to his father was well fitted to conciliate the maternal aunts and uncles and mr deanes favorable reports and predictions to mr glegg concerning toms qualifications for business began to be discussed amongst them with various acceptance he was likely it appeared to do the family credit without causing it any expense and trouble mrs pullet had always thought it strange if toms excellent complexion so entirely that of the dodsons did not argue a certainty that he would turn out well his juvenile errors of running down the peacock and general disrespect to his aunts only indicating a tinge of tulliver blood which he had doubtless outgrown mr glegg who had contracted a cautious liking for tom ever since his spirited and sensible behavior when the execution was in the house was now warming into a resolution to further his prospects activelysome time when an opportunity offered of doing so in a prudent manner without ultimate loss but mrs glegg observed that she was not given to speak without book as some people were that those who said least were most likely to find their words made good and that when the right moment came it would be seen who could do something better than talk uncle pullet after silent meditation for a period of several lozenges came distinctly to the conclusion that when a young man was likely to do well it was better not to meddle with him  tom meanwhile had shown no disposition to rely on any one but himself though with a natural sensitiveness toward all indications of favorable opinion he was glad to see his uncle glegg look in on him sometimes in a friendly way during business hours and glad to be invited to dine at his house though he usually preferred declining on the ground that he was not sure of being punctual but about a year ago something had occurred which induced tom to test his uncle gleggs friendly disposition  bob jakin who rarely returned from one of his rounds without seeing tom and maggie awaited him on the bridge as he was coming home from st oggs one evening that they might have a little private talk he took the liberty of asking if mr tom had ever thought of making money by trading a bit on his own account trading how tom wished to know why by sending out a bit of a cargo to foreign ports because bob had a particular friend who had offered to do a little business for him in that way in laceham goods and would be glad to serve mr tom on the same footing tom was interested at once and begged for full explanation wondering he had not thought of this plan before  he was so well pleased with the prospect of a speculation that might change the slow process of addition into multiplication that he at once determined to mention the matter to his father and get his consent to appropriate some of the savings in the tin box to the purchase of a small cargo he would rather not have consulted his father but he had just paid his last quarters money into the tin box and there was no other resource all the savings were there for mr tulliver would not consent to put the money out at interest lest he should lose it since he had speculated in the purchase of some corn and had lost by it he could not be easy without keeping the money under his eye  tom approached the subject carefully as he was seated on the hearth with his father that evening and mr tulliver listened leaning forward in his armchair and looking up in toms face with a sceptical glance his first impulse was to give a positive refusal but he was in some awe of toms wishes and since he had the sense of being an unlucky father he had lost some of his old peremptoriness and determination to be master he took the key of the bureau from his pocket got out the key of the large chest and fetched down the tin boxslowly as if he were trying to defer the moment of a painful parting then he seated himself against the table and opened the box with that little padlockkey which he fingered in his waistcoat pocket in all vacant moments there they were the dingy banknotes and the bright sovereigns and he counted them out on the tableonly a hundred and sixteen pounds in two years after all the pinching  how much do you want then he said speaking as if the words burnt his lips  suppose i begin with the thirtysix pounds father said tom  mr tulliver separated this sum from the rest and keeping his hand over it said  its as much as i can save out o my pay in a year  yes father it is such slow work saving out of the little money we get and in this way we might double our savings  ay my lad said the father keeping his hand on the money but you might lose ityou might lose a year o my lifeand i havent got many  tom was silent  and you know i wouldnt pay a dividend with the first hundred because i wanted to see it all in a lumpand when i see it im sure ont if you trust to luck its sure to be against me its old harrys got the luck in his hands and if i lose one year i shall never pick it up again death ull oertake me  mr tullivers voice trembled and tom was silent for a few minutes before he said  ill give it up father since you object to it so strongly  but unwilling to abandon the scheme altogether he determined to ask his uncle glegg to venture twenty pounds on condition of receiving five per cent of the profits that was really a very small thing to ask so when bob called the next day at the wharf to know the decision tom proposed that they should go together to his uncle gleggs to open the business for his diffident pride clung to him and made him feel that bobs tongue would relieve him from some embarrassment  mr glegg at the pleasant hour of four in the afternoon of a hot august day was naturally counting his wallfruit to assure himself that the sum total had not varied since yesterday to him entered tom in what appeared to mr glegg very questionable companionshipthat of a man with a pack on his backfor bob was equipped for a new journeyand of a huge brindled bullterrier who walked with a slow swaying movement from side to side and glanced from under his eyelids with a surly indifference which might after all be a cover to the most offensive designs  mr gleggs spectacles which had been assisting him in counting the fruit made these suspicious details alarmingly evident to him  heigh heigh keep that dog back will you he shouted snatching up a stake and holding it before him as a shield when the visitors were within three yards of him  get out wi you mumps said bob with a kick hes as quiet as a lamb siran observation which mumps corroborated by a low growl as he retreated behind his masters legs  why what ever does this mean tom said mr glegg have you brought information about the scoundrels as cut my trees if bob came in the character of information mr glegg saw reasons for tolerating some irregularity  no sir said tom i came to speak to you about a little matter of business of my own  aywell but what has this dog got to do with it said the old gentleman getting mild again  its my dog sir said the ready bob an its me as put mr tom up to the bit o business for mr toms been a friend o mine iver since i was a little chap fust thing iver i did was frightenin the birds for th old master an if a bit o luck turns up im allays thinkin if i can let mr tom have a pull at it an its a downright roarin shame as when hes got the chance o making a bit o money wi sending goods outten or twelve per zent clear when freight an commissions paidas he shouldnt lay hold o the chance for want o money an when theres the laceham goodslors theyre made o purpose for folks as want to send out a little carguy light an take up no roomyou may pack twenty pound so as you cant see the passill an theyre manifacturs as please fools so i reckon they arent like to want a market an id go to laceham an buy in the goods for mr tom along wi my own an theres the shupercargo o the bit of a vessel as is goin to take em out i know him particlar hes a solid man an got a family i the town here salt his name isan a briny chap he is tooan if you dont believe me i can take you to him  uncle glegg stood openmouthed with astonishment at this unembarrassed loquacity with which his understanding could hardly keep pace he looked at bob first over his spectacles then through them then over them again while tom doubtful of his uncles impression began to wish he had not brought this singular aaron or mouthpiece bobs talk appeared less seemly now some one besides himself was listening to it  you seem to be a knowing fellow said mr glegg at last  ay sir you say true returned bob nodding his head aside i think my heads all alive inside like an old cheese for im so full o plans one knocks another over if i hadnt mumps to talk to i should get topheavy an tumble in a fit i suppose its because i niver went to school much thats what i jaw my old mother for i says you should ha sent me to school a bit more i says an then i could ha read i the books like fun an kep my head cool an empty lors shes fine an comforble now my old mother is she ates her baked meat an taters as often as she likes for im gettin so full o money i must hev a wife to spend it for me but its botherin a wife isand mumps mightnt like her  uncle glegg who regarded himself as a jocose man since he had retired from business was beginning to find bob amusing but he had still a disapproving observation to make which kept his face serious  ah he said i should think youre at a loss for ways o spending your money else you wouldnt keep that big dog to eat as much as two christians its shamefulshameful but he spoke more in sorrow than in anger and quickly added  but come now lets hear more about this business tom i suppose you want a little sum to make a venture with but wheres all your own money you dont spend it alleh  no sir said tom coloring but my father is unwilling to risk it and i dont like to press him if i could get twenty or thirty pounds to begin with i could pay five per cent for it and then i could gradually make a little capital of my own and do without a loan  ayay said mr glegg in an approving tone thats not a bad notion and i wont say as i wouldnt be your man but it ull be as well for me to see this salt as you talk on and thenheres this friend o yours offers to buy the goods for you perhaps youve got somebody to stand surety for you if the moneys put into your hands added the cautious old gentleman looking over his spectacles at bob  i dont think thats necessary uncle said tom at least i mean it would not be necessary for me because i know bob well but perhaps it would be right for you to have some security  you get your percentage out o the purchase i suppose said mr glegg looking at bob  no sir said bob rather indignantly i didnt offer to get a apple for mr tom o purpose to hev a bite out of it myself when i play folks tricks therell be more fun in em nor that  well but its nothing but right you should have a small percentage said mr glegg ive no opinion o transactions where folks do things for nothing it allays looks bad  well then said bob whose keenness saw at once what was implied ill tell you what i get byt an its money in my pocket in the endi make myself look big wi makin a bigger purchase thats what im thinking on lors im a cute chapi am  mr glegg mr glegg said a severe voice from the open parlor window pray are you coming in to tea or are you going to stand talking with packmen till you get murdered in the open daylight  murdered said mr glegg whats the woman talking of heres your nephey tom come about a bit o business  murderedyesit isnt many sizes ago since a packman murdered a young woman in a lone place and stole her thimble and threw her body into a ditch  nay nay said mr glegg soothingly youre thinking o the man wi no legs as drove a dogcart  well its the same thing mr glegg only youre fond o contradicting what i say and if my nepheys come about business it ud be more fitting if youd bring him into the house and let his aunt know about it instead o whispering in corners in that plotting underminding way  well well said mr glegg well come in now  you neednt stay here said the lady to bob in a loud voice adapted to the moral not the physical distance between them we dont want anything i dont deal wi packmen mind you shut the gate after you  stop a bit not so fast said mr glegg i havent done with this young man yet come in tom come in he added stepping in at the french window  mr glegg said mrs g in a fatal tone if youre going to let that man and his dog in on my carpet before my very face be so good as to let me know a wifes got a right to ask that i hope  dont you be uneasy mum said bob touching his cap he saw at once that mrs glegg was a bit of game worth running down and longed to be at the sport well stay out upo the gravel heremumps and me will mumps knows his companyhe does i might hish at him by th hour together before hed fly at a real gentlewoman like you its wonderful how he knows which is the goodlooking ladies ands particlar fond of em when theyve good shapes lors added bob laying down his pack on the gravel its a thousand pities such a lady as you shouldnt deal with a packman i stead o goin into these newfangled shops where theres halfadozen fine gents wi their chins propped up wi a stiff stock alooking like bottles wi ornamental stoppers an all got to get their dinner out of a bit o calico it stans to reason you must pay three times the price you pay a packman as is the natral way o gettin goodsan pays no rent an isnt forced to throttle himself till the lies are squeezed out on him whether he will or no but lors mum you know what it is better nor i doyou can see through them shopmen ill be bound  yes i reckon i can and through the packmen too observed mrs glegg intending to imply that bobs flattery had produced no effect on her while her husband standing behind her with his hands in his pockets and legs apart winked and smiled with conjugal delight at the probability of his wifes being circumvented  ay to be sure mum said bob why you must ha dealt wi no end o packmen when you war a young lassbefore the master here had the luck to set eyes on you i know where you lived i doseen th house many a timeclose upon squire darleighsa stone house wi steps  ah that it had said mrs glegg pouring out the tea you know something o my family then are you akin to that packman with a squint in his eye as used to bring th irish linen  look you there now said bob evasively didnt i know as youd remember the best bargains youve made in your life was made wi packmen why you see even a squintin packmans better nor a shopman as can see straight lors if id had the luck to call at the stone house wi my pack as lies herestooping and thumping the bundle emphatically with his fistan th handsome young lasses all stannin out on the stone steps it ud ha been summat like openin a pack that would its ony the poor houses now as a packman calls on if it isnt for the sake o the sarvantmaids theyre paltry times these are why mum look at the printed cottons now an what they was when you wore emwhy you wouldnt put such a thing on now i can see it must be firstrate quality the manifactur as youd buysummat as ud wear as well as your own faitures  yes better quality nor any youre like to carry youve got nothing firstrate but brazenness ill be bound said mrs glegg with a triumphant sense of her insurmountable sagacity mr glegg are you going ever to sit down to your tea tom theres a cup for you  you speak true there mum said bob my pack isnt for ladies like you the times gone by for that bargains picked up dirt cheap a bit o damage here an there as can be cut out or else niver seen i the wearin but not fit to offer to rich folks as can pay for the look o things as nobody sees im not the man as ud offer t open my pack to you mum no no im a imperent chap as you saythese times makes folks imperentbut im not up to the mark o that  why what goods do you carry in your pack said mrs glegg finecolored things i supposeshawls an that  all sorts mum all sorts said bobthumping his bundle but let us say no more about that if you please im here upo mr toms business an im not the man to take up the time wi my own  and pray what is this business as is to be kept from me said mrs glegg who solicited by a double curiosity was obliged to let the onehalf wait  a little plan o nephey toms here said goodnatured mr glegg and not altogether a bad un i think a little plan for making money thats the right sort o plan for young folks as have got their fortin to make eh jane  but i hope it isnt a plan where he expects iverything to be done for him by his friends thats what the young folks think of mostly nowadays and pray what has this packman got to do wi what goes on in our family cant you speak for yourself tom and let your aunt know things as a nephey should  this is bob jakin aunt said tom bridling the irritation that aunt gleggs voice always produced ive known him ever since we were little boys hes a very good fellow and always ready to do me a kindness and he has had some experience in sending goods outa small part of a cargo as a private speculation and he thinks if i could begin to do a little in the same way i might make some money a large interest is got in that way  large intrest said aunt glegg with eagerness and what do you call large intrest  ten or twelve per cent bob says after expenses are paid  then why wasnt i let to know o such things before mr glegg said mrs glegg turning to her husband with a deep grating tone of reproach havent you allays told me as there was no getting more nor five per cent  pooh pooh nonsense my good woman said mr glegg you couldnt go into trade could you you cant get more than five per cent with security  but i can turn a bit o money for you an welcome mum said bob if youd like to risk itnot as theres any risk to speak on but if youd a mind to lend a bit o money to mr tom hed pay you six or seven per zent an get a trifle for himself as well an a goodnaturd lady like you ud like the feel o the money better if your nephey took part on it  what do you say mrs g said mr glegg ive a notion when ive made a bit more inquiry as i shall perhaps start tom here with a bit of a nestegghell pay me intrest you knowan if youve got some little sums lyin idle twisted up in a stockin toe or that  mr glegg its beyond iverything youll go and give information to the tramps next as they may come and rob me  well well as i was sayin if you like to join me wi twenty pounds you canill make it fifty thatll be a pretty good nestegg eh tom  youre not counting on me mr glegg i hope said his wife you could do fine things wi my money i dont doubt  very well said mr glegg rather snappishly then well do without you i shall go with you to see this salt he added turning to bob  and now i suppose youll go all the other way mr glegg said mrs g and want to shut me out o my own nepheys business i never said i wouldnt put money into iti dont say as it shall be twenty pounds though youre so ready to say it for mebut hell see some day as his aunts in the right not to risk the money shes saved for him till its proved as it wont be lost  ay thats a pleasant sort orisk that is said mr glegg indiscreetly winking at tom who couldnt avoid smiling but bob stemmed the injured ladys outburst  ay mum he said admiringly you know whats whatyou do an its nothing but fair you see how the first bit of a job answers an then youll come down handsome lors its a fine thing to hev good kin i got my bit of a nestegg as the master calls it all by my own sharpnessten suvreigns it waswi dousing the fire at torrys mill an its growed an growed by a bit an a bit till in got a matter o thirty pound to lay out besides

out on it but melors i shall sell em for pretty near what i paid for em  have you got a bit of good net now said mrs glegg in a patronizing tone moving from the teatable and folding her napkin  eh mum not what youd think it worth your while to look at id scorn to show it you it ud be an insult to you  but let me see said mrs glegg still patronizing if theyre damaged goods theyre like enough to be a bit the better quality  no mum i know my place said bob lifting up his pack and shouldering it im not going t expose the lowness o my trade to a lady like you packs is come down i the world it ud cut you to th heart to see the difference im at your sarvice sir when youve a mind to go and see salt  all in good time said mr glegg really unwilling to cut short the dialogue are you wanted at the wharf tom  no sir i left stowe in my place  come put down your pack and let me see said mrs glegg drawing a chair to the window and seating herself with much dignity  dont you ask it mum said bob entreatingly  make no more words said mrs glegg severely but do as i tell you  eh mum im loth that i am said bob slowly depositing his pack on the step and beginning to untie it with unwilling fingers but what you order shall be done much fumbling in pauses between the sentences its not as youll buy a single thing on meid be sorry for you to do itfor think o them poor women up i the villages there as niver stir a hundred yards from homeit ud be a pity for anybody to buy up their bargains lors its as good as a junketing to em when they see me wi my pack an i shall niver pick up such bargains for

 see what there is over measure he said holding forth the extra halfyard while mrs glegg was busy examining the damaged yard and throwing her head back to see how far the fault would be lost on a distant view  ill give you six shilling for it she said throwing it down with the air of a person who mentions an ultimatum  didnt i tell you now mum as it ud hurt your feelings to look at my pack that damaged bits turned your stomach now i see it has said bob wrapping the muslin up with the utmost quickness and apparently about to fasten up his pack youre used to seein a different sort o

interest you know i dont approve o giving we niver looked for that in my family  thank you aunt said tom rather proudly i prefer having the money only lent to me  very well thats the dodson sperrit said mrs glegg rising to get her knitting with the sense that any further remark after this would be bathos  saltthat eminently briny chaphaving been discovered in a cloud of tobaccosmoke at the anchor tavern mr glegg commenced inquiries which turned out satisfactorily enough to warrant the advance of the nestegg to which aunt glegg contributed twenty pounds and in this modest beginning you see the ground of a fact which might otherwise surprise you namely toms accumulation of a fund unknown to his father that promised in no very long time to meet the more tardy process of saving and quite cover the deficit when once his attention had been turned to this source of gain tom determined to make the most of it and lost on opportunity of obtaining information and extending his small enterprises in not telling his father he was influenced by that strange mixture of opposite feelings which often gives equal truth to those who blame an action and those who admire itpartly it was that disinclination to confidence which is seen between near kindred that family repulsion which spoils the most sacred relations of our lives partly it was the desire to surprise his father with a great joy he did not see that it would have been better to soothe the interval with a new hope and prevent the delirium of a too sudden elation  at the time of maggies first meeting with philip tom had already nearly a hundred and fifty pounds of his own capital and while they were walking by the evening light in the red deeps he by the same evening light was riding into laceham proud of being on his first journey on behalf of guest  co and revolving in his mind all the chances that by the end of another year he should have doubled his gains lifted off the obloquy of debt from his fathers name and perhapsfor he should be twentyonehave got a new start for himself on a higher platform of employment did he not desire it he was quite sure that he did    chapter iii  the wavering balance   i said that maggie went home that evening from the red deeps with a mental conflict already begun you have seen clearly enough in her interview with philip what that conflict was here suddenly was an opening in the rocky wall which shut in the narrow valley of humiliation where all her prospect was the remote unfathomed sky and some of the memoryhaunting earthly delights were no longer out of her reach she might have books converse affection she might hear tidings of the world from which her mind had not yet lost its sense of exile and it would be a kindness to philip too who was pitiableclearly not happy and perhaps here was an opportunity indicated for making her mind more worthy of its highest service perhaps the noblest completest devoutness could hardly exist without some width of knowledge must she always live in this resigned imprisonment it was so blameless so good a thing that there should be friendship between her and philip the motives that forbade it were so unreasonable so unchristian but the severe monotonous warning came again and againthat she was losing the simplicity and clearness of her life by admitting a ground of concealment and that by forsaking the simple rule of renunciation she was throwing herself under the seductive guidance of illimitable wants she thought she had won strength to obey the warning before she allowed herself the next week to turn her steps in the evening to the red deeps but while she was resolved to say an affectionate farewell to philip how she looked forward to that evening walk in the still fleckered shade of the hollows away from all that was harsh and unlovely to the affectionate admiring looks that would meet her to the sense of comradeship that childish memories would give to wiser older talk to the certainty that philip would care to hear everything she said which no one else cared for it was a halfhour that it would be very hard to turn her back upon with the sense that there would be no other like it yet she said what she meant to say she looked firm as well as sad  philip i have made up my mind it is right that we should give each other up in everything but memory i could not see you without concealmentstay i know what you are going to sayit is other peoples wrong feelings that make concealment necessary but concealment is bad however it may be caused i feel that it would be bad for me for us both and then if our secret were discovered there would be nothing but miserydreadful anger and then we must part after all and it would be harder when we were used to seeing each other  philips face had flushed and there was a momentary eagerness of expression as if he had been about to resist this decision with all his might  but he controlled himself and said with assumed calmness well maggie if we must part let us try and forget it for one half hour let us talk together a little while for the last time  he took her hand and maggie felt no reason to withdraw it his quietness made her all the more sure she had given him great pain and she wanted to show him how unwillingly she had given it they walked together hand in hand in silence  let us sit down in the hollow said philip where we stood the last time see how the dogroses have strewed the ground and spread their opal petals over it  they sat down at the roots of the slanting ash  ive begun my picture of you among the scotch firs maggie said philip so you must let me study your face a little while you staysince i am not to see it again please turn your head this way  this was said in an entreating voice and it would have been very hard of maggie to refuse the full lustrous face with the bright black coronet looked down like that of a divinity well pleased to be worshipped on the palehued smallfeatured face that was turned up to it  i shall be sitting for my second portrait then she said smiling will it be larger than the other  oh yes much larger it is an oilpainting you will look like a tall hamadryad dark and strong and noble just issued from one of the firtrees when the stems are casting their afternoon shadows on the grass  you seem to think more of painting than of anything now philip  perhaps i do said philip rather sadly but i think of too many thingssow all sorts of seeds and get no great harvest from any one of them im cursed with susceptibility in every direction and effective faculty in none i care for painting and music i care for classic literature and mediæval literature and modern literature i flutter all ways and fly in none  but surely that is a happiness to have so many tastesto enjoy so many beautiful things when they are within your reach said maggie musingly it always seemed to me a sort of clever stupidity only to have one sort of talentalmost like a carrierpigeon  it might be a happiness to have many tastes if i were like other men said philip bitterly i might get some power and distinction by mere mediocrity as they do at least i should get those middling satisfactions which make men contented to do without great ones i might think society at st oggs agreeable then but nothing could make life worth the purchasemoney of pain to me but some faculty that would lift me above the dead level of provincial existence yes there is one thinga passion answers as well as a faculty  maggie did not hear the last words she was struggling against the consciousness that philips words had set her own discontent vibrating again as it used to do  i understand what you mean she said though i know so much less than you do i used to think i could never bear life if it kept on being the same every day and i must always be doing things of no consequence and never know anything greater but dear philip i think we are only like children that some one who is wiser is taking care of is it not right to resign ourselves entirely whatever may be denied us i have found great peace in that for the last two or three years even joy in subduing my own will  yes maggie said philip vehemently and you are shutting yourself up in a narrow selfdelusive fanaticism which is only a way of escaping pain by starving into dulness all the highest powers of your nature joy and peace are not resignation resignation is the willing endurance of a pain that is not allayed that you dont expect to be allayed stupefaction is not resignation and it is stupefaction to remain in ignoranceto shut up all the avenues by which the life of your fellowmen might become known to you i am not resigned i am not sure that life is long enough to learn that lesson you are not resigned you are only trying to stupefy yourself  maggies lips trembled she felt there was some truth in what philip said and yet there was a deeper consciousness that for any immediate application it had to her conduct it was no better than falsity her double impression corresponded to the double impulse of the speaker philip seriously believed what he said but he said it with vehemence because it made an argument against the resolution that opposed his wishes but maggies face made more childlike by the gathering tears touched him with a tenderer less egotistic feeling he took her hand and said gently  dont let us think of such things in this short halfhour maggie let us only care about being together we shall be friends in spite of separation we shall always think of each other i shall be glad to live as long as you are alive because i shall think there may always come a time when i canwhen you will let me help you in some way  what a dear good brother you would have been philip said maggie smiling through the haze of tears i think you would have made as much fuss about me and been as pleased for me to love you as would have satisfied even me you would have loved me well enough to bear with me and forgive me everything that was what i always longed that tom should do i was never satisfied with a little of anything that is why it is better for me to do without earthly happiness altogether i never felt that i had enough musici wanted more instruments playing together i wanted voices to be fuller and deeper do you ever sing now philip she added abruptly as if she had forgotten what went before  yes he said every day almost but my voice is only middling like everything else in me  oh sing me somethingjust one song i may listen to that before i gosomething you used to sing at lorton on a saturday afternoon when we had the drawingroom all to ourselves and i put my apron over my head to listen  i know said philip and maggie buried her face in her hands while he sang sotto voce love in her eyes sits playing and then said thats it isnt it  oh no i wont stay said maggie starting up it will only haunt me let us walk philip i must go home  she moved away so that he was obliged to rise and follow her  maggie he said in a tone of remonstrance dont persist in this wilful senseless privation it makes me wretched to see you benumbing and cramping your nature in this way you were so full of life when you were a child i thought you would be a brilliant womanall wit and bright imagination and it flashes out in your face still until you draw that veil of dull quiescence over it  why do you speak so bitterly to me philip said maggie  because i foresee it will not end well you can never carry on this selftorture  i shall have strength given me said maggie tremulously  no you will not maggie no one has strength given to do what is unnatural it is mere cowardice to seek safety in negations no character becomes strong in that way you will be thrown into the world some day and then every rational satisfaction of your nature that you deny now will assault you like a savage appetite  maggie started and paused looking at philip with alarm in her face  philip how dare you shake me in this way you are a tempter  no i am not but love gives insight maggie and insight often gives foreboding listen to melet me supply you with books do let me see you sometimesbe your brother and teacher as you said at lorton it is less wrong that you should see me than that you should be committing this long suicide  maggie felt unable to speak she shook her head and walked on in silence till they came to the end of the scotch firs and she put out her hand in sign of parting  do you banish me from this place forever then maggie surely i may come and walk in it sometimes if i meet you by chance there is no concealment in that  it is the moment when our resolution seems about to become irrevocablewhen the fatal iron gates are about to close upon usthat tests our strength then after hours of clear reasoning and firm conviction we snatch at any sophistry that will nullify our long struggles and bring us the defeat that we love better than victory  maggie felt her heart leap at this subterfuge of philips and there passed over her face that almost imperceptible shock which accompanies any relief he saw it and they parted in silence  philips sense of the situation was too complete for him not to be visited with glancing fears lest he had been intervening too presumptuously in the action of maggies conscience perhaps for a selfish end but nohe persuaded himself his end was not selfish he had little hope that maggie would ever return the strong feeling he had for her and it must be better for maggies future life when these petty family obstacles to her freedom had disappeared that the present should not be entirely sacrificed and that she should have some opportunity of culturesome interchange with a mind above the vulgar level of those she was now condemned to live with if we only look far enough off for the consequence of our actions we can always find some point in the combination of results by which those actions can be justified by adopting the point of view of a providence who arranges results or of a philosopher who traces them we shall find it possible to obtain perfect complacency in choosing to do what is most agreeable to us in the present moment and it was in this way that philip justified his subtle efforts to overcome maggies true prompting against a concealment that would introduce doubleness into her own mind and might cause new misery to those who had the primary natural claim on her but there was a surplus of passion in him that made him half independent of justifying motives his longing to see maggie and make an element in her life had in it some of that savage impulse to snatch an offered joy which springs from a life in which the mental and bodily constitution have made pain predominate he had not his full share in the common good of men he could not even pass muster with the insignificant but must be singled out for pity and excepted from what was a matter of course with others even to maggie he was an exception it was clear that the thought of his being her lover had never entered her mind  do not think too hardly of philip ugly and deformed people have great need of unusual virtues because they are likely to be extremely uncomfortable without them but the theory that unusual virtues spring by a direct consequence out of personal disadvantages as animals get thicker wool in severe climates is perhaps a little overstrained the temptations of beauty are much dwelt upon but i fancy they only bear the same relation to those of ugliness as the temptation to excess at a feast where the delights are varied for eye and ear as well as palate bears to the temptations that assail the desperation of hunger does not the hunger tower stand as the type of the utmost trial to what is human in us  philip had never been soothed by that mothers love which flows out to us in the greater abundance because our need is greater which clings to us the more tenderly because we are the less likely to be winners in the game of life and the sense of his fathers affection and indulgence toward him was marred by the keener perception of his fathers faults kept aloof from all practical life as philip had been and by nature half feminine in sensitiveness he had some of the womans intolerant repulsion toward worldliness and the deliberate pursuit of sensual enjoyment and this one strong natural tie in his lifehis relation as a sonwas like an aching limb to him perhaps there is inevitably something morbid in a human being who is in any way unfavorably excepted from ordinary conditions until the good force has had time to triumph and it has rarely had time for that at twoandtwenty that force was present in philip in much strength but the sun himself looks feeble through the morning mists    chapter iv  another lovescene   early in the following april nearly a year after that dubious parting you have just witnessed you may if you like again see maggie entering the red deeps through the group of scotch firs but it is early afternoon and not evening and the edge of sharpness in the spring air makes her draw her large shawl close about her and trip along rather quickly though she looks round as usual that she may take in the sight of her beloved trees there is a more eager inquiring look in her eyes than there was last june and a smile is hovering about her lips as if some playful speech were awaiting the right hearer the hearer was not long in appearing  take back your corinne said maggie drawing a book from under her shawl you were right in telling me she would do me no good but you were wrong in thinking i should wish to be like her  wouldnt you really like to be a tenth muse then maggie said philip looking up in her face as we look at a first parting in the clouds that promises us a bright heaven once more  not at all said maggie laughing the muses were uncomfortable goddesses i thinkobliged always to carry rolls and musical instruments about with them if i carried a harp in this climate you know i must have a green baize cover for it and i should be sure to leave it behind me by mistake  you agree with me in not liking corinne then  i didnt finish the book said maggie as soon as i came to the blondhaired young lady reading in the park i shut it up and determined to read no further i foresaw that that lightcomplexioned girl would win away all the love from corinne and make her miserable im determined to read no more books where the blondhaired women carry away all the happiness i should begin to have a prejudice against them if you could give me some story now where the dark woman triumphs it would restore the balance i want to avenge rebecca and flora macivor and minna and all the rest of the dark unhappy ones since you are my tutor you ought to preserve my mind from prejudices you are always arguing against prejudices  well perhaps you will avenge the dark women in your own person and carry away all the love from your cousin lucy she is sure to have some handsome young man of st oggs at her feet now and you have only to shine upon himyour fair little cousin will be quite quenched in your beams  philip that is not pretty of you to apply my nonsense to anything real said maggie looking hurt as if i with my old gowns and want of all accomplishments could be a rival of dear little lucywho knows and does all sorts of charming things and is ten times prettier than i ameven if i were odious and base enough to wish to be her rival besides i never go to aunt deanes when any one is there it is only because dear lucy is good and loves me that she comes to see me and will have me go to see her sometimes  maggie said philip with surprise it is not like you to take playfulness literally you must have been in st oggs this morning and brought away a slight infection of dulness  well said maggie smiling if you meant that for a joke it was a poor one but i thought it was a very good reproof i thought you wanted to remind me that i am vain and wish every one to admire me most but it isnt for that that im jealous for the dark womennot because im dark myself its because i always care the most about the unhappy people if the blond girl were forsaken i should like her best i always take the side of the rejected lover in the stories  then you would never have the heart to reject one yourself should you maggie said philip flushing a little  i dont know said maggie hesitatingly then with a bright smile i think perhaps i could if he were very conceited and yet if he got extremely humiliated afterward i should relent  ive often wondered maggie philip said with some effort whether you wouldnt really be more likely to love a man that other women were not likely to love  that would depend on what they didnt like him for said maggie laughing he might be very disagreeable he might look at me through an eyeglass stuck in his eye making a hideous face as young torry does i should think other women are not fond of that but i never felt any pity for young torry ive never any pity for conceited people because i think they carry their comfort about with them  but suppose maggiesuppose it was a man who was not conceited who felt he had nothing to be conceited about who had been marked from childhood for a peculiar kind of suffering and to whom you were the daystar of his life who loved you worshipped you so entirely that he felt it happiness enough for him if you would let him see you at rare moments  philip paused with a pang of dread lest his confession should cut short this very happinessa pang of the same dread that had kept his love mute through long months a rush of selfconsciousness told him that he was besotted to have said all this maggies manner this morning had been as unconstrained and indifferent as ever  but she was not looking indifferent now struck with the unusual emotion in philips tone she had turned quickly to look at him and as he went on speaking a great change came over her facea flush and slight spasm of the features such as we see in people who hear some news that will require them to readjust their conceptions of the past she was quite silent and walking on toward the trunk of a fallen tree she sat down as if she had no strength to spare for her muscles she was trembling  maggie said philip getting more and more alarmed in every fresh moment of silence i was a fool to say it forget that ive said it i shall be contented if things can be as they were  the distress with which he spoke urged maggie to say something i am so surprised philip i had not thought of it and the effort to say this brought the tears down too  has it made you hate me maggie said philip impetuously do you think im a presumptuous fool  oh philip said maggie how can you think i have such feelings as if i were not grateful for any love butbut i had never thought of your being my lover it seemed so far offlike a dreamonly like one of the stories one imaginesthat i should ever have a lover  then can you bear to think of me as your lover maggie said philip seating himself by her and taking her hand in the elation of a sudden hope do you love me  maggie turned rather pale this direct question seemed not easy to answer but her eyes met philips which were in this moment liquid and beautiful with beseeching love she spoke with hesitation yet with sweet simple girlish tenderness  i think i could hardly love any one better there is nothing but what i love you for she paused a little while and then added but it will be better for us not to say any more about it wont it dear philip you know we couldnt even be friends if our friendship were discovered i have never felt that i was right in giving way about seeing you though it has been so precious to me in some ways and now the fear comes upon me strongly again that it will lead to evil  but no evil has come maggie and if you had been guided by that fear before you would only have lived through another dreary benumbing year instead of reviving into your real self  maggie shook her head it has been very sweet i knowall the talking together and the books and the feeling that i had the walk to look forward to when i could tell you the thoughts that had come into my head while i was away from you but it has made me restless it has made me think a great deal about the world and i have impatient thoughts againi get weary of my home and then it cuts me to the heart afterward that i should ever have felt weary of my father and mother i think what you call being benumbed was betterbetter for mefor then my selfish desires were benumbed  philip had risen again and was walking backward and forward impatiently  no maggie you have wrong ideas of selfconquest as ive often told you what you call selfconquestbinding and deafening yourself to all but one train of impressionsis only the culture of monomania in a nature like yours  he had spoken with some irritation but now he sat down by her again and took her hand  dont think of the past now maggie think only of our love if you can really cling to me with all your heart every obstacle will be overcome in time we need only wait i can live on hope look at me maggie tell me again it is possible for you to love me dont look away from me to that cloven tree it is a bad omen  she turned her large dark glance upon him with a sad smile  come maggie say one kind word or else you were better to me at lorton you asked me if i should like you to kiss medont you rememberand you promised to kiss me when you met me again you never kept the promise  the recollection of that childish time came as a sweet relief to maggie it made the present moment less strange to her she kissed him almost as simply and quietly as she had done when she was twelve years old philips eyes flashed with delight but his next words were words of discontent  you dont seem happy enough maggie you are forcing yourself to say you love me out of pity  no philip said maggie shaking her head in her old childish way im telling you the truth it is all new and strange to me but i dont think i could love any one better than i love you i should like always to live with youto make you happy i have always been happy when i have been with you there is only one thing i will not do for your sake i will never do anything to wound my father you must never ask that from me  no maggie i will ask nothing i will bear everything ill wait another year only for a kiss if you will only give me the first place in your heart  no said maggie smiling i wont make you wait so long as that but then looking serious again she added as she rose from her seat  but what would your own father say philip oh it is quite impossible we can ever be more than friendsbrother and sister in secret as we have been let us give up thinking of everything else  no maggie i cant give you upunless you are deceiving me unless you really only care for me as if i were your brother tell me the truth  indeed i do philip what happiness have i ever had so great as being with yousince i was a little girlthe days tom was good to me and your mind is a sort of world to me you can tell me all i want to know i think i should never be tired of being with you  they were walking hand in hand looking at each other maggie indeed was hurrying along for she felt it time to be gone but the sense that their parting was near made her more anxious lest she should have unintentionally left some painful impression on philips mind it was one of those dangerous moments when speech is at once sincere and deceptive when feeling rising high above its average depth leaves floodmarks which are never reached again  they stopped to part among the scotch firs  then my life will be filled with hope maggie and i shall be happier than other men in spite of all we do belong to each otherfor alwayswhether we are apart or together  yes philip i should like never to part i should like to make your life very happy  i am waiting for something else i wonder whether it will come  maggie smiled with glistening tears and then stooped her tall head to kiss the pale face that was full of pleading timid lovelike a womans  she had a moment of real happiness thena moment of belief that if there were sacrifice in this love it was all the richer and more satisfying  she turned away and hurried home feeling that in the hour since she had trodden this road before a new era had begun for her the tissue of vague dreams must now get narrower and narrower and all the threads of thought and emotion be gradually absorbed in the woof of her actual daily life    chapter v  the cloven tree   secrets are rarely betrayed or discovered according to any programme our fear has sketched out fear is almost always haunted by terrible dramatic scenes which recur in spite of the bestargued probabilities against them and during a year that maggie had had the burthen of concealment on her mind the possibility of discovery had continually presented itself under the form of a sudden meeting with her father or tom when she was walking with philip in the red deeps she was aware that this was not one of the most likely events but it was the scene that most completely symbolized her inward dread those slight indirect suggestions which are dependent on apparently trivial coincidences and incalculable states of mind are the favorite machinery of fact but are not the stuff in which imagination is apt to work  certainly one of the persons about whom maggies fears were furthest from troubling themselves was her aunt pullet on whom seeing that she did not live in st oggs and was neither sharpeyed nor sharptempered it would surely have been quite whimsical of them to fix rather than on aunt glegg and yet the channel of fatalitythe pathway of the lightningwas no other than aunt pullet she did not live at st oggs but the road from garum firs lay by the red deeps at the end opposite that by which maggie entered  the day after maggies last meeting with philip being a sunday on which mr pullet was bound to appear in funeral hatband and scarf at st oggs church mrs pullet made this the occasion of dining with sister glegg and taking tea with poor sister tulliver sunday was the one day in the week on which tom was at home in the afternoon and today the brighter spirits he had been in of late had flowed over in unusually cheerful open chat with his father and in the invitation come magsie you come too when he strolled out with his mother in the garden to see the advancing cherryblossoms he had been better pleased with maggie since she had been less odd and ascetic he was even getting rather proud of her several persons had remarked in his hearing that his sister was a very fine girl today there was a peculiar brightness in her face due in reality to an undercurrent of excitement which had as much doubt and pain as pleasure in it but it might pass for a sign of happiness  you look very well my dear said aunt pullet shaking her head sadly as they sat round the teatable i niver thought your girl ud be so goodlooking bessy but you must wear pink my dear that blue thing as your aunt glegg gave you turns you into a crowflower jane never was tasty why dont you wear that gown o mine  it is so pretty and so smart aunt i think its too showy for meat least for my other clothes that i must wear with it  to be sure it ud be unbecoming if it wasnt well known youve got them belonging to you as can afford to give you such things when theyve done with em themselves it stands to reason i must give my own niece clothes now and thensuch things as i buy every year and never wear anything out and as for lucy theres no giving to her for shes got everything o the choicest sister deane may well hold her head upthough she looks dreadful yallow poor thingi doubt this liver complaint ull carry her off thats what this new vicar this dr kenn said in the funeral sermon today  ah hes a wonderful preacher by all accountisnt he sophy said mrs tulliver  why lucy had got a collar on this blessed day continued mrs pullet with her eyes fixed in a ruminating manner as i dont say i havent got as good but i must look out my best to match it  miss lucys called the bell o st oggs they say thats a curous word observed mr pullet on whom the mysteries of etymology sometimes fell with an oppressive weight  pooh said mr tulliver jealous for maggie shes a small thing not much of a figure but fine feathers make fine birds i see nothing to admire so much in those diminutive women they look silly by the side o the menout o proportion when i chose my wife i chose her the right sizeneither too little nor too big  the poor wife with her withered beauty smiled complacently  but the men arent all big said uncle pullet not without some selfreference a young fellow may be goodlooking and yet not be a sixfoot like master tom here  ah its poor talking about littleness and bignessanybody may think its a mercy theyre straight said aunt pullet theres that mismade son o lawyer wakems i saw him at church today dear dear to think o the property hes like to have and they say hes very queer and lonely doesnt like much company i shouldnt wonder if he goes out of his mind for we never come along the road but hes ascrambling out o the trees and brambles at the red deeps  this wide statement by which mrs pullet represented the fact that she had twice seen philip at the spot indicated produced an effect on maggie which was all the stronger because tom sate opposite her and she was intensely anxious to look indifferent at philips name she had blushed and the blush deepened every instant from consciousness until the mention of the red deeps made her feel as if the whole secret were betrayed and she dared not even hold her teaspoon lest she should show how she trembled she sat with her hands clasped under the table not daring to look round happily her father was seated on the same side with herself beyond her uncle pullet and could not see her face without stooping forward her mothers voice brought the first relief turning the conversation for mrs tulliver was always alarmed when the name of wakem was mentioned in her husbands presence gradually maggie recovered composure enough to look up her eyes met toms but he turned away his head immediately and she went to bed that night wondering if he had gathered any suspicion from her confusion perhaps not perhaps he would think it was only her alarm at her aunts mention of wakem before her father that was the interpretation her mother had put in it to her father wakem was like a disfiguring disease of which he was obliged to endure the consciousness but was exasperated to have the existence recognized by others and no amount of sensitiveness in her about her father could be surprising maggie thought  but tom was too keensighted to rest satisfied with such an interpretation he had seen clearly enough that there was something distinct from anxiety about her father in maggies excessive confusion in trying to recall all the details that could give shape to his suspicions he remembered only lately hearing his mother scold maggie for walking in the red deeps when the ground was wet and bringing home shoes clogged with red soil still tom retaining all his old repulsion for philips deformity shrank from attributing to his sister the probability of feeling more than a friendly interest in such an unfortunate exception to the common run of men toms was a nature which had a sort of superstitious repugnance to everything exceptional a love for a deformed man would be odious in any woman in a sister intolerable but if she had been carrying on any kind of intercourse whatever with philip a stop must be put to it at once she was disobeying her fathers strongest feelings and her brothers express commands besides compromising herself by secret meetings he left home the next morning in that watchful state of mind which turns the most ordinary course of things into pregnant coincidences  that afternoon about halfpast three oclock tom was standing on the wharf talking with bob jakin about the probability of the good ship adelaide coming in in a day or two with results highly important to both of them  eh said bob parenthetically as he looked over the fields on the other side of the river there goes that crooked young wakem i know him or his shadder as far off as i can see em im allays lighting on him o that side the river  a sudden thought seemed to have darted through toms mind i must go bob he said ive something to attend to hurrying off to the warehouse where he left notice for some one to take his place he was called away home on peremptory business  the swiftest pace and the shortest road took him to the gate and he was pausing to open it deliberately that he might walk into the house with an appearance of perfect composure when maggie came out at the front door in bonnet and shawl his conjecture was fulfilled and he waited for her at the gate she started violently when she saw him  tom how is it you are come home is there anything the matter maggie spoke in a low tremulous voice  im come to walk with you to the red deeps and meet philip wakem said tom the central fold in his brow which had become habitual with him deepening as he spoke  maggie stood helpless pale and cold by some means then tom knew everything at last she said im not going and turned round  yes you are but i want to speak to you first where is my father  out on horseback  and my mother  in the yard i think with the poultry  i can go in then without her seeing me  they walked in together and tom entering the parlor said to maggie come in here  she obeyed and he closed the door behind her  now maggie tell me this instant everything that has passed between you and philip wakem  does my father know anything said maggie still trembling  no said tom indignantly but he shall know if you attempt to use deceit toward me any further  i dont wish to use deceit said maggie flushing into resentment at hearing this word applied to her conduct  tell me the whole truth then  perhaps you know it  never mind whether i know it or not tell me exactly what has happened or my father shall know everything  i tell it for my fathers sake then  yes it becomes you to profess affection for your father when you have despised his strongest feelings  you never do wrong tom said maggie tauntingly  not if i know it answered tom with proud sincerity  but i have nothing to say to you beyond this tell me what has passed between you and philip wakem when did you first meet him in the red deeps  a year ago said maggie quietly toms severity gave her a certain fund of defiance and kept her sense of error in abeyance you need ask me no more questions we have been friendly a year we have met and walked together often he has lent me books  is that all said tom looking straight at her with his frown  maggie paused a moment then determined to make an end of toms right to accuse her of deceit she said haughtily  no not quite all on saturday he told me that he loved me i didnt think of it before then i had only thought of him as an old friend  and you encouraged him said tom with an expression of disgust  i told him that i loved him too  tom was silent a few moments looking on the ground and frowning with his hands in his pockets at last he looked up and said coldly  now then maggie there are but two courses for you to takeeither you vow solemnly to me with your hand on my fathers bible that you will never have another meeting or speak another word in private with philip wakem or you refuse and i tell my father everything and this month when by my exertions he might be made happy once more you will cause him the blow of knowing that you are a disobedient deceitful daughter who throws away her own respectability by clandestine meetings with the son of a man that has helped to ruin her father choose tom ended with cold decision going up to the large bible drawing it forward and opening it at the flyleaf where the writing was  it was a crushing alternative to maggie  tom she said urged out of pride into pleading dont ask me that i will promise you to give up all intercourse with philip if you will let me see him once or even only write to him and explain everythingto give it up as long as it would ever cause any pain to my father i feel something for philip too he is not happy  i dont wish to hear anything of your feelings i have said exactly what i mean choose and quickly lest my mother should come in  if i give you my word that will be as strong a bond to me as if i laid my hand on the bible i dont require that to bind me  do what i require said tom i cant trust you maggie there is no consistency in you put your hand on this bible and say i renounce all private speech and intercourse with philip wakem from this time forth else you will bring shame on us all and grief on my father and what is the use of my exerting myself and giving up everything else for the sake of paying my fathers debts if you are to bring madness and vexation on him just when he might be easy and hold up his head once more  oh tom will the debts be paid soon said maggie clasping her hands with a sudden flash of joy across her wretchedness  if things turn out as i expect said tom but he added his voice trembling with indignation while i have been contriving and working that my father may have some peace of mind before he diesworking for the respectability of our familyyou have done all you can to destroy both  maggie felt a deep movement of compunction for the moment her mind ceased to contend against what she felt to be cruel and unreasonable and in her selfblame she justified her brother  tom she said in a low voice it was wrong of me but i was so lonely and i was sorry for philip and i think enmity and hatred are wicked  nonsense said tom your duty was clear enough say no more but promise in the words i told you  i must speak to philip once more  you will go with me now and speak to him  i give you my word not to meet him or write to him again without your knowledge that is the only thing i will say i will put my hand on the bible if you like  say it then  maggie laid her hand on the page of manuscript and repeated the promise tom closed the book and said now let us go  not a word was spoken as they walked along maggie was suffering in anticipation of what philip was about to suffer and dreading the galling words that would fall on him from toms lips but she felt it was in vain to attempt anything but submission tom had his terrible clutch on her conscience and her deepest dread she writhed under the demonstrable truth of the character he had given to her conduct and yet her whole soul rebelled against it as unfair from its incompleteness he meanwhile felt the impetus of his indignation diverted toward philip he did not know how much of an old boyish repulsion and of mere personal pride and animosity was concerned in the bitter severity of the words by which he meant to do the duty of a son and a brother tom was not given to inquire subtly into his own motives any more than into other matters of an intangible kind he was quite sure that his own motives as well as actions were good else he would have had nothing to do with them  maggies only hope was that something might for the first time have prevented philip from coming then there would be delaythen she might get toms permission to write to him her heart beat with double violence when they got under the scotch firs it was the last moment of suspense she thought philip always met her soon after she got beyond them but they passed across the more open green space and entered the narrow bushy path by the mound another turning and they came so close upon him that both tom and philip stopped suddenly within a yard of each other there was a moments silence in which philip darted a look of inquiry at maggies face he saw an answer there in the pale parted lips and the terrified tension of the large eyes her imagination always rushing extravagantly beyond an immediate impression saw her tall strong brother grasping the feeble philip bodily crushing him and trampling on him  do you call this acting the part of a man and a gentleman sir tom said in a voice of harsh scorn as soon as philips eyes were turned on him again  what do you mean answered philip haughtily  mean stand farther from me lest i should lay hands on you and ill tell you what i mean i mean taking advantage of a young girls foolishness and ignorance to get her to have secret meetings with you i mean daring to trifle with the respectability of a family that has a good and honest name to support  i deny that interrupted philip impetuously i could never trifle with anything that affected your sisters happiness she is dearer to me than she is to you i honor her more than you can ever honor her i would give up my life to her  dont talk highflown nonsense to me sir do you mean to pretend that you didnt know it would be injurious to her to meet you here week after week do you pretend you had any right to make professions of love to her even if you had been a fit husband for her when neither her father nor your father would ever consent to a marriage between you and youyou to try and worm yourself into the affections of a handsome girl who is not eighteen and has been shut out from the world by her fathers misfortunes thats your crooked notion of honor is it i call it base treachery i call it taking advantage of circumstances to win whats too good for youwhat youd never get by fair means  it is manly of you to talk in this way to me said philip bitterly his whole frame shaken by violent emotions giants have an immemorial right to stupidity and insolent abuse you are incapable even of understanding what i feel for your sister i feel so much for her that i could even desire to be at friendship with you  i should be very sorry to understand your feelings said tom with scorching contempt what i wish is that you should understand methat i shall take care of my sister and that if you dare to make the least attempt to come near her or to write to her or to keep the slightest hold on her mind your puny miserable body that ought to have put some modesty into your mind shall not protect you ill thrash you ill hold you up to public scorn who wouldnt laugh at the idea of your turning lover to a fine girl  tom and maggie walked on in silence for some yards he burst out in a convulsed voice  stay maggie said philip making a strong effort to speak then looking at tom you have dragged your sister here i suppose that she may stand by while you threaten and insult me these naturally seemed to you the right means to influence me but you are mistaken let your sister speak if she says she is bound to give me up i shall abide by her wishes to the slightest word  it was for my fathers sake philip said maggie imploringly tom threatens to tell my father and he couldnt bear it i have promised i have vowed solemnly that we will not have any intercourse without my brothers knowledge  it is enough maggie i shall not change but i wish you to hold yourself entirely free but trust me remember that i can never seek for anything but good to what belongs to you  yes said tom exasperated by this attitude of philips you can talk of seeking good for her and what belongs to her now did you seek her good before  i didat some risk perhaps but i wished her to have a friend for lifewho would cherish her who would do her more justice than a coarse and narrowminded brother that she has always lavished her affections on  yes my way of befriending her is different from yours and ill tell you what is my way ill save her from disobeying and disgracing her father ill save her from throwing herself away on youfrom making herself a laughingstockfrom being flouted by a man like your father because shes not good enough for his son you know well enough what sort of justice and cherishing you were preparing for her im not to be imposed upon by fine words i can see what actions mean come away maggie  he seized maggies right wrist as he spoke and she put out her left hand philip clasped it an instant with one eager look and then hurried away  tom and maggie walked on in silence for some yards he was still holding her wrist tightly as if he were compelling a culprit from the scene of action at last maggie with a violent snatch drew her hand away and her pentup longgathered irritation burst into utterance  dont suppose that i think you are right tom or that i bow to your will i despise the feelings you have shown in speaking to philip i detest your insulting unmanly allusions to his deformity you have been reproaching other people all your life you have been always sure you yourself are right it is because you have not a mind large enough to see that there is anything better than your own conduct and your own petty aims  certainly said tom coolly i dont see that your conduct is better or your aims either if your conduct and philip wakems conduct has been right why are you ashamed of its being known answer me that i know what i have aimed at in my conduct and ive succeeded pray what good has your conduct brought to you or any one else  i dont want to defend myself said maggie still with vehemence i know ive been wrongoften continually but yet sometimes when i have done wrong it has been because i have feelings that you would be the better for if you had them if you were in fault ever if you had done anything very wrong i should be sorry for the pain it brought you i should not want punishment to be heaped on you but you have always enjoyed punishing me you have always been hard and cruel to me even when i was a little girl and always loved you better than any one else in the world you would let me go crying to bed without forgiving me you have no pity you have no sense of your own imperfection and your own sins it is a sin to be hard it is not fitting for a mortal for a christian you are nothing but a pharisee you thank god for nothing but your own virtues you think they are great enough to win you everything else you have not even a vision of feelings by the side of which your shining virtues are mere darkness  well said tom with cold scorn if your feelings are so much better than mine let me see you show them in some other way than by conduct thats likely to disgrace us allthan by ridiculous flights first into one extreme and then into another pray how have you shown your love that you talk of either to me or my father by disobeying and deceiving us i have a different way of showing my affection  because you are a man tom and have power and can do something in the world  then if you can do nothing submit to those that can  so i will submit to what i acknowledge and feel to be right i will submit even to what is unreasonable from my father but i will not submit to it from you you boast of your virtues as if they purchased you a right to be cruel and unmanly as youve been today dont suppose i would give up philip wakem in obedience to you the deformity you insult would make me cling to him and care for him the more  very well that is your view of things said tom more coldly than ever you need say no more to show me what a wide distance there is between us let us remember that in future and be silent  tom went back to st oggs to fulfill an appointment with his uncle deane and receive directions about a journey on which he was to set out the next morning  maggie went up to her own room to pour out all that indignant remonstrance against which toms mind was close barred in bitter tears then when the first burst of unsatisfied anger was gone by came the recollection of that quiet time before the pleasure which had ended in todays misery had perturbed the clearness and simplicity of her life she used to think in that time that she had made great conquests and won a lasting stand on serene heights above worldly temptations and conflict and here she was down again in the thick of a hot strife with her own and others passions life was not so short then and perfect rest was not so near as she had dreamed when she was two years younger there was more struggle for her and perhaps more falling if she had felt that she was entirely wrong and that tom had been entirely right she could sooner have recovered more inward harmony but now her penitence and submission were constantly obstructed by resentment that would present itself to her no otherwise than as a just indignation her heart bled for philip she went on recalling the insults that had been flung at him with so vivid a conception of what he had felt under them that it was almost like a sharp bodily pain to her making her beat the floor with her foot and tighten her fingers on her palm  and yet how was it that she was now and then conscious of a certain dim background of relief in the forced separation from philip surely it was only because the sense of a deliverance from concealment was welcome at any cost    chapter vi  the hardwon triumph   three weeks later when dorlcote mill was at its prettiest moment in all the yearthe great chestnuts in blossom and the grass all deep and daisiedtom tulliver came home to it earlier than usual in the evening and as he passed over the bridge he looked with the old deeprooted affection at the respectable red brick house which always seemed cheerful and inviting outside let the rooms be as bare and the hearts as sad as they might inside there is a very pleasant light in toms bluegray eyes as he glances at the housewindows that fold in his brow never disappears but it is not unbecoming it seems to imply a strength of will that may possibly be without harshness when the eyes and mouth have their gentlest expression his firm step becomes quicker and the corners of his mouth rebel against the compression which is meant to forbid a smile  the eyes in the parlor were not turned toward the bridge just then and the group there was sitting in unexpectant silencemr tulliver in his armchair tired with a long ride and ruminating with a worn look fixed chiefly on maggie who was bending over her sewing while her mother was making the tea  they all looked up with surprise when they heard the wellknown foot  why whats up now tom said his father youre a bit earlier than usual  oh there was nothing more for me to do so i came away well mother  tom went up to his mother and kissed her a sign of unusual goodhumor with him hardly a word or look had passed between him and maggie in all the three weeks but his usual incommunicativeness at home prevented this from being noticeable to their parents  father said tom when they had finished tea do you know exactly how much money there is in the tin box  only a hundred and ninetythree pound said mr tulliver youve brought less o late but young fellows like to have their own way with their money though i didnt do as i liked before i was of age he spoke with rather timid discontent  are you quite sure thats the sum father said tom i wish you would take the trouble to fetch the tin box down i think you have perhaps made a mistake  how should i make a mistake said his father sharply ive counted it often enough but i can fetch it if you wont believe me  it was always an incident mr tulliver liked in his gloomy life to fetch the tin box and count the money  dont go out of the room mother said tom as he saw her moving when his father was gone upstairs  and isnt maggie to go said mrs tulliver because somebody must take away the things  just as she likes said tom indifferently  that was a cutting word to maggie her heart had leaped with the sudden conviction that tom was going to tell their father the debts could be paid and tom would have let her be absent when that news was told but she carried away the tray and came back immediately the feeling of injury on her own behalf could not predominate at that moment  tom drew to the corner of the table near his father when the tin box was set down and opened and the red evening light falling on them made conspicuous the worn sour gloom of the darkeyed father and the suppressed joy in the face of the faircomplexioned son the mother and maggie sat at the other end of the table the one in blank patience the other in palpitating expectation  mr tulliver counted out the money setting it in order on the table and then said glancing sharply at tom  there now you see i was right enough  he paused looking at the money with bitter despondency  theres more nor three hundred wanting itll be a fine while before i can save that losing that fortytwo pound wi the corn was a sore job this worlds been too many for me its took four year to lay this by its much if im above ground for another four year i must trusten to you to pay em he went on with a trembling voice if you keep i the same mind now youre coming o age but youre like enough to bury me first  he looked up in toms face with a querulous desire for some assurance  no father said tom speaking with energetic decision though there was tremor discernible in his voice too you will live to see the debts all paid you shall pay them with your own hand  his tone implied something more than mere hopefulness or resolution a slight electric shock seemed to pass through mr tulliver and he kept his eyes fixed on tom with a look of eager inquiry while maggie unable to restrain herself rushed to her fathers side and knelt down by him tom was silent a little while before he went on  a good while ago my uncle glegg lent me a little money to trade with and that has answered i have three hundred and twenty pounds in the bank  his mothers arms were round his neck as soon as the last words were uttered and she said half crying  oh my boy i knew youd make iverything right again when you got a man  but his father was silent the flood of emotion hemmed in all power of speech both tom and maggie were struck with fear lest the shock of joy might even be fatal but the blessed relief of tears came the broad chest heaved the muscles of the face gave way and the grayhaired man burst into loud sobs the fit of weeping gradually subsided and he sat quiet recovering the regularity of his breathing at last he looked up at his wife and said in a gentle tone  bessy you must come and kiss me nowthe lad has made you amends youll see a bit o comfort again belike  when she had kissed him and he had held her hand a minute his thoughts went back to the money  i wish youd brought me the money to look at tom he said fingering the sovereigns on the table i should ha felt surer  you shall see it tomorrow father said tom my uncle deane has appointed the creditors to meet tomorrow at the golden lion and he has ordered a dinner for them at two oclock my uncle glegg and he will both be there it was advertised in the messenger on saturday  then wakem knows ont said mr tulliver his eye kindling with triumphant fire ah he went on with a longdrawn guttural enunciation taking out his snuffbox the only luxury he had left himself and tapping it with something of his old air of defiance ill get from under his thumb now though i must leave the old mill i thought i could ha held out to die herebut i cantweve got a glass o nothing in the house have we bessy  yes said mrs tulliver drawing out her muchreduced bunch of keys theres some brandy sister deane brought me when i was ill  get it me then get it me i feel a bit weak  tom my lad he said in a stronger voice when he had taken some brandyandwater you shall make a speech to em ill tell em its you as got the best part o the money theyll see im honest at last and ha got an honest son ah wakem ud be fine and glad to have a son like minea fine straight fellowistead o that poor crooked creatur youll prosper i the world my lad youll maybe see the day when wakem and his son ull be a round or two below you youll like enough be taen into partnership as your uncle deane was before youyoure in the right way fort and then theres nothing to hinder your getting rich and if ever youre rich enoughmind thistry and get th old mill again  mr tulliver threw himself back in his chair his mind which had so long been the home of nothing but bitter discontent and foreboding suddenly filled by the magic of joy with visions of good fortune but some subtle influence prevented him from foreseeing the good fortune as happening to himself  shake hands wi me my lad he said suddenly putting out his hand its a great thing when a man can be proud as hes got a good son ive had that luck  tom never lived to taste another moment so delicious as that and maggie couldnt help forgetting her own grievances tom was good and in the sweet humility that springs in us all in moments of true admiration and gratitude she felt that the faults he had to pardon in her had never been redeemed as his faults were she felt no jealousy this evening that for the first time she seemed to be thrown into the background in her fathers mind  there was much more talk before bedtime mr tulliver naturally wanted to hear all the particulars of toms trading adventures and he listened with growing excitement and delight he was curious to know what had been said on every occasion if possible what had been thought and bob jakins part in the business threw him into peculiar outbursts of sympathy with the triumphant knowingness of that remarkable packman bobs juvenile history so far as it had come under mr tullivers knowledge was recalled with that sense of astonishing promise it displayed which is observable in all reminiscences of the childhood of great men  it was well that there was this interest of narrative to keep under the vague but fierce sense of triumph over wakem which would otherwise have been the channel his joy would have rushed into with dangerous force even as it was that feeling from time to time gave threats of its ultimate mastery in sudden bursts of irrelevant exclamation  it was long before mr tulliver got to sleep that night and the sleep when it came was filled with vivid dreams at halfpast five oclock in the morning when mrs tulliver was already rising he alarmed her by starting up with a sort of smothered shout and looking round in a bewildered way at the walls of the bedroom  whats the matter mr tulliver said his wife he looked at her still with a puzzled expression and said at last  ahi was dreamingdid i make a noisei thought id got hold of him    chapter vii  a day of reckoning   mr tulliver was an essentially sober manable to take his glass and not averse to it but never exceeding the bounds of moderation he had naturally an active hotspur temperament which did not crave liquid fire to set it aglow his impetuosity was usually equal to an exciting occasion without any such reinforcements and his desire for the brandyandwater implied that the too sudden joy had fallen with a dangerous shock on a frame depressed by four years of gloom and unaccustomed hard fare but that first doubtful tottering moment passed he seemed to gather strength with his gathering excitement and the next day when he was seated at table with his creditors his eye kindling and his cheek flushed with the consciousness that he was about to make an honorable figure once more he looked more like the proud confident warmhearted and warmtempered tulliver of old times than might have seemed possible to any one who had met him a week before riding along as had been his wont for the last four years since the sense of failure and debt had been upon himwith his head hanging down casting brief unwilling looks on those who forced themselves on his notice he made his speech asserting his honest principles with his old confident eagerness alluding to the rascals and the luck that had been against him but that he had triumphed over to some extent by hard efforts and the aid of a good son and winding up with the story of how tom had got the best part of the needful money but the streak of irritation and hostile triumph seemed to melt for a little while into purer fatherly pride and pleasure when toms health having been proposed and uncle deane having taken occasion to say a few words of eulogy on his general character and conduct tom himself got up and made the single speech of his life it could hardly have been briefer he thanked the gentlemen for the honor they had done him he was glad that he had been able to help his father in proving his integrity and regaining his honest name and for his own part he hoped he should never undo that work and disgrace that name but the applause that followed was so great and tom looked so gentlemanly as well as tall and straight that mr tulliver remarked in an explanatory manner to his friends on his right and left that he had spent a deal of money on his sons education  the party broke up in very sober fashion at five oclock tom remained in st oggs to attend to some business and mr tulliver mounted his horse to go home and describe the memorable things that had been said and done to poor bessy and the little wench the air of excitement that hung about him was but faintly due to good cheer or any stimulus but the potent wine of triumphant joy he did not choose any back street today but rode slowly with uplifted head and free glances along the principal street all the way to the bridge  why did he not happen to meet wakem the want of that coincidence vexed him and set his mind at work in an irritating way perhaps wakem was gone out of town today on purpose to avoid seeing or hearing anything of an honorable action which might well cause him some unpleasant twinges if wakem were to meet him then mr tulliver would look straight at him and the rascal would perhaps be forsaken a little by his cool domineering impudence he would know by and by that an honest man was not going to serve him any longer and lend his honesty to fill a pocket already overfull of dishonest gains perhaps the luck was beginning to turn perhaps the devil didnt always hold the best cards in this world  simmering in this way mr tulliver approached the yardgates of dorlcote mill near enough to see a wellknown figure coming out of them on a fine black horse they met about fifty yards from the gates between the great chestnuts and elms and the high bank  tulliver said wakem abruptly in a haughtier tone than usual what a fools trick you didspreading those hard lumps on that far close i told you how it would be but you men never learn to farm with any method  oh said tulliver suddenly boiling up get somebody else to farm for you then asll ask you to teach him  you have been drinking i suppose said wakem really believing that this was the meaning of tullivers flushed face and sparkling eyes  no ive not been drinking said tulliver i want no drinking to help me make up my mind as ill serve no longer under a scoundrel  very well you may leave my premises tomorrow then hold your insolent tongue and let me pass tulliver was backing his horse across the road to hem wakem in  no i shant let you pass said tulliver getting fiercer i shall tell you what i think of you first youre too big a raskill to get hangedyoure  let me pass you ignorant brute or ill ride over you  mr tulliver spurring his horse and raising his whip made a rush forward and wakems horse rearing and staggering backward threw his rider from the saddle and sent him sideways on the ground wakem had had the presence of mind to loose the bridle at once and as the horse only staggered a few paces and then stood still he might have risen and remounted without more inconvenience than a bruise and a shake but before he could rise tulliver was off his horse too the sight of the longhated predominant man down and in his power threw him into a frenzy of triumphant vengeance which seemed to give him preternatural agility and strength he rushed on wakem who was in the act of trying to recover his feet grasped him by the left arm so as to press wakems whole weight on the right arm which rested on the ground and flogged him fiercely across the back with his ridingwhip wakem shouted for help but no help came until a womans scream was heard and the cry of father father  suddenly wakem felt something had arrested mr tullivers arm for the flogging ceased and the grasp on his own arm was relaxed  get away with yougo said tulliver angrily but it was not to wakem that he spoke slowly the lawyer rose and as he turned his head saw that tullivers arms were being held by a girl rather by the fear of hurting the girl that clung to him with all her young might  oh lukemothercome and help mr wakem maggie cried as she heard the longedfor footsteps  help me on to that low horse said wakem to luke then i shall perhaps manage thoughconfound iti think this arm is sprained  with some difficulty wakem was heaved on to tullivers horse then he turned toward the miller and said with white rage youll suffer for this sir your daughter is a witness that youve assaulted me  i dont care said mr tulliver in a thick fierce voice go and show your back and tell em i thrashed you tell em ive made things a bit more even i the world  ride my horse home with me said wakem to luke by the tofton ferry not through the town  father come in said maggie imploringly then seeing that wakem had ridden off and that no further violence was possible she slackened her hold and burst into hysteric sobs while poor mrs tulliver stood by in silence quivering with fear but maggie became conscious that as she was slackening her hold her father was beginning to grasp her and lean on her the surprise checked her sobs  i feel illfaintish he said help me in bessyim giddyive a pain i the head  he walked in slowly propped by his wife and daughter and tottered into his armchair the almost purple flush had given way to paleness and his hand was cold  hadnt we better send for the doctor said mrs tulliver  he seemed to be too faint and suffering to hear her but presently when she said to maggie go and seek for somebody to fetch the doctor he looked up at her with full comprehension and said doctor nono doctor its my head thats all help me to bed  sad ending to the day that had risen on them all like a beginning of better times but mingled seed must bear a mingled crop  in half an hour after his father had lain down tom came home bob jakin was with him come to congratulate the old master not without some excusable pride that he had had his share in bringing about mr toms good luck and tom had thought his father would like nothing better as a finish to the day than a talk with bob but now tom could only spend the evening in gloomy expectation of the unpleasant consequences that must follow on this mad outbreak of his fathers longsmothered hate after the painful news had been told he sat in silence he had not spirit or inclination to tell his mother and sister anything about the dinner they hardly cared to ask it apparently the mingled thread in the web of their life was so curiously twisted together that there could be no joy without a sorrow coming close upon it tom was dejected by the thought that his exemplary effort must always be baffled by the wrongdoing of others maggie was living through over and over again the agony of the moment in which she had rushed to throw herself on her fathers arm with a vague shuddering foreboding of wretched scenes to come not one of the three felt any particular alarm about mr tullivers health the symptoms did not recall his former dangerous attack and it seemed only a necessary consequence that his violent passion and effort of strength after many hours of unusual excitement should have made him feel ill rest would probably cure him  tom tired out by his active day fell asleep soon and slept soundly it seemed to him as if he had only just come to bed when he waked to see his mother standing by him in the gray light of early morning  my boy you must get up this minute ive sent for the doctor and your father wants you and maggie to come to him  is he worse mother  hes been very ill all night with his head but he doesnt say its worse he only said suddenly bessy fetch the boy and girl tell em to make haste  maggie and tom threw on their clothes hastily in the chill gray light and reached their fathers room almost at the same moment he was watching for them with an expression of pain on his brow but with sharpened anxious consciousness in his eyes mrs tulliver stood at the foot of the bed frightened and trembling looking worn and aged from disturbed rest maggie was at the bedside first but her fathers glance was toward tom who came and stood next to her  tom my lad its come upon me as i shant get up again this worlds been too many for me my lad but youve done what you could to make things a bit even shake hands wi me again my lad before i go away from you  the father and son clasped hands and looked at each other an instant then tom said trying to speak firmly  have you any wish fatherthat i can fulfil when  ay my ladyoull try and get the old mill back  yes father  and theres your motheryoull try and make her amends all you can for my bad luckand theres the little wench  the father turned his eyes on maggie with a still more eager look while she with a bursting heart sank on her knees to be closer to the dear timeworn face which had been present with her through long years as the sign of her deepest love and hardest trial  you must take care of her tomdont you fret my wenchtherell come somebody asll love you and take your partand you must be good to her my lad i was good to my sister kiss me maggiecome bessyyoull manage to pay for a brick grave tom so as your mother and me can lie together  he looked away from them all when he had said this and lay silent for some minutes while they stood watching him not daring to move the morning light was growing clearer for them and they could see the heaviness gathering in his face and the dulness in his eyes but at last he looked toward tom and said  i had my turni beat him that was nothing but fair i never wanted anything but what was fair  but father dear father said maggie an unspeakable anxiety predominating over her grief you forgive himyou forgive every one now  he did not move his eyes to look at her but he said  no my wench i dont forgive him whats forgiving to do i cant love a raskill  his voice had become thicker but he wanted to say more and moved his lips again and again struggling in vain to speak at length the words forced their way  does god forgive raskillsbut if he does he wont be hard wi me  his hands moved uneasily as if he wanted them to remove some obstruction that weighed upon him two or three times there fell from him some broken words  this worldstoo manyhonest manpuzzling  soon they merged into mere mutterings the eyes had ceased to discern and then came the final silence  but not of death for an hour or more the chest heaved the loud hard breathing continued getting gradually slower as the cold dews gathered on the brow  at last there was total stillness and poor tullivers dimly lighted soul had forever ceased to be vexed with the painful riddle of this world  help was come now luke and his wife were there and mr turnbull had arrived too late for everything but to say this is death  tom and maggie went downstairs together into the room where their fathers place was empty their eyes turned to the same spot and maggie spoke  tom forgive melet us always love each other and they clung and wept together     book vi  the great temptation    chapter i  a duet in paradise   the wellfurnished drawingroom with the open grand piano and the pleasant outlook down a sloping garden to a boathouse by the side of the floss is mr deanes the neat little lady in mourning whose lightbrown ringlets are falling over the colored embroidery with which her fingers are busy is of course lucy deane and the fine young man who is leaning down from his chair to snap the scissors in the extremely abbreviated face of the king charles lying on the young ladys feet is no other than mr stephen guest whose diamond ring attar of roses and air of nonchalant leisure at twelve oclock in the day are the graceful and odoriferous result of the largest oilmill and the most extensive wharf in st oggs there is an apparent triviality in the action with the scissors but your discernment perceives at once that there is a design in it which makes it eminently worthy of a largeheaded longlimbed young man for you see that lucy wants the scissors and is compelled reluctant as she may be to shake her ringlets back raise her soft hazel eyes smile playfully down on the face that is so very nearly on a level with her knee and holding out her little shellpink palm to say  my scissors please if you can renounce the great pleasure of persecuting my poor minny  the foolish scissors have slipped too far over the knuckles it seems and hercules holds out his entrapped fingers hopelessly  confound the scissors the oval lies the wrong way please draw them off for me  draw them off with your other hand says miss lucy roguishly  oh but thats my left hand im not lefthanded  lucy laughs and the scissors are drawn off with gentle touches from tiny tips which naturally dispose mr stephen for a repetition da capo accordingly he watches for the release of the scissors that he may get them into his possession again  no no said lucy sticking them in her band you shall not have my scissors againyou have strained them already now dont set minny growling again sit up and behave properly and then i will tell you some news  what is that said stephen throwing himself back and hanging his right arm over the corner of his chair he might have been sitting for his portrait which would have represented a rather striking young man of fiveandtwenty with a square forehead short darkbrown hair standing erect with a slight wave at the end like a thick crop of corn and a halfardent halfsarcastic glance from under his wellmarked horizontal eyebrows is it very important news  yes very guess  you are going to change minnys diet and give him three ratafias soaked in a dessertspoonful of cream daily  quite wrong  well then dr kenn has been preaching against buckram and you ladies have all been sending him a roundrobin saying this is a hard doctrine who can bear it  for shame said lucy adjusting her little mouth gravely it is rather dull of you not to guess my news because it is about something i mentioned to you not very long ago  but you have mentioned many things to me not long ago does your feminine tyranny require that when you say the thing you mean is one of several things i should know it immediately by that mark  yes i know you think i am silly  i think you are perfectly charming  and my silliness is part of my charm  i didnt say that  but i know you like women to be rather insipid philip wakem betrayed you he said so one day when you were not here  oh i know phil is fierce on that point he makes it quite a personal matter i think he must be lovesick for some unknown ladysome exalted beatrice whom he met abroad  by the by said lucy pausing in her work it has just occurred to me that i never found out whether my cousin maggie will object to see philip as her brother does tom will not enter a room where philip is if he knows it perhaps maggie may be the same and then we shant be able to sing our glees shall we  what is your cousin coming to stay with you said stephen with a look of slight annoyance  yes that was my news which you have forgotten shes going to leave her situation where she has been nearly two years poor thingever since her fathers death and she will stay with me a month or twomany months i hope  and am i bound to be pleased at that news  oh no not at all said lucy with a little air of pique i am pleased but that of course is no reason why you should be pleased there is no girl in the world i love so well as my cousin maggie  and you will be inseparable i suppose when she comes there will be no possibility of a têteàtête with you any more unless you can find an admirer for her who will pair off with her occasionally what is the ground of dislike to philip he might have been a resource  it is a family quarrel with philips father there were very painful circumstances i believe i never quite understood them or knew them all my uncle tulliver was unfortunate and lost all his property and i think he considered mr wakem was somehow the cause of it mr wakem bought dorlcote mill my uncles old place where he always lived you must remember my uncle tulliver dont you  no said stephen with rather supercilious indifference ive always known the name and i dare say i knew the man by sight apart from his name i know half the names and faces in the neighborhood in that detached disjointed way  he was a very hottempered man i remember when i was a little girl and used to go to see my cousins he often frightened me by talking as if he were angry papa told me there was a dreadful quarrel the very day before my uncles death between him and mr wakem but it was hushed up that was when you were in london papa says my uncle was quite mistaken in many ways his mind had become embittered but tom and maggie must naturally feel it very painful to be reminded of these things they have had so much so very much trouble maggie was at school with me six years ago when she was fetched away because of her fathers misfortunes and she has hardly had any pleasure since i think she has been in a dreary situation in a school since uncles death because she is determined to be independent and not live with aunt pullet and i could hardly wish her to come to me then because dear mamma was ill and everything was so sad that is why i want her to come to me now and have a long long holiday  very sweet and angelic of you said stephen looking at her with an admiring smile and all the more so if she has the conversational qualities of her mother  poor aunty you are cruel to ridicule her she is very valuable to me i know she manages the house beautifullymuch better than any stranger wouldand she was a great comfort to me in mammas illness  yes but in point of companionship one would prefer that she should be represented by her brandycherries and creamcakes i think with a shudder that her daughter will always be present in person and have no agreeable proxies of that kinda fat blond girl with round blue eyes who will stare at us silently  oh yes exclaimed lucy laughing wickedly and clapping her hands that is just my cousin maggie you must have seen her  no indeed im only guessing what mrs tullivers daughter must be and then if she is to banish philip our only apology for a tenor that will be an additional bore  but i hope that may not be i think i will ask you to call on philip and tell him maggie is coming tomorrow he is quite aware of toms feeling and always keeps out of his way so he will understand if you tell him that i asked you to warn him not to come until i write to ask him  i think you had better write a pretty note for me to take phil is so sensitive you know the least thing might frighten him off coming at all and we had hard work to get him i can never induce him to come to the park he doesnt like my sisters i think it is only your faëry touch that can lay his ruffled feathers  stephen mastered the little hand that was straying toward the table and touched it lightly with his lips little lucy felt very proud and happy she and stephen were in that stage of courtship which makes the most exquisite moment of youth the freshest blossomtime of passionwhen each is sure of the others love but no formal declaration has been made and all is mutual divination exalting the most trivial word the lightest gesture into thrills delicate and delicious as wafted jasmine scent the explicitness of an engagement wears off this finest edge of susceptibility it is jasmine gathered and presented in a large bouquet  but it is really odd that you should have hit so exactly on maggies appearance and manners said the cunning lucy moving to reach her desk because she might have been like her brother you know and tom has not round eyes and he is as far as possible from staring at people  oh i suppose he is like the father he seems to be as proud as lucifer not a brilliant companion though i should think  i like tom he gave me my minny when i lost lolo and papa is very fond of him he says tom has excellent principles it was through him that his father was able to pay all his debts before he died  oh ah ive heard about that i heard your father and mine talking about it a little while ago after dinner in one of their interminable discussions about business they think of doing something for young tulliver he saved them from a considerable loss by riding home in some marvellous way like turpin to bring them news about the stoppage of a bank or something of that sort but i was rather drowsy at the time  stephen rose from his seat and sauntered to the piano humming in falsetto graceful consort as he turned over the volume of the creation which stood open on the desk  come and sing this he said when he saw lucy rising  what graceful consort i dont think it suits your voice  never mind it exactly suits my feeling which philip will have it is the grand element of good singing i notice men with indifferent voices are usually of that opinion  philip burst into one of his invectives against the creation the other day said lucy seating herself at the piano he says it has a sort of sugared complacency and flattering makebelieve in it as if it were written for the birthday fête of a german grandduke  oh pooh he is the fallen adam with a soured temper we are adam and eve unfallen in paradise now thenthe recitative for the sake of the moral you will sing the whole duty of womanand from obedience grows my pride and happiness  oh no i shall not respect an adam who drags the tempo as you will said lucy beginning to play the duet  surely the only courtship unshaken by doubts and fears must be that in which the lovers can sing together the sense of mutual fitness that springs from the two deep notes fulfilling expectation just at the right moment between the notes of the silvery soprano from the perfect accord of descending thirds and fifths from the preconcerted loving chase of a fugue is likely enough to supersede any immediate demand for less impassioned forms of agreement the contralto will not care to catechise the bass the tenor will foresee no embarrassing dearth of remark in evenings spent with the lovely soprano in the provinces too where music was so scarce in that remote time how could the musical people avoid falling in love with each other even political principle must have been in danger of relaxation under such circumstances and the violin faithful to rotten boroughs must have been tempted to fraternize in a demoralizing way with a reforming violoncello in that case the linnetthroated soprano and the fulltoned bass singing    with thee delight is ever new   with thee is life incessant bliss  believed what they sang all the more because they sang it  now for raphaels great song said lucy when they had finished the duet you do the heavy beasts to perfection  that sounds complimentary said stephen looking at his watch by jove its nearly halfpast one well i can just sing this  stephen delivered with admirable ease the deep notes representing the tread of the heavy beasts but when a singer has an audience of two there is room for divided sentiments minnys mistress was charmed but minny who had intrenched himself trembling in his basket as soon as the music began found this thunder so little to his taste that he leaped out and scampered under the remotest chiffonnier as the most eligible place in which a small dog could await the crack of doom  adieu graceful consort said stephen buttoning his coat across when he had done singing and smiling down from his tall height with the air of rather a patronizing lover at the little lady on the musicstool my bliss is not incessant for i must gallop home i promised to be there at lunch  you will not be able to call on philip then it is of no consequence i have said everything in my note  you will be engaged with your cousin tomorrow i suppose  yes we are going to have a little familyparty my cousin tom will dine with us and poor aunty will have her two children together for the first time it will be very pretty i think a great deal about it  but i may come the next day  oh yes come and be introduced to my cousin maggie though you can hardly be said not to have seen her you have described her so well  goodbye then and there was that slight pressure of the hands and momentary meeting of the eyes which will often leave a little lady with a slight flush and smile on her face that do not subside immediately when the door is closed and with an inclination to walk up and down the room rather than to seat herself quietly at her embroidery or other rational and improving occupation at least this was the effect on lucy and you will not i hope consider it an indication of vanity predominating over more tender impulses that she just glanced in the chimneyglass as her walk brought her near it the desire to know that one has not looked an absolute fright during a few hours of conversation may be construed as lying within the bounds of a laudable benevolent consideration for others and lucy had so much of this benevolence in her nature that i am inclined to think her small egoisms were impregnated with it just as there are people not altogether unknown to you whose small benevolences have a predominant and somewhat rank odor of egoism even now that she is walking up and down with a little triumphant flutter of her girlish heart at the sense that she is loved by the person of chief consequence in her small world you may see in her hazel eyes an everpresent sunny benignity in which the momentary harmless flashes of personal vanity are quite lost and if she is happy in thinking of her lover it is because the thought of him mingles readily with all the gentle affections and goodnatured offices with which she fills her peaceful days even now her mind with that instantaneous alternation which makes two currents of feeling or imagination seem simultaneous is glancing continually from stephen to the preparations she has only half finished in maggies room cousin maggie should be treated as well as the grandest ladyvisitornay better for she should have lucys best prints and drawings in her bedroom and the very finest bouquet of spring flowers on her table maggie would enjoy all that she was so found of pretty things and there was poor aunt tulliver that no one made any account of she was to be surprised with the present of a cap of superlative quality and to have her health drunk in a gratifying manner for which lucy was going to lay a plot with her father this evening clearly she had not time to indulge in long reveries about her own happy loveaffairs with this thought she walked toward the door but paused there  whats the matter then minny she said stooping in answer to some whimpering of that small quadruped and lifting his glossy head against her pink cheek did you think i was going without you come then let us go and see sinbad  sinbad was lucys chestnut horse that she always fed with her own hand when he was turned out in the paddock she was fond of feeding dependent creatures and knew the private tastes of all the animals about the house delighting in the little rippling sounds of her canaries when their beaks were busy with fresh seed and in the small nibbling pleasures of certain animals which lest she should appear too trivial i will here call the more familiar rodents  was not stephen guest right in his decided opinion that this slim maiden of eighteen was quite the sort of wife a man would not be likely to repent of marryinga woman who was loving and thoughtful for other women not giving them judaskisses with eyes askance on their welcome defects but with real care and vision for their halfhidden pains and mortifications with long ruminating enjoyment of little pleasures prepared for them perhaps the emphasis of his admiration did not fall precisely on this rarest quality in her perhaps he approved his own choice of her chiefly because she did not strike him as a remarkable rarity a man likes his wife to be pretty well lucy was pretty but not to a maddening extent a man likes his wife to be accomplished gentle affectionate and not stupid and lucy had all these qualifications stephen was not surprised to find himself in love with her and was conscious of excellent judgment in preferring her to miss leyburn the daughter of the county member although lucy was only the daughter of his fathers subordinate partner besides he had had to defy and overcome a slight unwillingness and disappointment in his father and sistersa circumstance which gives a young man an agreeable consciousness of his own dignity stephen was aware that he had sense and independence enough to choose the wife who was likely to make him happy unbiassed by any indirect considerations he meant to choose lucy she was a little darling and exactly the sort of woman he had always admired    chapter ii  first impressions   he is very clever maggie said lucy she was kneeling on a footstool at maggies feet after placing that dark lady in the large crimsonvelvet chair i feel sure you will like him i hope you will  i shall be very difficult to please said maggie smiling and holding up one of lucys long curls that the sunlight might shine through it a gentleman who thinks he is good enough for lucy must expect to be sharply criticised  indeed hes a great deal too good for me and sometimes when he is away i almost think it cant really be that he loves me but i can never doubt it when he is with me though i couldnt bear any one but you to know that i feel in that way maggie  oh then if i disapprove of him you can give him up since you are not engaged said maggie with playful gravity  i would rather not be engaged when people are engaged they begin to think of being married soon said lucy too thoroughly preoccupied to notice maggies joke and i should like everything to go on for a long while just as it is sometimes i am quite frightened lest stephen should say that he has spoken to papa and from something that fell from papa the other day i feel sure he and mr guest are expecting that and stephens sisters are very civil to me now at first i think they didnt like his paying me attention and that was natural it does seem out of keeping that i should ever live in a great place like the park house such a little insignificant thing as i am  but people are not expected to be large in proportion to the houses they live in like snails said maggie laughing pray are mr guests sisters giantesses  oh no and not handsomethat is not very said lucy halfpenitent at this uncharitable remark but he isat least he is generally considered very handsome  though you are unable to share that opinion  oh i dont know said lucy blushing pink over brow and neck it is a bad plan to raise expectation you will perhaps be disappointed but i have prepared a charming surprise for him i shall have a glorious laugh against him i shall not tell you what it is though  lucy rose from her knees and went to a little distance holding her pretty head on one side as if she had been arranging maggie for a portrait and wished to judge of the general effect  stand up a moment maggie  what is your pleasure now said maggie smiling languidly as she rose from her chair and looked down on her slight aerial cousin whose figure was quite subordinate to her faultless drapery of silk and crape  lucy kept her contemplative attitude a moment or two in silence and then said  i cant think what witchery it is in you maggie that makes you look best in shabby clothes though you really must have a new dress now but do you know last night i was trying to fancy you in a handsome fashionable dress and do what i would that old limp merino would come back as the only right thing for you i wonder if marie antoinette looked all the grander when her gown was darned at the elbows now if i were to put anything shabby on i should be quite unnoticeable i should be a mere rag  oh quite said maggie with mock gravity you would be liable to be swept out of the room with the cobwebs and carpetdust and to find yourself under the grate like cinderella maynt i sit down now  yes now you may said lucy laughing then with an air of serious reflection unfastening her large jet brooch but you must change brooches maggie that little butterfly looks silly on you  but wont that mar the charming effect of my consistent shabbiness said maggie seating herself submissively while lucy knelt again and unfastened the contemptible butterfly i wish my mother were of your opinion for she was fretting last night because this is my best frock ive been saving my money to pay for some lessons i shall never get a better situation without more accomplishments  maggie gave a little sigh  now dont put on that sad look again said lucy pinning the large brooch below maggies fine throat youre forgetting that youve left that dreary schoolroom behind you and have no little girls clothes to mend  yes said maggie it is with me as i used to think it would be with the poor uneasy white bear i saw at the show i thought he must have got so stupid with the habit of turning backward and forward in that narrow space that he would keep doing it if they set him free one gets a bad habit of being unhappy  but i shall put you under a discipline of pleasure that will make you lose that bad habit said lucy sticking the black butterfly absently in her own collar while her eyes met maggies affectionately  you dear tiny thing said maggie in one of her bursts of loving admiration you enjoy other peoples happiness so much i believe you would do without any of your own i wish i were like you  ive never been tried in that way said lucy ive always been so happy i dont know whether i could bear much trouble i never had any but poor mammas death you have been tried maggie and im sure you feel for other people quite as much as i do  no lucy said maggie shaking her head slowly i dont enjoy their happiness as you do else i should be more contented i do feel for them when they are in trouble i dont think i could ever bear to make any one unhappy and yet i often hate myself because i get angry sometimes at the sight of happy people i think i get worse as i get older more selfish that seems very dreadful  now maggie said lucy in a tone of remonstrance i dont believe a word of that it is all a gloomy fancy just because you are depressed by a dull wearisome life  well perhaps it is said maggie resolutely clearing away the clouds from her face with a bright smile and throwing herself backward in her chair perhaps it comes from the school dietwatery ricepudding spiced with pinnock let us hope it will give way before my mothers custards and this charming geoffrey crayon  maggie took up the sketch book which lay by her on the table  do i look fit to be seen with this little brooch said lucy going to survey the effect in the chimneyglass  oh no mr guest will be obliged to go out of the room again if he sees you in it pray make haste and put another on  lucy hurried out of the room but maggie did not take the opportunity of opening her book she let it fall on her knees while her eyes wandered to the window where she could see the sunshine falling on the rich clumps of spring flowers and on the long hedge of laurels and beyond the silvery breadth of the dear old floss that at this distance seemed to be sleeping in a morning holiday the sweet fresh gardenscent came through the open window and the birds were busy flitting and alighting gurgling and singing yet maggies eyes began to fill with tears the sight of the old scenes had made the rush of memories so painful that even yesterday she had only been able to rejoice in her mothers restored comfort and toms brotherly friendliness as we rejoice in good news of friends at a distance rather than in the presence of a happiness which we share memory and imagination urged upon her a sense of privation too keen to let her taste what was offered in the transient present her future she thought was likely to be worse than her past for after her years of contented renunciation she had slipped back into desire and longing she found joyless days of distasteful occupation harder and harder she found the image of the intense and varied life she yearned for and despaired of becoming more and more importunate the sound of the opening door roused her and hastily wiping away her tears she began to turn over the leaves of her book  there is one pleasure i know maggie that your deepest dismalness will never resist said lucy beginning to speak as soon as she entered the room that is music and i mean you to have quite a riotous feast of it i mean you to get up your playing again which used to be so much better than mine when we were at laceham  you would have laughed to see me playing the little girls tunes over and over to them when i took them to practise said maggie just for the sake of fingering the dear keys again but i dont know whether i could play anything more difficult now than begone dull care  i know what a wild state of joy you used to be in when the gleemen came round said lucy taking up her embroidery and we might have all those old glees that you used to love so if i were certain that you dont feel exactly as tom does about some things  i should have thought there was nothing you might be more certain of said maggie smiling  i ought rather to have said one particular thing because if you feel just as he does about that we shall want our third voice st oggs is so miserably provided with musical gentlemen there are really only stephen and philip wakem who have any knowledge of music so as to be able to sing a part  lucy had looked up from her work as she uttered the last sentence and saw that there was a change in maggies face  does it hurt you to hear the name mentioned maggie if it does i will not speak of him again i know tom will not see him if he can avoid it  i dont feel at all as tom does on that subject said maggie rising and going to the window as if she wanted to see more of the landscape ive always liked philip wakem ever since i was a little girl and saw him at lorton he was so good when tom hurt his foot  oh im so glad said lucy then you wont mind his coming sometimes and we can have much more music than we could without him im very fond of poor philip only i wish he were not so morbid about his deformity i suppose it is his deformity that makes him so sad and sometimes bitter it is certainly very piteous to see his poor little crooked body and pale face among great strong people  but lucy said maggie trying to arrest the prattling stream  ah there is the doorbell that must be stephen lucy went on not noticing maggies faint effort to speak one of the things i most admire in stephen is that he makes a greater friend of philip than any one  it was too late for maggie to speak now the drawingroom door was opening and minny was already growling in a small way at the entrance of a tall gentleman who went up to lucy and took her hand with a halfpolite halftender glance and tone of inquiry which seemed to indicate that he was unconscious of any other presence  let me introduce you to my cousin miss tulliver said lucy turning with wicked enjoyment toward maggie who now approached from the farther window this is mr stephen guest  for one instant stephen could not conceal his astonishment at the sight of this tall darkeyed nymph with her jetblack coronet of hair the next maggie felt herself for the first time in her life receiving the tribute of a very deep blush and a very deep bow from a person toward whom she herself was conscious of timidity  this new experience was very agreeable to her so agreeable that it almost effaced her previous emotion about philip there was a new brightness in her eyes and a very becoming flush on her cheek as she seated herself  i hope you perceive what a striking likeness you drew the day before yesterday said lucy with a pretty laugh of triumph she enjoyed her lovers confusion the advantage was usually on his side  this designing cousin of yours quite deceived me miss tulliver said stephen seating himself by lucy and stooping to play with minny only looking at maggie furtively she said you had light hair and blue eyes  nay it was you who said so remonstrated lucy i only refrained from destroying your confidence in your own secondsight  i wish i could always err in the same way said stephen and find reality so much more beautiful than my preconceptions  now you have proved yourself equal to the occasion said maggie and said what it was incumbent on you to say under the circumstances  she flashed a slightly defiant look at him it was clear to her that he had been drawing a satirical portrait of her beforehand lucy had said he was inclined to be satirical and maggie had mentally supplied the addition and rather conceited  an alarming amount of devil there was stephens first thought the second when she had bent over her work was i wish she would look at me again the next was to answer  i suppose all phrases of mere compliment have their turn to be true a man is occasionally grateful when he says thank you its rather hard upon him that he must use the same words with which all the world declines a disagreeable invitation dont you think so miss tulliver  no said maggie looking at him with her direct glance if we use common words on a great occasion they are the more striking because they are felt at once to have a particular meaning like old banners or everyday clothes hung up in a sacred place  then my compliment ought to be eloquent said stephen really not quite knowing what he said while maggie looked at him seeing that the words were so far beneath the occasion  no compliment can be eloquent except as an expression of indifference said maggie flushing a little  lucy was rather alarmed she thought stephen and maggie were not going to like each other she had always feared lest maggie should appear too old and clever to please that critical gentleman why dear maggie she interposed you have always pretended that you are too fond of being admired and now i think you are angry because some one ventures to admire you  not at all said maggie i like too well to feel that i am admired but compliments never make me feel that  i will never pay you a compliment again miss tulliver said stephen  thank you that will be a proof of respect  poor maggie she was so unused to society that she could take nothing as a matter of course and had never in her life spoken from the lips merely so that she must necessarily appear absurd to more experienced ladies from the excessive feeling she was apt to throw into very trivial incidents but she was even conscious herself of a little absurdity in this instance it was true she had a theoretic objection to compliments and had once said impatiently to philip that she didnt see why women were to be told with a simper that they were beautiful any more than old men were to be told that they were venerable still to be so irritated by a common practice in the case of a stranger like mr stephen guest and to care about his having spoken slightingly of her before he had seen her was certainly unreasonable and as soon as she was silent she began to be ashamed of herself it did not occur to her that her irritation was due to the pleasanter emotion which preceded it just as when we are satisfied with a sense of glowing warmth an innocent drop of cold water may fall upon us as a sudden smart  stephen was too well bred not to seem unaware that the previous conversation could have been felt embarrassing and at once began to talk of impersonal matters asking lucy if she knew when the bazaar was at length to take place so that there might be some hope of seeing her rain the influence of her eyes on objects more grateful than those worsted flowers that were growing under her fingers  some day next month i believe said lucy but your sisters are doing more for it than i am they are to have the largest stall  ah yes but they carry on their manufactures in their own sittingroom where i dont intrude on them i see you are not addicted to the fashionable vice of fancywork miss tulliver said stephen looking at maggies plain hemming  no said maggie i can do nothing more difficult or more elegant than shirtmaking  and your plain sewing is so beautiful maggie said lucy that i think i shall beg a few specimens of you to show as fancywork your exquisite sewing is quite a mystery to me you used to dislike that sort of work so much in old days  it is a mystery easily explained dear said maggie looking up quietly plain sewing was the only thing i could get money by so i was obliged to try and do it well  lucy good and simple as she was could not help blushing a little she did not quite like that stephen should know that maggie need not have mentioned it perhaps there was some pride in the confession the pride of poverty that will not be ashamed of itself but if maggie had been the queen of coquettes she could hardly have invented a means of giving greater piquancy to her beauty in stephens eyes i am not sure that the quiet admission of plain sewing and poverty would have done alone but assisted by the beauty they made maggie more unlike other women even than she had seemed at first  but i can knit lucy maggie went on if that will be of any use for your bazaar  oh yes of infinite use i shall set you to work with scarlet wool tomorrow but your sister is the most enviable person continued lucy turning to stephen to have the talent of modelling she is doing a wonderful bust of dr kenn entirely from memory  why if she can remember to put the eyes very near together and the corners of the mouth very far apart the likeness can hardly fail to be striking in st oggs  now that is very wicked of you said lucy looking rather hurt i didnt think you would speak disrespectfully of dr kenn  i say anything disrespectful of dr kenn heaven forbid but i am not bound to respect a libellous bust of him i think kenn one of the finest fellows in the world i dont care much about the tall candlesticks he has put on the communiontable and i shouldnt like to spoil my temper by getting up to early prayers every morning but hes the only man i ever knew personally who seems to me to have anything of the real apostle in hima man who has eight hundred ayear and is contented with deal furniture and boiled beef because he gives away twothirds of his income that was a very fine thing of himtaking into his house that poor lad grattan who shot his mother by accident he sacrifices more time than a less busy man could spare to save the poor fellow from getting into a morbid state of mind about it he takes the lad out with him constantly i see  that is beautiful said maggie who had let her work fall and was listening with keen interest i never knew any one who did such things  and one admires that sort of action in kenn all the more said stephen because his manners in general are rather cold and severe theres nothing sugary and maudlin about him  oh i think hes a perfect character said lucy with pretty enthusiasm  no there i cant agree with you said stephen shaking his head with sarcastic gravity  now what fault can you point out in him  hes an anglican  well those are the right views i think said lucy gravely  that settles the question in the abstract said stephen but not from a parliamentary point of view he has set the dissenters and the church people by the ears and a rising senator like myself of whose services the country is very much in need will find it inconvenient when he puts up for the honor of representing st oggs in parliament  do you really think of that said lucy her eyes brightening with a proud pleasure that made her neglect the argumentative interests of anglicanism  decidedly whenever old mr leyburns public spirit and gout induce him to give way my fathers heart is set on it and gifts like mine you knowhere stephen drew himself up and rubbed his large white hands over his hair with playful selfadmirationgifts like mine involve great responsibilities dont you think so miss tulliver  yes said maggie smiling but not looking up so much fluency and selfpossession should not be wasted entirely on private occasions  ah i see how much penetration you have said stephen you have discovered already that i am talkative and impudent now superficial people never discern that owing to my manner i suppose  she doesnt look at me when i talk of myself he thought while his listeners were laughing i must try other subjects  did lucy intend to be present at the meeting of the book club next week was the next question then followed the recommendation to choose southeys life of cowper unless she were inclined to be philosophical and startle the ladies of st oggs by voting for one of the bridgewater treatises of course lucy wished to know what these alarmingly learned books were and as it is always pleasant to improve the minds of ladies by talking to them at ease on subjects of which they know nothing stephen became quite brilliant in an account of bucklands treatise which he had just been reading he was rewarded by seeing maggie let her work fall and gradually get so absorbed in his wonderful geological story that she sat looking at him leaning forward with crossed arms and with an entire absence of selfconsciousness as if he had been the snuffiest of old professors and she a downylipped alumna he was so fascinated by the clear large gaze that at last he forgot to look away from it occasionally toward lucy but she sweet child was only rejoicing that stephen was proving to maggie how clever he was and that they would certainly be good friends after all  i will bring you the book shall i miss tulliver said stephen when he found the stream of his recollections running rather shallow there are many illustrations in it that you will like to see  oh thank you said maggie blushing with returning selfconsciousness at this direct address and taking up her work again  no no lucy interposed i must forbid your plunging maggie in books i shall never get her away from them and i want her to have delicious donothing days filled with boating and chatting and riding and driving that is the holiday she needs  apropos said stephen looking at his watch shall we go out for a row on the river now the tide will suit for us to the tofton way and we can walk back  that was a delightful proposition to maggie for it was years since she had been on the river when she was gone to put on her bonnet lucy lingered to give an order to the servant and took the opportunity of telling stephen that maggie had no objection to seeing philip so that it was a pity she had sent that note the day before yesterday but she would write another tomorrow and invite him  ill call and beat him up tomorrow said stephen and bring him with me in the evening shall i my sisters will want to call on you when i tell them your cousin is with you i must leave the field clear for them in the morning  oh yes pray bring him said lucy and you will like maggie shant you she added in a beseeching tone isnt she a dear noblelooking creature  too tall said stephen smiling down upon her and a little too fiery she is not my type of woman you know  gentlemen you are aware are apt to impart these imprudent confidences to ladies concerning their unfavorable opinion of sister fair ones that is why so many women have the advantage of knowing that they are secretly repulsive to men who have selfdenyingly made ardent love to them and hardly anything could be more distinctively characteristic of lucy than that she both implicitly believed what stephen said and was determined that maggie should not know it but you who have a higher logic than the verbal to guide you have already foreseen as the direct sequence to that unfavorable opinion of stephens that he walked down to the boathouse calculating by the aid of a vivid imagination that maggie must give him her hand at least twice in consequence of this pleasant boating plan and that a gentleman who wishes ladies to look at him is advantageously situated when he is rowing them in a boat what then had he fallen in love with this surprising daughter of mrs tulliver at first sight certainly not such passions are never heard of in real life besides he was in love already and halfengaged to the dearest little creature in the world and he was not a man to make a fool of himself in any way but when one is fiveandtwenty one has not chalkstones at ones fingerends that the touch of a handsome girl should be entirely indifferent it was perfectly natural and safe to admire beauty and enjoy looking at itat least under such circumstances as the present and there was really something very interesting about this girl with her poverty and troubles it was gratifying to see the friendship between the two cousins generally stephen admitted he was not fond of women who had any peculiarity of character but here the peculiarity seemed really of a superior kind and provided one is not obliged to marry such women why they certainly make a variety in social intercourse  maggie did not fulfil stephens hope by looking at him during the first quarter of an hour her eyes were too full of the old banks that she knew so well she felt lonely cut off from philipthe only person who had ever seemed to love her devotedly as she had always longed to be loved but presently the rhythmic movement of the oars attracted her and she thought she should like to learn how to row this roused her from her reverie and she asked if she might take an oar it appeared that she required much teaching and she became ambitious the exercise brought the warm blood into her cheeks and made her inclined to take her lesson merrily  i shall not be satisfied until i can manage both oars and row you and lucy she said looking very bright as she stepped out of the boat maggie we know was apt to forget the thing she was doing and she had chosen an inopportune moment for her remark her foot slipped but happily mr stephen guest held her hand and kept her up with a firm grasp  you have not hurt yourself at all i hope he said bending to look in her face with anxiety it was very charming to be taken care of in that kind graceful manner by some one taller and stronger than ones self maggie had never felt just in the same way before  when they reached home again they found uncle and aunt pullet seated with mrs tulliver in the drawingroom and stephen hurried away asking leave to come again in the evening  and pray bring with you the volume of purcell that you took away said lucy i want maggie to hear your best songs  aunt pullet under the certainty that maggie would be invited to go out with lucy probably to park house was much shocked at the shabbiness of her clothes which when witnessed by the higher society of st oggs would be a discredit to the family that demanded a strong and prompt remedy and the consultation as to what would be most suitable to this end from among the superfluities of mrs pullets wardrobe was one that lucy as well as mrs tulliver entered into with some zeal maggie must really have an evening dress as soon as possible and she was about the same height as aunt pullet  but shes so much broader across the shoulders than i am its very illconvenient said mrs pullet else she might wear that beautiful black brocade o mine without any alteration and her arms are beyond everything added mrs pullet sorrowfully as she lifted maggies large round arm shed never get my sleeves on  oh never mind that aunt send us the dress said lucy i dont mean maggie to have long sleeves and i have abundance of black lace for trimming her arms will look beautiful  maggies arms are a pretty shape said mrs tulliver theyre like mine used to be only mine was never brown i wish shed had our family skin  nonsense aunty said lucy patting her aunt tullivers shoulder you dont understand those things a painter would think maggies complexion beautiful  maybe my dear said mrs tulliver submissively you know better than i do only when i was young a brown skin wasnt thought well on among respectable folks  no said uncle pullet who took intense interest in the ladies conversation as he sucked his lozenges though there was a song about the nutbrown maid too i think she was crazycrazy katebut i cant justly remember  oh dear dear said maggie laughing but impatient i think that will be the end of my brown skin if it is always to be talked about so much    chapter iii  confidential moments   when maggie went up to her bedroom that night it appeared that she was not at all inclined to undress she set down her candle on the first table that presented itself and began to walk up and down her room which was a large one with a firm regular and rather rapid step which showed that the exercise was the instinctive vent of strong excitement her eyes and cheeks had an almost feverish brilliancy her head was thrown backward and her hands were clasped with the palms outward and with that tension of the arms which is apt to accompany mental absorption  had anything remarkable happened  nothing that you are not likely to consider in the highest degree unimportant she had been hearing some fine music sung by a fine bass voicebut then it was sung in a provincial amateur fashion such as would have left a critical ear much to desire and she was conscious of having been looked at a great deal in rather a furtive manner from beneath a pair of wellmarked horizontal eyebrows with a glance that seemed somehow to have caught the vibratory influence of the voice such things could have had no perceptible effect on a thoroughly welleducated young lady with a perfectly balanced mind who had had all the advantages of fortune training and refined society but if maggie had been that young lady you would probably have known nothing about her her life would have had so few vicissitudes that it could hardly have been written for the happiest women like the happiest nations have no history  in poor maggies highlystrung hungry naturejust come away from a thirdrate schoolroom with all its jarring sounds and petty round of tasksthese apparently trivial causes had the effect of rousing and exalting her imagination in a way that was mysterious to herself it was not that she thought distinctly of mr stephen guest or dwelt on the indications that he looked at her with admiration it was rather that she felt the halfremote presence of a world of love and beauty and delight made up of vague mingled images from all the poetry and romance she had ever read or had ever woven in her dreamy reveries her mind glanced back once or twice to the time when she had courted privation when she had thought all longing all impatience was subdued but that condition seemed irrecoverably gone and she recoiled from the remembrance of it no prayer no striving now would bring back that negative peace the battle of her life it seemed was not to be decided in that short and easy wayby perfect renunciation at the very threshold of her youth  the music was vibrating in her stillpurcells music with its wild passion and fancyand she could not stay in the recollection of that bare lonely past she was in her brighter aerial world again when a little tap came at the door of course it was her cousin who entered in ample white dressinggown  why maggie you naughty child havent you begun to undress said lucy in astonishment i promised not to come and talk to you because i thought you must be tired but here you are looking as if you were ready to dress for a ball come come get on your dressinggown and unplait your hair  well you are not very forward retorted maggie hastily reaching her own pink cotton gown and looking at lucys lightbrown hair brushed back in curly disorder  oh i have not much to do i shall sit down and talk to you till i see you are really on the way to bed  while maggie stood and unplaited her long black hair over her pink drapery lucy sat down near the toilettetable watching her with affectionate eyes and head a little aside like a pretty spaniel if it appears to you at all incredible that young ladies should be led on to talk confidentially in a situation of this kind i will beg you to remember that human life furnishes many exceptional cases  you really have enjoyed the music tonight havent you maggie  oh yes that is what prevented me from feeling sleepy i think i should have no other mortal wants if i could always have plenty of music it seems to infuse strength into my limbs and ideas into my brain life seems to go on without effort when i am filled with music at other times one is conscious of carrying a weight  and stephen has a splendid voice hasnt he  well perhaps we are neither of us judges of that said maggie laughing as she seated herself and tossed her long hair back you are not impartial and i think any barrelorgan splendid  but tell me what you think of him now tell me exactly good and bad too  oh i think you should humiliate him a little a lover should not be so much at ease and so selfconfident he ought to tremble more  nonsense maggie as if any one could tremble at me you think he is conceited i see that but you dont dislike him do you  dislike him no am i in the habit of seeing such charming people that i should be very difficult to please besides how could i dislike any one that promised to make you happy my dear thing maggie pinched lucys dimpled chin  we shall have more music tomorrow evening said lucy looking happy already for stephen will bring philip wakem with him  oh lucy i cant see him said maggie turning pale at least i could not see him without toms leave  is tom such a tyrant as that said lucy surprised ill take the responsibility thentell him it was my fault  but dear said maggie falteringly i promised tom very solemnly before my fathers deathi promised him i would not speak to philip without his knowledge and consent and i have a great dread of opening the subject with tomof getting into a quarrel with him again  but i never heard of anything so strange and unreasonable what harm can poor philip have done may i speak to tom about it  oh no pray dont dear said maggie ill go to him myself tomorrow and tell him that you wish philip to come ive thought before of asking him to absolve me from my promise but ive not had the courage to determine on it  they were both silent for some moments and then lucy said  maggie you have secrets from me and i have none from you  maggie looked meditatively away from lucy then she turned to her and said i should like to tell you about philip but lucy you must not betray that you know it to any oneleast of all to philip himself or to mr stephen guest  the narrative lasted long for maggie had never before known the relief of such an outpouring she had never before told lucy anything of her inmost life and the sweet face bent toward her with sympathetic interest and the little hand pressing hers encouraged her to speak on on two points only she was not expansive she did not betray fully what still rankled in her mind as toms great offencethe insults he had heaped on philip angry as the remembrance still made her she could not bear that any one else should know it at all both for toms sake and philips and she could not bear to tell lucy of the last scene between her father and wakem though it was this scene which she had ever since felt to be a new barrier between herself and philip she merely said she saw now that tom was no the whole right in regarding any prospect of love and marriage between her and philip as put out of the question by the relation of the two families of course philips father would never consent  there lucy you have had my story said maggie smiling with the tears in her eyes you see i am like sir andrew aguecheek i was adored once  ah now i see how it is you know shakespeare and everything and have learned so much since you left school which always seemed to me witchcraft beforepart of your general uncanniness said lucy  she mused a little with her eyes downward and then added looking at maggie it is very beautiful that you should love philip i never thought such a happiness would befall him and in my opinion you ought not to give him up there are obstacles now but they may be done away with in time  maggie shook her head  yes yes persisted lucy i cant help being hopeful about it there is something romantic in itout of the common wayjust what everything that happens to you ought to be and philip will adore you like a husband in a fairy tale oh i shall puzzle my small brain to contrive some plot that will bring everybody into the right mind so that you may marry philip when i marrysomebody else wouldnt that be a pretty ending to all my poor poor maggies troubles  maggie tried to smile but shivered as if she felt a sudden chill  ah dear you are cold said lucy you must go to bed and so must i i dare not think what time it is  they kissed each other and lucy went away possessed of a confidence which had a strong influence over her subsequent impressions maggie had been thoroughly sincere her nature had never found it easy to be otherwise but confidences are sometimes blinding even when they are sincere    chapter iv  brother and sister   maggie was obliged to go to toms lodgings in the middle of the day when he would be coming in to dinner else she would not have found him at home he was not lodging with entire strangers our friend bob jakin had with mumpss tacit consent taken not only a wife about eight months ago but also one of those queer old houses pierced with surprising passages by the waterside where as he observed his wife and mother could keep themselves out of mischief by letting out two pleasureboats in which he had invested some of his savings and by taking in a lodger for the parlor and spare bedroom under these circumstances what could be better for the interests of all parties sanitary considerations apart than that the lodger should be mr tom  it was bobs wife who opened the door to maggie she was a tiny woman with the general physiognomy of a dutch doll looking in comparison with bobs mother who filled up the passage in the rear very much like one of those human figures which the artist finds conveniently standing near a colossal statue to show the proportions the tiny woman curtsied and looked up at maggie with some awe as soon as she had opened the door but the words is my brother at home which maggie uttered smilingly made her turn round with sudden excitement and say  eh mother mothertell bobits miss maggie come in miss for goodness do she went on opening a side door and endeavoring to flatten her person against the wall to make the utmost space for the visitor  sad recollections crowded on maggie as she entered the small parlor which was now all that poor tom had to call by the name of homethat name which had once so many years ago meant for both of them the same sum of dear familiar objects but everything was not strange to her in this new room the first thing her eyes dwelt on was the large old bible and the sight was not likely to disperse the old memories she stood without speaking  if you please to take the privilege o sitting down miss said mrs jakin rubbing her apron over a perfectly clean chair and then lifting up the corner of that garment and holding it to her face with an air of embarrassment as she looked wonderingly at maggie  bob is at home then said maggie recovering herself and smiling at the bashful dutch doll  yes miss but i think he must be washing and dressing himself ill go and see said mrs jakin disappearing  but she presently came back walking with new courage a little way behind her husband who showed the brilliancy of his blue eyes and regular white teeth in the doorway bowing respectfully  how do you do bob said maggie coming forward and putting out her hand to him i always meant to pay your wife a visit and i shall come another day on purpose for that if she will let me but i was obliged to come today to speak to my brother  hell be in before long miss hes doin finely mr tom is hell be one o the first men hereaboutsyoull see that  well bob im sure hell be indebted to you whatever he becomes he said so himself only the other night when he was talking of you  eh miss thats his way o takin it but i think the more ont when he says a thing because his tongue doesnt overshoot him as mine does lors im no better nor a tilted bottle i arnti cant stop mysen when once i begin but you look rarely miss it does me good to see you what do you say now prissyhere bob turned to his wifeisnt it all come true as i said though there isnt many sorts o goods as i cant overpraise when i set my tongue tot  mrs bobs small nose seemed to be following the example of her eyes in turning up reverentially toward maggie but she was able now to smile and curtsey and say id looked forrard like aenything to seein you miss for my husbands tongues been runnin on you like as if he was lightheaded iver since first he come acourtin on me  well well said bob looking rather silly go an see after the taters else mr tom ull have to wait for em  i hope mumps is friendly with mrs jakin bob said maggie smiling i remember you used to say he wouldnt like your marrying  eh miss said bob he made up his mind tot when he seed what a little un she was he pretends not to see her mostly or else to think as she isnt fullgrowed but about mr tom miss said bob speaking lower and looking serious hes as close as a iron biler he is but im a cutish chap an when ive left off carrying my pack an am at a loose end ive got more brains nor i know what to do wi an im forced to busy myself wi other folkss insides an it worrets me as mr tomll sit by himself so glumpish aknittin his brow an alookin at the fire of a night he should be a bit livelier now a fine young fellow like him my wife says when she goes in sometimes an he takes no notice of her he sits lookin into the fire and frownin as if he was watchin folks at work in it  he thinks so much about business said maggie  ay said bob speaking lower but do you think its nothin else miss hes close mr tom is but im a cute chap i am an i thought towrt last christmas as id found out a soft place in him it was about a little black spaniela rare bit o breedas he made a fuss to get but since then summats come over him as hes set his teeth again things more nor iver for all hes had such good luck an i wanted to tell you miss cause i thought you might work it out of him a bit now youre come hes a deal too lonely and doesnt go into company enough  im afraid i have very little power over him bob said maggie a good deal moved by bobs suggestion it was a totally new idea to her mind that tom could have his love troubles poor fellowand in love with lucy too but it was perhaps a mere fancy of bobs too officious brain the present of the dog meant nothing more than cousinship and gratitude but bob had already said heres mr tom and the outer door was opening  there is no time to spare tom said maggie as soon as bob left the room i must tell you at once what i came about else i shall be hindering you from taking your dinner  tom stood with his back against the chimneypiece and maggie was seated opposite the light he noticed that she was tremulous and he had a presentiment of the subject she was going to speak about the presentiment made his voice colder and harder as he said what is it  this tone roused a spirit of resistance in maggie and she put her request in quite a different form from the one she had predetermined on she rose from her seat and looking straight at tom said  i want you to absolve me from my promise about philip wakem or rather i promised you not to see him without telling you i am come to tell you that i wish to see him  very well said tom still more coldly  but maggie had hardly finished speaking in that chill defiant manner before she repented and felt the dread of alienation from her brother  not for myself dear tom dont be angry i shouldnt have asked it only that philip you know is a friend of lucys and she wishes him to come has invited him to come this evening and i told her i couldnt see him without telling you i shall only see him in the presence of other people there will never be anything secret between us again  tom looked away from maggie knitting his brow more strongly for a little while then he turned to her and said slowly and emphatically  you know what is my feeling on that subject maggie there is no need for my repeating anything i said a year ago while my father was living i felt bound to use the utmost power over you to prevent you from disgracing him as well as yourself and all of us but now i must leave you to your own choice you wish to be independent you told me so after my fathers death my opinion is not changed if you think of philip wakem as a lover again you must give up me  i dont wish it dear tom at least as things are i see that it would lead to misery but i shall soon go away to another situation and i should like to be friends with him again while i am here lucy wishes it  the severity of toms face relaxed a little  i shouldnt mind your seeing him occasionally at my unclesi dont want you to make a fuss on the subject but i have no confidence in you maggie you would be led away to do anything  that was a cruel word maggies lip began to tremble  why will you say that tom it is very hard of you have i not done and borne everything as well as i could and i kept my word to youwhenwhenmy life has not been a happy one any more than yours  she was obliged to be childish the tears would come when maggie was not angry she was as dependent on kind or cold words as a daisy on the sunshine or the cloud the need of being loved would always subdue her as in old days it subdued her in the wormeaten attic the brothers goodness came uppermost at this appeal but it could only show itself in toms fashion he put his hand gently on her arm and said in the tone of a kind pedagogue  now listen to me maggie ill tell you what i mean youre always in extremes you have no judgment and selfcommand and yet you think you know best and will not submit to be guided you know i didnt wish you to take a situation my aunt pullet was willing to give you a good home and you might have lived respectably amongst your relations until i could have provided a home for you with my mother and that is what i should like to do i wished my sister to be a lady and i always have taken care of you as my father desired until you were well married but your ideas and mine never accord and you will not give way yet you might have sense enough to see that a brother who goes out into the world and mixes with men necessarily knows better what is right and respectable for his sister than she can know herself you think i am not kind but my kindness can only be directed by what i believe to be good for you  yes i know dear tom said maggie still halfsobbing but trying to control her tears i know you would do a great deal for me i know how you work and dont spare yourself i am grateful to you but indeed you cant quite judge for me our natures are very different you dont know how differently things affect me from what they do you  yes i do know i know it too well i know how differently you must feel about all that affects our family and your own dignity as a young woman before you could think of receiving secret addresses from philip wakem if it was not disgusting to me in every other way i should object to my sisters name being associated for a moment with that of a young man whose father must hate the very thought of us all and would spurn you with any one but you i should think it quite certain that what you witnessed just before my fathers death would secure you from ever thinking again of philip wakem as a lover but i dont feel certain of it with you i never feel certain about anything with you at one time you take pleasure in a sort of perverse selfdenial and at another you have not resolution to resist a thing that you know to be wrong  there was a terrible cutting truth in toms wordsthat hard rind of truth which is discerned by unimaginative unsympathetic minds maggie always writhed under this judgment of toms she rebelled and was humiliated in the same moment it seemed as if he held a glass before her to show her her own folly and weakness as if he were a prophetic voice predicting her future fallings and yet all the while she judged him in return she said inwardly that he was narrow and unjust that he was below feeling those mental needs which were often the source of the wrongdoing or absurdity that made her life a planless riddle to him  she did not answer directly her heart was too full and she sat down leaning her arm on the table it was no use trying to make tom feel that she was near to him he always repelled her her feeling under his words was complicated by the allusion to the last scene between her father and wakem and at length that painful solemn memory surmounted the immediate grievance no she did not think of such things with frivolous indifference and tom must not accuse her of that she looked up at him with a grave earnest gaze and said  i cant make you think better of me tom by anything i can say but i am not so shut out from all your feelings as you believe me to be i see as well as you do that from our position with regard to philips fathernot on other groundsit would be unreasonable it would be wrong for us to entertain the idea of marriage and i have given up thinking of him as a lover i am telling you the truth and you have no right to disbelieve me i have kept my word to you and you have never detected me in a falsehood i should not only not encourage i should carefully avoid any intercourse with philip on any other footing than of quiet friendship you may think that i am unable to keep my resolutions but at least you ought not to treat me with hard contempt on the ground of faults that i have not committed yet  well maggie said tom softening under this appeal i dont want to overstrain matters i think all things considered it will be best for you to see philip wakem if lucy wishes him to come to the house i believe what you sayat least you believe it yourself i know i can only warn you i wish to be as good a brother to you as you will let me  there was a little tremor in toms voice as he uttered the last words and maggies ready affection came back with as sudden a glow as when they were children and bit their cake together as a sacrament of conciliation she rose and laid her hand on toms shoulder  dear tom i know you mean to be good i know you have had a great deal to bear and have done a great deal i should like to be a comfort to you not to vex you you dont think im altogether naughty now do you  tom smiled at the eager face his smiles were very pleasant to see when they did come for the gray eyes could be tender underneath the frown  no maggie  i may turn out better than you expect  i hope you will  and may i come some day and make tea for you and see this extremely small wife of bobs again  yes but trot away now for ive no more time to spare said tom looking at his watch  not to give me a kiss  tom bent to kiss her cheek and then said  there be a good girl ive got a great deal to think of today im going to have a long consultation with my uncle deane this afternoon  youll come to aunt gleggs tomorrow were going all to dine early that we may go there to tea you must come lucy told me to say so  oh pooh ive plenty else to do said tom pulling his bell violently and bringing down the small bellrope  im frightened i shall run away said maggie making a laughing retreat while tom with masculine philosophy flung the bellrope to the farther end of the room not very far eithera touch of human experience which i flatter myself will come home to the bosoms of not a few substantial or distinguished men who were once at an early stage of their rise in the world and were cherishing very large hopes in very small lodgings    chapter v  showing that tom had opened the oyster   and now weve settled this newcastle business tom said mr deane that same afternoon as they were seated in the private room at the bank together theres another matter i want to talk to you about since youre likely to have rather a smoky unpleasant time of it at newcastle for the next few weeks youll want a good prospect of some sort to keep up your spirits  tom waited less nervously than he had done on a former occasion in this apartment while his uncle took out his snuffbox and gratified each nostril with deliberate impartiality  you see tom said mr deane at last throwing himself backward the world goes on at a smarter pace now than it did when i was a young fellow why sir forty years ago when i was much such a strapping youngster as you a man expected to pull between the shafts the best part of his life before he got the whip in his hand the looms went slowish and fashions didnt alter quite so fast id a best suit that lasted me six years everything was on a lower scale sirin point of expenditure i mean its this steam you see that has made the difference it drives on every wheel double pace and the wheel of fortune along with em as our mr stephen guest said at the anniversary dinner he hits these things off wonderfully considering hes seen nothing of business i dont find fault with the change as some people do trade sir opens a mans eyes and if the population is to get thicker upon the ground as its doing the world must use its wits at inventions of one sort or other i know ive done my share as an ordinary man of business somebody has said its a fine thing to make two ears of corn grow where only one grew before but sir its a fine thing too to further the exchange of commodities and bring the grains of corn to the mouths that are hungry and thats our line of business and i consider it as honorable a position as a man can hold to be connected with it  tom knew that the affair his uncle had to speak of was not urgent mr deane was too shrewd and practical a man to allow either his reminiscences or his snuff to impede the progress of trade indeed for the last month or two there had been hints thrown out to tom which enabled him to guess that he was going to hear some proposition for his own benefit with the beginning of the last speech he had stretched out his legs thrust his hands in his pockets and prepared himself for some introductory diffuseness tending to show that mr deane had succeeded by his own merit and that what he had to say to young men in general was that if they didnt succeed too it was because of their own demerit he was rather surprised then when his uncle put a direct question to him  let me seeits going on for seven years now since you applied to me for a situation eh tom  yes sir im threeandtwenty now said tom  ah its as well not to say that though for youd pass for a good deal older and age tells well in business i remember your coming very well i remember i saw there was some pluck in you and that was what made me give you encouragement and im happy to say i was right im not often deceived i was naturally a little shy at pushing my nephew but im happy to say youve done me credit sir and if id had a son o my own i shouldnt have been sorry to see him like you  mr deane tapped his box and opened it again repeating in a tone of some feeling no i shouldnt have been sorry to see him like you  im very glad ive given you satisfaction sir ive done my best said tom in his proud independent way  yes tom youve given me satisfaction i dont speak of your conduct as a son though that weighs with me in my opinion of you but what i have to do with as a partner in our firm is the qualities youve shown as a man o business ours is a fine businessa splendid concern sirand theres no reason why it shouldnt go on growing theres a growing capital and growing outlets for it but theres another thing thats wanted for the prosperity of every concern large or small and thats men to conduct itmen of the right habits none o your flashy fellows but such as are to be depended on now this is what mr guest and i see clear enough three years ago we took gell into the concern we gave him a share in the oilmill and why why because gell was a fellow whose services were worth a premium so it will always be sir so it was with me and though gell is pretty near ten years older than you there are other points in your favor  tom was getting a little nervous as mr deane went on speaking he was conscious of something he had in his mind to say which might not be agreeable to his uncle simply because it was a new suggestion rather than an acceptance of the proposition he foresaw  it stands to reason mr deane went on when he had finished his new pinch that your being my nephew weighs in your favor but i dont deny that if youd been no relation of mine at all your conduct in that affair of pelleys bank would have led mr guest and myself to make some acknowledgment of the service youve been to us and backed by your general conduct and business ability it has made us determine on giving you a share in the businessa share which we shall be glad to increase as the years go on we think thatll be better on all grounds than raising your salary itll give you more importance and prepare you better for taking some of the anxiety off my shoulders by and by im equal to a good deal o work at present thank god but im getting oldertheres no denying that i told mr guest i would open the subject to you and when you come back from this northern business we can go into particulars this is a great stride for a young fellow of threeandtwenty but im bound to say youve deserved it  im very grateful to mr guest and you sir of course i feel the most indebted to you who first took me into the business and have taken a good deal of pains with me since  tom spoke with a slight tremor and paused after he had said this  yes yes said mr deane i dont spare pains when i see theyll be of any use i gave myself some trouble with gell else he wouldnt have been what he is  but theres one thing i should like to mention to you uncle ive never spoken to you of it before if you remember at the time my fathers property was sold there was some thought of your firm buying the mill i know you thought it would be a very good investment especially if steam were applied  to be sure to be sure but wakem outbid us hed made up his mind to that hes rather fond of carrying everything over other peoples heads  perhaps its of no use my mentioning it at present tom went on but i wish you to know what i have in my mind about the mill ive a strong feeling about it it was my fathers dying wish that i should try and get it back again whenever i could it was in his family for five generations i promised my father and besides that im attached to the place i shall never like any other so well and if it should ever suit your views to buy it for the firm i should have a better chance of fulfilling my fathers wish i shouldnt have liked to mention the thing to you only youve been kind enough to say my services have been of some value and id give up a much greater chance in life for the sake of having the mill againi mean having it in my own hands and gradually working off the price  mr deane had listened attentively and now looked thoughtful  i see i see he said after a while the thing would be possible if there were any chance of wakems parting with the property but that i dont see hes put that young jetsome in the place and he had his reasons when he bought it ill be bound  hes a loose fish that young jetsome said tom hes taking to drinking and they say hes letting the business go down luke told me about itour old miller he says he shant stay unless theres an alteration i was thinking if things went on that way wakem might be more willing to part with the mill luke says hes getting very sour about the way things are going on  well ill turn it over tom i must inquire into the matter and go into it with mr guest but you see its rather striking out a new branch and putting you to that instead of keeping you where you are which was what wed wanted  i should be able to manage more than the mill when things were once set properly going sir i want to have plenty of work theres nothing else i care about much  there was something rather sad in that speech from a young man of threeandtwenty even in uncle deanes businessloving ears  pooh pooh youll be having a wife to care about one of these days if you get on at this pace in the world but as to this mill we mustnt reckon on our chickens too early however i promise you to bear it in mind and when you come back well talk of it again i am going to dinner now come and breakfast with us tomorrow morning and say goodbye to your mother and sister before you start    chapter vi  illustrating the laws of attraction  it is evident to you now that maggie had arrived at a moment in her life which must be considered by all prudent persons as a great opportunity for a young woman launched into the higher society of st oggs with a striking person which had the advantage of being quite unfamiliar to the majority of beholders and with such moderate assistance of costume as you have seen foreshadowed in lucys anxious colloquy with aunt pullet maggie was certainly at a new startingpoint in life at lucys first evening party young torry fatigued his facial muscles more than usual in order that the darkeyed girl there in the corner might see him in all the additional style conferred by his eyeglass and several young ladies went home intending to have short sleeves with black lace and to plait their hair in a broad coronet at the back of their headthat cousin of miss deanes looked so very well in fact poor maggie with all her inward consciousness of a painful past and her presentiment of a troublous future was on the way to become an object of some envya topic of discussion in the newly established billiardroom and between fair friends who had no secrets from each other on the subject of trimmings the miss guests who associated chiefly on terms of condescension with the families of st oggs and were the glass of fashion there took some exception to maggies manners she had a way of not assenting at once to the observations current in good society and of saying that she didnt know whether those observations were true or not which gave her an air of gaucherie and impeded the even flow of conversation but it is a fact capable of an amiable interpretation that ladies are not the worst disposed toward a new acquaintance of their own sex because she has points of inferiority and maggie was so entirely without those pretty airs of coquetry which have the traditional reputation of driving gentlemen to despair that she won some feminine pity for being so ineffective in spite of her beauty she had not had many advantages poor thing and it must be admitted there was no pretension about her her abruptness and unevenness of manner were plainly the result of her secluded and lowly circumstances it was only a wonder that there was no tinge of vulgarity about her considering what the rest of poor lucys relations werean allusion which always made the miss guests shudder a little it was not agreeable to think of any connection by marriage with such people as the gleggs and the pullets but it was of no use to contradict stephen when once he had set his mind on anything and certainly there was no possible objection to lucy in herselfno one could help liking her she would naturally desire that the miss guests should behave kindly to this cousin of whom she was so fond and stephen would make a great fuss if they were deficient in civility under these circumstances the invitations to park house were not wanting and elsewhere also miss deane was too popular and too distinguished a member of society in st oggs for any attention toward her to be neglected  thus maggie was introduced for the first time to the young ladys life and knew what it was to get up in the morning without any imperative reason for doing one thing more than another this new sense of leisure and unchecked enjoyment amidst the softbreathing airs and gardenscents of advancing springamidst the new abundance of music and lingering strolls in the sunshine and the delicious dreaminess of gliding on the rivercould hardly be without some intoxicating effect on her after her years of privation and even in the first week maggie began to be less haunted by her sad memories and anticipations life was certainly very pleasant just now it was becoming very pleasant to dress in the evening and to feel that she was one of the beautiful things of this springtime and there were admiring eyes always awaiting her now she was no longer an unheeded person liable to be chid from whom attention was continually claimed and on whom no one felt bound to confer any it was pleasant too when stephen and lucy were gone out riding to sit down at the piano alone and find that the old fitness between her fingers and the keys remained and revived like a sympathetic kinship not to be worn out by separation to get the tunes she had heard the evening before and repeat them again and again until she had found out a way of producing them so as to make them a more pregnant passionate language to her the mere concord of octaves was a delight to maggie and she would often take up a book of studies rather than any melody that she might taste more keenly by abstraction the more primitive sensation of intervals not that her enjoyment of music was of the kind that indicates a great specific talent it was rather that her sensibility to the supreme excitement of music was only one form of that passionate sensibility which belonged to her whole nature and made her faults and virtues all merge in each other made her affections sometimes an impatient demand but also prevented her vanity from taking the form of mere feminine coquetry and device and gave it the poetry of ambition but you have known maggie a long while and need to be told not her characteristics but her history which is a thing hardly to be predicted even from the completest knowledge of characteristics for the tragedy of our lives is not created entirely from within character says novalis in one of his questionable aphorismscharacter is destiny but not the whole of our destiny hamlet prince of denmark was speculative and irresolute and we have a great tragedy in consequence but if his father had lived to a good old age and his uncle had died an early death we can conceive hamlets having married ophelia and got through life with a reputation of sanity notwithstanding many soliloquies and some moody sarcasms toward the fair daughter of polonius to say nothing of the frankest incivility to his fatherinlaw  maggies destiny then is at present hidden and we must wait for it to reveal itself like the course of an unmapped river we only know that the river is full and rapid and that for all rivers there is the same final home under the charm of her new pleasures maggie herself was ceasing to think with her eager prefiguring imagination of her future lot and her anxiety about her first interview with philip was losing its predominance perhaps unconsciously to herself she was not sorry that the interview had been deferred  for philip had not come the evening he was expected and mr stephen guest brought word that he was gone to the coastprobably he thought on a sketching expedition but it was not certain when he would return it was just like philip to go off in that way without telling any one it was not until the twelfth day that he returned to find both lucys notes awaiting him he had left before he knew of maggies arrival  perhaps one had need be nineteen again to be quite convinced of the feelings that were crowded for maggie into those twelve days of the length to which they were stretched for her by the novelty of her experience in them and the varying attitudes of her mind the early days of an acquaintance almost always have this importance for us and fill up a larger space in our memory than longer subsequent periods which have been less filled with discovery and new impressions there were not many hours in those ten days in which mr stephen guest was not seated by lucys side or standing near her at the piano or accompanying her on some outdoor excursion his attentions were clearly becoming more assiduous and that was what every one had expected lucy was very happy all the happier because stephens society seemed to have become much more interesting and amusing since maggie had been there playful discussionssometimes serious oneswere going forward in which both stephen and maggie revealed themselves to the admiration of the gentle unobtrusive lucy and it more than once crossed her mind what a charming quartet they should have through life when maggie married philip is it an inexplicable thing that a girl should enjoy her lovers society the more for the presence of a third person and be without the slightest spasm of jealousy that the third person had the conversation habitually directed to her not when that girl is as tranquilhearted as lucy thoroughly possessed with a belief that she knows the state of her companions affections and not prone to the feelings which shake such a belief in the absence of positive evidence against it besides it was lucy by whom stephen sat to whom he gave his arm to whom he appealed as the person sure to agree with him and every day there was the same tender politeness toward her the same consciousness of her wants and care to supply them was there really the same it seemed to lucy that there was more and it was no wonder that the real significance of the change escaped her it was a subtle act of conscience in stephen that even he himself was not aware of his personal attentions to maggie were comparatively slight and there had even sprung up an apparent distance between them that prevented the renewal of that faint resemblance to gallantry into which he had fallen the first day in the boat if stephen came in when lucy was out of the room if lucy left them together they never spoke to each other stephen perhaps seemed to be examining books or music and maggie bent her head assiduously over her work each was oppressively conscious of the others presence even to the fingerends yet each looked and longed for the same thing to happen the next day neither of them had begun to reflect on the matter or silently to ask to what does all this tend maggie only felt that life was revealing something quite new to her and she was absorbed in the direct immediate experience without any energy left for taking account of it and reasoning about it stephen wilfully abstained from selfquestioning and would not admit to himself that he felt an influence which was to have any determining effect on his conduct and when lucy came into the room again they were once more unconstrained maggie could contradict stephen and laugh at him and he could recommend to her consideration the example of that most charming heroine miss sophia western who had a great respect for the understandings of men maggie could look at stephen which for some reason or other she always avoided when they were alone and he could even ask her to play his accompaniment for him since lucys fingers were so busy with that bazaarwork and lecture her on hurrying the tempo which was certainly maggies weak point  one dayit was the day of philips returnlucy had formed a sudden engagement to spend the evening with mrs kenn whose delicate state of health threatening to become confirmed illness through an attack of bronchitis obliged her to resign her functions at the coming bazaar into the hands of other ladies of whom she wished lucy to be one the engagement had been formed in stephens presence and he had heard lucy promise to dine early and call at six oclock for miss torry who brought mrs kenns request  here is another of the moral results of this idiotic bazaar stephen burst forth as soon as miss torry had left the roomtaking young ladies from the duties of the domestic hearth into scenes of dissipation among urnrugs and embroidered reticules i should like to know what is the proper function of women if it is not to make reasons for husbands to stay at home and still stronger reasons for bachelors to go out if this goes on much longer the bonds of society will be dissolved  well it will not go on much longer said lucy laughing for the bazaar is to take place on monday week  thank heaven said stephen kenn himself said the other day that he didnt like this plan of making vanity do the work of charity but just as the british public is not reasonable enough to bear direct taxation so st oggs has not got force of motive enough to build and endow schools without calling in the force of folly  did he say so said little lucy her hazel eyes opening wide with anxiety i never heard him say anything of that kind i thought he approved of what we were doing  im sure he approves you said stephen smiling at her affectionately your conduct in going out tonight looks vicious i own but i know there is benevolence at the bottom of it  oh you think too well of me said lucy shaking her head with a pretty blush and there the subject ended but it was tacitly understood that stephen would not come in the evening and on the strength of that tacit understanding he made his morning visit the longer not saying goodbye until after four  maggie was seated in the drawingroom alone shortly after dinner with minny on her lap having left her uncle to his wine and his nap and her mother to the compromise between knitting and nodding which when there was no company she always carried on in the diningroom till teatime maggie was stooping to caress the tiny silken pet and comforting him for his mistresss absence when the sound of a footstep on the gravel made her look up and she saw mr stephen guest walking up the garden as if he had come straight from the river it was very unusual to see him so soon after dinner he often complained that their dinnerhour was late at park house nevertheless there he was in his black dress he had evidently been home and must have come again by the river maggie felt her cheeks glowing and her heart beating it was natural she should be nervous for she was not accustomed to receive visitors alone he had seen her look up through the open window and raised his hat as he walked toward it to enter that way instead of by the door he blushed too and certainly looked as foolish as a young man of some wit and selfpossession can be expected to look as he walked in with a roll of music in his hand and said with an air of hesitating improvisation  you are surprised to see me again miss tulliver i ought to apologize for coming upon you by surprise but i wanted to come into the town and i got our man to row me so i thought i would bring these things from the maid of artois for your cousin i forgot them this morning will you give them to her  yes said maggie who had risen confusedly with minny in her arms and now not quite knowing what else to do sat down again  stephen laid down his hat with the music which rolled on the floor and sat down in the chair close by her he had never done so before and both he and maggie were quite aware that it was an entirely new position  well you pampered minion said stephen leaning to pull the long curly ears that drooped over maggies arm it was not a suggestive remark and as the speaker did not follow it up by further development it naturally left the conversation at a standstill it seemed to stephen like some action in a dream that he was obliged to do and wonder at himself all the whileto go on stroking minnys head yet it was very pleasant he only wished he dared look at maggie and that she would look at himlet him have one long look into those deep strange eyes of hers and then he would be satisfied and quite reasonable after that he thought it was becoming a sort of monomania with him to want that long look from maggie and he was racking his invention continually to find out some means by which he could have it without its appearing singular and entailing subsequent embarrassment as for maggie she had no distinct thought only the sense of a presence like that of a closely hovering broadwinged bird in the darkness for she was unable to look up and saw nothing but minnys black wavy coat  but this must end some time perhaps it ended very soon and only seemed long as a minutes dream does stephen at last sat upright sideways in his chair leaning one hand and arm over the back and looking at maggie what should he say  we shall have a splendid sunset i think shant you go out and see it  i dont know said maggie then courageously raising her eyes and looking out of the window if im not playing cribbage with my uncle  a pause during which minny is stroked again but has sufficient insight not to be grateful for it to growl rather  do you like sitting alone  a rather arch look came over maggies face and just glancing at stephen she said would it be quite civil to sayve s  it was rather a dangerous question for an intruder to ask said stephen delighted with that glance and getting determined to stay for another but you will have more than half an hour to yourself after i am gone he added taking out his watch i know mr deane never comes in till halfpast seven  another pause during which maggie looked steadily out of the window till by a great effort she moved her head to look down at minnys back again and said  i wish lucy had not been obliged to go out we lose our music  we shall have a new voice tomorrow night said stephen will you tell your cousin that our friend philip wakem is come back i saw him as i went home  maggie gave a little startit seemed hardly more than a vibration that passed from head to foot in an instant but the new images summoned by philips name dispersed half the oppressive spell she had been under she rose from her chair with a sudden resolution and laying minny on his cushion went to reach lucys large workbasket from its corner stephen was vexed and disappointed he thought perhaps maggie didnt like the name of wakem to be mentioned to her in that abrupt way for he now recalled what lucy had told him of the family quarrel it was of no use to stay any longer maggie was seating herself at the table with her work and looking chill and proud and hehe looked like a simpleton for having come a gratuitous entirely superfluous visit of that sort was sure to make a man disagreeable and ridiculous of course it was palpable to maggies thinking that he had dined hastily in his own room for the sake of setting off again and finding her alone  a boyish state of mind for an accomplished young gentleman of fiveandtwenty not without legal knowledge but a reference to history perhaps may make it not incredible  at this moment maggies ball of knittingwool rolled along the ground and she started up to reach it stephen rose too and picking up the ball met her with a vexed complaining look that gave his eyes quite a new expression to maggie whose own eyes met them as he presented the ball to her  goodbye said stephen in a tone that had the same beseeching discontent as his eyes he dared not put out his hand he thrust both hands into his tailpockets as he spoke maggie thought she had perhaps been rude  wont you stay she said timidly not looking away for that would have seemed rude again  no thank you said stephen looking still into the halfunwilling halffascinated eyes as a thirsty man looks toward the track of the distant brook the boat is waiting for me youll tell your cousin  yes  that i brought the music i mean  yes  and that philip is come back  yes maggie did not notice philips name this time  wont you come out a little way into the garden said stephen in a still gentler tone but the next moment he was vexed that she did not say no for she moved away now toward the open window and he was obliged to take his hat and walk by her side but he thought of something to make him amends  do take my arm he said in a low tone as if it were a secret  there is something strangely winning to most women in that offer of the firm arm the help is not wanted physically at that moment but the sense of help the presence of strength that is outside them and yet theirs meets a continual want of the imagination either on that ground or some other maggie took the arm and they walked together round the grassplot and under the drooping green of the laburnums in the same dim dreamy state as they had been in a quarter of an hour before only that stephen had had the look he longed for without yet perceiving in himself the symptoms of returning reasonableness and maggie had darting thoughts across the dimnesshow came he to be there why had she come out not a word was spoken if it had been each would have been less intensely conscious of the other  take care of this step said stephen at last  oh i will go in now said maggie feeling that the step had come like a rescue goodevening  in an instant she had withdrawn her arm and was running back to the house she did not reflect that this sudden action would only add to the embarrassing recollections of the last halfhour she had no thought left for that she only threw herself into the low armchair and burst into tears  oh philip philip i wish we were together againso quietlyin the red deeps  stephen looked after her a moment then went on to the boat and was soon landed at the wharf he spent the evening in the billiardroom smoking one cigar after another and losing lives at pool but he would not leave off he was determined not to thinknot to admit any more distinct remembrance than was urged upon him by the perpetual presence of maggie he was looking at her and she was on his arm  but there came the necessity of walking home in the cool starlight and with it the necessity of cursing his own folly and bitterly determining that he would never trust himself alone with maggie again it was all madness he was in love thoroughly attached to lucy and engagedengaged as strongly as an honorable man need be he wished he had never seen this maggie tulliver to be thrown into a fever by her in this way she would make a sweet strange troublesome adorable wife to some man or other but he would never have chosen her himself did she feel as he did he hoped she didnot he ought not to have gone he would master himself in future he would make himself disagreeable to her quarrel with her perhaps quarrel with her was it possible to quarrel with a creature who had such eyesdefying and deprecating contradicting and clinging imperious and beseeching full of delicious opposites to see such a creature subdued by love for one would be a lot worth havingto another man  there was a muttered exclamation which ended this inward soliloquy as stephen threw away the end of his last cigar and thrusting his hands into his pockets stalked along at a quieter pace through the shrubbery it was not of a benedictory kind    chapter vii  philip reenters   the next morning was very wetthe sort of morning on which male neighbors who have no imperative occupation at home are likely to pay their fair friends an illimitable visit the rain which has been endurable enough for the walk or ride one way is sure to become so heavy and at the same time so certain to clear up by and by that nothing but an open quarrel can abbreviate the visit latent detestation will not do at all and if people happen to be lovers what can be so delightful in england as a rainy morning english sunshine is dubious bonnets are never quite secure and if you sit down on the grass it may lead to catarrhs but the rain is to be depended on you gallop through it in a mackintosh and presently find yourself in the seat you like besta little above or a little below the one on which your goddess sits it is the same thing to the metaphysical mind and that is the reason why women are at once worshipped and looked down upon with a satisfactory confidence that there will be no ladycallers  stephen will come earlier this morning i know said lucy he always does when its rainy  maggie made no answer she was angry with stephen she began to think she should dislike him and if it had not been for the rain she would have gone to her aunt gleggs this morning and so have avoided him altogether as it was she must find some reason for remaining out of the room with her mother  but stephen did not come earlier and there was another visitora nearer neighborwho preceded him when philip entered the room he was going merely to bow to maggie feeling that their acquaintance was a secret which he was bound not to betray but when she advanced toward him and put out her hand he guessed at once that lucy had been taken into her confidence it was a moment of some agitation to both though philip had spent many hours in preparing for it but like all persons who have passed through life with little expectation of sympathy he seldom lost his selfcontrol and shrank with the most sensitive pride from any noticeable betrayal of emotion a little extra paleness a little tension of the nostril when he spoke and the voice pitched in rather a higher key that to strangers would seem expressive of cold indifference were all the signs philip usually gave of an inward drama that was not without its fierceness but maggie who had little more power of concealing the impressions made upon her than if she had been constructed of musical strings felt her eyes getting larger with tears as they took each others hands in silence they were not painful tears they had rather something of the same origin as the tears women and children shed when they have found some protection to cling to and look back on the threatened danger for philip who a little while ago was associated continually in maggies mind with the sense that tom might reproach her with some justice had now in this short space become a sort of outward conscience to her that she might fly to for rescue and strength her tranquil tender affection for philip with its root deep down in her childhood and its memories of long quiet talk confirming by distinct successive impressions the first instinctive biasthe fact that in him the appeal was more strongly to her pity and womanly devotedness than to her vanity or other egoistic excitability of her natureseemed now to make a sort of sacred place a sanctuary where she could find refuge from an alluring influence which the best part of herself must resist which must bring horrible tumult within wretchedness without this new sense of her relation to philip nullified the anxious scruples she would otherwise have felt lest she should overstep the limit of intercourse with him that tom would sanction and she put out her hand to him and felt the tears in her eyes without any consciousness of an inward check the scene was just what lucy expected and her kind heart delighted in bringing philip and maggie together again though even with all her regard for philip she could not resist the impression that her cousin tom had some excuse for feeling shocked at the physical incongruity between the twoa prosaic person like cousin tom who didnt like poetry and fairy tales but she began to speak as soon as possible to set them at ease  this was very good and virtuous of you she said in her pretty treble like the low conversational notes of little birds to come so soon after your arrival and as it is i think i will pardon you for running away in an inopportune manner and giving your friends no notice come and sit down here she went on placing the chair that would suit him best and you shall find yourself treated mercifully  you will never govern well miss deane said philip as he seated himself because no one will ever believe in your severity people will always encourage themselves in misdemeanors by the certainty that you will be indulgent  lucy gave some playful contradiction but philip did not hear what it was for he had naturally turned toward maggie and she was looking at him with that open affectionate scrutiny which we give to a friend from whom we have been long separated what a moment their parting had been and philip felt as if he were only in the morrow of it he felt this so keenlywith such intense detailed remembrance with such passionate revival of all that had been said and looked in their last conversationthat with that jealousy and distrust which in diffident natures is almost inevitably linked with a strong feeling he thought he read in maggies glance and manner the evidence of a change the very fact that he feared and half expected it would be sure to make this thought rush in in the absence of positive proof to the contrary  i am having a great holiday am i not said maggie lucy is like a fairy godmother she has turned me from a drudge into a princess in no time i do nothing but indulge myself all day long and she always finds out what i want before i know it myself  i am sure she is the happier for having you then said philip you must be better than a whole menagerie of pets to her and you look well you are benefiting by the change  artificial conversation of this sort went on a little while till lucy determined to put an end to it exclaimed with a good imitation of annoyance that she had forgotten something and was quickly out of the room  in a moment maggie and philip leaned forward and the hands were clasped again with a look of sad contentment like that of friends who meet in the memory of recent sorrow  i told my brother i wished to see you philip i asked him to release me from my promise and he consented  maggie in her impulsiveness wanted philip to know at once the position they must hold toward each other but she checked herself the things that had happened since he had spoken of his love for her were so painful that she shrank from being the first to allude to them it seemed almost like an injury toward philip even to mention her brotherher brother who had insulted him but he was thinking too entirely of her to be sensitive on any other point at that moment  then we can at least be friends maggie there is nothing to hinder that now  will not your father object said maggie withdrawing her hand  i should not give you up on any ground but your own wish maggie said philip coloring there are points on which i should always resist my father as i used to tell you that is one  then there is nothing to hinder our being friends philipseeing each other and talking to each other while i am here i shall soon go away again i mean to go very soon to a new situation  is that inevitable maggie  yes i must not stay here long it would unfit me for the life i must begin again at last i cant live in dependencei cant live with my brother though he is very good to me he would like to provide for me but that would be intolerable to me  philip was silent a few moments and then said in that high feeble voice which with him indicated the resolute suppression of emotion  is there no other alternative maggie is that life away from those who love you the only one you will allow yourself to look forward to  yes philip she said looking at him pleadingly as if she entreated him to believe that she was compelled to this course at least as things are i dont know what may be in years to come but i begin to think there can never come much happiness to me from loving i have always had so much pain mingled with it i wish i could make myself a world outside it as men do  now you are returning to your old thought in a new form maggiethe thought i used to combat said philip with a slight tinge of bitterness you want to find out a mode of renunciation that will be an escape from pain i tell you again there is no such escape possible except by perverting or mutilating ones nature what would become of me if i tried to escape from pain scorn and cynicism would be my only opium unless i could fall into some kind of conceited madness and fancy myself a favorite of heaven because i am not a favorite with men  the bitterness had taken on some impetuosity as philip went on speaking the words were evidently an outlet for some immediate feeling of his own as well as an answer to maggie there was a pain pressing on him at that moment he shrank with proud delicacy from the faintest allusion to the words of love of plighted love that had passed between them it would have seemed to him like reminding maggie of a promise it would have had for him something of the baseness of compulsion he could not dwell on the fact that he himself had not changed for that too would have had the air of an appeal his love for maggie was stamped even more than the rest of his experience with the exaggerated sense that he was an exceptionthat she that every one saw him in the light of an exception  but maggie was consciencestricken  yes philip she said with her childish contrition when he used to chide her you are right i know i do always think too much of my own feelings and not enough of othersnot enough of yours i had need have you always to find fault with me and teach me so many things have come true that you used to tell me  maggie was resting her elbow on the table leaning her head on her hand and looking at philip with halfpenitent dependent affection as she said this while he was returning her gaze with an expression that to her consciousness gradually became less vaguebecame charged with a specific recollection had his mind flown back to something that she now rememberedsomething about a lover of lucys it was a thought that made her shudder it gave new definiteness to her present position and to the tendency of what had happened the evening before she moved her arm from the table urged to change her position by that positive physical oppression at the heart that sometimes accompanies a sudden mental pang  what is the matter maggie has something happened philip said in inexpressible anxiety his imagination being only too ready to weave everything that was fatal to them both  no nothing said maggie rousing her latent will philip must not have that odious thought in his mind she would banish it from her own nothing she repeated except in my own mind you used to say i should feel the effect of my starved life as you called it and i do i am too eager in my enjoyment of music and all luxuries now they are come to me  she took up her work and occupied herself resolutely while philip watched her really in doubt whether she had anything more than this general allusion in her mind it was quite in maggies character to be agitated by vague selfreproach but soon there came a violent wellknown ring at the doorbell resounding through the house  oh what a startling announcement said maggie quite mistress of herself though not without some inward flutter i wonder where lucy is  lucy had not been deaf to the signal and after an interval long enough for a few solicitous but not hurried inquiries she herself ushered stephen in  well old fellow he said going straight up to philip and shaking him heartily by the hand bowing to maggie in passing its glorious to have you back again only i wish youd conduct yourself a little less like a sparrow with a residence on the housetop and not go in and out constantly without letting the servants know this is about the twentieth time ive had to scamper up those countless stairs to that paintingroom of yours all to no purpose because your people thought you were at home such incidents embitter friendship  ive so few visitors it seems hardly worth while to leave notice of my exit and entrances said philip feeling rather oppressed just then by stephens bright strong presence and strong voice  are you quite well this morning miss tulliver said stephen turning to maggie with stiff politeness and putting out his hand with the air of fulfilling a social duty  maggie gave the tips of her fingers and said quite well thank you in a tone of proud indifference philips eyes were watching them keenly but lucy was used to seeing variations in their manner to each other and only thought with regret that there was some natural antipathy which every now and then surmounted their mutual goodwill maggie is not the sort of woman stephen admires and she is irritated by something in him which she interprets as conceit was the silent observation that accounted for everything to guileless lucy stephen and maggie had no sooner completed this studied greeting than each felt hurt by the others coldness and stephen while rattling on in questions to philip about his recent sketching expedition was thinking all the more about maggie because he was not drawing her into the conversation as he had invariably done before maggie and philip are not looking happy thought lucy this first interview has been saddening to them  i think we people who have not been galloping she said to stephen are all a little damped by the rain let us have some music we ought to take advantage of having philip and you together give us the duet in masaniello maggie has not heard that and i know it will suit her  come then said stephen going toward the piano and giving a foretaste of the tune in his deep brumbrum very pleasant to hear  you please philipyou play the accompaniment said lucy and then i can go on with my work you will like to play shant you she added with a pretty inquiring look anxious as usual lest she should have proposed what was not pleasant to another but with yearnings toward her unfinished embroidery  philip had brightened at the proposition for there is no feeling perhaps except the extremes of fear and grief that does not find relief in musicthat does not make a man sing or play the better and philip had an abundance of pentup feeling at this moment as complex as any trio or quartet that was ever meant to express love and jealousy and resignation and fierce suspicion all at the same time  oh yes he said seating himself at the piano it is a way of eking out ones imperfect life and being three people at onceto sing and make the piano sing and hear them both all the whileor else to sing and paint  ah there you are an enviable fellow i can do nothing with my hands said stephen that has generally been observed in men of great administrative capacity i believea tendency to predominance of the reflective powers in me havent you observed that miss tulliver  stephen had fallen by mistake into his habit of playful appeal to maggie and she could not repress the answering flush and epigram  i have observed a tendency to predominance she said smiling and philip at that moment devoutly hoped that she found the tendency disagreeable  come come said lucy music music we will discuss each others qualities another time  maggie always tried in vain to go on with her work when music began she tried harder than ever today for the thought that stephen knew how much she cared for his singing was one that no longer roused a merely playful resistance and she knew too that it was his habit always to stand so that he could look at her but it was of no use she soon threw her work down and all her intentions were lost in the vague state of emotion produced by the inspiring duetemotion that seemed to make her at once strong and weak strong for all enjoyment weak for all resistance when the strain passed into the minor she half started from her seat with the sudden thrill of that change poor maggie she looked very beautiful when her soul was being played on in this way by the inexorable power of sound you might have seen the slightest perceptible quivering through her whole frame as she leaned a little forward clasping her hands as if to steady herself while her eyes dilated and brightened into that wideopen childish expression of wondering delight which always came back in her happiest moments lucy who at other times had always been at the piano when maggie was looking in this way could not resist the impulse to steal up to her and kiss her philip too caught a glimpse of her now and then round the open book on the desk and felt that he had never before seen her under so strong an influence  more more said lucy when the duet had been encored something spirited again maggie always says she likes a great rush of sound  it must be let us take the road then said stephenso suitable for a wet morning but are you prepared to abandon the most sacred duties of life and come and sing with us  oh yes said lucy laughing if you will look out the beggars opera from the large canterbury it has a dingy cover  that is a great clue considering there are about a score covers here of rival dinginess said stephen drawing out the canterbury  oh play something the while philip said lucy noticing that his fingers were wandering over the keys what is that you are falling intosomething delicious that i dont know  dont you know that said philip bringing out the tune more definitely its from the sonnambulaah perchè non posso odiarti i dont know the opera but it appears the tenor is telling the heroine that he shall always love her though she may forsake him youve heard me sing it to the english words i love thee still  it was not quite unintentionally that philip had wandered into this song which might be an indirect expression to maggie of what he could not prevail on himself to say to her directly her ears had been open to what he was saying and when he began to sing she understood the plaintive passion of the music that pleading tenor had no very fine qualities as a voice but it was not quite new to her it had sung to her by snatches in a subdued way among the grassy walks and hollows and underneath the leaning ashtree in the red deeps there seemed to be some reproach in the words did philip mean that she wished she had assured him more distinctly in their conversation that she desired not to renew the hope of love between them only because it clashed with her inevitable circumstances she was touched not thrilled by the song it suggested distinct memories and thoughts and brought quiet regret in the place of excitement  thats the way with you tenors said stephen who was waiting with music in his hand while philip finished the song you demoralize the fair sex by warbling your sentimental love and constancy under all sorts of vile treatment nothing short of having your heads served up in a dish like that mediæval tenor or troubadour would prevent you from expressing your entire resignation i must administer an antidote while miss deane prepares to tear herself away from her bobbins  stephen rolled out with saucy energy    shall i wasting in despair   die because a womans fair  and seemed to make all the air in the room alive with a new influence lucy always proud of what stephen did went toward the piano with laughing admiring looks at him and maggie in spite of her resistance to the spirit of the song and to the singer was taken hold of and shaken by the invisible influencewas borne along by a wave too strong for her  but angrily resolved not to betray herself she seized her work and went on making false stitches and pricking her fingers with much perseverance not looking up or taking notice of what was going forward until all the three voices united in let us take the road  i am afraid there would have been a subtle stealing gratification in her mind if she had known how entirely this saucy defiant stephen was occupied with her how he was passing rapidly from a determination to treat her with ostentatious indifference to an irritating desire for some sign of inclination from hersome interchange of subdued word or look with her it was not long before he found an opportunity when they had passed to the music of the tempest maggie feeling the need of a footstool was walking across the room to get one when stephen who was not singing just then and was conscious of all her movements guessed her want and flew to anticipate her lifting the footstool with an entreating look at her which made it impossible not to return a glance of gratitude and then to have the footstool placed carefully by a too selfconfident personagenot any selfconfident personage but one in particular who suddenly looks humble and anxious and lingers bending still to ask if there is not some draught in that position between the window and the fireplace and if he may not be allowed to move the worktable for herthese things will summon a little of the too ready traitorous tenderness into a womans eyes compelled as she is in her girlish time to learn her lifelessons in very trivial language and to maggie such things had not been everyday incidents but were a new element in her life and found her keen appetite for homage quite fresh that tone of gentle solicitude obliged her to look at the face that was bent toward her and to say no thank you and nothing could prevent that mutual glance from being delicious to both as it had been the evening before  it was but an ordinary act of politeness in stephen it had hardly taken two minutes and lucy who was singing scarcely noticed it but to philips mind filled already with a vague anxiety that was likely to find a definite ground for itself in any trivial incident this sudden eagerness in stephen and the change in maggies face which was plainly reflecting a beam from his seemed so strong a contrast with the previous overwrought signs of indifference as to be charged with painful meaning stephens voice pouring in again jarred upon his nervous susceptibility as if it had been the clang of sheetiron and he felt inclined to make the piano shriek in utter discord he had really seen no communicable ground for suspecting any ususual feeling between stephen and maggie his own reason told him so and he wanted to go home at once that he might reflect coolly on these false images till he had convinced himself of their nullity but then again he wanted to stay as long as stephen stayedalways to be present when stephen was present with maggie it seemed to poor philip so natural nay inevitable that any man who was near maggie should fall in love with her there was no promise of happiness for her if she were beguiled into loving stephen guest and this thought emboldened philip to view his own love for her in the light of a less unequal offering he was beginning to play very falsely under this deafening inward tumult and lucy was looking at him in astonishment when mrs tullivers entrance to summon them to lunch came as an excuse for abruptly breaking off the music  ah mr philip said mr deane when they entered the diningroom ive not seen you for a long while your fathers not at home i think is he i went after him to the office the other day and they said he was out of town  hes been to mudport on business for several days said philip but hes come back now  as fond of his farming hobby as ever eh  i believe so said philip rather wondering at this sudden interest in his fathers pursuits  ah said mr deane hes got some land in his own hands on this side the river as well as the other i think  yes he has  ah continued mr deane as he dispensed the pigeonpie he must find farming a heavy iteman expensive hobby i never had a hobby myself never would give in to that and the worst of all hobbies are those that people think they can get money at they shoot their money down like corn out of a sack then  lucy felt a little nervous under her fathers apparently gratuitous criticism of mr wakems expenditure but it ceased there and mr deane became unusually silent and meditative during his luncheon lucy accustomed to watch all indications in her father and having reasons which had recently become strong for an extra interest in what referred to the wakems felt an unusual curiosity to know what had prompted her fathers questions his subsequent silence made her suspect there had been some special reason for them in his mind  with this idea in her head she resorted to her usual plan when she wanted to tell or ask her father anything particular she found a reason for her aunt tulliver to leaving the diningroom after dinner and seated herself on a small stool at her fathers knee mr deane under those circumstances considered that he tasted some of the most agreeable moments his merits had purchased him in life notwithstanding that lucy disliking to have her hair powdered with snuff usually began by mastering his snuffbox on such occasions  you dont want to go to sleep yet papa do you she said as she brought up her stool and opened the large fingers that clutched the snuffbox  not yet said mr deane glancing at the reward of merit in the decanter but what do you want he added pinching the dimpled chin fondlyto coax some more sovereigns out of my pocket for your bazaar eh  no i have no base motives at all today i only want to talk not to beg i want to know what made you ask philip wakem about his fathers farming today papa it seemed rather odd because you never hardly say anything to him about his father and why should you care about mr wakems losing money by his hobby  something to do with business said mr deane waving his hands as if to repel intrusion into that mystery  but papa you always say mr wakem has brought philip up like a girl how came you to think you should get any business knowledge out of him those abrupt questions sounded rather oddly philip thought them queer  nonsense child said mr deane willing to justify his social demeanor with which he had taken some pains in his upward progress theres a report that wakems mill and farm on the other side of the riverdorlcote mill your uncle tullivers you knowisnt answering so well as it did i wanted to see if your friend philip would let anything out about his fathers being tired of farming  why would you buy the mill papa if he would part with it said lucy eagerly oh tell me everything here you shall have your snuffbox if youll tell me because maggie says all their hearts are set on toms getting back the mill some time it was one of the last things her father said to tom that he must get back the mill  hush you little puss said mr deane availing himself of the restored snuffbox you must not say a word about this thing do you hear theres very little chance of their getting the mill or of anybodys getting it out of wakems hands and if he knew that we wanted it with a view to the tullivers getting it again hed be the less likely to part with it its natural after what happened he behaved well enough to tulliver before but a horsewhipping is not likely to be paid for with sugarplums  now papa said lucy with a little air of solemnity will you trust me you must not ask me all my reasons for what im going to say but i have very strong reasons and im very cautious i am indeed  well let us hear  why i believe if you will let me take philip wakem into our confidencelet me tell him all about your wish to buy and what its for that my cousins wish to have it and why they wish to have iti believe philip would help to bring it about i know he would desire to do it  i dont see how that can be child said mr deane looking puzzled why should he carethen with a sudden penetrating look at his daughter you dont think the poor lads fond of you and so you can make him do what you like mr deane felt quite safe about his daughters affections  no papa he cares very little about menot so much as i care about him but i have a reason for being quite sure of what i say dont you ask me and if you ever guess dont tell me only give me leave to do as i think fit about it  lucy rose from her stool to seat herself on her fathers knee and kissed him with that last request  are you sure you wont do mischief now he said looking at her with delight  yes papa quite sure im very wise ive got all your business talents didnt you admire my accomptbook now when i showed it you  well well if this youngster will keep his counsel there wont be much harm done and to tell the truth i think theres not much chance for us any other way now let me go off to sleep    chapter viii  wakem in a new light   before three days had passed after the conversation you have just overheard between lucy and her father she had contrived to have a private interview with philip during a visit of maggies to her aunt glegg for a day and a night philip turned over in his mind with restless agitation all that lucy had told him in that interview till he had thoroughly resolved on a course of action he thought he saw before him now a possibility of altering his position with respect to maggie and removing at least one obstacle between them he laid his plan and calculated all his moves with the fervid deliberation of a chessplayer in the days of his first ardor and was amazed himself at his sudden genius as a tactician his plan was as bold as it was thoroughly calculated having watched for a moment when his father had nothing more urgent on his hands than the newspaper he went behind him laid a hand on his shoulder and said  father will you come up into my sanctum and look at my new sketches ive arranged them now  im getting terrible stiff in the joints phil for climbing those stairs of yours said wakem looking kindly at his son as he laid down his paper but come along then  this is a nice place for you isnt it phila capital light that from the roof eh was as usual the first thing he said on entering the paintingroom he liked to remind himself and his son too that his fatherly indulgence had provided the accommodation he had been a good father emily would have nothing to reproach him with there if she came back again from her grave  come come he said putting his double eyeglass over his nose and seating himself to take a general view while he rested youve got a famous show here upon my word i dont see that your things arent as good as that london artistswhats his namethat leyburn gave so much money for  philip shook his head and smiled he had seated himself on his paintingstool and had taken a lead pencil in his hand with which he was making strong marks to counteract the sense of tremulousness he watched his father get up and walk slowly round goodnaturedly dwelling on the pictures much longer than his amount of genuine taste for landscape would have prompted till he stopped before a stand on which two pictures were placedone much larger than the other the smaller one in a leather case  bless me what have you here said wakem startled by a sudden transition from landscape to portrait i thought youd left off figures who are these  they are the same person said philip with calm promptness at different ages  and what person said wakem sharply fixing his eyes with a growing look of suspicion on the larger picture  miss tulliver the small one is something like what she was when i was at school with her brother at kings lorton the larger one is not quite so good a likeness of what she was when i came from abroad  wakem turned round fiercely with a flushed face letting his eyeglass fall and looking at his son with a savage expression for a moment as if he was ready to strike that daring feebleness from the stool but he threw himself into the armchair again and thrust his hands into his trouserpockets still looking angrily at his son however philip did not return the look but sat quietly watching the point of his pencil  and do you mean to say then that you have had any acquaintance with her since you came from abroad said wakem at last with that vain effort which rage always makes to throw as much punishment as it desires to inflict into words and tones since blows are forbidden  yes i saw a great deal of her for a whole year before her fathers death we met often in that thicketthe red deepsnear dorlcote mill i love her dearly i shall never love any other woman i have thought of her ever since she was a little girl  go on sir and you have corresponded with her all this while  no i never told her i loved her till just before we parted and she promised her brother not to see me again or to correspond with me i am not sure that she loves me or would consent to marry me but if she would consentif she did love me well enoughi should marry her  and this is the return you make me for all the indulgences ive heaped on you said wakem getting white and beginning to tremble under an enraged sense of impotence before philips calm defiance and concentration of purpose  no father said philip looking up at him for the first time i dont regard it as a return you have been an indulgent father to me but i have always felt that it was because you had an affectionate wish to give me as much happiness as my unfortunate lot would admit not that it was a debt you expected me to pay by sacrificing all my chances of happiness to satisfy feelings of yours which i can never share  i think most sons would share their fathers feelings in this case said wakem bitterly the girls father was an ignorant mad brute who was within an inch of murdering me the whole town knows it and the brother is just as insolent only in a cooler way he forbade her seeing you you say hell break every bone in your body for your greater happiness if you dont take care but you seem to have made up your mind you have counted the consequences i suppose of course you are independent of me you can marry this girl tomorrow if you like you are a man of fiveandtwentyyou can go your way and i can go mine we need have no more to do with each other  wakem rose and walked toward the door but something held him back and instead of leaving the room he walked up and down it philip was slow to reply and when he spoke his tone had a more incisive quietness and clearness than ever  no i cant marry miss tulliver even if she would have me if i have only my own resources to maintain her with i have been brought up to no profession i cant offer her poverty as well as deformity  ah there is a reason for your clinging to me doubtless said wakem still bitterly though philips last words had given him a pang they had stirred a feeling which had been a habit for a quarter of a century he threw himself into the chair again  i expected all this said philip i know these scenes are often happening between father and son if i were like other men of my age i might answer your angry words by still angrier we might part i should marry the woman i love and have a chance of being as happy as the rest but if it will be a satisfaction to you to annihilate the very object of everything youve done for me you have an advantage over most fathers you can completely deprive me of the only thing that would make my life worth having  philip paused but his father was silent  you know best what satisfaction you would have beyond that of gratifying a ridiculous rancor worthy only of wandering savages  ridiculous rancor wakem burst out what do you mean damn it is a man to be horsewhipped by a boor and love him for it besides theres that cold proud devil of a son who said a word to me i shall not forget when we had the settling he would be as pleasant a mark for a bullet as i know if he were worth the expense  i dont mean your resentment toward them said philip who had his reasons for some sympathy with this view of tom though a feeling of revenge is not worth much that you should care to keep it i mean your extending the enmity to a helpless girl who has too much sense and goodness to share their narrow prejudices she has never entered into the family quarrels  what does that signify we dont ask what a woman does we ask whom she belongs to its altogether a degrading thing to you to think of marrying old tullivers daughter  for the first time in the dialogue philip lost some of his selfcontrol and colored with anger  miss tulliver he said with bitter incisiveness has the only grounds of rank that anything but vulgar folly can suppose to belong to the middle class she is thoroughly refined and her friends whatever else they may be are respected for irreproachable honor and integrity all st oggs i fancy would pronounce her to be more than my equal  wakem darted a glance of fierce question at his son but philip was not looking at him and with a certain penitent consciousness went on in a few moments as if in amplification of his last words  find a single person in st oggs who will not tell you that a beautiful creature like her would be throwing herself away on a pitiable object like me  not she said wakem rising again and forgetting everything else in a burst of resentful pride half fatherly half personal it would be a deuced fine match for her its all stuff about an accidental deformity when a girls really attached to a man  but girls are not apt to get attached under those circumstances said philip  well then said wakem rather brutally trying to recover his previous position if she doesnt care for you you might have spared yourself the trouble of talking to me about her and you might have spared me the trouble of refusing my consent to what was never likely to happen  wakem strode to the door and without looking round again banged it after him  philip was not without confidence that his father would be ultimately wrought upon as he had expected by what had passed but the scene had jarred upon his nerves which were as sensitive as a womans he determined not to go down to dinner he couldnt meet his father again that day it was wakems habit when he had no company at home to go out in the evening often as early as halfpast seven and as it was far on in the afternoon now philip locked up his room and went out for a long ramble thinking he would not return until his father was out of the house again he got into a boat and went down the river to a favorite village where he dined and lingered till it was late enough for him to return he had never had any sort of quarrel with his father before and had a sickening fear that this contest just begun might go on for weeks and what might not happen in that time he would not allow himself to define what that involuntary question meant but if he could once be in the position of maggies accepted acknowledged lover there would be less room for vague dread he went up to his paintingroom again and threw himself with a sense of fatigue into the armchair looking round absently at the views of water and rock that were ranged around till he fell into a doze in which he fancied maggie was slipping down a glistening green slimy channel of a waterfall and he was looking on helpless till he was awakened by what seemed a sudden awful crash  it was the opening of the door and he could hardly have dozen more than a few moments for there was no perceptible change in the evening light it was his father who entered and when philip moved to vacate the chair for him he said  sit still id rather walk about  he stalked up and down the room once or twice and then standing opposite philip with his hands thrust in his side pockets he said as if continuing a conversation that had not been broken off  but this girl seems to have been fond of you phil else she wouldnt have met you in that way  philips heart was beating rapidly and a transient flush passed over his face like a gleam it was not quite easy to speak at once  she liked me at kings lorton when she was a little girl because i used to sit with her brother a great deal when he had hurt his foot she had kept that in her memory and thought of me as a friend of a long while ago she didnt think of me as a lover when she met me  well but you made love to her at last what did she say then said wakem walking about again  she said she did love me then  confound it then what else do you want is she a jilt  she was very young then said philip hesitatingly im afraid she hardly knew what she felt im afraid our long separation and the idea that events must always divide us may have made a difference  but shes in the town ive seen her at church havent you spoken to her since you came back  yes at mr deanes but i couldnt renew my proposals to her on several grounds one obstacle would be removed if you would give your consentif you would be willing to think of her as a daughterinlaw  wakem was silent a little while pausing before maggies picture  shes not the sort of woman your mother was though phil he said at last i saw her at churchshes handsomer than thisdeuced fine eyes and fine figure i saw but rather dangerous and unmanageable eh  shes very tender and affectionate and so simplewithout the airs and petty contrivances other women have  ah said wakem then looking round at his son but your mother looked gentler she had that brown wavy hair and gray eyes like yours you cant remember her very well it was a thousand pities id no likeness of her  then shouldnt you be glad for me to have the same sort of happiness father to sweeten my life for me there can never be another tie so strong to you as that which began eightandtwenty years ago when you married my mother and you have been tightening it ever since  ah phil youre the only fellow that knows the best of me said wakem giving his hand to his son we must keep together if we can and now what am i to do you must come downstairs and tell me am i to go and call on this darkeyed damsel  the barrier once thrown down in this way philip could talk freely to his father of their entire relation with the tulliversof the desire to get the mill and land back into the family and of its transfer to guest  co as an intermediate step he could venture now to be persuasive and urgent and his father yielded with more readiness than he had calculated on  i dont care about the mill he said at last with a sort of angry compliance ive had an infernal deal of bother lately about the mill let them pay me for my improvements thats all but theres one thing you neednt ask me i shall have no direct transactions with young tulliver if you like to swallow him for his sisters sake you may but ive no sauce that will make him go down  i leave you to imagine the agreeable feelings with which philip went to mr deane the next day to say that mr wakem was ready to open the negotiations and lucys pretty triumph as she appealed to her father whether she had not proved her great business abilities mr deane was rather puzzled and suspected that there had been something going on among the young people to which he wanted a clew but to men of mr deanes stamp what goes on among the young people is as extraneous to the real business of life as what goes on among the birds and butterflies until it can be shown to have a malign bearing on monetary affairs and in this case the bearing appeared to be entirely propitious    chapter ix  charity in fulldress   the culmination of maggies career as an admired member of society in st oggs was certainly the day of the bazaar when her simple noble beauty clad in a white muslin of some softfloating kind which i suspect must have come from the stores of aunt pullets wardrobe appeared with marked distinction among the more adorned and conventional women around her we perhaps never detect how much of our social demeanor is made up of artificial airs until we see a person who is at once beautiful and simple without the beauty we are apt to call simplicity awkwardness the miss guests were much too wellbred to have any of the grimaces and affected tones that belong to pretentious vulgarity but their stall being next to the one where maggie sat it seemed newly obvious today that miss guest held her chin too high and that miss laura spoke and moved continually with a view to effect  all welldressed st oggs and its neighborhood were there and it would have been worth while to come even from a distance to see the fine old hall with its open roof and carved oaken rafters and great oaken foldingdoors and light shed down from a height on the manycolored show beneath a very quaint place with broad faded stripes painted on the walls and here and there a show of heraldic animals of a bristly longsnouted character the cherished emblems of a noble family once the seigniors of this now civic hall a grand arch cut in the upper wall at one end surmounted an oaken orchestra with an open room behind it where hothouse plants and stalls for refreshments were disposed an agreeable resort for gentlemen disposed to loiter and yet to exchange the occasional crush down below for a more commodious point of view in fact the perfect fitness of this ancient building for an admirable modern purpose that made charity truly elegant and led through vanity up to the supply of a deficit was so striking that hardly a person entered the room without exchanging the remark more than once near the great arch over the orchestra was the stone oriel with painted glass which was one of the venerable inconsistencies of the old hall and it was close by this that lucy had her stall for the convenience of certain large plain articles which she had taken charge of for mrs kenn maggie had begged to sit at the open end of the stall and to have the sale of these articles rather than of beadmats and other elaborate products of which she had but a dim understanding but it soon appeared that the gentlemens dressinggowns which were among her commodities were objects of such general attention and inquiry and excited so troublesome a curiosity as to their lining and comparative merits together with a determination to test them by trying on as to make her post a very conspicuous one the ladies who had commodities of their own to sell and did not want dressinggowns saw at once the frivolity and bad taste of this masculine preference for goods which any tailor could furnish and it is possible that the emphatic notice of various kinds which was drawn toward miss tulliver on this public occasion threw a very strong and unmistakable light on her subsequent conduct in many minds then present not that anger on account of spurned beauty can dwell in the celestial breasts of charitable ladies but rather that the errors of persons who have once been much admired necessarily take a deeper tinge from the mere force of contrast and also that today maggies conspicuous position for the first time made evident certain characteristics which were subsequently felt to have an explanatory bearing there was something rather bold in miss tullivers direct gaze and something undefinably coarse in the style of her beauty which placed her in the opinion of all feminine judges far below her cousin miss deane for the ladies of st oggs had now completely ceded to lucy their hypothetic claims on the admiration of mr stephen guest  as for dear little lucy herself her late benevolent triumph about the mill and all the affectionate projects she was cherishing for maggie and philip helped to give her the highest spirits today and she felt nothing but pleasure in the evidence of maggies attractiveness it is true she was looking very charming herself and stephen was paying her the utmost attention on this public occasion jealously buying up the articles he had seen under her fingers in the process of making and gayly helping her to cajole the male customers into the purchase of the most effeminate futilities he chose to lay aside his hat and wear a scarlet fez of her embroidering but by superficial observers this was necessarily liable to be interpreted less as a compliment to lucy than as a mark of coxcombry guest is a great coxcomb young torry observed but then he is a privileged person in st oggshe carries all before him if another fellow did such things everybody would say he made a fool of himself  and stephen purchased absolutely nothing from maggie until lucy said in rather a vexed undertone  see now all the things of maggies knitting will be gone and you will not have bought one there are those deliciously soft warm things for the wristsdo buy them  oh no said stephen they must be intended for imaginative persons who can chill themselves on this warm day by thinking of the frosty caucasus stern reason is my forte you know you must get philip to buy those by the way why doesnt he come  he never likes going where there are many people though i enjoined him to come he said he would buy up any of my goods that the rest of the world rejected but now do go and buy something of maggie  no no see she has got a customer there is old wakem himself just coming up  lucys eyes turned with anxious interest toward maggie to see how she went through this first interview since a sadly memorable time with a man toward whom she must have so strange a mixture of feelings but she was pleased to notice that wakem had tact enough to enter at once into talk about the bazaar wares and appear interested in purchasing smiling now and then kindly at maggie and not calling on her to speak much as if he observed that she was rather pale and tremulous  why wakem is making himself particularly amiable to your cousin said stephen in an undertone to lucy is it pure magnanimity you talked of a family quarrel  oh that will soon be quite healed i hope said lucy becoming a little indiscreet in her satisfaction and speaking with an air of significance but stephen did not appear to notice this and as some ladypurchasers came up he lounged on toward maggies end handling trifles and standing aloof until wakem who had taken out his purse had finished his t transactions  my son came with me he overheard wakem saying but he has vanished into some other part of the building and has left all these charitable gallantries to me i hope youll reproach him for his shabby conduct  she returned his smile and bow without speaking and he turned away only then observing stephen and nodding to him maggie conscious that stephen was still there busied herself with counting money and avoided looking up she had been well pleased that he had devoted himself to lucy today and had not come near her they had begun the morning with an indifferent salutation and both had rejoiced in being aloof from each other like a patient who has actually done without his opium in spite of former failures in resolution and during the last few days they had even been making up their minds to failures looking to the outward events that must soon come to separate them as a reason for dispensing with selfconquest in detail  stephen moved step by step as if he were being unwillingly dragged until he had got round the open end of the stall and was half hidden by a screen of draperies maggie went on counting her money till she suddenly heard a deep gentle voice saying arent you very tried do let me bring you somethingsome fruit or jelly maynt i  the unexpected tones shook her like a sudden accidental vibration of a harp close by her  oh no thank you she said faintly and only half looking up for an instant  you look so pale stephen insisted in a more entreating tone im sure youre exhausted i must disobey you and bring something  no indeed i couldnt take it  are you angry with me what have i done do look at me  pray go away said maggie looking at him helplessly her eyes glancing immediately from him to the opposite corner of the orchestra which was half hidden by the folds of the old faded green curtain maggie had no sooner uttered this entreaty than she was wretched at the admission it implied but stephen turned away at once and following her upward glance he saw philip wakem sealed in the halfhidden corner so that he could command little more than that angle of the hall in which maggie sat an entirely new though occurred to stephen and linking itself with what he had observed of wakems manner and with lucys reply to his observation it convinced him that there had been some former relation between philip and maggie beyond that childish one of which he had heard more than one impulse made him immediately leave the hall and go upstairs to the refreshmentroom where walking up to philip he sat down behind him and put his hand on his shoulder  are you studying for a portrait phil he said or for a sketch of that oriel window by george it makes a capital bit from this dark corner with the curtain just marking it off  i have been studying expression said philip curtly  what miss tullivers its rather of the savagemoody order today i thinksomething of the fallen princess serving behind a counter her cousin sent me to her with a civil offer to get her some refreshment but i have been snubbed as usual theres natural antipathy between us i suppose i have seldom the honor to please her  what a hypocrite you are said philip flushing angrily  what because experience must have told me that im universally pleasing i admit the law but theres some disturbing force here  i am going said philip rising abruptly  so am ito get a breath of fresh air this place gets oppressive i think i have done suit and service long enough  the two friends walked downstairs together without speaking philip turned through the outer door into the courtyard but stephen saying oh by the by i must call in here went on along the passage to one of the rooms at the other end of the building which were appropriated to the town library he had the room all to himself and a man requires nothing less than this when he wants to dash his cap on the table throw himself astride a chair and stare at a high brick wall with a frown which would not have been beneath the occasion if he had been slaying the giant python the conduct that issues from a moral conflict has often so close a resemblance to vice that the distinction escapes all outward judgments founded on a mere comparison of actions it is clear to you i hope that stephen was not a hypocritecapable of deliberate doubleness for a selfish end and yet his fluctuations between the indulgence of a feeling and the systematic concealment of it might have made a good case in support of philips accusation  meanwhile maggie sat at her stall cold and trembling with that painful sensation in the eyes which comes from resolutely repressed tears was her life to be always like thisalways bringing some new source of inward strife she heard confusedly the busy indifferent voices around her and wished her mind could flow into that easy babbling current it was at this moment that dr kenn who had quite lately come into the hall and was now walking down the middle with his hands behind him taking a general view fixed his eyes on maggie for the first time and was struck with the expression of pain on her beautiful face she was sitting quite still for the stream of customers had lessened at this late hour in the afternoon the gentlemen had chiefly chosen the middle of the day and maggies stall was looking rather bare this with her absent pained expression finished the contrast between her and her companions who were all bright eager and busy he was strongly arrested her face had naturally drawn his attention as a new and striking one at church and he had been introduced to her during a short call on business at mr deanes but he had never spoken more than three words to her he walked toward her now and maggie perceiving some one approaching roused herself to look up and be prepared to speak she felt a childlike instinctive relief from the sense of uneasiness in this exertion when she saw it was dr kenns face that was looking at her that plain middleaged face with a grave penetrating kindness in it seeming to tell of a human being who had reached a firm safe strand but was looking with helpful pity toward the strugglers still tossed by the waves had an effect on maggie at this moment which was afterward remembered by her as if it had been a promise the middleaged who have lived through their strongest emotions but are yet in the time when memory is still half passionate and not merely contemplative should surely be a sort of natural priesthood whom life has disciplined and consecrated to be the refuge and rescue of early stumblers and victims of selfdespair most of us at some moment in our young lives would have welcomed a priest of that natural order in any sort of canonicals or uncanonicals but had to scramble upward into all the difficulties of nineteen entirely without such aid as maggie did  you find your office rather a fatiguing one i fear miss tulliver said dr kenn  it is rather said maggie simply not being accustomed to simpler amiable denials of obvious facts  but i can tell mrs kenn that you have disposed of her goods very quickly he added she will be very much obliged to you  oh i have done nothing the gentlemen came very fast to buy the dressinggowns and embroidered waistcoats but i think any of the other ladies would have sold more i didnt know what to say about them  dr kenn smiled i hope im going to have you as a permanent parishioner now miss tulliver am i you have been at a distance from us hitherto  i have been a teacher in a school and im going into another situation of the same kind very soon  ah i was hoping you would remain among your friends who are all in this neighborhood i believe  oh i must go said maggie earnestly looking at dr kenn with an expression of reliance as if she had told him her history in those three words it was one of those moments of implicit revelation which will sometimes happen even between people who meet quite transientlyon a miles journey perhaps or when resting by the wayside there is always this possibility of a word or look from a stranger to keep alive the sense of human brotherhood  dr kenns ear and eye took in all the signs that this brief confidence of maggies was charged with meaning  i understand he said you feel it right to go but that will not prevent our meeting again i hope it will not prevent my knowing you better if i can be of any service to you  he put out his hand and pressed hers kindly before he turned away  she has some trouble or other at heart he thought poor child she looks as if she might turn out to be one of    the souls by nature pitched too high   by suffering plunged too low  theres something wonderfully honest in those beautiful eyes  it may be surprising that maggie among whose many imperfections an excessive delight in admiration and acknowledged supremacy were not absent now any more than when she was instructing the gypsies with a view toward achieving a royal position among them was not more elated on a day when she had had the tribute of so many looks and smiles together with that satisfactory consciousness which had necessarily come from being taken before lucys chevalglass and made to look at the full length of her tall beauty crowned by the night of her massy hair maggie had smiled at herself then and for the moment had forgotten everything in the sense of her own beauty if that state of mind could have lasted her choice would have been to have stephen guest at her feet offering her a life filled with all luxuries with daily incense of adoration near and distant and with all possibilities of culture at her command but there were things in her stronger than vanitypassion and affection and long deep memories of early discipline and effort of early claims on her love and pity and the stream of vanity was soon swept along and mingled imperceptibly with that wider current which was at its highest force today under the double urgency of the events and inward impulses brought by the last week  philip had not spoken to her himself about the removal of obstacles between them on his fathers sidehe shrank from that but he had told everything to lucy with the hope that maggie being informed through her might give him some encouraging sign that their being brought thus much nearer to each other was a happiness to her the rush of conflicting feelings was too great for maggie to say much when lucy with a face breathing playful joy like one of correggios cherubs poured forth her triumphant revelation and lucy could hardly be surprised that she could do little more than cry with gladness at the thought of her fathers wish being fulfilled and of toms getting the mill again in reward for all his hard striving the details of preparation for the bazaar had then come to usurp lucys attention for the next few days and nothing had been said by the cousins on subjects that were likely to rouse deeper feelings philip had been to the house more than once but maggie had had no private conversation with him and thus she had been left to fight her inward battle without interference  but when the bazaar was fairly ended and the cousins were alone again resting together at home lucy said  you must give up going to stay with your aunt moss the day after tomorrow maggie write a note to her and tell her you have put it off at my request and ill send the man with it she wont be displeased youll have plenty of time to go byandby and i dont want you to go out of the way just now  yes indeed i must go dear i cant put it off i wouldnt leave aunt gritty out for the world and i shall have very little time for im going away to a new situation on the 25th of june  maggie said lucy almost white with astonishment  i didnt tell you dear said maggie making a great effort to command herself because youve been so busy but some time ago i wrote to our old governess miss firniss to ask her to let me know if she met with any situation that i could fill and the other day i had a letter from her telling me that i could take three orphan pupils of hers to the coast during the holidays and then make trial of a situation with her as teacher i wrote yesterday to accept the offer  lucy felt so hurt that for some moments she was unable to speak  maggie she said at last how could you be so unkind to menot to tell meto take such a stepand now she hesitated a little and then added and philip i thought everything was going to be so happy oh maggie what is the reason give it up let me write there is nothing now to keep you and philip apart  yes said maggie faintly there is toms feeling he said i must give him up if i married philip and i know he will not changeat least not for a long whileunless something happened to soften him  but i will talk to him hes coming back this week and this good news about the mill will soften him and ill talk to him about philip toms always very compliant to me i dont think hes so obstinate  but i must go said maggie in a distressed voice i must leave some time to pack dont press me to stay dear lucy  lucy was silent for two or three minutes looking away and ruminating at length she knelt down by her cousin and looking up in her face with anxious seriousness said  maggie is it that you dont love philip well enough to marry him tell metrust me  maggie held lucys hands tightly in silence a little while her own hands were quite cold but when she spoke her voice was quite clear and distinct  yes lucy i would choose to marry him i think it would be the best and highest lot for meto make his life happy he loved me first no one else could be quite what he is to me but i cant divide myself from my brother for life i must go away and wait pray dont speak to me again about it  lucy obeyed in pain and wonder the next word she said was  well dear maggie at least you will go to the dance at park house tomorrow and have some music and brightness before you go to pay these dull dutiful visits ah here come aunty and the tea    chapter x  the spell seems broken   the suite of rooms opening into each other at park house looked duly brilliant with lights and flowers and the personal splendors of sixteen couples with attendant parents and guardians the focus of brilliancy was the long drawingroom where the dancing went forward under the inspiration of the grand piano the library into which it opened at one end had the more sober illumination of maturity with caps and cards and at the other end the pretty sittingroom with a conservatory attached was left as an occasional cool retreat lucy who had laid aside her black for the first time and had her pretty slimness set off by an abundant dress of white crape was the acknowledged queen of the occasion for this was one of the miss guests thoroughly condescending parties including no member of any aristocracy higher than that of st oggs and stretching to the extreme limits of commercial and professional gentility  maggie at first refused to dance saying that she had forgotten all the figuresit was so many years since she had danced at school and she was glad to have that excuse for it is ill dancing with a heavy heart but at length the music wrought in her young limbs and the longing came even though it was the horrible young torry who walked up a second time to try and persuade her she warned him that she could not dance anything but a countrydance but he of course was willing to wait for that high felicity meaning only to be complimentary when he assured her at several intervals that it was a great bore that she couldnt waltz he would have liked so much to waltz with her but at last it was the turn of the good oldfashioned dance which has the least of vanity and the most of merriment in it and maggie quite forgot her troublous life in a childlike enjoyment of that halfrustic rhythm which seems to banish pretentious etiquette she felt quite charitably toward young torry as his hand bore her along and held her up in the dance her eyes and cheeks had that fire of young joy in them which will flame out if it can find the least breath to fan it and her simple black dress with its bit of black lace seemed like the dim setting of a jewel  stephen had not yet asked her to dance had not yet paid her more than a passing civility since yesterday that inward vision of her which perpetually made part of his consciousness had been half screened by the image of philip wakem which came across it like a blot there was some attachment between her and philip at least there was an attachment on his side which made her feel in some bondage here then stephen told himself was another claim of honor which called on him to resist the attraction that was continually threatening to overpower him he told himself so and yet he had once or twice felt a certain savage resistance and at another moment a shuddering repugnance to this intrusion of philips image which almost made it a new incitement to rush toward maggie and claim her for himself nevertheless he had done what he meant to do this eveninghe had kept aloof from her he had hardly looked at her and he had been gayly assiduous to lucy but now his eyes were devouring maggie he felt inclined to kick young torry out of the dance and take his place then he wanted the dance to end that he might get rid of his partner the possibility that he too should dance with maggie and have her hand in his so long was beginning to possess him like a thirst but even now their hands were meeting in the dancewere meeting still to the very end of it though they were far off each other  stephen hardly knew what happened or in what automatic way he got through the duties of politeness in the interval until he was free and saw maggie seated alone again at the farther end of the room he made his way toward her round the couples that were forming for the waltz and when maggie became conscious that she was the person he sought she felt in spite of all the thoughts that had gone before a glowing gladness at heart her eyes and cheeks were still brightened with her childlike enthusiasm in the dance her whole frame was set to joy and tenderness even the coming pain could not seem bittershe was ready to welcome it as a part of life for life at this moment seemed a keen vibrating consciousness poised above pleasure or pain this one this last night she might expand unrestrainedly in the warmth of the present without those chill eating thoughts of the past and the future  theyre going to waltz again said stephen bending to speak to her with that glance and tone of subdued tenderness which young dreams create to themselves in the summer woods when low cooing voices fill the air such glances and tones bring the breath of poetry with them into a room that is half stifling with glaring gas and hard flirtation  they are going to waltz again it is rather dizzy work to look on and the room is very warm shall we walk about a little  he took her hand and placed it within his arm and they walked on into the sittingroom where the tables were strewn with engravings for the accommodation of visitors who would not want to look at them but no visitors were here at this moment they passed on into the conservatory  how strange and unreal the trees and flowers look with the lights among them said maggie in a low voice they look as if they belonged to an enchanted land and would never fade away i could fancy they were all made of jewels  she was looking at the tier of geraniums as she spoke and stephen made no answer but he was looking at her and does not a supreme poet blend light and sound into one calling darkness mute and light eloquent something strangely powerful there was in the light of stephens long gaze for it made maggies face turn toward it and look upward at it slowly like a flower at the ascending brightness and they walked unsteadily on without feeling that they were walking without feeling anything but that long grave mutual gaze which has the solemnity belonging to all deep human passion the hovering thought that they must and would renounce each other made this moment of mute confession more intense in its rapture  but they had reached the end of the conservatory and were obliged to pause and turn the change of movement brought a new consciousness to maggie she blushed deeply turned away her head and drew her arm from stephens going up to some flowers to smell them stephen stood motionless and still pale  oh may i get this rose said maggie making a great effort to say something and dissipate the burning sense of irretrievable confession i think i am quite wicked with roses i like to gather them and smell them till they have no scent left  stephen was mute he was incapable of putting a sentence together and maggie bent her arm a little upward toward the large halfopened rose that had attracted her who has not felt the beauty of a womans arm the unspeakable suggestions of tenderness that lie in the dimpled elbow and all the varied gently lessening curves down to the delicate wrist with its tiniest almost imperceptible nicks in the firm softness a womans arm touched the soul of a great sculptor two thousand years ago so that he wrought an image of it for the parthenon which moves us still as it clasps lovingly the timeworn marble of a headless trunk maggies was such an arm as that and it had the warm tints of life  a mad impulse seized on stephen he darted toward the arm and showered kisses on it clasping the wrist  but the next moment maggie snatched it from him and glared at him like a wounded wargoddess quivering with rage and humiliation  how dare you she spoke in a deeply shaken halfsmothered voice what right have i given you to insult me  she darted from him into the adjoining room and threw herself on the sofa panting and trembling  a horrible punishment was come upon her for the sin of allowing a moments happiness that was treachery to lucy to philip to her own better soul that momentary happiness had been smitten with a blight a leprosy stephen thought more lightly of her than he did of lucy  as for stephen he leaned back against the framework of the conservatory dizzy with the conflict of passionslove rage and confused despair despair at his want of selfmastery and despair that he had offended maggie  the last feeling surmounted every other to be by her side again and entreat forgiveness was the only thing that had the force of a motive for him and she had not been seated more than a few minutes when he came and stood humbly before her but maggies bitter rage was unspent  leave me to myself if you please she said with impetuous haughtiness and for the future avoid me  stephen turned away and walked backward and forward at the other end of the room there was the dire necessity of going back into the dancingroom again and he was beginning to be conscious of that they had been absent so short a time that when he went in again the waltz was not ended  maggie too was not long before she reentered all the pride of her nature was stung into activity the hateful weakness which had dragged her within reach of this wound to her selfrespect had at least wrought its own cure the thoughts and temptations of the last month should all be flung away into an unvisited chamber of memory there was nothing to allure her now duty would be easy and all the old calm purposes would reign peacefully once more she reentered the drawingroom still with some excited brightness in her face but with a sense of proud selfcommand that defied anything to agitate her she refused to dance again but she talked quite readily and calmly with every one who addressed her and when they got home that night she kissed lucy with a free heart almost exulting in this scorching moment which had delivered her from the possibility of another word or look that would have the stamp of treachery toward that gentle unsuspicious sister  the next morning maggie did not set off to basset quite so soon as she had expected her mother was to accompany her in the carriage and household business could not be dispatched hastily by mrs tulliver so maggie who had been in a hurry to prepare herself had to sit waiting equipped for the drive in the garden lucy was busy in the house wrapping up some bazaar presents for the younger ones at basset and when there was a loud ring at the doorbell maggie felt some alarm lest lucy should bring out stephen to her it was sure to be stephen  but presently the visitor came out into the garden alone and seated himself by her on the gardenchair it was not stephen  we can just catch the tips of the scotch firs maggie from this seat said philip  they had taken each others hands in silence but maggie had looked at him with a more complete revival of the old childlike affectionate smile than he had seen before and he felt encouraged  yes she said i often look at them and wish i could see the low sunlight on the stems again but i have never been that way but onceto the churchyard with my mother  i have been there i go there continually said philip i have nothing but the past to live upon  a keen remembrance and keen pity impelled maggie to put her hand in philips they had so often walked hand in hand  i remember all the spots she saidjust where you told me of particular things beautiful stories that i had never heard of before  you will go there again soon wont you maggie said philip getting timid the mill will soon be your brothers home again  yes but i shall not be there said maggie i shall only hear of that happiness i am going away again lucy has not told you perhaps  then the future will never join on to the past again maggie that book is quite closed  the gray eyes that had so often looked up at her with entreating worship looked up at her now with a last struggling ray of hope in them and maggie met them with her large sincere gaze  that book never will be closed philip she said with grave sadness i desire no future that will break the ties of the past but the tie to my brother is one of the strongest i can do nothing willingly that will divide me always from him  is that the only reason that would keep us apart forever maggie said philip with a desperate determination to have a definite answer  the only reason said maggie with calm decision and she believed it at that moment she felt as if the enchanted cup had been dashed to the ground the reactionary excitement that gave her a proud selfmastery had not subsided and she looked at the future with a sense of calm choice  they sat hand in hand without looking at each other or speaking for a few minutes in maggies mind the first scenes of love and parting were more present than the actual moment and she was looking at philip in the red deeps  philip felt that he ought to have been thoroughly happy in that answer of hers she was as open and transparent as a rockpool why was he not thoroughly happy jealousy is never satisfied with anything short of an omniscience that would detect the subtlest fold of the heart    chapter xi  in the lane   maggie had been four days at her aunt mosss giving the early june sunshine quite a new brightness in the caredimmed eyes of that affectionate woman and making an epoch for her cousins great and small who were learning her words and actions by heart as if she had been a transient avatar of perfect wisdom and beauty  she was standing on the causeway with her aunt and a group of cousins feeding the chickens at that quiet moment in the life of the farmyards before the afternoon milkingtime the great buildings round the hollow yard were as dreary and tumbledown as ever but over the old gardenwall the straggling rosebushes were beginning to toss their summer weight and the gray wood and old bricks of the house on its higher level had a look of sleepy age in the broad afternoon sunlight that suited the quiescent time maggie with her bonnet over her arm was smiling down at the hatch of small fluffy chickens when her aunt exclaimed  goodness me who is that gentleman coming in at the gate  it was a gentleman on a tall bay horse and the flanks and neck of the horse were streaked black with fast riding maggie felt a beating at head and heart horrible as the sudden leaping to life of a savage enemy who had feigned death  who is it my dear said mrs moss seeing in maggies face the evidence that she knew  it is mr stephen guest said maggie rather faintly my cousin lucysa gentleman who is very intimate at my cousins  stephen was already close to them had jumped off his horse and now raised his hat as he advanced  hold the horse willy said mrs moss to the twelveyearold boy  no thank you said stephen pulling at the horses impatiently tossing head i must be going again immediately i have a message to deliver to you miss tulliver on private business may i take the liberty of asking you to walk a few yards with me  he had a halfjaded halfirritated look such as a man gets when he has been dogged by some care or annoyance that makes his bed and his dinner of little use to him he spoke almost abruptly as if his errand were too pressing for him to trouble himself about what would be thought by mrs moss of his visit and request good mrs moss rather nervous in the presence of this apparently haughty gentleman was inwardly wondering whether she would be doing right or wrong to invite him again to leave his horse and walk in when maggie feeling all the embarrassment of the situation and unable to say anything put on her bonnet and turned to walk toward the gate  stephen turned too and walked by her side leading his horse  not a word was spoken till they were out in the lane and had walked four or five yards when maggie who had been looking straight before her all the while turned again to walk back saying with haughty resentment  there is no need for me to go any farther i dont know whether you consider it gentlemanly and delicate conduct to place me in a position that forced me to come out with you or whether you wished to insult me still further by thrusting an interview upon me in this way  of course you are angry with me for coming said stephen bitterly of course it is of no consequence what a man has to suffer it is only your womans dignity that you care about  maggie gave a slight start such as might have come from the slightest possible electric shock  as if it were not enough that im entangled in this way that im mad with love for you that i resist the strongest passion a man can feel because i try to be true to other claims but you must treat me as if i were a coarse brute who would willingly offend you and when if i had my own choice i should ask you to take my hand and my fortune and my whole life and do what you liked with them i know i forgot myself i took an unwarrantable liberty i hate myself for having done it but i repented immediately ive been repenting ever since you ought not to think it unpardonable a man who loves with his whole soul as i do you is liable to be mastered by his feelings for a moment but you knowyou must believethat the worst pain i could have is to have pained you that i would give the world to recall the error  maggie dared not speak dared not turn her head the strength that had come from resentment was all gone and her lips were quivering visibly she could not trust herself to utter the full forgiveness that rose in answer to that confession  they were come nearly in front of the gate again and she paused trembling  you must not say these things i must not hear them she said looking down in misery as stephen came in front of her to prevent her from going farther toward the gate im very sorry for any pain you have to go through but it is of no use to speak  yes it is of use said stephen impetuously it would be of use if you would treat me with some sort of pity and consideration instead of doing me vile injustice in your mind i could bear everything more quietly if i knew you didnt hate me for an insolent coxcomb look at me see what a hunted devil i am ive been riding thirty miles every day to get away from the thought of you  maggie did notdared notlook she had already seen the harassed face but she said gently  i dont think any evil of you  then dearest look at me said stephen in deepest tenderest tones of entreaty dont go away from me yet give me a moments happiness make me feel youve forgiven me  yes i do forgive you said maggie shaken by those tones and all the more frightened at herself but pray let me go in again pray go away  a great tear fell from under her lowered eyelids  i cant go away from you i cant leave you said stephen with still more passionate pleading i shall come back again if you send me away with this coldness i cant answer for myself but if you will go with me only a little way i can live on that you see plainly enough that your anger has only made me ten times more unreasonable  maggie turned but tancred the bay horse began to make such spirited remonstrances against this frequent change of direction that stephen catching sight of willy moss peeping through the gate called out here just come and hold my horse for five minutes  oh no said maggie hurriedly my aunt will think it so strange  never mind stephen answered impatiently they dont know the people at st oggs lead him up and down just here for five minutes he added to willy who was now close to them and then he turned to maggies side and they walked on it was clear that she must go on now  take my arm said stephen entreatingly and she took it feeling all the while as if she were sliding downward in a nightmare  there is no end to this misery she began struggling to repel the influence by speech it is wickedbaseever allowing a word or look that lucythat others might not have seen think of lucy  i do think of herbless her if i didnt stephen had laid his hand on maggies that rested on his arm and they both felt it difficult to speak  and i have other ties maggie went on at last with a desperate effort even if lucy did not exist  you are engaged to philip wakem said stephen hastily is it so  i consider myself engaged to him i dont mean to marry any one else  stephen was silent again until they had turned out of the sun into a side lane all grassy and sheltered then he burst out impetuously  it is unnatural it is horrible maggie if you loved me as i love you we should throw everything else to the winds for the sake of belonging to each other we should break all these mistaken ties that were made in blindness and determine to marry each other  i would rather die than fall into that temptation said maggie with deep slow distinctness all the gathered spiritual force of painful years coming to her aid in this extremity she drew her arm from his as she spoke  tell me then that you dont care for me he said almost violently tell me that you love some one else better  it darted through maggies mind that here was a mode of releasing herself from outward struggleto tell stephen that her whole heart was philips but her lips would not utter that and she was silent  if you do love me dearest said stephen gently taking her hand again and laying it within his arm it is betterit is right that we should marry each other we cant help the pain it will give it is come upon us without our seeking it is natural it has taken hold of me in spite of every effort i have made to resist it god knows ive been trying to be faithful to tacit engagements and ive only made things worse id better have given way at first  maggie was silent if it were not wrongif she were once convinced of that and need no longer beat and struggle against this current soft and yet strong as the summer stream  sayve s dearest said stephen leaning to look entreatingly in her face what could we care about in the whole world beside if we belonged to each other  her breath was on his face his lips were very near hers but there was a great dread dwelling in his love for her  her lips and eyelids quivered she opened her eyes full on his for an instant like a lovely wild animal timid and struggling under caresses and then turned sharp round toward home again  and after all he went on in an impatient tone trying to defeat his own scruples as well as hers i am breaking no positive engagement if lucys affections had been withdrawn from me and given to some one else i should have felt no right to assert a claim on her if you are not absolutely pledged to philip we are neither of us bound  you dont believe that it is not your real feeling said maggie earnestly you feel as i do that the real tie lies in the feelings and expectations we have raised in other minds else all pledges might be broken when there was no outward penalty there would be no such thing as faithfulness  stephen was silent he could not pursue that argument the opposite conviction had wrought in him too strongly through his previous time of struggle but it soon presented itself in a new form  the pledge cant be fulfilled he said with impetuous insistence it is unnatural we can only pretend to give ourselves to any one else there is wrong in that too there may be misery in it for them as well as for us maggie you must see that you do see that  he was looking eagerly at her face for the least sign of compliance his large firm gentle grasp was on her hand she was silent for a few moments with her eyes fixed on the ground then she drew a deep breath and said looking up at him with solemn sadness  oh it is difficultlife is very difficult it seems right to me sometimes that we should follow our strongest feeling but then such feelings continually come across the ties that all our former life has made for usthe ties that have made others dependent on usand would cut them in two if life were quite easy and simple as it might have been in paradise and we could always see that one being first toward whomi mean if life did not make duties for us before love comes love would be a sign that two people ought to belong to each other but i seei feel it is not so now there are things we must renounce in life some of us must resign love many things are difficult and dark to me but i see one thing quite clearlythat i must not cannot seek my own happiness by sacrificing others love is natural but surely pity and faithfulness and memory are natural too and they would live in me still and punish me if i did not obey them i should be haunted by the suffering i had caused our love would be poisoned dont urge me help mehelp me because i love you  maggie had become more and more earnest as she went on her face had become flushed and her eyes fuller and fuller of appealing love stephen had the fibre of nobleness in him that vibrated to her appeal but in the same momenthow could it be otherwisethat pleading beauty gained new power over him  dearest he said in scarcely more than a whisper while his arm stole round her ill do ill bear anything you wish butone kissonethe lastbefore we part  one kiss and then a long look until maggie said tremulously let me golet me make haste back  she hurried along and not another word was spoken stephen stood still and beckoned when they came within sight of willy and the horse and maggie went on through the gate mrs moss was standing alone at the door of the old porch she had sent all the cousins in with kind thoughtfulness it might be a joyful thing that maggie had a rich and handsome lover but she would naturally feel embarrassed at coming in again and it might not be joyful in either case mrs moss waited anxiously to receive maggie by herself the speaking face told plainly enough that if there was joy it was of a very agitating dubious sort  sit down here a bit my dear she drew maggie into the porch and sat down on the bench by her there was no privacy in the house  oh aunt gritty im very wretched i wish i could have died when i was fifteen it seemed so easy to give things up then it is so hard now  the poor child threw her arms round her aunts neck and fell into long deep sobs    chapter xii  a family party   maggie left her good aunt gritty at the end of the week and went to garum firs to pay her visit to aunt pullet according to agreement in the mean time very unexpected things had happened and there was to be a family party at garum to discuss and celebrate a change in the fortunes of the tullivers which was likely finally to carry away the shadow of their demerits like the last limb of an eclipse and cause their hitherto obscured virtues to shine forth in fullrounded splendor it is pleasant to know that a new ministry just come into office are not the only fellowmen who enjoy a period of high appreciation and fullblown eulogy in many respectable families throughout this realm relatives becoming creditable meet with a similar cordiality of recognition which in its fine freedom from the coercion of any antecedents suggests the hopeful possibility that we may some day without any notice find ourselves in full millennium with cockatrices who have ceased to bite and wolves that no longer show their teeth with any but the blandest intentions  lucy came so early as to have the start even of aunt glegg for she longed to have some undisturbed talk with maggie about the wonderful news it seemed did it not said lucy with her prettiest air of wisdom as if everything even other peoples misfortunes poor creatures were conspiring now to make poor dear aunt tulliver and cousin tom and naughty maggie too if she were not obstinately bent on the contrary as happy as they deserved to be after all their troubles to think that the very daythe very dayafter tom had come back from newcastle that unfortunate young jetsome whom mr wakem had placed at the mill had been pitched off his horse in a drunken fit and was lying at st oggs in a dangerous state so that wakem had signified his wish that the new purchasers should enter on the premises at once  it was very dreadful for that unhappy young man but it did seem as if the misfortune had happened then rather than at any other time in order that cousin tom might all the sooner have the fit reward of his exemplary conductpapa thought so very highly of him aunt tulliver must certainly go to the mill now and keep house for tom that was rather a loss to lucy in the matter of household comfort but then to think of poor aunty being in her old place again and gradually getting comforts about her there  on this last point lucy had her cunning projects and when she and maggie had made their dangerous way down the bright stairs into the handsome parlor where the very sunbeams seemed cleaner than elsewhere she directed her manœuvres as any other great tactician would have done against the weaker side of the enemy  aunt pullet she said seating herself on the sofa and caressingly adjusting that ladys floating capstring i want you to make up your mind what linen and things you will give tom toward housekeeping because you are always so generousyou give such nice things you know and if you set the example aunt glegg will follow  that she never can my dear said mrs pullet with unusual vigor for she hasnt got the linen to follow suit wi mine i can tell you shed niver the taste not if shed spend the money big checks and live things like stags and foxes all her tablelinen isnot a spot nor a diamond among em but its poor work dividing ones linen before one diesi niver thought to ha done that bessy mrs pullet continued shaking her head and looking at her sister tulliver when you and me chose the double diamont the first flax iver wed spun and the lord knows where yours is gone  id no choice im sure sister said poor mrs tulliver accustomed to consider herself in the light of an accused person im sure it was no wish o mine iver as i should lie awake o nights thinking o my best bleached linen all over the country  take a peppermint mrs tulliver said uncle pullet feeling that he was offering a cheap and wholesome form of comfort which he was recommending by example  oh but aunt pullet said lucy youve so much beautiful linen and suppose you had had daughters then you must have divided it when they were married  well i dont say as i wont do it said mrs pullet for now toms so lucky its nothing but right his friends should look on him and help him theres the tablecloths i bought at your sale bessy it was nothing but good natur o me to buy em for theyve been lying in the chest ever since but im not going to give maggie any more o my indy muslin and things if shes to go into service again when she might stay and keep me company and do my sewing for me if she wasnt wanted at her brothers  going into service was the expression by which the dodson mind represented to itself the position of teacher or governess and maggies return to that menial condition now circumstances offered her more eligible prospects was likely to be a sore point with all her relatives besides lucy maggie in her crude form with her hair down her back and altogether in a state of dubious promise was a most undesirable niece but now she was capable of being at once ornamental and useful the subject was revived in aunt and uncle gleggs presence over the tea and muffins  hegh hegh said mr glegg goodnaturedly patting maggie on the back nonsense nonsense dont let us hear of you taking a place again maggie why you must ha picked up halfadozen sweethearts at the bazaar isnt there one of em the right sort of article come now  mr glegg said his wife with that shade of increased politeness in her severity which she always put on with her crisper fronts youll excuse me but youre far too light for a man of your years its respect and duty to her aunts and the rest of her kin as are so good to her should have kept my niece from fixing about going away again without consulting us not sweethearts if im to use such a word though it was never heared in my family  why what did they call us when we went to see em then eh neighbor pullet they thought us sweet enough then said mr glegg winking pleasantly while mr pullet at the suggestion of sweetness took a little more sugar  mr glegg said mrs g if youre going to be undelicate let me know  la jane your husbands only joking said mrs pullet let him joke while hes got health and strength theres poor mr tilt got his mouth drawn all o one side and couldnt laugh if he was to try  ill trouble you for the muffineer then mr glegg said mrs g if i may be so bold to interrupt your joking though its other people must see the joke in a nieces putting a slight on her mothers eldest sister as is the head o the family and only coming in and out on short visits all the time shes been in the town and then settling to go away without my knowledgeas id laid caps out on purpose for her to make em up for meand me as have divided my money so equal  sister mrs tulliver broke in anxiously im sure maggie never thought o going away without staying at your house as well as the others not as its my wish she should go away at all but quite contrairy im sure im innocent ive said over and over again my dear youve no call to go away but theres ten days or a fortnight maggiell have before shes fixed to go she can stay at your house just as well and ill step in when i can and so will lucy  bessy said mrs glegg if youd exercise a little more thought you might know i should hardly think it was worth while to unpin a bed and go to all that trouble now just at the end o the time when our house isnt above a quarter of an hours walk from mr deanes she can come the first thing in the morning and go back the last at night and be thankful shes got a good aunt so close to her to come and sit with i know i should when i was her age  la jane said mrs pullet it ud do your beds good to have somebody to sleep in em theres that striped room smells dreadful mouldy and the glass mildewed like anything im sure i thought i should be struck with death when you took me in  oh there is tom exclaimed lucy clapping her hands hes come on sindbad as i told him i was afraid he was not going to keep his promise  maggie jumped up to kiss tom as he entered with strong feeling at this first meeting since the prospect of returning to the mill had been opened to him and she kept his hand leading him to the chair by her side to have no cloud between herself and tom was still a perpetual yearning in her that had its root deeper than all change he smiled at her very kindly this evening and said well magsie hows aunt moss  come come sir said mr glegg putting out his hand why youre such a big man you carry all before you it seems youre come into your luck a good deal earlier than us old folks did but i wish you joy i wish you joy youll get the mill all for your own again some day ill be bound you wont stop halfway up the hill  but i hope hell bear in mind as its his mothers family as he owes it to said mrs glegg if he hadnt had them to take after hed ha been poorly off there was never any failures nor lawing nor wastefulness in our family nor dying without wills  no nor sudden deaths said aunt pullet allays the doctor called in but tom had the dodson skin i said that from the first and i dont know what you mean to do sister glegg but i mean to give him a tablecloth of all my three biggest sizes but one besides sheets i dont say what more i shall do but that i shall do and if i should die tomorrow mr pullet youll bear it in mindthough youll be blundering with the keys and never remember as that on the third shelf o the lefthand wardrobe behind the nightcaps with the broad tiesnot the narrowfrilled unsis the key of the drawer in the blue room where the key o the blue closet is youll make a mistake and i shall niver be worthy to know it youve a memory for my pills and draughts wonderfulill allays say that of youbut youre lost among the keys this gloomy prospect of the confusion that would ensue on her decease was very affecting to mrs pullet  you carry it too far sophythat locking in and out said mrs glegg in a tone of some disgust at this folly you go beyond your own family theres nobody can say i dont lock up but i do whats reasonable and no more and as for the linen i shall look out whats serviceable to make a present of to my nephey ive got cloth as has never been whitened better worth having than other peoples fine holland and i hope hell lie down in it and think of his aunt  tom thanked mrs glegg but evaded any promise to meditate nightly on her virtues and mrs glegg effected a diversion for him by asking about mr deanes intentions concerning steam  lucy had had her farsighted views in begging tom to come on sindbad it appeared when it was time to go home that the manservant was to ride the horse and cousin tom was to drive home his mother and lucy you must sit by yourself aunty said that contriving young lady because i must sit by tom ive a great deal to say to him  in the eagerness of her affectionate anxiety for maggie lucy could not persuade herself to defer a conversation about her with tom who she thought with such a cup of joy before him as this rapid fulfilment of his wish about the mill must become pliant and flexible her nature supplied her with no key to toms and she was puzzled as well as pained to notice the unpleasant change on his countenance when she gave him the history of the way in which philip had used his influence with his father she had counted on this revelation as a great stroke of policy which was to turn toms heart toward philip at once and besides that prove that the elder wakem was ready to receive maggie with all the honors of a daughterinlaw nothing was wanted then but for dear tom who always had that pleasant smile when he looked at cousin lucy to turn completely round say the opposite of what he had always said before and declare that he for his part was delighted that all the old grievances should be healed and that maggie should have philip with all suitable despatch in cousin lucys opinion nothing could be easier  but to minds strongly marked by the positive and negative qualities that create severitystrength of will conscious rectitude of purpose narrowness of imagination and intellect great power of selfcontrol and a disposition to exert control over othersprejudices come as the natural food of tendencies which can get no sustenance out of that complex fragmentary doubtprovoking knowledge which we call truth let a prejudice be bequeathed carried in the air adopted by hearsay caught in through the eyehowever it may come these minds will give it a habitation it is something to assert strongly and bravely something to fill up the void of spontaneous ideas something to impose on others with the authority of conscious right it is at once a staff and a baton every prejudice that will answer these purposes is selfevident our good upright tom tullivers mind was of this class his inward criticism of his fathers faults did not prevent him from adopting his fathers prejudice it was a prejudice against a man of lax principle and lax life and it was a meetingpoint for all the disappointed feelings of family and personal pride other feelings added their force to produce toms bitter repugnance to philip and to maggies union with him and notwithstanding lucys power over her strongwilled cousin she got nothing but a cold refusal ever to sanction such a marriage but of course maggie could do as she likedshe had declared her determination to be independent for toms part he held himself bound by his duty to his fathers memory and by every manly feeling never to consent to any relation with the wakems  thus all that lucy had effected by her zealous mediation was to fill toms mind with the expectation that maggies perverse resolve to go into a situation again would presently metamorphose itself as her resolves were apt to do into something equally perverse but entirely differenta marriage with philip wakem    chapter xiii  borne along by the tide   in less than a week maggie was at st oggs againoutwardly in much the same position as when her visit there had just begun it was easy for her to fill her mornings apart from lucy without any obvious effort for she had her promised visits to pay to her aunt glegg and it was natural that she should give her mother more than usual of her companionship in these last weeks especially as there were preparations to be thought of for toms housekeeping but lucy would hear of no pretext for her remaining away in the evenings she must always come from aunt gleggs before dinnerelse what shall i have of you said lucy with a tearful pout that could not be resisted  and mr stephen guest had unaccountably taken to dining at mr deanes as often as possible instead of avoiding that as he used to do at first he began his mornings with a resolution that he would not dine there not even go in the evening till maggie was away he had even devised a plan of starting off on a journey in this agreeable june weather the headaches which he had constantly been alleging as a ground for stupidity and silence were a sufficient ostensible motive but the journey was not taken and by the fourth morning no distinct resolution was formed about the evenings they were only foreseen as times when maggie would still be present for a little whilewhen one more touch one more glance might be snatched for why not there was nothing to conceal between them they knew they had confessed their love and they had renounced each other they were going to part honor and conscience were going to divide them maggie with that appeal from her inmost soul had decided it but surely they might cast a lingering look at each other across the gulf before they turned away never to look again till that strange light had forever faded out of their eyes  maggie all this time moved about with a quiescence and even torpor of manner so contrasted with her usual fitful brightness and ardor that lucy would have had to seek some other cause for such a change if she had not been convinced that the position in which maggie stood between philip and her brother and the prospect of her selfimposed wearisome banishment were quite enough to account for a large amount of depression but under this torpor there was a fierce battle of emotions such as maggie in all her life of struggle had never known or foreboded it seemed to her as if all the worst evil in her had lain in ambush till now and had suddenly started up fullarmed with hideous overpowering strength there were moments in which a cruel selfishness seemed to be getting possession of her why should not lucy why should not philip suffer she had had to suffer through many years of her life and who had renounced anything for her and when something like that fulness of existencelove wealth ease refinement all that her nature cravedwas brought within her reach why was she to forego it that another might have itanother who perhaps needed it less but amidst all this new passionate tumult there were the old voices making themselves heard with rising power till from time to time the tumult seemed quelled was that existence which tempted her the full existence she dreamed where then would be all the memories of early striving all the deep pity for anothers pain which had been nurtured in her through years of affection and hardship all the divine presentiment of something higher than mere personal enjoyment which had made the sacredness of life she might as well hope to enjoy walking by maiming her feet as hope to enjoy an existence in which she set out by maiming the faith and sympathy that were the best organs of her soul and then if pain were so hard to her what was it to others ah god preserve me from inflictinggive me strength to bear it how had she sunk into this struggle with a temptation that she would once have thought herself as secure from as from deliberate crime when was that first hateful moment in which she had been conscious of a feeling that clashed with her truth affection and gratitude and had not shaken it from her with horror as if it had been a loathsome thing and yet since this strange sweet subduing influence did not should not conquer hersince it was to remain simply her own sufferingher mind was meeting stephens in that thought of his that they might still snatch moments of mute confession before the parting came for was not he suffering too she saw it dailysaw it in the sickened look of fatigue with which as soon as he was not compelled to exert himself he relapsed into indifference toward everything but the possibility of watching her could she refuse sometimes to answer that beseeching look which she felt to be following her like a low murmur of love and pain she refused it less and less till at last the evening for them both was sometimes made of a moments mutual gaze they thought of it till it came and when it had come they thought of nothing else  one other thing stephen seemed now and then to care for and that was to sing it was a way of speaking to maggie perhaps he was not distinctly conscious that he was impelled to it by a secret longingrunning counter to all his selfconfessed resolvesto deepen the hold he had on her watch your own speech and notice how it is guided by your less conscious purposes and you will understand that contradiction in stephen  philip wakem was a less frequent visitor but he came occasionally in the evening and it happened that he was there when lucy said as they sat out on the lawn near sunset  now maggies tale of visits to aunt glegg is completed i mean that we shall go out boating every day until she goes she has not had half enough boating because of these tiresome visits and she likes it better than anything dont you maggie  better than any sort of locomotion i hope you mean said philip smiling at maggie who was lolling backward in a low gardenchair else she will be selling her soul to that ghostly boatman who haunts the floss only for the sake of being drifted in a boat forever  should you like to be her boatman said lucy because if you would you can come with us and take an oar if the floss were but a quiet lake instead of a river we should be independent of any gentleman for maggie can row splendidly as it is we are reduced to ask services of knights and squires who do not seem to offer them with great alacrity  she looked playful reproach at stephen who was sauntering up and down and was just singing in pianissimo falsetto    the thirst that from the soul doth rise   doth ask a drink divine  he took no notice but still kept aloof he had done so frequently during philips recent visits  you dont seem inclined for boating said lucy when he came to sit down by her on the bench doesnt rowing suit you now  oh i hate a large party in a boat he said almost irritably ill come when you have no one else  lucy colored fearing that philip would be hurt it was quite a new thing for stephen to speak in that way but he had certainly not been well of late philip colored too but less from a feeling of personal offence than from a vague suspicion that stephens moodiness had some relation to maggie who had started up from her chair as he spoke and had walked toward the hedge of laurels to look at the descending sunlight on the river  as miss deane didnt know she was excluding others by inviting me said philip i am bound to resign  no indeed you shall not said lucy much vexed i particularly wish for your company tomorrow the tide will suit at halfpast ten it will be a delicious time for a couple of hours to row to luckreth and walk back before the sun gets too hot and how can you object to four people in a boat she added looking at stephen  i dont object to the people but the number said stephen who had recovered himself and was rather ashamed of his rudeness if i voted for a fourth at all of course it would be you phil but we wont divide the pleasure of escorting the ladies well take it alternately ill go the next day  this incident had the effect of drawing philips attention with freshened solicitude toward stephen and maggie but when they reentered the house music was proposed and mrs tulliver and mr deane being occupied with cribbage maggie sat apart near the table where the books and work were placed doing nothing however but listening abstractedly to the music stephen presently turned to a duet which he insisted that lucy and philip should sing he had often done the same thing before but this evening philip thought he divined some double intention in every word and look of stephens and watched him keenly angry with himself all the while for this clinging suspicion for had not maggie virtually denied any ground for his doubts on her side and she was truth itself it was impossible not to believe her word and glance when they had last spoken together in the garden stephen might be strongly fascinated by her what was more natural but philip felt himself rather base for intruding on what must be his friends painful secret still he watched stephen moving away from the piano sauntered slowly toward the table near which maggie sat and turned over the newspapers apparently in mere idleness then he seated himself with his back to the piano dragging a newspaper under his elbow and thrusting his hand through his hair as if he had been attracted by some bit of local news in the laceham courier he was in reality looking at maggie who had not taken the slightest notice of his approach she had always additional strength of resistance when philip was present just as we can restrain our speech better in a spot that we feel to be hallowed but at last she heard the word dearest uttered in the softest tone of pained entreaty like that of a patient who asks for something that ought to have been given without asking she had never heard that word since the moments in the lane at basset when it had come from stephen again and again almost as involuntarily as if it had been an inarticulate cry philip could hear no word but he had moved to the opposite side of the piano and could see maggie start and blush raise her eyes an instant toward stephens face but immediately look apprehensively toward himself it was not evident to her that philip had observed her but a pang of shame under the sense of this concealment made her move from her chair and walk to her mothers side to watch the game at cribbage  philip went home soon after in a state of hideous doubt mingled with wretched certainty it was impossible for him now to resist the conviction that there was some mutual consciousness between stephen and maggie and for half the night his irritable susceptible nerves were pressed upon almost to frenzy by that one wretched fact he could attempt no explanation that would reconcile it with her words and actions when at last the need for belief in maggie rose to its habitual predominance he was not long in imagining the truthshe was struggling she was banishing herself this was the clue to all he had seen since his return but athwart that belief there came other possibilities that would not be driven out of sight his imagination wrought out the whole story stephen was madly in love with her he must have told her so she had rejected him and was hurrying away but would he give her up knowingphilip felt the fact with heartcrushing despairthat she was made half helpless by her feeling toward him  when the morning came philip was too ill to think of keeping his engagement to go in the boat in his present agitation he could decide on nothing he could only alternate between contradictory intentions first he thought he must have an interview with maggie and entreat her to confide in him then again he distrusted his own interference had he not been thrusting himself on maggie all along she had uttered words long ago in her young ignorance it was enough to make her hate him that these should be continually present with her as a bond and had he any right to ask her for a revelation of feelings which she had evidently intended to withhold from him he would not trust himself to see her till he had assured himself that he could act from pure anxiety for her and not from egoistic irritation he wrote a brief note to stephen and sent it early by the servant saying that he was not well enough to fulfil his engagement to miss deane would stephen take his excuse and fill his place  lucy had arranged a charming plan which had made her quite content with stephens refusal to go in the boat she discovered that her father was to drive to lindum this morning at ten lindum was the very place she wanted to go to to make purchasesimportant purchases which must by no means be put off to another opportunity and aunt tulliver must go too because she was concerned in some of the purchases  you will have your row in the boat just the same you know she said to maggie when they went out of the breakfastroom and upstairs together philip will be here it halfpast ten and it is a delicious morning now dont say a word against it you dear dolorous thing what is the use of my being a fairy godmother if you set your face against all the wonders i work for you dont think of awful cousin tom you may disobey him a little  maggie did not persist in objecting she was almost glad of the plan for perhaps it would bring her some strength and calmness to be alone with philip again it was like revisiting the scene of a quieter life in which the very struggles were repose compared with the daily tumult of the present she prepared herself for the boat and at halfpast ten sat waiting in the drawingroom  the ring of the doorbell was punctual and she was thinking with halfsad affectionate pleasure of the surprise philip would have in finding that he was to be with her alone when she distinguished a firm rapid step across the hall that was certainly not philips the door opened and stephen guest entered  in the first moment they were both too much agitated to speak for stephen had learned from the servant that the others were gone out maggie had started up and sat down again with her heart beating violently and stephen throwing down his cap and gloves came and sat by her in silence she thought philip would be coming soon and with great effortfor she trembled visiblyshe rose to go to a distant chair  he is not coming said stephen in a low tone i am going in the boat  oh we cant go said maggie sinking into her chair again lucy did not expectshe would be hurt why is not philip come  he is not well he asked me to come instead  lucy is gone to lindum said maggie taking off her bonnet with hurried trembling fingers we must not go  very well said stephen dreamily looking at her as he rested his arm on the back of his chair then well stay here  he was looking into her deep deep eyes far off and mysterious at the starlit blackness and yet very near and timidly loving maggie sat perfectly stillperhaps for moments perhaps for minutesuntil the helpless trembling had ceased and there was a warm glow on her check  the man is waiting he has taken the cushions she said will you go and tell him  what shall i tell him said stephen almost in a whisper he was looking at the lips now  maggie made no answer  let us go stephen murmured entreatingly rising and taking her hand to raise her too we shall not be long together  and they went maggie felt that she was being led down the garden among the roses being helped with firm tender care into the boat having the cushion and cloak arranged for her feet and her parasol opened for her which she had forgotten all by this stronger presence that seemed to bear her along without any act of her own will like the added self which comes with the sudden exalting influence of a strong tonic and she felt nothing else memory was excluded  they glided rapidly along stephen rowing helped by the backwardflowing tide past the tofton trees and houses on between the silent sunny fields and pastures which seemed filled with a natural joy that had no reproach for theirs the breath of the young unwearied day the delicious rhythmic dip of the oars the fragmentary song of a passing bird heard now and then as if it were only the overflowing of brimful gladness the sweet solitude of a twofold consciousness that was mingled into one by that grave untiring gaze which need not be avertedwhat else could there be in their minds for the first hour some low subdued languid exclamation of love came from stephen from time to time as he went on rowing idly half automatically otherwise they spoke no word for what could words have been but an inlet to thought and thought did not belong to that enchanted haze in which they were envelopedit belonged to the past and the future that lay outside the haze maggie was only dimly conscious of the banks as they passed them and dwelt with no recognition on the villages she knew there were several to be passed before they reached luckreth where they always stopped and left the boat at all times she was so liable to fits of absence that she was likely enough to let her waymarks pass unnoticed  but at last stephen who had been rowing more and more idly ceased to row laid down the oars folded his arms and looked down on the water as if watching the pace at which the boat glided without his help this sudden change roused maggie she looked at the farstretching fields at the banks close by and felt that they were entirely strange to her a terrible alarm took possession of her  oh have we passed luckreth where we were to stop she exclaimed looking back to see if the place were out of sight no village was to be seen she turned around again with a look of distressed questioning at stephen  he went on watching the water and said in a strange dreamy absent tone yes a long way  oh what shall i do cried maggie in an agony we shall not get home for hours and lucy o god help me  she clasped her hands and broke into a sob like a frightened child she thought of nothing but of meeting lucy and seeing her look of pained surprise and doubt perhaps of just upbraiding  stephen moved and sat near her and gently drew down the clasped hands  maggie he said in a deep tone of slow decision let us never go home again till no one can part ustill we are married  the unusual tone the startling words arrested maggies sob and she sat quite still wondering as if stephen might have seen some possibilities that would alter everything and annul the wretched facts  see maggie how everything has come without our seekingin spite of all our efforts we never thought of being alone together again it has all been done by others see how the tide is carrying us out away from all those unnatural bonds that we have been trying to make faster round us and trying in vain it will carry us on to torby and we can land there and get some carriage and hurry on to york and then to scotlandand never pause a moment till we are bound to each other so that only death can part us it is the only right thing dearest it is the only way of escaping from this wretched entanglement everything has concurred to point it out to us we have contrived nothing we have thought of nothing ourselves  stephen spoke with deep earnest pleading maggie listened passing from her startled wonderment to the yearning after that belief that the tide was doing it all that she might glide along with the swift silent stream and not struggle any more but across that stealing influence came the terrible shadow of past thoughts and the sudden horror lest now at last the moment of fatal intoxication was close upon her called up feelings of angry resistance toward stephen  let me go she said in an agitated tone flashing an indignant look at him and trying to get her hands free you have wanted to deprive me of any choice you knew we were come too far you have dared to take advantage of my thoughtlessness it is unmanly to bring me into such a position  stung by this reproach he released her hands moved back to his former place and folded his arms in a sort of desperation at the difficulty maggies words had made present to him if she would not consent to go on he must curse himself for the embarrassment he had led her into but the reproach was the unendurable thing the one thing worse than parting with her was that she should feel he had acted unworthily toward her at last he said in a tone of suppressed rage  i didnt notice that we had passed luckreth till we had got to the next village and then it came into my mind that we would go on i cant justify it i ought to have told you it is enough to make you hate me since you dont love me well enough to make everything else indifferent to you as i do you shall i stop the boat and try to get you out here ill tell lucy that i was mad and that you hate me and you shall be clear of me forever no one can blame you because i have behaved unpardonably to you  maggie was paralyzed it was easier to resist stephens pleading than this picture he had called up of himself suffering while she was vindicated easier even to turn away from his look of tenderness than from this look of angry misery that seemed to place her in selfish isolation from him he had called up a state of feeling in which the reasons which had acted on her conscience seemed to be transmitted into mere selfregard the indignant fire in her eyes was quenched and she began to look at him with timid distress she had reproached him for being hurried into irrevocable trespassshe who had been so weak herself  as if i shouldnt feel what happened to youjust the same she said with reproach of another kindthe reproach of love asking for more trust this yielding to the idea of stephens suffering was more fatal than the other yielding because it was less distinguishable from that sense of others claims which was the moral basis of her resistance  he felt all the relenting in her look and tone it was heaven opening again he moved to her side and took her hand leaning his elbow on the back of the boat and saying nothing he dreaded to utter another word he dreaded to make another movement that might provoke another reproach or denial from her life hung on her consent everything else was hopeless confused sickening misery they glided along in this way both resting in that silence as in a haven both dreading lest their feelings should be divided againtill they became aware that the clouds had gathered and that the slightest perceptible freshening of the breeze was growing and growing so that the whole character of the day was altered  you will be chill maggie in this thin dress let me raise the cloak over your shoulders get up an instant dearest  maggie obeyed there was an unspeakable charm in being told what to do and having everything decided for her she sat down again covered with the cloak and stephen took to his oars again making haste for they must try to get to torby as fast as they could maggie was hardly conscious of having said or done anything decisive all yielding is attended with a less vivid consciousness than resistance it is the partial sleep of thought it is the submergence of our own personality by another every influence tended to lull her into acquiescence that dreamy gliding in the boat which had lasted for four hours and had brought some weariness and exhaustion the recoil of her fatigued sensations from the impracticable difficulty of getting out of the boat at this unknown distance from home and walking for long milesall helped to bring her into more complete subjection to that strong mysterious charm which made a last parting from stephen seem the death of all joy and made the thought of wounding him like the first touch of the torturing iron before which resolution shrank and then there was the present happiness of being with him which was enough to absorb all her languid energy  presently stephen observed a vessel coming after them several vessels among them the steamer to mudport had passed them with the early tide but for the last hour they had seen none he looked more and more eagerly at this vessel as if a new thought had come into his mind along with it and then he looked at maggie hesitatingly  maggie dearest he said at last if this vessel should be going to mudport or to any convenient place on the coast northward it would be our best plan to get them to take us on board you are fatigued and it may soon rain it may be a wretched business getting to torby in this boat its only a trading vessel but i dare say you can be made tolerably comfortable well take the cushions out of the boat it is really our best plan theyll be glad enough to take us ive got plenty of money about me i can pay them well  maggies heart began to beat with reawakened alarm at this new proposition but she was silentone course seemed as difficult as another  stephen hailed the vessel it was a dutch vessel going to mudport the english mate informed him and if this wind held would be there in less than two days  we had got out too far with our boat said stephen i was trying to make for torby but im afraid of the weather and this ladymy wifewill be exhausted with fatigue and hunger take us on boardwill youand haul up the boat ill pay you well  maggie now really faint and trembling with fear was t aken on board making an interesting object of contemplation to admiring dutchmen the mate feared the lady would have a poor time of it on board for they had no accommodation for such entirely unlookedfor passengersno private cabin larger than an oldfashioned churchpew but at least they had dutch cleanliness which makes all other inconveniences tolerable and the boat cushions were spread into a couch for maggie on the poop with all alacrity but to pace up and down the deck leaning on stephenbeing upheld by his strengthwas the first change that she needed then came food and then quiet reclining on the cushions with the sense that no new resolution could be taken that day everything must wait till tomorrow stephen sat beside her with her hand in his they could only speak to each other in low tones only look at each other now and then for it would take a long while to dull the curiosity of the five men on board and reduce these handsome young strangers to that minor degree of interest which belongs in a sailors regard to all objects nearer than the horizon but stephen was triumphantly happy every other thought or care was thrown into unmarked perspective by the certainty that maggie must be his the leap had been taken now he had been tortured by scruples he had fought fiercely with overmastering inclination he had hesitated but repentance was impossible he murmured forth in fragmentary sentences his happiness his adoration his tenderness his belief that their life together must be heaven that her presence with him would give rapture to every common day that to satisfy her lightest wish was dearer to him than all other bliss that everything was easy for her sake except to part with her and now they never would part he would belong to her forever and all that was his was hershad no value for him except as it was hers such things uttered in low broken tones by the one voice that has first stirred the fibre of young passion have only a feeble effecton experienced minds at a distance from them to poor maggie they were very near they were like nectar held close to thirsty lips there was there must be then a life for mortals here below which was not hard and chillin which affection would no longer be selfsacrifice stephens passionate words made the vision of such a life more fully present to her than it had ever been before and the vision for the time excluded all realitiesall except the returning sungleams which broke out on the waters as the evening approached and mingled with the visionary sunlight of promised happiness all except the hand that pressed hers and the voice that spoke to her and the eyes that looked at her with grave unspeakable love  there was to be no rain after all the clouds rolled off to the horizon again making the great purple rampart and long purple isles of that wondrous land which reveals itself to us when the sun goes downthe land that the evening star watches over maggie was to sleep all night on the poop it was better than going below and she was covered with the warmest wrappings the ship could furnish it was still early when the fatigues of the day brought on a drowsy longing for perfect rest and she laid down her head looking at the faint dying flush in the west where the one golden lamp was getting brighter and brighter then she looked up at stephen who was still seated by her hanging over her as he leaned his arm against the vessels side behind all the delicious visions of these last hours which had flowed over her like a soft stream and made her entirely passive there was the dim consciousness that the condition was a transient one and that the morrow must bring back the old life of struggle that there were thoughts which would presently avenge themselves for this oblivion but now nothing was distinct to her she was being lulled to sleep with that soft stream still flowing over her with those delicious visions melting and fading like the wondrous aerial land of the west    chapter xiv  waking   when maggie was gone to sleep stephen weary too with his unaccustomed amount of rowing and with the intense inward life of the last twelve hours but too restless to sleep walked and lounged about the deck with his cigar far on into midnight not seeing the dark water hardly conscious there were stars living only in the near and distant future at last fatigue conquered restlessness and he rolled himself up in a piece of tarpaulin on the deck near maggies feet  she had fallen asleep before nine and had been sleeping for six hours before the faintest hint of a midsummer daybreak was discernible she awoke from that vivid dreaming which makes the margin of our deeper rest she was in a boat on the wide water with stephen and in the gathering darkness something like a star appeared that grew and grew till they saw it was the virgin seated in st oggs boat and it came nearer and nearer till they saw the virgin was lucy and the boatman was philipno not philip but her brother who rowed past without looking at her and she rose to stretch out her arms and call to him and their own boat turned over with the movement and they began to sink till with one spasm of dread she seemed to awake and find she was a child again in the parlor at evening twilight and tom was not really angry from the soothed sense of that false waking she passed to the real wakingto the plash of water against the vessel and the sound of a footstep on the deck and the awful starlit sky there was a moment of utter bewilderment before her mind could get disentangled from the confused web of dreams but soon the whole terrible truth urged itself upon her stephen was not by her now she was alone with her own memory and her own dread the irrevocable wrong that must blot her life had been committed she had brought sorrow into the lives of othersinto the lives that were knit up with hers by trust and love the feeling of a few short weeks had hurried her into the sins her nature had most recoiled frombreach of faith and cruel selfishness she had rent the ties that had given meaning to duty and had made herself an outlawed soul with no guide but the wayward choice of her own passion and where would that lead her where had it led her now she had said she would rather die than fall into that temptation she felt it nownow that the consequences of such a fall had come before the outward act was completed there was at least this fruit from all her years of striving after the highest and bestthat her soul though betrayed beguiled ensnared could never deliberately consent to a choice of the lower and a choice of what o god not a choice of joy but of conscious cruelty and hardness for could she ever cease to see before her lucy and philip with their murdered trust and hopes her life with stephen could have no sacredness she must forever sink and wander vaguely driven by uncertain impulse for she had let go the clue of lifethat clue which once in the faroff years her young need had clutched so strongly she had renounced all delights then before she knew them before they had come within her reach philip had been right when he told her that she knew nothing of renunciation she had thought it was quiet ecstasy she saw it face to face nowthat sad patient loving strength which holds the clue of lifeand saw that the thorns were forever pressing on its brow the yesterday which could never be revokedif she could have changed it now for any length of inward silent endurance she would have bowed beneath that cross with a sense of rest  day break came and the reddening eastern light while her past life was grasping her in this way with that tightening clutch which comes in the last moments of possible rescue she could see stephen now lying on the deck still fast asleep and with the sight of him there came a wave of anguish that found its way in a longsuppressed sob the worst bitterness of partingthe thought that urged the sharpest inward cry for helpwas the pain it must give to him but surmounting everything was the horror at her own possible failure the dread lest her conscience should be benumbed again and not rise to energy till it was too late too late it was too late already not to have caused misery too late for everything perhaps but to rush away from the last act of basenessthe tasting of joys that were wrung from crushed hearts  the sun was rising now and maggie started up with the sense that a day of resistance was beginning for her her eyelashes were still wet with tears as with her shawl over her head she sat looking at the slowly rounding sun something roused stephen too and getting up from his hard bed he came to sit beside her the sharp instinct of anxious love saw something to give him alarm in the very first glance he had a hovering dread of some resistance in maggies nature that he would be unable to overcome he had the uneasy consciousness that he had robbed her of perfect freedom yesterday there was too much native honor in him for him not to feel that if her will should recoil his conduct would have been odious and she would have a right to reproach him  but maggie did not feel that right she was too conscious of fatal weakness in herself too full of the tenderness that comes with the foreseen need for inflicting a wound she let him take her hand when he came to sit down beside her and smiled at him only with rather a sad glance she could say nothing to pain him till the moment of possible parting was nearer and so they drank their cup of coffee together and walked about the deck and heard the captains assurance that they should be in at mudport by five oclock each with an inward burthen but in him it was an undefined fear which he trusted to the coming hours to dissipate in her it was a definite resolve on which she was trying silently to tighten her hold stephen was continually through the morning expressing his anxiety at the fatigue and discomfort she was suffering and alluded to landing and to the change of motion and repose she would have in a carriage wanting to assure himself more completely by presupposing that everything would be as he had arranged it for a long while maggie contented herself with assuring him that she had had a good nights rest and that she didnt mind about being on the vesselit was not like being on the open sea it was only a little less pleasant than being in a boat on the floss but a suppressed resolve will betray itself in the eyes and stephen became more and more uneasy as the day advanced under the sense that maggie had entirely lost her passiveness he longed but did not dare to speak of their marriage of where they would go after it and the steps he would take to inform his father and the rest of what had happened he longed to assure himself of a tacit assent from her but each time he looked at her he gathered a stronger dread of the new quiet sadness with which she met his eyes and they were more and more silent  here we are in sight of mudport he said at last now dearest he added turning toward her with a look that was half beseeching the worst part of your fatigue is over on the land we can command swiftness in another hour and a half we shall be in a chaise together and that will seem rest to you after this  maggie felt it was time to speak it would only be unkind now to assent by silence she spoke in the lowest tone as he had done but with distinct decision  we shall not be together we shall have parted  the blood rushed to stephens face  we shall not he said ill die first  it was as he had dreadedthere was a struggle coming but neither of them dared to say another word till the boat was let down and they were taken to the landingplace here there was a cluster of gazers and passengers awaiting the departure of the steamboat to st oggs maggie had a dim sense when she had landed and stephen was hurrying her along on his arm that some one had advanced toward her from that cluster as if he were coming to speak to her but she was hurried along and was indifferent to everything but the coming trial  a porter guided them to the nearest inn and postinghouse and stephen gave the order for the chaise as they passed through the yard maggie took no notice of this and only said ask them to show us into a room where we can sit down  when they entered maggie did not sit down and stephen whose face had a desperate determination in it was about to ring the bell when she said in a firm voice  im not going we must part here  maggie he said turning round toward her and speaking in the tones of a man who feels a process of torture beginning do you mean to kill me what is the use of it now the whole thing is done  no it is not done said maggie too much is donemore than we can ever remove the trace of but i will go no farther dont try to prevail with me again i couldnt choose yesterday  what was he to do he dared not go near her her anger might leap out and make a new barrier he walked backward and forward in maddening perplexity  maggie he said at last pausing before her and speaking in a tone of imploring wretchedness have some pityhear meforgive me for what i did yesterday i will obey you now i will do nothing without your full consent but dont blight our lives forever by a rash perversity that can answer no good purpose to any one that can only create new evils sit down dearest waitthink what you are going to do dont treat me as if you couldnt trust me  he had chosen the most effective appeal but maggies will was fixed unswervingly on the coming wrench she had made up her mind to suffer  we must not wait she said in a low but distinct voice we must part at once  we cant part maggie said stephen more impetuously i cant bear it what is the use of inflicting that misery on me the blowwhatever it may have beenhas been struck now will it help any one else that you should drive me mad  i will not begin any future even for you said maggie tremulously with a deliberate consent to what ought not to have been what i told you at basset i feel now i would rather have died than fall into this temptation it would have been better if we had parted forever then but we must part now  we will not part stephen burst out instinctively placing his back against the door forgetting everything he had said a few moments before i will not endure it youll make me desperate i shant know what i do  maggie trembled she felt that the parting could not be effected suddenly she must rely on a slower appeal to stephens better self she must be prepared for a harder task than that of rushing away while resolution was fresh she sat down stephen watching her with that look of desperation which had come over him like a lurid light approached slowly from the door seated himself close beside her and grasped her hand her heart beat like the heart of a frightened bird but this direct opposition helped her she felt her determination growing stronger  remember what you felt weeks ago she began with beseeching earnestness remember what we both feltthat we owed ourselves to others and must conquer every inclination which could make us false to that debt we have failed to keep our resolutions but the wrong remains the same  no it does not remain the same said stephen we have proved that it was impossible to keep our resolutions we have proved that the feeling which draws us toward each other is too strong to be overcome that natural law surmounts every other we cant help what it clashes with  it is not so stephen im quite sure that is wrong i have tried to think it again and again but i see if we judged in that way there would be a warrant for all treachery and cruelty we should justify breaking the most sacred ties that can ever be formed on earth if the past is not to bind us where can duty lie we should have no law but the inclination of the moment  but there are ties that cant be kept by mere resolution said stephen starting up and walking about again what is outward faithfulness would they have thanked us for anything so hollow as constancy without love  maggie did not answer immediately she was undergoing an inward as well as an outward contest at last she said with a passionate assertion of her conviction as much against herself as against him  that seems rightat first but when i look further im sure it is not right faithfulness and constancy mean something else besides doing what is easiest and pleasantest to ourselves they mean renouncing whatever is opposed to the reliance others have in uswhatever would cause misery to those whom the course of our lives has made dependent on us if weif i had been better nobler those claims would have been so strongly present with mei should have felt them pressing on my heart so continually just as they do now in the moments when my conscience is awakethat the opposite feeling would never have grown in me as it has done it would have been quenched at once i should have prayed for help so earnestly i should have rushed away as we rush from hideous danger i feel no excuse for myself none i should never have failed toward lucy and philip as i have done if i had not been weak selfish and hardable to think of their pain without a pain to myself that would have destroyed all temptation oh what is lucy feeling now she believed in meshe loved meshe was so good to me think of her  maggies voice was getting choked as she uttered these last words  i cant think of her said stephen stamping as if with pain i can think of nothing but you maggie you demand of a man what is impossible i felt that once but i cant go back to it now and where is the use of your thinking of it except to torture me you cant save them from pain now you can only tear yourself from me and make my life worthless to me and even if we could go back and both fulfil our engagementsif that were possible nowit would be hateful horrible to think of your ever being philips wifeof your ever being the wife of a man you didnt love we have both been rescued from a mistake  a deep flush came over maggies face and she couldnt speak stephen saw this he sat down again taking her hand in his and looking at her with passionate entreaty  maggie dearest if you love me you are mine who can have so great a claim on you as i have my life is bound up in your love there is nothing in the past that can annul our right to each other it is the first time we have either of us loved with our whole heart and soul  maggie was still silent for a little while looking down stephen was in a flutter of new hope he was going to triumph but she raised her eyes and met his with a glance that was filled with the anguish of regret not with yielding  no not with my whole heart and soul stephen she said with timid resolution i have never consented to it with my whole mind there are memories and affections and longings after perfect goodness that have such a strong hold on me they would never quit me for long they would come back and be pain to merepentance i couldnt live in peace if i put the shadow of a wilful sin between myself and god i have caused sorrow alreadyi knowi feel it but i have never deliberately consented to it i have never said they shall suffer that i may have joy it has never been my will to marry you if you were to win consent from the momentary triumph of my feeling for you you would not have my whole soul if i could wake back again into the time before yesterday i would choose to be true to my calmer affections and live without the joy of love  stephen loosed her hand and rising impatiently walked up and down the room in suppressed rage  good god he burst out at last what a miserable thing a womans love is to a mans i could commit crimes for youand you can balance and choose in that way but you dont love me if you had a tithe of the feeling for me that i have for you it would be impossible to you to think for a moment of sacrificing me but it weighs nothing with you that you are robbing me of my lifes happiness  maggie pressed her fingers together almost convulsively as she held them clasped on her lap a great terror was upon her as if she were ever and anon seeing where she stood by great flashes of lightning and then again stretched forth her hands in the darkness  no i dont sacrifice youi couldnt sacrifice you she said as soon as she could speak again but i cant believe in a good for you that i feel that we both feel is a wrong toward others we cant choose happiness either for ourselves or for another we cant tell where that will lie we can only choose whether we will indulge ourselves in the present moment or whether we will renounce that for the sake of obeying the divine voice within usfor the sake of being true to all the motives that sanctify our lives i know this belief is hard it has slipped away from me again and again but i have felt that if i let it go forever i should have no light through the darkness of this life  but maggie said stephen seating himself by her again is it possible you dont see that what happened yesterday has altered the whole position of things what infatuation is it what obstinate prepossession that blinds you to that it is too late to say what we might have done or what we ought to have done admitting the very worst view of what has been done it is a fact we must act on now our position is altered the right course is no longer what it was before we must accept our own actions and start afresh from them suppose we had been married yesterday it is nearly the same thing the effect on others would not have been different it would only have made this difference to ourselves stephen added bitterly that you might have acknowledged then that your tie to me was stronger than to others  again a deep flush came over maggies face and she was silent stephen thought again that he was beginning to prevailhe had never yet believed that he should not prevail there are possibilities which our minds shrink from too completely for us to fear them  dearest he said in his deepest tenderest tone leaning toward her and putting his arm round her you are mine nowthe world believes it duty must spring out of that now  in a few hours you will be legally mine and those who had claims on us will submitthey will see that there was a force which declared against their claims  maggies eyes opened wide in one terrified look at the face that was close to hers and she started up pale again  oh i cant do it she said in a voice almost of agony stephen dont ask medont urge me i cant argue any longeri dont know what is wise but my heart will not let me do it i seei feel their trouble now it is as if it were branded on my mind i have suffered and had no one to pity me and now i have made others suffer it would never leave me it would embitter your love to me i do care for philipin a different way i remember all we said to each other i know how he thought of me as the one promise of his life he was given to me that i might make his lot less hard and i have forsaken him and lucyshe has been deceived she who trusted me more than any one i cannot marry you i cannot take a good for myself that has been wrung out of their misery it is not the force that ought to rule usthis that we feel for each other it would rend me away from all that my past life has made dear and holy to me i cant set out on a fresh life and forget that i must go back to it and cling to it else i shall feel as if there were nothing firm beneath my feet  good god maggie said stephen rising too and grasping her arm you rave how can you go back without marrying me you dont know what will be said dearest you see nothing as it really is  yes i do but they will believe me i will confess everything lucy will believe meshe will forgive you andandoh some good will come by clinging to the right dear dear stephen let me godont drag me into deeper remorse my whole soul has never consented it does not consent now  stephen let go her arm and sank back on his chair halfstunned by despairing rage he was silent a few moments not looking at her while her eyes were turned toward him yearningly in alarm at this sudden change at last he said still without looking at her  go thenleave me dont torture me any longeri cant bear it  involuntarily she leaned toward him and put out her hand to touch his but he shrank from it as if it had been burning iron and said again  leave me  maggie was not conscious of a decision as she turned away from that gloomy averted face and walked out of the room it was like an automatic action that fulfils a forgotten intention what came after a sense of stairs descended as if in a dream of flagstones of a chaise and horses standing then a street and a turning into another street where a stagecoach was standing taking in passengers and the darting thought that that coach would take her away perhaps toward home but she could ask nothing yet she only got into the coach  homewhere her mother and brother were philip lucy the scene of her very cares and trialswas the haven toward which her mind tended the sanctuary where sacred relics lay where she would be rescued from more falling the thought of stephen was like a horrible throbbing pain which yet as such pains do seemed to urge all other thoughts into activity but among her thoughts what others would say and think of her conduct was hardly present love and deep pity and remorseful anguish left no room for that  the coach was taking her to york farther away from home but she did not learn that until she was set down in the old city at midnight it was no matter she could sleep there and start home the next day she had her purse in her pocket with all her money in ita banknote and a sovereign she had kept it in her pocket from forgetfulness after going out to make purchases the day before yesterday  did she lie down in the gloomy bedroom of the old inn that night with her will bent unwaveringly on the path of penitent sacrifice the great struggles of life are not so easy as that the great problems of life are not so clear in the darkness of that night she saw stephens face turned toward her in passionate reproachful misery she lived through again all the tremulous delights of his presence with her that made existence an easy floating in a stream of joy instead of a quiet resolved endurance and effort the love she had renounced came back upon her with a cruel charm she felt herself opening her arms to receive it once more and then it seemed to slip away and fade and vanish leaving only the dying sound of a deep thrilling voice that said gone forever gone     book vii  the final rescue    chapter i  the return to the mill   between four and five oclock on the afternoon of the fifth day from that on which stephen and maggie had left st oggs tom tulliver was standing on the gravel walk outside the old house at dorlcote mill he was master there now he had half fulfilled his fathers dying wish and by years of steady selfgovernment and energetic work he had brought himself near to the attainment of more than the old respectability which had been the proud inheritance of the dodsons and tullivers  but toms face as he stood in the hot still sunshine of that summer afternoon had no gladness no triumph in it his mouth wore its bitterest expression his severe brow its hardest and deepest fold as he drew down his hat farther over his eyes to shelter them from the sun and thrusting his hands deep into his pockets began to walk up and down the gravel no news of his sister had been heard since bob jakin had come back in the steamer from mudport and put an end to all improbable suppositions of an accident on the water by stating that he had seen her land from a vessel with mr stephen guest would the next news be that she was marriedor what probably that she was not married toms mind was set to the expectation of the worst that could happennot death but disgrace  as he was walking with his back toward the entrance gate and his face toward the rushing millstream a tall darkeyed figure that we know well approached the gate and paused to look at him with a fastbeating heart her brother was the human being of whom she had been most afraid from her childhood upward afraid with that fear which springs in us when we love one who is inexorable unbending unmodifiable with a mind that we can never mould ourselves upon and yet that we cannot endure to alienate from us  that deeprooted fear was shaking maggie now but her mind was unswervingly bent on returning to her brother as the natural refuge that had been given her in her deep humiliation under the retrospect of her own weaknessin her anguish at the injury she had inflictedshe almost desired to endure the severity of toms reproof to submit in patient silence to that harsh disapproving judgment against which she had so often rebelled it seemed no more than just to her nowwho was weaker than she was she craved that outward help to her better purpose which would come from complete submissive confession from being in the presence of those whose looks and words would be a reflection of her own conscience  maggie had been kept on her bed at york for a day with that prostrating headache which was likely to follow on the terrible strain of the previous day and night there was an expression of physical pain still about her brow and eyes and her whole appearance with her dress so long unchanged was worn and distressed she lifted the latch of the gate and walked in slowly tom did not hear the gate he was just then close upon the roaring dam but he presently turned and lifting up his eyes saw the figure whose worn look and loneliness seemed to him a confirmation of his worst conjectures he paused trembling and white with disgust and indignation  maggie paused too three yards before him she felt the hatred in his face felt it rushing through her fibres but she must speak  tom she began faintly i am come back to youi am come back homefor refugeto tell you everything  you will find no home with me he answered with tremulous rage you have disgraced us all you have disgraced my fathers name you have been a curse to your best friends you have been base deceitful no motives are strong enough to restrain you i wash my hands of you forever you dont belong to me  their mother had come to the door now she stood paralyzed by the double shock of seeing maggie and hearing toms words  tom said maggie with more courage i am perhaps not so guilty as you believe me to be i never meant to give way to my feelings i struggled against them i was carried too far in the boat to come back on tuesday i came back as soon as i could  i cant believe in you any more said tom gradually passing from the tremulous excitement of the first moment to cold inflexibility you have been carrying on a clandestine relation with stephen guestas you did before with another he went to see you at my aunt mosss you walked alone with him in the lanes you must have behaved as no modest girl would have done to her cousins lover else that could never have happened the people at luckreth saw you pass you passed all the other places you knew what you were doing you have been using philip wakem as a screen to deceive lucythe kindest friend you ever had go and see the return you have made her shes ill unable to speak my mother cant go near her lest she should remind her of you  maggie was half stunnedtoo heavily pressed upon by her anguish even to discern any difference between her actual guilt and her brothers accusations still less to vindicate herself  tom she said crushing her hands together under her cloak in the effort to speak again whatever i have done i repent it bitterly i want to make amends i will endure anything i want to be kept from doing wrong again  what will keep you said tom with cruel bitterness not religion not your natural feelings of gratitude and honor and hehe would deserve to be shot if it were notbut you are ten times worse than he is i loathe your character and your conduct you struggled with your feelings you say yes i have had feelings to struggle with but i conquered them i have had a harder life than you have had but i have found my comfort in doing my duty but i will sanction no such character as yours the world shall know that i feel the difference between right and wrong if you are in want i will provide for you let my mother know but you shall not come under my roof it is enough that i have to bear the thought of your disgrace the sight of you is hateful to me  slowly maggie was turning away with despair in her heart but the poor frightened mothers love leaped out now stronger than all dread  my child ill go with you youve got a mother  oh the sweet rest of that embrace to the heartstricken maggie more helpful than all wisdom is one draught of simple human pity that will not forsake us  tom turned and walked into the house  come in my child mrs tulliver whispered hell let you stay and sleep in my bed he wont deny that if i ask him  no mother said maggie in a low tone like a moan i will never go in  then wait for me outside ill get ready and come with you  when his mother appeared with her bonnet on tom came out to her in the passage and put money into her hands  my house is yours mother always he said you will come and let me know everything you want you will come back to me  poor mrs tulliver took the money too frightened to say anything the only thing clear to her was the mothers instinct that she would go with her unhappy child  maggie was waiting outside the gate she took her mothers hand and they walked a little way in silence  mother said maggie at last we will go to lukes cottage luke will take me in he was very good to me when i was a little girl  hes got no room for us my dear now his wifes got so many children i dont know where to go if it isnt to one o your aunts and i hardly durst said poor mrs tulliver quite destitute of mental resources in this extremity  maggie was silent a little while and then said  let us go to bob jakins mother his wife will have room for us if they have no other lodger  so they went on their way to st oggs to the old house by the riverside  bob himself was at home with a heaviness at heart which resisted even the new joy and pride of possessing a twomonthsold baby quite the liveliest of its age that had ever been born to prince or packman he would perhaps not so thoroughly have understood all the dubiousness of maggies appearance with mr stephen guest on the quay at mudport if he had not witnessed the effect it produced on tom when he went to report it and since then the circumstances which in any case gave a disastrous character to her elopement had passed beyond the more polite circles of st oggs and had become matter of common talk accessible to the grooms and errandboys so that when he opened the door and saw maggie standing before him in her sorrow and weariness he had no questions to ask except one which he dared only ask himselfwhere was mr stephen guest bob for his part hoped he might be in the warmest department of an asylum understood to exist in the other world for gentlemen who are likely to be in fallen circumstances there  the lodgings were vacant and both mrs jakin the larger and mrs jakin the less were commanded to make all things comfortable for the old missis and the young miss alas that she was still miss the ingenious bob was sorely perplexed as to how this result could have come about how mr stephen guest could have gone away from her or could have let her go away from him when he had the chance of keeping her with him but he was silent and would not allow his wife to ask him a question would not present himself in the room lest it should appear like intrusion and a wish to pry having the same chivalry toward darkeyed maggie as in the days when he had bought her the memorable present of books  but after a day or two mrs tulliver was gone to the mill again for a few hours to see to toms household matters maggie had wished this after the first violent outburst of feeling which came as soon as she had no longer any active purpose to fulfil she was less in need of her mothers presence she even desired to be alone with her grief but she had been solitary only a little while in the old sittingroom that looked on the river when there came a tap at the door and turning round her sad face as she said come in she saw bob enter with the baby in his arms and mumps at his heels  well go back if it disturbs you miss said bob  no said maggie in a low voice wishing she could smile  bob closing the door behind him came and stood before her  you see weve got a little un miss and i wantd you to look at it and take it in your arms if youd be so good for we made free to name it after you and it ud be better for your takin a bit o notice on it  maggie could not speak but she put out her arms to receive the tiny baby while mumps snuffed at it anxiously to ascertain that this transference was all right maggies heart had swelled at this action and speech of bobs she knew well enough that it was a way he had chosen to show his sympathy and respect  sit down bob she said presently and he sat down in silence finding his tongue unmanageable in quite a new fashion refusing to say what he wanted it to say  bob she said after a few moments looking down at the baby and holding it anxiously as if she feared it might slip from her mind and her fingers i have a favor to ask of you  dont you speak so miss said bob grasping the skin of mumpss neck if theres anything i can do for you i should look upon it as a days earnings  i want you to go to dr kenns and ask to speak to him and tell him that i am here and should be very grateful if he would come to me while my mother is away she will not come back till evening  eh miss id do it in a minuteit is but a stepbut dr kenns wife lies dead shes to be buried tomorrow died the day i come from mudport its all the more pity she should ha died just now if you want him i hardly like to go anigh him yet  oh no bob said maggie we must let it betill after a few days perhaps when you hear that he is going about again but perhaps he may be going out of townto a distance she added with a new sense of despondency at this idea  not he miss said bob hell none go away he isnt one o them gentlefolks as go to cry at waterinplaces when their wives die hes got summat else to do he looks fine and sharp after the parish he does he christened the little un an he was at me to know what i did of a sunday as i didnt come to church but i told him i was upo the travel three parts o the sundaysan then im so used to bein on my legs i cant sit so long on endan lors sir says i a packman can do wi a small lowance o church it tastes strong says i theres no call to lay it on thick eh miss how good the little un is wi you its like as if it knowed you it partly does ill be boundlike the birds know the mornin  bobs tongue was now evidently loosed from its unwonted bondage and might even be in danger of doing more work than was required of it but the subjects on which he longed to be informed were so steep and difficult of approach that his tongue was likely to run on along the level rather than to carry him on that unbeaten road he felt this and was silent again for a little while ruminating much on the possible forms in which he might put a question at last he said in a more timid voice than usual  will you give me leave to ask you only one thing miss  maggie was rather startled but she answered yes bob if it is about myselfnot about any one else  well miss its this do you owe anybody a grudge  no not any one said maggie looking up at him inquiringly why  oh lors miss said bob pinching mumpss neck harder than ever i wish you did an tell me id leather him till i couldnt seei wouldan the justice might do what he liked to me arter  oh bob said maggie smiling faintly youre a very good friend to me but i shouldnt like to punish any one even if theyd done me wrong ive done wrong myself too often  this view of things was puzzling to bob and threw more obscurity than ever over what could possibly have happened between stephen and maggie but further questions would have been too intrusive even if he could have framed them suitably and he was obliged to carry baby away again to an expectant mother  happen youd like mumps for company miss he said when he had taken the baby again hes rare company mumps is he knows iverything an makes no bother about it if i tell him hell lie before you an watch you as stilljust as he watches my pack youd better let me leave him a bit hell get fond on you lors its a fine thing to hev a dumb brute fond on you itll stick to you an make no jaw  yes do leave him please said maggie i think i should like to have mumps for a friend  mumps lie down there said bob pointing to a place in front of maggie and niver do you stir till youre spoke to  mumps lay down at once and made no sign of restlessness when his master left the room    chapter ii  st oggs passes judgment   it was soon known throughout st oggs that miss tulliver was come back she had not then eloped in order to be married to mr stephen guestat all events mr stephen guest had not married her which came to the same thing so far as her culpability was concerned we judge others according to results how elsenot knowing the process by which results are arrived at if miss tulliver after a few months of wellchosen travel had returned as mrs stephen guest with a postmarital trousseau and all the advantages possessed even by the most unwelcome wife of an only son public opinion which at st oggs as else where always knew what to think would have judged in strict consistency with those results public opinion in these cases is always of the feminine gendernot the world but the worlds wife and she would have seen that two handsome young peoplethe gentleman of quite the first family in st oggshaving found themselves in a false position had been led into a course which to say the least of it was highly injudicious and productive of sad pain and disappointment especially to that sweet young thing miss deane mr stephen guest had certainly not behaved well but then young men were liable to those sudden infatuated attachments and bad as it might seem in mrs stephen guest to admit the faintest advances from her cousins lover indeed it had been said that she was actually engaged to young wakemold wakem himself had mentioned it still she was very youngand a deformed young man you knowand young guest so very fascinating and they say he positively worships her to be sure that cant last and he ran away with her in the boat quite against her will and what could she do she couldnt come back then no one would have spoken to her and how very well that maizecolored satinette becomes her complexion it seems as if the folds in front were quite come in several of her dresses are made sothey say he thinks nothing too handsome to buy for her poor miss deane she is very pitiable but then there was no positive engagement and the air at the coast will do her good after all if young guest felt no more for her than that it was better for her not to marry him what a wonderful marriage for a girl like miss tulliverquite romantic why young guest will put up for the borough at the next election nothing like commerce nowadays that young wakem nearly went out of his mind he always was rather queer but hes gone abroad again to be out of the wayquite the best thing for a deformed young man miss unit declares she will never visit mr and mrs stephen guestsuch nonsense pretending to be better than other people society couldnt be carried on if we inquired into private conduct in that wayand christianity tells us to think no eviland my belief is that miss unit had no cards sent her  but the results we know were not of a kind to warrant this extenuation of the past maggie had returned without a trousseau without a husbandin that degraded and outcast condition to which error is well known to lead and the worlds wife with that fine instinct which is given her for the preservation of society saw at once that miss tullivers conduct had been of the most aggravated kind could anything be more detestable a girl so much indebted to her friendswhose mother as well as herself had received so much kindness from the deanesto lay the design of winning a young mans affections away from her own cousin who had behaved like a sister to her winning his affections that was not the phrase for such a girl as miss tulliver it would have been more correct to say that she had been actuated by mere unwomanly boldness and unbridled passion there was always something questionable about her that connection with young wakem which they said had been carried on for years looked very illdisgusting in fact but with a girl of that disposition to the worlds wife there had always been something in miss tullivers very physique that a refined instinct felt to be prophetic of harm as for poor mr stephen guest he was rather pitiable than otherwise a young man of fiveandtwenty is not to be too severely judged in these caseshe is really very much at the mercy of a designing bold girl and it was clear that he had given way in spite of himself he had shaken her off as soon as he could indeed their having parted so soon looked very black indeedfor her to be sure he had written a letter laying all the blame on himself and telling the story in a romantic fashion so as to try and make her appear quite innocent of course he would do that but the refined instinct of the worlds wife was not to be deceived providentiallyelse what would become of society why her own brother had turned her from his door he had seen enough you might be sure before he would do that a truly respectable young man mr tom tulliver quite likely to rise in the world his sisters disgrace was naturally a heavy blow to him it was to be hoped that she would go out of the neighborhoodto america or anywhereso as to purify the air of st oggs from the stain of her presence extremely dangerous to daughters there no good could happen to her it was only to be hoped she would repent and that god would have mercy on her he had not the care of society on his hands as the worlds wife had  it required nearly a fortnight for fine instinct to assure itself of these inspirations indeed it was a whole week before stephens letter came telling his father the facts and adding that he was gone across to hollandhad drawn upon the agent at mudport for moneywas incapable of any resolution at present  maggie all this while was too entirely filled with a more agonizing anxiety to spend any thought on the view that was being taken of her conduct by the world of st oggs anxiety about stephen lucy philip beat on her poor heart in a hard driving ceaseless storm of mingled love remorse and pity if she had thought of rejection and injustice at all it would have seemed to her that they had done their worst that she could hardly feel any stroke from them intolerable since the words she had heard from her brothers lips across all her anxiety for the loved and the injured those words shot again and again like a horrible pang that would have brought misery and dread even into a heaven of delights the idea of ever recovering happiness never glimmered in her mind for a moment it seemed as if every sensitive fibre in her were too entirely preoccupied by pain ever to vibrate again to another influence life stretched before her as one act of penitence and all she craved as she dwelt on her future lot was something to guarantee her from more falling her own weakness haunted her like a vision of hideous possibilities that made no peace conceivable except such as lay in the sense of a sure refuge  but she was not without practical intentions the love of independence was too strong an inheritance and a habit for her not to remember that she must get her bread and when other projects looked vague she fell back on that of returning to her plain sewing and so getting enough to pay for her lodging at bobs she meant to persuade her mother to return to the mill by and by and live with tom again and somehow or other she would maintain herself at st oggs dr kenn would perhaps help her and advise her she remembered his parting words at the bazaar she remembered the momentary feeling of reliance that had sprung in her when he was talking with her and she waited with yearning expectation for the opportunity of confiding everything to him her mother called every day at mr deanes to learn how lucy was the report was always sadnothing had yet roused her from the feeble passivity which had come on with the first shock but of philip mrs tulliver had learned nothing naturally no one whom she met would speak to her about what related to her daughter but at last she summoned courage to go and see sister glegg who of course would know everything and had been even to see tom at the mill in mrs tullivers absence though he had said nothing of what had passed on the occasion  as soon as her mother was gone maggie put on her bonnet she had resolved on walking to the rectory and asking to see dr kenn he was in deep grief but the grief of another does not jar upon us in such circumstances it was the first time she had been beyond the door since her return nevertheless her mind was so bent on the purpose of her walk that the unpleasantness of meeting people on the way and being stared at did not occur to her but she had no sooner passed beyond the narrower streets which she had to thread from bobs dwelling than she became aware of unusual glances cast at her and this consciousness made her hurry along nervously afraid to look to right or left presently however she came full on mrs and miss turnbull old acquaintances of her family they both looked at her strangely and turned a little aside without speaking all hard looks were pain to maggie but her selfreproach was too strong for resentment no wonder they will not speak to me she thought they are very fond of lucy but now she knew that she was about to pass a group of gentlemen who were standing at the door of the billiardrooms and she could not help seeing young torry step out a little with his glass at his eye and bow to her with that air of nonchalance which he might have bestowed on a friendly barmaid  maggies pride was too intense for her not to feel that sting even in the midst of her sorrow and for the first time the thought took strong hold of her that she would have other obloquy cast on her besides that which was felt to be due to her breach of faith toward lucy but she was at the rectory now there perhaps she would find something else than retribution retribution may come from any voice the hardest cruelest most imbruted urchin at the streetcorner can inflict it surely help and pity are rarer things more needful for the righteous to bestow  she was shown up at once after being announced into dr kenns study where he sat amongst piledup books for which he had little appetite leaning his cheek against the head of his youngest child a girl of three the child was sent away with the servant and when the door was closed dr kenn said placing a chair for maggie  i was coming to see you miss tulliver you have anticipated me i am glad you did  maggie looked at him with her childlike directness as she had done at the bazaar and said i want to tell you everything but her eyes filled fast with tears as she said it and all the pentup excitement of her humiliating walk would have its vent before she could say more  do tell me everything dr kenn said with quiet kindness in his grave firm voice think of me as one to whom a long experience has been granted which may enable him to help you  in rather broken sentences and with some effort at first but soon with the greater ease that came from a sense of relief in the confidence maggie told the brief story of a struggle that must be the beginning of a long sorrow only the day before dr kenn had been made acquainted with the contents of stephens letter and he had believed them at once without the confirmation of maggies statement that involuntary plaint of hers oh i must go had remained with him as the sign that she was undergoing some inward conflict  maggie dwelt the longest on the feeling which had made her come back to her mother and brother which made her cling to all the memories of the past when she had ended dr kenn was silent for some minutes there was a difficulty on his mind he rose and walked up and down the hearth with his hands behind him at last he seated himself again and said looking at maggie  your prompting to go to your nearest friendsto remain where all the ties of your life have been formedis a true prompting to which the church in its original constitution and discipline responds opening its arms to the penitent watching over its children to the last never abandoning them until they are hopelessly reprobate and the church ought to represent the feeling of the community so that every parish should be a family knit together by christian brotherhood under a spiritual father but the ideas of discipline and christian fraternity are entirely relaxedthey can hardly be said to exist in the public mind they hardly survive except in the partial contradictory form they have taken in the narrow communities of schismatics and if i were not supported by the firm faith that the church must ultimately recover the full force of that constitution which is alone fitted to human needs i should often lose heart at observing the want of fellowship and sense of mutual responsibility among my own flock at present everything seems tending toward the relaxation of tiestoward the substitution of wayward choice for the adherence to obligation which has its roots in the past your conscience and your heart have given you true light on this point miss tulliver and i have said all this that you may know what my wish about youwhat my advice to youwould be if they sprang from my own feeling and opinion unmodified by counteracting circumstances  dr kenn paused a little while there was an entire absence of effusive benevolence in his manner there was something almost cold in the gravity of his look and voice if maggie had not known that his benevolence was persevering in proportion to its reserve she might have been chilled and frightened as it was she listened expectantly quite sure that there would be some effective help in his words he went on  your inexperience of the world miss tulliver prevents you from anticipating fully the very unjust conceptions that will probably be formed concerning your conductconceptions which will have a baneful effect even in spite of known evidence to disprove them  oh i doi begin to see said maggie unable to repress this utterance of her recent pain i know i shall be insulted i shall be thought worse than i am  you perhaps do not yet know said dr kenn with a touch of more personal pity that a letter is come which ought to satisfy every one who has known anything of you that you chose the steep and difficult path of a return to the right at the moment when that return was most of all difficult  oh where is he said poor maggie with a flush and tremor that no presence could have hindered  he is gone abroad he has written of all that passed to his father he has vindicated you to the utmost and i hope the communication of that letter to your cousin will have a beneficial effect on her  dr kenn waited for her to get calm again before he went on  that letter as i said ought to suffice to prevent false impressions concerning you but i am bound to tell you miss tulliver that not only the experience of my whole life but my observation within the last three days makes me fear that there is hardly any evidence which will save you from the painful effect of false imputations the persons who are the most incapable of a conscientious struggle such as yours are precisely those who will be likely to shrink from you because they will not believe in your struggle i fear your life here will be attended not only with much pain but with many obstructions for this reasonand for this onlyi ask you to consider whether it will not perhaps be better for you to take a situation at a distance according to your former intention i will exert myself at once to obtain one for you  oh if i could but stop here said maggie i have no heart to begin a strange life again i should have no stay i should feel like a lonely wanderer cut off from the past i have written to the lady who offered me a situation to excuse myself if i remained here i could perhaps atone in some way to lucyto others i could convince them that im sorry and she added with some of the old proud fire flashing out i will not go away because people say false things of me they shall learn to retract them if i must go away at last becausebecause others wish it i will not go now  well said dr kenn after some consideration if you determine on that miss tulliver you may rely on all the influence my position gives me i am bound to aid and countenance you by the very duties of my office as a parish priest i will add that personally i have a deep interest in your peace of mind and welfare  the only thing i want is some occupation that will enable me to get my bread and be independent said maggie i shall not want much i can go on lodging where i am  i must think over the subject maturely said dr kenn and in a few days i shall be better able to ascertain the general feeling i shall come to see you i shall bear you constantly in mind  when maggie had left him dr kenn stood ruminating with his hands behind him and his eyes fixed on the carpet under a painful sense of doubt and difficulty the tone of stephens letter which he had read and the actual relations of all the persons concerned forced upon him powerfully the idea of an ultimate marriage between stephen and maggie as the least evil and the impossibility of their proximity in st oggs on any other supposition until after years of separation threw an insurmountable prospective difficulty over maggies stay there on the other hand he entered with all the comprehension of a man who had known spiritual conflict and lived through years of devoted service to his fellowmen into that state of maggies heart and conscience which made the consent to the marriage a desecration to her her conscience must not be tampered with the principle on which she had acted was a safer guide than any balancing of consequences his experience told him that intervention was too dubious a responsibility to be lightly incurred the possible issue either of an endeavor to restore the former relations with lucy and philip or of counselling submission to this irruption of a new feeling was hidden in a darkness all the more impenetrable because each immediate step was clogged with evil  the great problem of the shifting relation between passion and duty is clear to no man who is capable of apprehending it the question whether the moment has come in which a man has fallen below the possibility of a renunciation that will carry any efficacy and must accept the sway of a passion against which he had struggled as a trespass is one for which we have no masterkey that will fit all cases the casuists have become a byword of reproach but their perverted spirit of minute discrimination was the shadow of a truth to which eyes and hearts are too often fatally sealedthe truth that moral judgments must remain false and hollow unless they are checked and enlightened by a perpetual reference to the special circumstances that mark the individual lot  all people of broad strong sense have an instinctive repugnance to the men of maxims because such people early discern that the mysterious complexity of our life is not to be embraced by maxims and that to lace ourselves up in formulas of that sort is to repress all the divine promptings and inspirations that spring from growing insight and sympathy and the man of maxims is the popular representative of the minds that are guided in their moral judgment solely by general rules thinking that these will lead them to justice by a readymade patent method without the trouble of exerting patience discrimination impartialitywithout any care to assure themselves whether they have the insight that comes from a hardly earned estimate of temptation or from a life vivid and intense enough to have created a wide fellowfeeling with all that is human    chapter iii  showing that old acquaintances are capable of surprising us   when maggie was at home again her mother brought her news of an unexpected line of conduct in aunt glegg as long as maggie had not been heard of mrs glegg had half closed her shutters and drawn down her blinds she felt assured that maggie was drowned that was far more probable than that her niece and legatee should have done anything to wound the family honor in the tenderest point when at last she learned from tom that maggie had come home and gathered from him what was her explanation of her absence she burst forth in severe reproof of tom for admitting the worst of his sister until he was compelled if you were not to stand by your kin as long as there was a shred of honor attributable to them pray what were you to stand by lightly to admit conduct in one of your own family that would force you to alter your will had never been the way of the dodsons and though mrs glegg had always augured ill of maggies future at a time when other people were perhaps less clearsighted yet fair play was a jewel and it was not for her own friends to help to rob the girl of her fair fame and to cast her out from family shelter to the scorn of the outer world until she had become unequivocally a family disgrace the circumstances were unprecedented in mrs gleggs experience nothing of that kind had happened among the dodsons before but it was a case in which her hereditary rectitude and personal strength of character found a common channel along with her fundamental ideas of clanship as they did in her lifelong regard to equity in money matters she quarrelled with mr glegg whose kindness flowing entirely into compassion for lucy made him as hard in his judgment of maggie as mr deane himself was and fuming against her sister tulliver because she did not at once come to her for advice and help shut herself up in her own room with baxters saints rest from morning till night denying herself to all visitors till mr glegg brought from mr deane the news of stephens letter then mrs glegg felt that she had adequate fightingground then she laid aside baxter and was ready to meet all comers while mrs pullet could do nothing but shake her head and cry and wish that cousin abbot had died or any number of funerals had happened rather than this which had never happened before so that there was no knowing how to act and mrs pullet could never enter st oggs again because acquaintances knew of it all mrs glegg only hoped that mrs wooll or any one else would come to her with their false tales about her own niece and she would know what to say to that illadvised person  again she had a scene of remonstrance with tom all the more severe in proportion to the greater strength of her present position but tom like other immovable things seemed only the more rigidly fixed under that attempt to shake him poor tom he judged by what he had been able to see and the judgment was painful enough to himself he thought he had the demonstration of facts observed through years by his own eyes which gave no warning of their imperfection that maggies nature was utterly untrustworthy and too strongly marked with evil tendencies to be safely treated with leniency he would act on that demonstration at any cost but the thought of it made his days bitter to him tom like every one of us was imprisoned within the limits of his own nature and his education had simply glided over him leaving a slight deposit of polish if you are inclined to be severe on his severity remember that the responsibility of tolerance lies with those who have the wider vision there had arisen in tom a repulsion toward maggie that derived its very intensity from their early childish love in the time when they had clasped tiny fingers together and their later sense of nearness in a common duty and a common sorrow the sight of her as he had told her was hateful to him in this branch of the dodson family aunt glegg found a stronger nature than her own a nature in which family feeling had lost the character of clanship by taking on a doubly deep dye of personal pride  mrs glegg allowed that maggie ought to be punishedshe was not a woman to deny that she knew what conduct wasbut punished in proportion to the misdeeds proved against her not to those which were cast upon her by people outside her own family who might wish to show that their own kin were better  your aunt glegg scolded me so as niver was my dear said poor mrs tulliver when she came back to maggie as i didnt go to her before she said it wasnt for her to come to me first but she spoke like a sister too having she allays was and hard to pleaseoh dearbut shes said the kindest word as has ever been spoke by you yet my child for she says for all shes been so set again having one extry in the house and making extry spoons and things and putting her about in her ways you shall have a shelter in her house if youll go to her dutiful and shell uphold you against folks as say harm of you when theyve no call and i told her i thought you couldnt bear to see anybody but me you were so beat down with trouble but she said i wont throw ill words at her theres them out o th family ull be ready enough to do that but ill give her good advice an she must be humble its wonderful o jane for im sure she used to throw everything i did wrong at meif it was the raisinwine as turned out bad or the pies too hot or whativer it was  oh mother said poor maggie shrinking from the thought of all the contact her bruised mind would have to bear tell her im very grateful ill go to see her as soon as i can but i cant see any one just yet except dr kenn ive been to himhe will advise me and help me to get some occupation i cant live with any one or be dependent on them tell aunt glegg i must get my own bread but did you hear nothing of philipphilip wakem have you never seen any one that has mentioned him  no my dear but ive been to lucys and i saw your uncle and he says they got her to listen to the letter and she took notice o miss guest and asked questions and the doctor thinks shes on the turn to be better what a world this iswhat trouble oh dear the law was the first beginning and its gone from bad to worse all of a sudden just when the luck seemed on the turn this was the first lamentation that mrs tulliver had let slip to maggie but old habit had been revived by the interview with sister glegg  my poor poor mother maggie burst out cut to the heart with pity and compunction and throwing her arms round her mothers neck i was always naughty and troublesome to you and now you might have been happy if it hadnt been for me  eh my dear said mrs tulliver leaning toward the warm young cheek i must put up wi my childreni shall never have no more and if they bring me bad luck i must be fond on it theres nothing else much to be fond on for my furnitur went long ago and youd got to be very good once i cant think how its turned out the wrong way so  still two or three more days passed and maggie heard nothing of philip anxiety about him was becoming her predominant trouble and she summoned courage at last to inquire about him of dr kenn on his next visit to her he did not even know if philip was at home the elder wakem was made moody by an accumulation of annoyance the disappointment in this young jetsome to whom apparently he was a good deal attached had been followed close by the catastrophe to his sons hopes after he had done violence to his own strong feeling by conceding to them and had incautiously mentioned this concession in st oggs and he was almost fierce in his brusqueness when any one asked him a question about his son  but philip could hardly have been ill or it would have been known through the calling in of the medical man it was probable that he was gone out of the town for a little while maggie sickened under this suspense and her imagination began to live more and more persistently in what philip was enduring what did he believe about her  at last bob brought her a letter without a postmark directed in a hand which she knew familiarly in the letters of her own namea hand in which her name had been written long ago in a pocket shakespeare which she possessed her mother was in the room and maggie in violent agitation hurried upstairs that she might read the letter in solitude she read it with a throbbing brow    maggiei believe in you i know you never meant to deceive me i   know you tried to keep faith to me and to all i believed this   before i had any other evidence of it than your own nature the   night after i last parted from you i suffered torments i had seen   what convinced me that you were not free that there was another   whose presence had a power over you which mine never possessed but   through all the suggestionsalmost murderous suggestionsof rage   and jealousy my mind made its way to believe in your truthfulness   i was sure that you meant to cleave to me as you had said that   you had rejected him that you struggled to renounce him for   lucys sake and for mine but i could see no issue that was not   fatal for you and that dread shut out the very thought of   resignation i foresaw that he would not relinquish you and i   believed then as i believe now that the strong attraction which   drew you together proceeded only from one side of your characters   and belonged to that partial divided action of our nature which   makes half the tragedy of the human lot i have felt the vibration   of chords in your nature that i have continually felt the want of   in his but perhaps i am wrong perhaps i feel about you as the   artist does about the scene over which his soul has brooded with   love he would tremble to see it confided to other hands he would   never believe that it could bear for another all the meaning and   the beauty it bears for him    i dared not trust myself to see you that morning i was filled   with selfish passion i was shattered by a night of conscious   delirium i told you long ago that i had never been resigned even   to the mediocrity of my powers how could i be resigned to the loss   of the one thing which had ever come to me on earth with the   promise of such deep joy as would give a new and blessed meaning to   the foregoing painthe promise of another self that would lift my   aching affection into the divine rapture of an everspringing   eversatisfied want    but the miseries of that night had prepared me for what came   before the next it was no surprise to me i was certain that he   had prevailed on you to sacrifice everything to him and i waited   with equal certainty to hear of your marriage i measured your love   and his by my own but i was wrong maggie there is something   stronger in you than your love for him    i will not tell you what i went through in that interval but even   in its utmost agonyeven in those terrible throes that love must   suffer before it can be disembodied of selfish desiremy love for   you sufficed to withhold me from suicide without the aid of any   other motive in the midst of my egoism i yet could not bear to   come like a deathshadow across the feast of your joy i could not   bear to forsake the world in which you still lived and might need   me it was part of the faith i had vowed to youto wait and   endure maggie that is a proof of what i write now to assure you   ofthat no anguish i have had to bear on your account has been   too heavy a price to pay for the new life into which i have entered   in loving you i want you to put aside all grief because of the   grief you have caused me i was nurtured in the sense of privation   i never expected happiness and in knowing you in loving you i   have had and still have what reconciles me to life you have been   to my affections what light what color is to my eyes what music   is to the inward ear you have raised a dim unrest into a vivid   consciousness the new life i have found in caring for your joy and   sorrow more than for what is directly my own has transformed the   spirit of rebellious murmuring into that willing endurance which is   the birth of strong sympathy i think nothing but such complete and   intense love could have initiated me into that enlarged life which   grows and grows by appropriating the life of others for before i   was always dragged back from it by everpresent painful   selfconsciousness i even think sometimes that this gift of   transferred life which has come to me in loving you may be a new   power to me    then dear one in spite of all you have been the blessing of my   life let no selfreproach weigh on you because of me it is i who   should rather reproach myself for having urged my feelings upon   you and hurried you into words that you have felt as fetters you   meant to be true to those words you have been true i can   measure your sacrifice by what i have known in only one halfhour   of your presence with me when i dreamed that you might love me   best but maggie i have no just claim on you for more than   affectionate remembrance    for some time i have shrunk from writing to you because i have   shrunk even from the appearance of wishing to thrust myself before   you and so repeating my original error but you will not   misconstrue me i know that we must keep apart for a long while   cruel tongues would force us apart if nothing else did but i   shall not go away the place where you are is the one where my mind   must live wherever i might travel and remember that i am   unchangeably yoursyours not with selfish wishes but with a   devotion that excludes such wishes    god comfort you my loving largesouled maggie if every one else   has misconceived you remember that you have never been doubted by   him whose heart recognized you ten years ago    do not believe any one who says i am ill because i am not seen   out of doors i have only had nervous headachesno worse than i   have sometimes had them before but the overpowering heat inclines   me to be perfectly quiescent in the daytime i am strong enough to   obey any word which shall tell me that i can serve you by word or   deed                            yours to the last                            philip wakem  as maggie knelt by the bed sobbing with that letter pressed under her her feelings again and again gathered themselves in a whispered cry always in the same words  o god is there any happiness in love that could make me forget their pain    chapter iv  maggie and lucy   by the end of the week dr kenn had made up his mind that there was only one way in which he could secure to maggie a suitable living at st oggs even with his twenty years experience as a parish priest he was aghast at the obstinate continuance of imputations against her in the face of evidence hitherto he had been rather more adored and appealed to than was quite agreeable to him but now in attempting to open the ears of women to reason and their consciences to justice on behalf of maggie tulliver he suddenly found himself as powerless as he was aware he would have been if he had attempted to influence the shape of bonnets dr kenn could not be contradicted he was listened to in silence but when he left the room a comparison of opinions among his hearers yielded much the same result as before miss tulliver had undeniably acted in a blamable manner even dr kenn did not deny that how then could he think so lightly of her as to put that favorable interpretation on everything she had done even on the supposition that required the utmost stretch of beliefnamely that none of the things said about miss tulliver were truestill since they had been said about her they had cast an odor round her which must cause her to be shrunk from by every woman who had to take care of her own reputationand of society to have taken maggie by the hand and said i will not believe unproved evil of you my lips shall not utter it my ears shall be closed against it i too am an erring mortal liable to stumble apt to come short of my most earnest efforts your lot has been harder than mine your temptation greater let us help each other to stand and walk without more fallingto have done this would have demanded courage deep pity selfknowledge generous trust would have demanded a mind that tasted no piquancy in evilspeaking that felt no selfexaltation in condemning that cheated itself with no large words into the belief that life can have any moral end any high religion which excludes the striving after perfect truth justice and love toward the individual men and women who come across our own path the ladies of st oggs were not beguiled by any wide speculative conceptions but they had their favorite abstraction called society which served to make their consciences perfectly easy in doing what satisfied their own egoismthinking and speaking the worst of maggie tulliver and turning their backs upon her it was naturally disappointing to dr kenn after two years of superfluous incense from his feminine parishioners to find them suddenly maintaining their views in opposition to his but then they maintained them in opposition to a higher authority which they had venerated longer that authority had furnished a very explicit answer to persons who might inquire where their social duties began and might be inclined to take wide views as to the startingpoint the answer had not turned on the ultimate good of society but on a certain man who was found in trouble by the wayside  not that st oggs was empty of women with some tenderness of heart and conscience probably it had as fair a proportion of human goodness in it as any other small trading town of that day but until every good man is brave we must expect to find many good women timidtoo timid even to believe in the correctness of their own best promptings when these would place them in a minority and the men at st oggs were not all brave by any means some of them were even fond of scandal and to an extent that might have given their conversation an effeminate character if it had not been distinguished by masculine jokes and by an occasional shrug of the shoulders at the mutual hatred of women it was the general feeling of the masculine mind at st oggs that women were not to be interfered with in their treatment of each other  and thus every direction in which dr kenn had turned in the hope of procuring some kind recognition and some employment for maggie proved a disappointment to him mrs james torry could not think of taking maggie as a nursery governess even temporarilya young woman about whom such things had been said and about whom gentlemen joked and miss kirke who had a spinal complaint and wanted a reader and companion felt quite sure that maggies mind must be of a quality with which she for her part could not risk any contact why did not miss tulliver accept the shelter offered her by her aunt glegg it did not become a girl like her to refuse it or else why did she not go out of the neighborhood and get a situation where she was not known it was not apparently of so much importance that she should carry her dangerous tendencies into strange families unknown at st oggs she must be very bold and hardened to wish to stay in a parish where she was so much stared at and whispered about  dr kenn having great natural firmness began in the presence of this opposition as every firm man would have done to contract a certain strength of determination over and above what would have been called forth by the end in view he himself wanted a daily governess for his younger children and though he had hesitated in the first instance to offer this position to maggie the resolution to protest with the utmost force of his personal and priestly character against her being crushed and driven away by slander was now decisive maggie gratefully accepted an employment that gave her duties as well as a support her days would be filled now and solitary evenings would be a welcome rest she no longer needed the sacrifice her mother made in staying with her and mrs tulliver was persuaded to go back to the mill  but now it began to be discovered that dr kenn exemplary as he had hitherto appeared had his crotchets possibly his weaknesses the masculine mind of st oggs smiled pleasantly and did not wonder that kenn liked to see a fine pair of eyes daily or that he was inclined to take so lenient a view of the past the feminine mind regarded at that period as less powerful took a more melancholy view of the case if dr kenn should be beguiled into marrying that miss tulliver it was not safe to be too confident even about the best of men an apostle had fallen and wept bitterly afterwards and though peters denial was not a close precedent his repentance was likely to be  maggie had not taken her daily walks to the rectory for many weeks before the dreadful possibility of her some time or other becoming the rectors wife had been talked of so often in confidence that ladies were beginning to discuss how they should behave to her in that position for dr kenn it had been understood had sat in the schoolroom half an hour one morning when miss tulliver was giving her lessonsnay he had sat there every morning he had once walked home with herhe almost always walked home with herand if not he went to see her in the evening what an artful creature she was what a mother for those children it was enough to make poor mrs kenn turn in her grave that they should be put under the care of this girl only a few weeks after her death would he be so lost to propriety as to marry her before the year was out the masculine mind was sarcastic and thought not  the miss guests saw an alleviation to the sorrow of witnessing a folly in their rector at least their brother would be safe and their knowledge of stephens tenacity was a constant ground of alarm to them lest he should come back and marry maggie they were not among those who disbelieved their brothers letter but they had no confidence in maggies adherence to her renunciation of him they suspected that she had shrunk rather from the elopement than from the marriage and that she lingered in st oggs relying on his return to her they had always thought her disagreeable they now thought her artful and proud having quite as good grounds for that judgment as you and i probably have for many strong opinions of the same kind formerly they had not altogether delighted in the contemplated match with lucy but now their dread of a marriage between stephen and maggie added its momentum to their genuine pity and indignation on behalf of the gentle forsaken girl in making them desire that he should return to her as soon as lucy was able to leave home she was to seek relief from the oppressive heat of this august by going to the coast with the miss guests and it was in their plans that stephen should be induced to join them on the very first hint of gossip concerning maggie and dr kenn the report was conveyed in miss guests letter to her brother  maggie had frequent tidings through her mother or aunt glegg or dr kenn of lucys gradual progress toward recovery and her thoughts tended continually toward her uncle deanes house she hungered for an interview with lucy if it were only for five minutes to utter a word of penitence to be assured by lucys own eyes and lips that she did not believe in the willing treachery of those whom she had loved and trusted but she knew that even if her uncles indignation had not closed his house against her the agitation of such an interview would have been forbidden to lucy only to have seen her without speaking would have been some relief for maggie was haunted by a face cruel in its very gentleness a face that had been turned on hers with glad sweet looks of trust and love from the twilight time of memory changed now to a sad and weary face by a first heartstroke and as the days passed on that pale image became more and more distinct the picture grew and grew into more speaking definiteness under the avenging hand of remorse the soft hazel eyes in their look of pain were bent forever on maggie and pierced her the more because she could see no anger in them but lucy was not yet able to go to church or any place where maggie could see her and even the hope of that departed when the news was told her by aunt glegg that lucy was really going away in a few days to scarborough with the miss guests who had been heard to say that they expected their brother to meet them there  only those who have known what hardest inward conflict is can know what maggie felt as she sat in her loneliness the evening after hearing that news from mrs gleggonly those who have known what it is to dread their own selfish desires as the watching mother would dread the sleepingpotion that was to still her own pain  she sat without candle in the twilight with the window wide open toward the river the sense of oppressive heat adding itself undistinguishably to the burthen of her lot seated on a chair against the window with her arm on the windowsill she was looking blankly at the flowing river swift with the backwardrushing tide struggling to see still the sweet face in its unreproaching sadness that seemed now from moment to moment to sink away and be hidden behind a form that thrust itself between and made darkness hearing the door open she thought mrs jakin was coming in with her supper as usual and with that repugnance to trivial speech which comes with languor and wretchedness she shrank from turning round and saying she wanted nothing good little mrs jakin would be sure to make some wellmeant remarks but the next moment without her having discerned the sound of a footstep she felt a light hand on her shoulder and heard a voice close to her saying maggie  the face was therechanged but all the sweeter the hazel eyes were there with their heartpiercing tenderness  maggie the soft voice said lucy answered a voice with a sharp ring of anguish in it and lucy threw her arms round maggies neck and leaned her pale cheek against the burning brow  i stole out said lucy almost in a whisper while she sat down close to maggie and held her hand when papa and the rest were away alice is come with me i asked her to help me but i must only stay a little while because it is so late  it was easier to say that at first than to say anything else they sat looking at each other it seemed as if the interview must end without more speech for speech was very difficult each felt that there would be something scorching in the words that would recall the irretrievable wrong but soon as maggie looked every distinct thought began to be overflowed by a wave of loving penitence and words burst forth with a sob  god bless you for coming lucy  the sobs came thick on each other after that  maggie dear be comforted said lucy now putting her cheek against maggies again dont grieve and she sat still hoping to soothe maggie with that gentle caress  i didnt mean to deceive you lucy said maggie as soon as she could speak it always made me wretched that i felt what i didnt like you to know it was because i thought it would all be conquered and you might never see anything to wound you  i know dear said lucy i know you never meant to make me unhappy it is a trouble that has come on us all you have more to bear than i haveand you gave him up whenyou did what it must have been very hard to do  they were silent again a little while sitting with clasped hands and cheeks leaned together  lucy maggie began again he struggled too he wanted to be true to you he will come back to you forgive himhe will be happy then  these words were wrung forth from maggies deepest soul with an effort like the convulsed clutch of a drowning man lucy trembled and was silent  a gentle knock came at the door it was alice the maid who entered and said  i darent stay any longer miss deane theyll find it out and therell be such anger at your coming out so late  lucy rose and said very well alicein a minute  im to go away on friday maggie she added when alice had closed the door again when i come back and am strong they will let me do as i like i shall come to you when i please then  lucy said maggie with another great effort i pray to god continually that i may never be the cause of sorrow to you any more  she pressed the little hand that she held between hers and looked up into the face that was bent over hers lucy never forgot that look  maggie she said in a low voice that had the solemnity of confession in it you are better than i am i cant  she broke off there and said no more but they clasped each other again in a last embrace    chapter v  the last conflict   in the second week of september maggie was again sitting in her lonely room battling with the old shadowy enemies that were forever slain and rising again it was past midnight and the rain was beating heavily against the window driven with fitful force by the rushing loudmoaning wind for the day after lucys visit there had been a sudden change in the weather the heat and drought had given way to cold variable winds and heavy falls of rain at intervals and she had been forbidden to risk the contemplated journey until the weather should become more settled in the counties higher up the floss the rains had been continuous and the completion of the harvest had been arrested and now for the last two days the rains on this lower course of the river had been incessant so that the old men had shaken their heads and talked of sixty years ago when the same sort of weather happening about the equinox brought on the great floods which swept the bridge away and reduced the town to great misery but the younger generation who had seen several small floods thought lightly of these sombre recollections and forebodings and bob jakin naturally prone to take a hopeful view of his own luck laughed at his mother when she regretted their having taken a house by the riverside observing that but for that they would have had no boats which were the most lucky of possessions in case of a flood that obliged them to go to a distance for food  but the careless and the fearful were alike sleeping in their beds now there was hope that the rain would abate by the morrow threatenings of a worse kind from sudden thaws after falls of snow had often passed off in the experience of the younger ones and at the very worst the banks would be sure to break lower down the river when the tide came in with violence and so the waters would be carried off without causing more than temporary inconvenience and losses that would be felt only by the poorer sort whom charity would relieve  all were in their beds now for it was past midnight all except some solitary watchers such as maggie she was seated in her little parlor toward the river with one candle that left everything dim in the room except a letter which lay before her on the table that letter which had come to her today was one of the causes that had kept her up far on into the night unconscious how the hours were going careless of seeking rest with no image of rest coming across her mind except of that far far off rest from which there would be no more waking for her into this struggling earthly life  two days before maggie received that letter she had been to the rectory for the last time the heavy rain would have prevented her from going since but there was another reason dr kenn at first enlightened only by a few hints as to the new turn which gossip and slander had taken in relation to maggie had recently been made more fully aware of it by an earnest remonstrance from one of his male parishioners against the indiscretion of persisting in the attempt to overcome the prevalent feeling in the parish by a course of resistance dr kenn having a conscience void of offence in the matter was still inclined to perseverewas still averse to give way before a public sentiment that was odious and contemptible but he was finally wrought upon by the consideration of the peculiar responsibility attached to his office of avoiding the appearance of evilan appearance that is always dependent on the average quality of surrounding minds where these minds are low and gross the area of that appearance is proportionately widened perhaps he was in danger of acting from obstinacy perhaps it was his duty to succumb conscientious people are apt to see their duty in that which is the most painful course and to recede was always painful to dr kenn he made up his mind that he must advise maggie to go away from st oggs for a time and he performed that difficult task with as much delicacy as he could only stating in vague terms that he found his attempt to countenance her stay was a source of discord between himself and his parishioners that was likely to obstruct his usefulness as a clergyman he begged her to allow him to write to a clerical friend of his who might possibly take her into his own family as governess and if not would probably know of some other available position for a young woman in whose welfare dr kenn felt a strong interest  poor maggie listened with a trembling lip she could say nothing but a faint thank you i shall be grateful and she walked back to her lodgings through the driving rain with a new sense of desolation she must be a lonely wanderer she must go out among fresh faces that would look at her wonderingly because the days did not seem joyful to her she must begin a new life in which she would have to rouse herself to receive new impressions and she was so unspeakably sickeningly weary there was no home no help for the erring even those who pitied were constrained to hardness but ought she to complain ought she to shrink in this way from the long penance of life which was all the possibility she had of lightening the load to some other sufferers and so changing that passionate error into a new force of unselfish human love all the next day she sat in her lonely room with a window darkened by the cloud and the driving rain thinking of that future and wrestling for patience for what repose could poor maggie ever win except by wrestling  and on the third daythis day of which she had just sat out the closethe letter had come which was lying on the table before her  the letter was from stephen he was come back from holland he was at mudport again unknown to any of his friends and had written to her from that place enclosing the letter to a person whom he trusted in st oggs from beginning to end it was a passionate cry of reproach an appeal against her useless sacrifice of him of herself against that perverted notion of right which led her to crush all his hopes for the sake of a mere idea and not any substantial goodhis hopes whom she loved and who loved her with that single overpowering passion that worship which a man never gives to a woman more than once in his life  they have written to me that you are to marry kenn as if i should believe that perhaps they have told you some such fables about me perhaps they tell you ive been travelling my body has been dragged about somewhere but i have never travelled from the hideous place where you left me where i started up from the stupor of helpless rage to find you gone  maggie whose pain can have been like mine whose injury is like mine who besides me has met that long look of love that has burnt itself into my soul so that no other image can come there maggie call me back to you call me back to life and goodness i am banished from both now i have no motives i am indifferent to everything two months have only deepened the certainty that i can never care for life without you write me one word say come in two days i should be with you maggie have you forgotten what it was to be togetherto be within reach of a look to be within hearing of each others voice  when maggie first read this letter she felt as if her real temptation had only just begun at the entrance of the chill dark cavern we turn with unworn courage from the warm light but how when we have trodden far in the damp darkness and have begun to be faint and weary how if there is a sudden opening above us and we are invited back again to the lifenourishing day the leap of natural longing from under the pressure of pain is so strong that all less immediate motives are likely to be forgottentill the pain has been escaped from  for hours maggie felt as if her struggle had been in vain for hours every other thought that she strove to summon was thrust aside by the image of stephen waiting for the single word that would bring him to her she did not read the letter she heard him uttering it and the voice shook her with its old strange power all the day before she had been filled with the vision of a lonely future through which she must carry the burthen of regret upheld only by clinging faith and here close within her reach urging itself upon her even as a claim was another future in which hard endurance and effort were to be exchanged for easy delicious leaning on anothers loving strength and yet that promise of joy in the place of sadness did not make the dire force of the temptation to maggie  it was stephens tone of misery it was the doubt in the justice of her own resolve that made the balance tremble and made her once start from her seat to reach the pen and paper and write come  but close upon that decisive act her mind recoiled and the sense of contradiction with her past self in her moments of strength and clearness came upon her like a pang of conscious degradation no she must wait she must pray the light that had forsaken her would come again she should feel again what she had felt when she had fled away under an inspiration strong enough to conquer agonyto conquer love she should feel again what she had felt when lucy stood by her when philips letter had stirred all the fibres that bound her to the calmer past  she sat quite still far on into the night with no impulse to change her attitude without active force enough even for the mental act of prayer only waiting for the light that would surely come again it came with the memories that no passion could long quench the long past came back to her and with it the fountains of selfrenouncing pity and affection of faithfulness and resolve the words that were marked by the quiet hand in the little old book that she had long ago learned by heart rushed even to her lips and found a vent for themselves in a low murmur that was quite lost in the loud driving of the rain against the window and the loud moan and roar of the wind i have received the cross i have received it from thy hand i will bear it and bear it till death as thou hast laid it upon me  but soon other words rose that could find no utterance but in a sobforgive me stephen it will pass away you will come back to her  she took up the letter held it to the candle and let it burn slowly on the hearth tomorrow she would write to him the last word of parting  i will bear it and bear it till death but how long it will be before death comes i am so young so healthy how shall i have patience and strength am i to struggle and fall and repent again has life other trials as hard for me still  with that cry of selfdespair maggie fell on her knees against the table and buried her sorrowstricken face her soul went out to the unseen pity that would be with her to the end surely there was something being taught her by this experience of great need and she must be learning a secret of human tenderness and longsuffering that the less erring could hardly know o god if my life is to be long let me live to bless and comfort  at that moment maggie felt a startling sensation of sudden cold about her knees and feet it was water flowing under her she started up the stream was flowing under the door that led into the passage she was not bewildered for an instant she knew it was the flood  the tumult of emotion she had been enduring for the last twelve hours seemed to have left a great calm in her without screaming she hurried with the candle upstairs to bob jakins bedroom the door was ajar she went in and shook him by the shoulder  bob the flood is come it is in the house let us see if we can make the boats safe  she lighted his candle while the poor wife snatching up her baby burst into screams and then she hurried down again to see if the waters were rising fast there was a step down into the room at the door leading from the staircase she saw that the water was already on a level with the step while she was looking something came with a tremendous crash against the window and sent the leaded panes and the old wooden framework inward in shivers the water pouring in after it  it is the boat cried maggie bob come down to get the boats  and without a moments shudder of fear she plunged through the water which was rising fast to her knees and by the glimmering light of the candle she had left on the stairs she mounted on to the windowsill and crept into the boat which was left with the prow lodging and protruding through the window bob was not long after her hurrying without shoes or stockings but with the lanthorn in his hand  why theyre both hereboth the boats said bob as he got into the one where maggie was its wonderful this fastening isnt broke too as well as the mooring  in the excitement of getting into the other boat unfastening it and mastering an oar bob was not struck with the danger maggie incurred we are not apt to fear for the fearless when we are companions in their danger and bobs mind was absorbed in possible expedients for the safety of the helpless indoors the fact that maggie had been up had waked him and had taken the lead in activity gave bob a vague impression of her as one who would help to protect not need to be protected she too had got possession of an oar and had pushed off so as to release the boat from the overhanging windowframe  the waters rising so fast said bob i doubt itll be in at the chambers before longth house is so low ive more mind to get prissy and the child and the mother into the boat if i could and trusten to the waterfor th old house is none so safe and if i let go the boatbut you he exclaimed suddenly lifting the light of his lanthorn on maggie as she stood in the rain with the oar in her hand and her black hair streaming  maggie had no time to answer for a new tidal current swept along the line of the houses and drove both the boats out on to the wide water with a force that carried them far past the meeting current of the river  in the first moments maggie felt nothing thought of nothing but that she had suddenly passed away from that life which she had been dreading it was the transition of death without its agonyand she was alone in the darkness with god  the whole thing had been so rapid so dreamlike that the threads of ordinary association were broken she sank down on the seat clutching the oar mechanically and for a long while had no distinct conception of her position the first thing that waked her to fuller consciousness was the cessation of the rain and a perception that the darkness was divided by the faintest light which parted the overhanging gloom from the immeasurable watery level below she was driven out upon the floodthat awful visitation of god which her father used to talk of which had made the nightmare of her childish dreams and with that thought there rushed in the vision of the old home and tom and her motherthey had all listened together  o god where am i which is the way home she cried out in the dim loneliness  what was happening to them at the mill the flood had once nearly destroyed it they might be in danger in distressher mother and her brother alone there beyond reach of help her whole soul was strained now on that thought and she saw the longloved faces looking for help into the darkness and finding none  she was floating in smooth water nowperhaps far on the overflooded fields there was no sense of present danger to check the outgoing of her mind to the old home and she strained her eyes against the curtain of gloom that she might seize the first sight of her whereaboutthat she might catch some faint suggestion of the spot toward which all her anxieties tended  oh how welcome the widening of that dismal watery level the gradual uplifting of the cloudy firmament the slowly defining blackness of objects above the glassy dark yes she must be out on the fields those were the tops of hedgerow trees which way did the river lie looking behind her she saw the lines of black trees looking before her there were none then the river lay before her she seized an oar and began to paddle the boat forward with the energy of wakening hope the dawning seemed to advance more swiftly now she was in action and she could soon see the poor dumb beasts crowding piteously on a mound where they had taken refuge onward she paddled and rowed by turns in the growing twilight her wet clothes clung round her and her streaming hair was dashed about by the wind but she was hardly conscious of any bodily sensationsexcept a sensation of strength inspired by mighty emotion along with the sense of danger and possible rescue for those longremembered beings at the old home there was an undefined sense of reconcilement with her brother what quarrel what harshness what unbelief in each other can subsist in the presence of a great calamity when all the artificial vesture of our life is gone and we are all one with each other in primitive mortal needs vaguely maggie felt this in the strong resurgent love toward her brother that swept away all the later impressions of hard cruel offence and misunderstanding and left only the deep underlying unshakable memories of early union  but now there was a large dark mass in the distance and near to her maggie could discern the current of the river the dark mass must beyes it wasst oggs ah now she knew which way to look for the first glimpse of the wellknown treesthe gray willows the now yellowing chestnutsand above them the old roof but there was no color no shape yet all was faint and dim more and more strongly the energies seemed to come and put themselves forth as if her life were a storedup force that was being spent in this hour unneeded for any future  she must get her boat into the current of the floss else she would never be able to pass the ripple and approach the house this was the thought that occurred to her as she imagined with more and more vividness the state of things round the old home but then she might be carried very far down and be unable to guide her boat out of the current again for the first time distinct ideas of danger began to press upon her but there was no choice of courses no room for hesitation and she floated into the current swiftly she went now without effort more and more clearly in the lessening distance and the growing light she began to discern the objects that she knew must be the wellknown trees and roofs nay she was not far off a rushing muddy current that must be the strangely altered ripple  great god there were floating masses in it that might dash against her boat as she passed and cause her to perish too soon what were those masses  for the first time maggies heart began to beat in an agony of dread she sat helpless dimly conscious that she was being floated along more intensely conscious of the anticipated clash but the horror was transient it passed away before the oncoming warehouses of st oggs she had passed the mouth of the ripple then now she must use all her skill and power to manage the boat and get it if possible out of the current she could see now that the bridge was broken down she could see the masts of a stranded vessel far out over the watery field but no boats were to be seen moving on the riversuch as had been laid hands on were employed in the flooded streets  with new resolution maggie seized her oar and stood up again to paddle but the now ebbing tide added to the swiftness of the river and she was carried along beyond the bridge she could hear shouts from the windows overlooking the river as if the people there were calling to her it was not till she had passed on nearly to tofton that she could get the boat clear of the current then with one yearning look toward her uncle deanes house that lay farther down the river she took to both her oars and rowed with all her might across the watery fields back toward the mill color was beginning to awake now and as she approached the dorlcote fields she could discern the tints of the trees could see the old scotch firs far to the right and the home chestnutsoh how deep they lay in the waterdeeper than the trees on this side the hill and the roof of the millwhere was it those heavy fragments hurrying down the ripplewhat had they meant but it was not the housethe house stood firm drowned up to the first story but still firmor was it broken in at the end toward the mill  with panting joy that she was there at lastjoy that overcame all distressmaggie neared the front of the house at first she heard no sound she saw no object moving her boat was on a level with the upstairs window she called out in a loud piercing voice  tom where are you mother where are you here is maggie  soon from the window of the attic in the central gable she heard toms voice  who is it have you brought a boat  it is i tommaggie where is mother  she is not here she went to garum the day before yesterday ill come down to the lower window  alone maggie said tom in a voice of deep astonishment as he opened the middle window on a level with the boat  yes tom god has taken care of me to bring me to you get in quickly is there no one else  no said tom stepping into the boat i fear the man is drowned he was carried down the ripple i think when part of the mill fell with the crash of trees and stones against it ive shouted again and again and there has been no answer give me the oars maggie  it was not till tom had pushed off and they were on the wide waterhe face to face with maggiethat the full meaning of what had happened rushed upon his mind it came with so overpowering a forceit was such a new revelation to his spirit of the depths in life that had lain beyond his vision which he had fancied so keen and clearthat he was unable to ask a question they sat mutely gazing at each othermaggie with eyes of intense life looking out from a weary beaten face tom pale with a certain awe and humiliation thought was busy though the lips were silent and though he could ask no question he guessed a story of almost miraculous divinely protected effort but at last a mist gathered over the bluegray eyes and the lips found a word they could utterthe old childish magsie  maggie could make no answer but a long deep sob of that mysterious wondrous happiness that is one with pain  as soon as she could speak she said we will go to lucy tom well go and see if she is safe and then we can help the rest  tom rowed with untired vigor and with a different speed from poor maggies the boat was soon in the current of the river again and soon they would be at tofton  park house stands high up out of the flood said maggie perhaps they have got lucy there  nothing else was said a new danger was being carried toward them by the river some wooden machinery had just given way on one of the wharves and huge fragments were being floated along the sun was rising now and the wide area of watery desolation was spread out in dreadful clearness around them in dreadful clearness floated onward the hurrying threatening masses a large company in a boat that was working its way along under the tofton houses observed their danger and shouted get out of the current  but that could not be done at once and tom looking before him saw death rushing on them huge fragments clinging together in fatal fellowship made one wide mass across the stream  it is coming maggie tom said in a deep hoarse voice loosing the oars and clasping her  the next instant the boat was no longer seen upon the water and the huge mass was hurrying on in hideous triumph  but soon the keel of the boat reappeared a black speck on the golden water  the boat reappeared but brother and sister had gone down in an embrace never to be parted living through again in one supreme moment the days when they had clasped their little hands in love and roamed the daisied fields together  conclusion  nature repairs her ravagesrepairs them with her sunshine and with human labor the desolation wrought by that flood had left little visible trace on the face of the earth five years after the fifth autumn was rich in golden cornstacks rising in thick clusters among the distant hedgerows the wharves and warehouses on the floss were busy again with echoes of eager voices with hopeful lading and unlading  and every man and woman mentioned in this history was still living except those whose end we know  nature repairs her ravages but not all the uptorn trees are not rooted again the parted hills are left scarred if there is a new growth the trees are not the same as the old and the hills underneath their green vesture bear the marks of the past rending to the eyes that have dwelt on the past there is no thorough repair  dorlcote mill was rebuilt and dorlcote churchyardwhere the brick grave that held a father whom we know was found with the stone laid prostrate upon it after the floodhad recovered all its grassy order and decent quiet  near that brick grave there was a tomb erected very soon after the flood for two bodies that were found in close embrace and it was visited at different moments by two men who both felt that their keenest joy and keenest sorrow were forever buried there  one of them visited the tomb again with a sweet face beside him but that was years after  the other was always solitary his great companionship was among the trees of the red deeps where the buried joy seemed still to hover like a revisiting spirit  the tomb bore the names of tom and maggie tulliver and below the names it was written                 in their death they were not divided
