temptation   chapter i  thrown on the world   miss winnifred said the old lawyer looking keenly over and through his shaggy eyebrows at the fair young creature seated before him you are this morning twentyone  winnifred clair raised her deep mourning veil lowered her eyes and folded her hands  this morning continued mr bonehead my guardianship is at an end  there was a tone of something like emotion in the voice of the stern old lawyer while for a moment his eye glistened with something like a tear which he hastened to remove with something like a handkerchief i have therefore sent for you he went on to render you an account of my trust  he heaved a sigh at her and then reaching out his hand he pulled the woollen bellrope up and down several times  an aged clerk appeared  did the bell ring he asked  i think it did said the lawyer be good enough atkinson to fetch me the papers of the estate of the late major clair defunct  i have them here said the clerk and he laid upon the table a bundle of faded blue papers and withdrew  miss winnifred resumed the old lawyer i will now proceed to give you an account of the disposition that has been made of your property this first document refers to the sum of two thousand pounds left to you by your great uncle it is lost  winnifred bowed  pray give me your best attention and i will endeavour to explain to you how i lost it  oh sir cried winnifred i am only a poor girl unskilled in the ways of the world and knowing nothing but music and french i fear that the details of business are beyond my grasp but if it is lost i gather that it is gone  it is said mr bonehead i lost it in a marginal option in an undeveloped oil company i suppose that means nothing to you  alas sighed winnifred nothing  very good resumed the lawyer here next we have a statement in regard to the thousand pounds left you under the will of your maternal grandmother i lost it at monte carlo but i need not fatigue you with the details  pray spare them cried the girl  this final item relates to the sum of fifteen hundred pounds placed in trust for you by your uncle i lost it on a horse race that horse added the old lawyer with rising excitement ought to have won he was coming down the stretch like bluebut there there my dear you must forgive me if the recollection of it still stirs me to anger suffice it to say the horse fell i have kept for your inspection the score card of the race and the betting tickets you will find everything in order  sir said winnifred as mr bonehead proceeded to fold up his papers i am but a poor inadequate girl a mere child in business but tell me i pray what is left to me of the money that you have managed  nothing said the lawyer everything is gone and i regret to say miss clair that it is my painful duty to convey to you a further disclosure of a distressing nature it concerns your birth  just heaven cried winnifred with a womans quick intuition does it concern my father  it does miss clair your father was not your father  oh sir exclaimed winnifred my poor mother how she must have suffered  your mother was not your mother said the old lawyer gravely nay nay do not question me there is a dark secret about your birth  alas said winnifred wringing her hands i am then alone in the world and penniless  you are said mr bonehead deeply moved you are unfortunately thrown upon the world but if you ever find yourself in a position where you need help and advice do not scruple to come to me especially he added for advice and meantime let me ask you in what way do you propose to earn your livelihood  i have my needle said winnifred  let me see it said the lawyer  winnifred showed it to him  i fear said mr bonehead shaking his head you will not do much with that  then he rang the bell again  atkinson he said take miss clair out and throw her on the world     chapter ii  a rencounter   as winnifred clair passed down the stairway leading from the lawyers office a figure appeared before her in the corridor blocking the way it was that of a tall aristocraticlooking man whose features wore that peculiarly saturnine appearance seen only in the english nobility the face while entirely gentlemanly in its general aspect was stamped with all the worst passions of mankind  had the innocent girl but known it the face was that of lord wynchgate one of the most contemptible of the greater nobility of britain and the figure was his too  ha exclaimed the dissolute aristocrat whom have we here stay pretty one and let me see the fair countenance that i divine behind your veil  sir said winnifred drawing herself up proudly let me pass i pray  not so cried wynchgate reaching out and seizing his intended victim by the wrist not till i have at least seen the colour of those eyes and imprinted a kiss upon those fair lips  with a brutal laugh he drew the struggling girl towards him  in another moment the aristocratic villain would have succeeded in lifting the veil of the unhappy girl when suddenly a ringing voice cried hold stop desist begone lay to cut it out  with these words a tall athletic young man attracted doubtless by the girls cries leapt into the corridor from the street without his figure was that more or less of a greek god while his face although at the moment inflamed with anger was of an entirely moral and permissible configuration  save me save me cried winnifred  i will cried the stranger rushing towards lord wynchgate with uplifted cane  but the cowardly aristocrat did not await the onslaught of the unknown  you shall yet be mine he hissed in winnifreds ear and releasing his grasp he rushed with a bound past the rescuer into the street  oh sir said winnifred clasping her hands and falling on her knees in gratitude i am only a poor inadequate girl but if the prayers of one who can offer naught but her prayers to her benefactor can avail to the advantage of one who appears to have every conceivable advantage already let him know that they are his  nay said the stranger as he aided the blushing girl to rise kneel not to me i beseech if i have done aught to deserve the gratitude of one who whoever she is will remain for ever present as a bright memory in the breast of one in whose breast such memories are all too few he is all too richly repaid if she does that he is blessed indeed  she does he is cried winnifred deeply moved here on her knees she blesses him and now she added we must part seek not to follow me one who has aided a poor girl in the hour of need will respect her wish when she tells him that alone and buffeted by the world her one prayer is that he will leave her  he will cried the unknown he will he does  leave me yes leave me exclaimed winnifred  i will said the unknown  do do sobbed the distraught girl yet stay one moment more let she who has received so much from her benefactor at least know his name  he cannot he must not exclaimed the indistinguishable his birth is suchbut enough  he tore his hand from the girls detaining clasp and rushed forth from the place  winnifred clair was alone     chapter iii  friends in distress   winnifred was now in the humblest lodgings in the humblest part of london a simple bedroom and sittingroom sufficed for her wants here she sat on her trunk bravely planning for the future  miss clair said the landlady knocking at the door do try to eat something you must keep up your health see ive brought you a kippered herring  winnifred ate the herring her heart filled with gratitude with renewed strength she sallied forth on the street to resume her vain search for employment for two weeks now winnifred clair had sought employment even of the humblest character at various dressmaking establishments she had offered to no purpose the services of her needle they had looked at it and refused it  in vain she had offered to various editors and publishers the use of her pen they had examined it coldly and refused it  she had tried fruitlessly to obtain a position of trust the various banks and trust companies to which she had applied declined her services in vain she had advertised in the newspapers offering to take sole charge of a little girl no one would give her one  her slender stock of money which she had in her purse on leaving mr boneheads office was almost consumed  each night the unhappy girl returned to her lodging exhausted with disappointment and fatigue  yet even in her adversity she was not altogether friendless  each evening on her return home a soft tap was heard at the door  miss clair said the voice of the landlady i have brought you a fried egg eat it you must keep up your strength  then one morning a terrible temptation had risen before her  miss clair said the manager of an agency to which she had applied i am glad to be able at last to make you a definite offer of employment are you prepared to go upon the stage  the stage  a flush of shame and indignation swept over the girl had it come to this little versed in the world as winnifred was she knew but too well the horror the iniquity the depth of degradation implied in the word  yes continued the agent i have a letter here asking me to recommend a young lady of suitable refinement to play the part of eliza in uncle toms cabin will you accept  sir said winnifred proudly answer me first this question fairly if i go upon the stage can i as eliza remain as innocent as simple as i am now  you can not said the manager  then sir said winnifred rising from her chair let me say this your offer is doubtless intended to be kind coming from the class you do and inspired by the ideas you are you no doubt mean well but let a poor girl friendless and alone tell you that rather than accept such a degradation she will die  very good said the manager  i go forth cried winnifred to perish  all right said the manager  the door closed behind her winnifred clair once more upon the street sank down upon the steps of the building in a swoon  but at this very juncture providence which always watches over the innocent and defenceless was keeping its eye direct upon winnifred  at that very moment when our heroine sank fainting upon the doorstep a handsome equipage drawn by two superb black steeds happened to pass along the street  its appearance and character proclaimed it at once to be one of those vehicles in which only the superior classes of the exclusive aristocracy are privileged to ride its sides were emblazoned with escutcheons insignia and other paraphernalia the large gilt coronet that appeared up its panelling surmounted by a bunch of huckleberries quartered in a field of potatoes indicated that its possessor was at least of the rank of marquis a coachman and two grooms rode in front while two footmen seated in the boot or box at the rear contrived by the immobility of their attitude and the melancholy of their faces to inspire the scene with an exclusive and aristocratic grandeur  the occupants of the equipagefor we refuse to count the menials as being suchwere two in number a lady and gentleman both of advanced years their snowwhite hair and benign countenances indicated that they belonged to that rare class of beings to whom rank and wealth are but an incentive to nobler things a gentle philanthropy played all over their faces and their eyes sought eagerly in the passing scene of the humble street for new objects of benefaction  those acquainted with the countenances of the aristocracy would have recognized at once in the occupants of the equipage the marquis of muddlenut and his spouse the marchioness  it was the eye of the marchioness which first detected the form of winnifred clair upon the doorstep  hold pause stop she cried in lively agitation  the horses were at once pulled in the brakes applied to the wheels and with the aid of a powerful lever operated by three of the menials the carriage was brought to a standstill  see look cried the marchioness she has fainted quick william your flask let us hasten to her aid  in another moment the noble lady was bending over the prostrate form of winnifred clair and pouring brandy between her lips  winnifred opened her eyes where am i she asked feebly  she speaks cried the marchioness give her another flaskful  after the second flask the girl sat up  tell me she cried clasping her hands what has happened where am i  with friends answered the marchioness but do not essay to speak drink this you must husband your strength meantime let us drive you to your home  winnifred was lifted tenderly by the menservants into the aristocratic equipage the brake was unset the lever reversed and the carriage thrown again into motion  on the way winnifred at the solicitation of the marchioness related her story  my poor child exclaimed the lady how you must have suffered thank heaven it is over now tomorrow we shall call for you and bring you away with us to muddlenut chase  alas could she but have known it before the morrow should dawn worse dangers still were in store for our heroine but what these dangers were we must reserve for another chapter     chapter iv  a gambling party in st jamess close   we must now ask our readers to shift the sceneif they dont mind doing this for usto the apartments of the earl of wynchgate in st jamess close the hour is nine oclock in the evening and the picture before us is one of revelry and dissipation so characteristic of the nobility of england the atmosphere of the room is thick with blue havana smoke such as is used by the nobility while on the green baize table a litter of counters and cards in which aces kings and even two spots are heaped in confusion proclaim the reckless nature of the play  seated about the table are six men dressed in the height of fashion each with collar and white necktie and broad white shirt their faces stamped with all or nearly all of the baser passions of mankind  lord wynchgatefor he it was who sat at the head of the tablerose with an oath and flung his cards upon the table  all turned and looked at him with an oath curse it dogwood he exclaimed with another oath to the man who sat beside him take the money i play no more tonight my luck is out  ha ha laughed lord dogwood with a third oath your mind is not on the cards who is the latest young beauty pray who so absorbs you i hear a whisper in town of a certain misadventure of yours  dogwood said wynchgate clenching his fist have a care man or you shall measure the length of my sword  both noblemen faced each other their hands upon their swords  my lords my lords pleaded a distinguishedlooking man of more advanced years who sat at one side of the table and in whose features the habitués of diplomatic circles would have recognized the handsome lineaments of the marquis of frogwater british ambassador to siam let us have no quarrelling come wynchgate come dogwood he continued with a mild oath put up your swords it were a shame to waste time in private quarrelling they may be needed all too soon in cochin china or for the matter of that he added sadly in cambodia or in dutch guinea  frogwater said young lord dogwood with a generous flush i was wrong wynchgate your hand  the two noblemen shook hands  my friends said lord wynchgate in asking you to abandon our game i had an end in view i ask your help in an affair of the heart  ha excellent exclaimed the five noblemen we are with you heart and soul  i propose this night continued wynchgate with your help to carry off a young girl a female  an abduction exclaimed the ambassador somewhat sternly wynchgate i cannot countenance this  mistake me not said the earl i intend to abduct her but i propose nothing dishonourable it is my firm resolve to offer her marriage  then said lord frogwater i am with you  gentlemen concluded wynchgate all is ready the coach is below i have provided masks pistols and black cloaks follow me  a few moments later a coach with the blinds drawn in which were six noblemen armed to the teeth might have been seen were it not for the darkness approaching the humble lodging in which winnifred clair was sheltered  but what it did when it got there we must leave to another chapter     chapter v  the abduction   the hour was twenty minutes to ten on the evening described in our last chapter  winnifred clair was seated still fully dressed at the window of the bedroom looking out over the great city  a light tap came at the door  if its a fried egg called winnifred softly i do not need it i ate yesterday  no said the voice of the landlady you are wanted below  i exclaimed winnifred below  you said the landlady below a party of gentlemen have called for you  gentlemen exclaimed winnifred putting her hand to her brow in perplexity for me at this late hour here this evening in this house  yes repeated the landlady six gentlemen they arrived in a closed coach they are all closely masked and heavily armed they beg you will descend at once  just heaven cried the unhappy girl is it possible that they mean to abduct me  they do said the landlady they said so  alas cried winnifred i am powerless tell themshe hesitatedtell them i will be down immediately let them not come up keep them below on any pretext show them an album let them look at the goldfish anything but not here i shall be ready in a moment  feverishly she made herself ready as hastily as possible she removed all traces of tears from her face she threw about her shoulders an opera cloak and with a light venetian scarf half concealed the beauty of her hair and features abducted she murmured and by six of them i think she said six oh the horror of it a touch of powder to her cheeks and a slight blackening of her eyebrows and the courageous girl was ready  lord wynchgate and his companionsfor they it was that is to say they were itsat below in the sittingroom looking at the albums woman said lord wynchgate to the landlady with an oath let her hurry up we have seen enough of these we can wait no longer  i am here cried a clear voice upon the threshold and winnifred stood before them my lords for i divine who you are and wherefore you have come take me do your worst with me but spare oh spare this humble companion of my sorrow  rightoh said lord dogwood with a brutal laugh  enough exclaimed wynchgate and seizing winnifred by the waist he dragged her forth out of the house and out upon the street  but something in the brutal violence of his behaviour seemed to kindle for the moment a spark of manly feeling if such there were in the breasts of his companions  wynchgate cried young lord dogwood my mind misgives me i doubt if this is a gentlemanly thing to do ill have no further hand in it  a chorus of approval from his companions endorsed his utterance for a moment they hesitated  nay cried winnifred turning to confront the masked faces that stood about her go forward with your fell design i am here i am helpless let no prayers stay your hand go to it  have done with this cried wynchgate with a brutal oath shove her in the coach  but at the very moment the sound of hurrying footsteps was heard and a clear ringing manly welltoned vibrating voice cried hold stop desist have a care titled villain or i will strike you to the earth  a tall aristocratic form bounded out of the darkness  gentlemen cried wynchgate releasing his hold upon the frightened girl we are betrayed save yourselves to the coach  in another instant the six noblemen had leaped into the coach and disappeared down the street  winnifred still half inanimate with fright turned to her rescuer and saw before her the form and lineaments of the unknown stranger who had thus twice stood between her and disaster half fainting she fell swooning into his arms  dear lady he exclaimed rouse yourself you are safe let me restore you to your home  that voice cried winnifred resuming consciousness it is my benefactor  she would have swooned again but the unknown lifted her bodily up the steps of her home and leant her against the door  farewell he said in a voice resonant with gloom  oh sir cried the unhappy girl let one who owes so much to one who has saved her in her hour of need at least know his name  but the stranger with a mournful gesture of farewell had disappeared as rapidly as he had come  but as to why he had disappeared we must ask our readers patience for another chapter     chapter vi  the unknown   the scene is now shifted sideways and forwards so as to put it at muddlenut chase and to make it a fortnight later than the events related in the last chapter  winnifred is now at the chase as the guest of the marquis and marchioness there her bruised soul finds peace  the chase itself was one of those typical country homes which are or were till yesterday the glory of england the approach to the chase lay through twenty miles of glorious forest filled with fallow deer and wild bulls the house itself dating from the time of the plantagenets was surrounded by a moat covered with broad lilies and floating green scum magnificent peacocks sunned themselves on the terraces while from the surrounding shrubberies there rose the soft murmur of doves pigeons bats owls and partridges  here sat winnifred clair day after day upon the terrace recovering her strength under the tender solicitude of the marchioness  each day the girl urged upon her noble hostess the necessity of her departure nay said the marchioness with gentle insistence stay where you are your soul is bruised you must rest  alas cried winnifred who am i that i should rest alone despised buffeted by fate what right have i to your kindness  miss clair replied the noble lady wait till you are stronger there is something that i wish to say to you  then at last one morning when winnifreds temperature had fallen to ninetyeight point three the marchioness spoke  miss clair she said in a voice which throbbed with emotion winnifred if i may so call you lord muddlenut and i have formed a plan for your future it is our dearest wish that you should marry our son  alas cried winnifred while tears rose in her eyes it cannot be  say not so cried the marchioness our son lord mordaunt muddlenut is young handsome all that a girl could desire after months of wandering he returns to us this morning it is our dearest wish to see him married and established we offer you his hand  indeed replied winnifred while her tears fell even more freely i seem to requite but ill the kindness that you show alas my heart is no longer in my keeping  where is it cried the marchioness  it is anothers one whose very name i do not know holds it in his keeping  but at this moment a blithe gladsome step was heard upon the flagstones of the terrace a manly ringing voice which sent a thrill to winnifreds heart cried mother and in another instant lord mordaunt muddlenut for he it was had folded the marchioness to his heart  winnifred rose her heart beating wildly one glance was enough the newcomer lord mordaunt was none other than the unknown the unaccountable to whose protection she had twice owed her life  with a wild cry winnifred clair leaped across the flagstones of the terrace and fled into the park     chapter vii  the proposal   they stood beneath the great trees of the ancestral park into which lord mordaunt had followed winnifred at a single bound all about them was the radiance of early june  lord mordaunt knelt on one knee on the greensward and with a touch in which respect and reverence were mingled with the deepest and manliest emotion he took between his finger and thumb the tip of the girls gloved hand  miss clair he uttered in a voice suffused with the deepest yearning yet vibrating with the most profound respect miss clairwinnifredhear me i implore  alas cried winnifred struggling in vain to disengage the tip of her glove from the impetuous clasp of the young nobleman alas whither can i fly i do not know my way through the wood and there are bulls in all directions i am not used to them lord mordaunt i implore you let the tears of one but little skilled in the art of dissimulation  nay winnifred said the young earl fly not hear me out  let me fly begged the unhappy girl  you must not fly pleaded mordaunt let me first here upon bended knee convey to you the expression of a devotion a love as ardent and as deep as ever burned in a human heart winnifred be my bride  oh sir sobbed winnifred if the knowledge of a gratitude a thankfulness from one whose heart will ever treasure as its proudest memory the recollection of one who did for one all that one could have wanted done for oneif this be some poor guerdon let it suffice but alas my birth the dark secret of my birth forbids  nay cried mordaunt leaping now to his feet your birth is all right i have looked into it myself it is as goodor nearly as goodas my own till i knew this my lips were sealed by duty while i supposed that you had a lower birth and i an upper i was bound to silence but come with me to the house there is one arrived with me who will explain all  hand in hand the lovers for such they now were returned to the chase there in the great hall the marquis and the marchioness were standing ready to greet them  my child exclaimed the noble lady as she folded winnifred to her heart then she turned to her son let her know all she cried  lord mordaunt stepped across the room to a curtain he drew it aside and there stepped forth mr bonehead the old lawyer who had cast winnifred upon the world  miss clair said the lawyer advancing and taking the girls hand for a moment in a kindly clasp the time has come for me to explain all you are not you never were the penniless girl that you suppose under the terms of your fathers will i was called upon to act a part and to throw you upon the world it was my clients wish and i followed it i told you quite truthfully that i had put part of your money into options in an oilwell miss clair that well is now producing a million gallons of gasolene a month  a million gallons cried winnifred i can never use it  wait till you own a motorcar miss winnifred said the lawyer  then i am rich exclaimed the bewildered girl  rich beyond your dreams answered the lawyer miss clair you own in your own right about half of the state of texasi think it is in texas at any rate either texas or rhode island or one of those big states in america more than this i have invested your property since your fathers death so wisely that even after paying the income tax and the property tax the inheritance tax the dog tax and the tax on amusements you will still have one half of one per cent to spend  winnifred clasped her hands  i knew it all the time said lord mordaunt drawing the girl to his embrace i found it out through this good man  we knew it too said the marchioness can you forgive us darling our little plot for your welfare had we not done this mordaunt might have had to follow you over to america and chase you all around newport and narragansett at a fearful expense  how can i thank you enough cried winnifred then she added eagerly and my birth my descent  it is all right interjected the old lawyer it is a 1 your father who died before you were born quite a little time before belonged to the very highest peerage of wales you are descended directly from claerapclaer who murdered owen glendower your mother we are still tracing up but we have already connected her with floydapfloyd who murdered prince llewellyn  oh sir cried the grateful girl i only hope i may prove worthy of them  one thing more said lord mordaunt and stepping over to another curtain he drew it aside and there emerged lord wynchgate  he stood before winnifred a manly contrition struggling upon features which but for the evil courses of he who wore them might have been almost presentable  miss clair he said i ask your pardon i tried to carry you off i never will again but before we part let me say that my acquaintance with you has made me a better man broader bigger and i hope deeper  with a profound bow lord wynchgate took his leave     chapter viii  wedded at last   lord mordaunt and his bride were married forthwith in the parish church of muddlenut chase with winnifreds money they have drained the moat rebuilt the chase and chased the bulls out of the park they have six children so far and are respected honoured and revered in the countryside far and wide over a radius of twenty miles in circumference     ii  john and i  or how i nearly lost my husband  narrated after the approved fashion of the best heart and home magazines     iijohn and i or how i nearly lost my husband   it was after we had been married about two years that i began to feel that i needed more air every time i looked at john across the breakfasttable i felt as if i must have more air more space  i seemed to feel as if i had no room to expand i had begun to ask myself whether i had been wise in marrying john whether john was really sufficient for my development i felt cramped and shut in in spite of myself the question would arise in my mind whether john really understood my nature he had a way of reading the newspaper propped up against the sugarbowl at breakfast that somehow made me feel as if things had gone all wrong it was bitter to realize that the time had come when john could prefer the newspaper to his wifes society  but perhaps i had better go back and tell the whole miserable story from the beginning  i shall never forgeti suppose no woman ever doesthe evening when john first spoke out his love for me i had felt for some time past that it was there again and again he seemed about to speak but somehow his words seemed to fail him twice i took him into the very heart of the little wood beside mothers house but it was only a small wood and somehow he slipped out on the other side oh john i had said how lonely and still it seems in the wood with no one here but ourselves do you think i said that the birds have souls i dont know john answered lets get out of this i was sure that his emotion was too strong for him i never feel a bit lonesome where you are john i said as we made our way among the underbrush i think we can get out down that little gully he answered then one evening in june after tea i led john down a path beside the house to a little corner behind the garden where there was a stone wall on one side and a high fence right in front of us and thorn bushes on the other side there was a little bench in the angle of the wall and the fence and we sat down on it  minnie john said theres something i meant to say  oh john i cried and i flung my arms round his neck it all came with such a flood of surprise  all i meant minn john went on but i checked him  oh dont john dont say anything more i said its just too perfect then i rose and seized him by the wrist come i said come to mother and i rushed him along the path  as soon as mother saw us come in hand in hand in this way she guessed everything she threw both her arms round johns neck and fairly pinned him against the wall john tried to speak but mother wouldnt let him i saw it all along john she said dont speak dont say a word i guessed your love for minn from the very start i dont know what i shall do without her john but shes yours now take her then mother began to cry and i couldnt help crying too take him to father mother said and we each took one of johns wrists and took him to father on the back verandah as soon as john saw father he tried to speak againi think i ought to say he began but mother stopped him father she said he wants to take our little girl away he loves her very dearly alfred she said and i think it our duty to let her go no matter how hard it is and oh please heaven alfred hell treat her well and not misuse her or beat her and she began to sob again  father got up and took john by the hand and shook it warmly  take her boy he said shes all yours now take her  so john and i were engaged and in due time our wedding day came and we were married i remember that for days and days before the wedding day john seemed very nervous and depressed i think he was worrying poor boy as to whether he could really make me happy and whether he could fill my life as it should be filled but i told him that he was not to worry because i meant to be happy and was determined just to make the best of everything  father stayed with john a good deal before the wedding day and on the wedding morning he went and fetched him to the church in a closed carriage and had him there all ready when we came it was a beautiful day in september and the church looked just lovely i had a beautiful gown of white organdie with tulle at the throat and i carried a great bunch of white roses and father led john up the aisle after me  i remember that mother cried a good deal at the wedding and told john that he had stolen her darling and that he must never misuse me or beat me and i remember that the clergyman spoke very severely to john and told him he hoped he realized the responsibility he was taking and that it was his duty to make me happy a lot of our old friends were there and they all spoke quite sharply to john and all the women kissed me and said they hoped i would never regret what i had done and i just kept up my spirits by sheer determination and told them that i had made up my mind to be happy and that i was going to be so  so presently it was all over and we were driven to the station and got the afternoon train for new york and when we sat down in the compartment among all our bandboxes and flowers john said well thank god thats over and i said oh john an oath on our wedding day an oath john said im sorry minn i didnt mean but i said dont john dont make it worse swear at me if you must but dont make it harder to bear                                       we spent our honeymoon in new york at first i had thought of going somewhere to the great lonely woods where i could have walked under the great trees and felt the silence of nature and where john should have been my viking and captured me with his spear and where i should be his and his alone and no other man should share me and john had said all right or else i had planned to go away somewhere to the seashore where i could have watched the great waves dashing themselves against the rocks i had told john that he should be my cave man and should seize me in his arms and carry me whither he would i felt somehow that for my development i wanted to get as close to nature as ever i couldthat my mind seemed to be reaching out for a great emptiness but i looked over all the hotel and steamship folders i could find and it seemed impossible to get good accommodation so we came to new york i had a great deal of shopping to do for our new house so i could not be much with john but i felt it was not right to neglect him so i drove him somewhere in a taxi each morning and called for him again in the evening one day i took him to the metropolitan museum and another day i left him at the zoo and another day at the aquarium john seemed very happy and quiet among the fishes  so presently we came back home and i spent many busy days in fixing and arranging our new house i had the drawingroom done in blue and the diningroom all in dark panelled wood and a boudoir upstairs done in pink and white enamel to match my bedroom and dressingroom there was a very nice little room in the basement next to the coal cellar that i turned into a den for john so that when he wanted to smoke he could go down there and do it john seemed to appreciate his den at once and often would stay down there so long that i had to call to him to come up  when i look back on those days they seem very bright and happy but it was not very long before a change came i began to realize that john was neglecting me i noticed it at first in small things i dont know just how long it was after our marriage that john began to read the newspaper at breakfast at first he would only pick it up and read it in little bits and only on the front page i tried not to be hurt at it and would go on talking just as brightly as i could without seeming to notice anything but presently he went on to reading the inside part of the paper and then one day he opened up the financial page and folded the paper right back and leant it against the sugarbowl  i could not but wonder whether johns love for me was what it had been was it cooling i asked myself and what was cooling it it hardly seemed possible when i looked back to the wild passion with which he had proposed to me on the garden bench that johns love was waning but i kept noticing different little things one day in the springtime i saw john getting out a lot of fishing tackle from a box and fitting it together i asked him what he was going to do and he said that he was going to fish i went to my room and had a good cry it seemed dreadful that he could neglect his wife for a few worthless fish  so i decided to put john to the test it had been my habit every morning after he put his coat on to go to the office to let john have one kiss just one weeny kiss to keep him happy all day so this day when he was getting ready i bent my head over a big bowl of flowers and pretended not to notice i think john must have been hurt as i heard him steal out on tiptoe  well i realized that things had come to a dreadful state and so i sent over to mother and mother came and we had a good cry together i made up my mind to force myself to face things and just to be as bright as ever i could mother and i both thought that things would be better if i tried all i could to make something out of john i have always felt that every woman should make all that she can out of her husband so i did my best first of all to straighten up johns appearance i shifted the style of collar he was wearing to a tighter kind that i liked better and i brushed his hair straight backward instead of forward which gave him a much more alert look mother said that john needed waking up and so we did all we could to wake him up mother came over to stay with me a good deal and in the evenings we generally had a little music or a game of cards  about this time another difficulty began to come into my married life which i suppose i ought to have foreseeni mean the attentions of other gentlemen i have always called forth a great deal of admiration in gentlemen but i have always done my best to act like a lady and to discourage it in every possible way i had been innocent enough to suppose that this would end with married life and it gave me a dreadful shock to realize that such was not the case the first one i noticed was a young man who came to the house at an hour when john was out for the purpose so he said at least of reading the gas meter he looked at me in just the boldest way and asked me to show him the way to the cellar i dont know whether it was a pretext or not but i just summoned all the courage i had and showed him to the head of the cellar stairs i had determined that if he tried to carry me down with him i would scream for the servants but i suppose something in my manner made him desist and he went alone when he came up he professed to have read the meter and he left the house quite quietly but i thought it wiser to say nothing to john of what had happened  there were others too there was a young man with large brown eyes who came and said he had been sent to tune the piano he came on three separate days and he bent his ear over the keys in such a mournful way that i knew he must have fallen in love with me on the last day he offered to tune my harp for a dollar extra but i refused and when i asked him instead to tune mothers mandoline he said he didnt know how of course i told john nothing of all this  then there was mr mcqueen who came to the house several times to play cribbage with john he had been desperately in love with me years beforeat least i remember his taking me home from a hockey match once and what a struggle it was for him not to come into the parlour and see mother for a few minutes when i asked him and though he was married now and with three children i felt sure when he came to play cribbage with john that it meant something he was very discreet and honourable and never betrayed himself for a moment and i acted my part as if there was nothing at all behind but one night when he came over to play and john had had to go out he refused to stay even for an instant he had got his overshoes off before i told him that john was out and asked him if he wouldnt come into the parlour and hear mother play the mandoline but he just made one dive for his overshoes and was gone i knew that he didnt dare to trust himself  then presently a new trouble came i began to suspect that john was drinking i dont mean for a moment that he was drunk or that he was openly cruel to me but at times he seemed to act so queerly and i noticed that one night when by accident i left a bottle of raspberry vinegar on the sideboard overnight it was all gone in the morning two or three times when mcqueen and john were to play cribbage john would fetch home two or three bottles of bevo with him and they would sit sipping all evening  i think he was drinking bevo by himself too though i could never be sure of it at any rate he often seemed queer and restless in the evenings and instead of staying in his den he would wander all over the house once we heard himi mean mother and i and two lady friends who were with us that eveningquite late after ten oclock apparently moving about in the pantry john i called is that you yes minn he answered quietly enough i admit what are you doing there i asked looking for something to eat he said john i said you are forgetting what is due to me as your wife you were fed at six go back  he went but yet i felt more and more that his love must be dwindling to make him act as he did i thought it all over wearily enough and asked myself whether i had done everything i should to hold my husbands love i had kept him in at nights i had cut down his smoking i had stopped his playing cards what more was there that i could do                                       so at last the conviction came to me that i must go away i felt that i must get away somewhere and think things out at first i thought of palm beach but the season had not opened and i felt somehow that i couldnt wait i wanted to get away somewhere by myself and just face things as they were so one morning i said to john john i think id like to go off somewhere for a little time just to be by myself dear and i dont want you to ask to come with me or to follow me but just let me go john said all right minn when are you going to start the cold brutality of it cut me to the heart and i went upstairs and had a good cry and looked over steamship and railroad folders i thought of havana for a while because the pictures of the harbour and the castle and the queer spanish streets looked so attractive but then i was afraid that at havana a woman alone by herself might be simply persecuted by attentions from gentlemen they say the spanish temperament is something fearful so i decided on bermuda instead i felt that in a beautiful quiet place like bermuda i could think everything all over and face things and it said on the folder that there were always at least two english regiments in garrison there and the english officers whatever their faults always treat a woman with the deepest respect  so i said nothing more to john but in the next few days i got all my arrangements made and my things packed and when the last afternoon came i sat down and wrote john a long letter to leave on my boudoir table telling him that i had gone to bermuda i told him that i wanted to be alone i said that i couldnt tell when i would be backthat it might be months or it might be years and i hoped that he would try to be as happy as he could and forget me entirely and to send me money on the first of every month                                       well it was just at that moment that one of those strange coincidences happen little things in themselves but which seem to alter the whole course of a persons life i had nearly finished the letter to john that i was to leave on the writingdesk when just then the maid came up to my room with a telegram it was for john but i thought it my duty to open it and read it for him before i left and i nearly fainted when i saw that it was from a lawyer in bermudaof all placesand it said that a legacy of two hundred thousand dollars had been left to john by an uncle of his who had died there and asking for instructions about the disposition of it  a great wave seemed to sweep over me and all the wicked thoughts that had been in my mindfor i saw now that they were wickedwere driven clean away i thought how completely lost poor old john would feel if all this money came to him and he didnt have to work any more and had no one at his side to help and guide him in using it  i tore up the wicked letter i had written and i hurried as fast as i could to pack up a valise with johns things my own were packed already as i said then presently john came in and i broke the news to him as gently and as tenderly as i could about his uncle having left him the money and having died i told him that i had found out all about the trains and the bermuda steamer and had everything all packed and ready for us to leave at once john seemed a little dazed about it all and kept saying that his uncle had taught him to play tennis when he was a little boy and he was very grateful and thankful to me for having everything arranged and thought it wonderful  i had time to telephone to a few of my women friends and they just managed to rush round for a few minutes to say goodbye i couldnt help crying a little when i told them about johns uncle dying so far away with none of us near him and i told them about the legacy and they cried a little to hear of it all and when i told them that john and i might not come back direct from bermuda but might take a run over to europe first they all cried some more  we left for new york that evening and after we had been to bermuda and arranged about a suitable monument for johns uncle and collected the money we sailed for europe  all through the happy time that has followed i like to think that through all our trials and difficulties affliction brought us safely together at last     iii  the split in the cabinet  or the fate of england  a political novel of the days that were     iiithe split in the cabinet or the fate of england     chapter i   the fate of england hangs upon it murmured sir john elphinspoon as he sank wearily into an armchair for a moment as he said england the baronets eye glistened and his ears lifted as if in defiance but as soon as he stopped saying it his eye lost its brilliance and his ears dropped wearily at the sides of his head  lady elphinspoon looked at her husband anxiously she could not conceal from herself that his face as he sank into his chair seemed somehow ten years older than it had been ten years ago  you are home early john she queried  the house rose early my dear said the baronet  for the all england pingpong match  no for the dog show the prime minister felt that the cabinet ought to attend he said that their presence there would help to bind the colonies to us i understand also that he has a pup in the show himself he took the cabinet with him  and why not you asked lady elphinspoon  you forget my dear said the baronet as foreign secretary my presence at a dog show might be offensive to the shah of persia had it been a cat show  the baronet paused and shook his head in deep gloom  john said his wife i feel that there is something more did anything happen at the house  sir john nodded  a bad business he said the wazuchistan boundary bill was read this afternoon for the third time  no woman in england so it was generally said had a keener political insight than lady elphinspoon  the third time she repeated thoughtfully and how many more will it have to go  sir john turned his head aside and groaned  you are faint exclaimed lady elphinspoon let me ring for tea  the baronet shook his head  an egg johnlet me beat you up an egg  yes yes murmured sir john still abstracted beat it yes do beat it  lady elphinspoon in spite of her elevated position as the wife of the foreign secretary of great britain held it not beneath her to perform for her husband the plainest household service she rang for an egg the butler broke it for her into a tall goblet filled with old sherry and the noble lady with her own hands beat the stuff out of it for the veteran politician whose official duties rarely allowed him to eat an egg was a sovereign remedy taken either in a goblet of sherry or in a mug of rum or in half a pint of whisky it never failed to revive his energies  the effect of the egg was at once visible in the brightening of his eye and the lengthening of his ears  and now explain to me said his wife what has happened what is this boundary bill  we never meant it to pass said sir john it was introduced only as a sop to public opinion it delimits our frontier in such a way as to extend our suzerainty over the entire desert of el skrub the wazoos have claimed that this is their desert the hill tribes are restless if we attempt to advance the wazoos will rise if we retire it deals a blow at our prestige  lady elphinspoon shuddered her long political training had taught her that nothing was so fatal to england as to be hit in the prestige  and on the other hand continued sir john if we move sideways the ohulîs the mortal enemies of the wazoos will strike us in our rear  in our rear exclaimed lady elphinspoon in a tone of pain oh john we must go forward take another egg  we cannot groaned the foreign secretary there are reasons which i cannot explain even to you caroline reasons of state which absolutely prevent us from advancing into wazuchistan our hands are tied meantime if the wazoos rise it is all over with us it will split the cabinet  split the cabinet repeated lady elphinspoon in alarm she well knew that next to a blow in the prestige the splitting of the cabinet was about the worst thing that could happen to great britain oh john they must be held together at all costs can nothing be done  everything is being done that can be the prime minister has them at the dog show at this moment tonight the chancellor is taking them to moving pictures and tomorrowit is a state secret my dear but it will be very generally known in the morningwe have seats for them all at the circus if we can hold them together all is well but if they split we are undone meantime our difficulties increase at the very passage of the bill itself a question was asked by one of the new labour members a miner my dear a quite uneducated man  yes queried lady elphinspoon  he asked the colonial secretarysir john shudderedto tell him where wazuchistan is worse than that my dear added sir john he defied him to tell him where it is  what did you do surely he has no right to information of that sort  it was a close shave luckily the whips saved us they got the secretary out of the house and rushed him to the british museum when he got back he said that he would answer the question a month from friday we got a great burst of cheers but it was a close thing but stop i must speak at once with powers my despatch box yes here it is now where is young powers there is work for him to do at once  mr powers is in the conservatory with angela said lady elphinspoon  with angela exclaimed sir john while a slight shade of displeasure appeared upon his brow with angela again do you think it quite proper my dear that powers should be so constantly with angela  john said his wife you forget i think who mr powers is i am sure that angela knows too well what is due to her rank and to herself to consider mr powers anything more than an instructive companion and i notice that since mr powers has been your secretary angelas mind is much keener already the girl has a wonderful grasp on foreign policy only yesterday i heard her asking the prime minister at luncheon whether we intend to extend our senegambian protectorate over the fusees he was delighted  oh very well very well said sir john then he rang a bell for a manservant  ask mr powers he said to be good enough to attend me in the library     chapter ii   angela elphinspoon stood with perriton powers among the begonias of the conservatory the same news which had so agitated sir john lay heavy on both their hearts  will the wazoo rise asked angela clasping her hands before her while her great eyes sought the young mans face and found it oh mr powers tell me will they rise it seems too dreadful to contemplate do you think the wazoo will rise  it is only too likely said powers they stood looking into one anothers eyes their thoughts all on the wazoo  angelina elphinspoon as she stood there against the background of the begonias made a picture that a painter or even a plumber would have loved tall and typically english in her fair beauty her features in repose had something of the hauteur and distinction of her mother and when in motion they recalled her father  perriton powers was even taller than angela the splendid frame and stern features of sir johns secretary made him a striking figure yet he was quite frankly sprung from the people and made no secret of it his father had been simply a welltodo london surgeon who had been knighted for some mere discoveries in science his grandfather so it was whispered had been nothing more than a successful banker who had amassed a fortune simply by successful banking yet at oxford young powers had carried all before him he had occupied a seat a front seat in one of the boats had got his blue and his pink and had taken a double final in sanscrit and arithmetic  he had already travelled widely in the east spoke urdu and hoodoo with facility while as secretary to sir john elphinspoon with a seat in the house in prospect he had his foot upon the ladder of success  yes repeated powers thoughtfully they may rise our confidential despatches tell us that for some time they have been secretly passing round packets of yeast the whole tribe is in a ferment  but our sphere of influence is at stake exclaimed angela  it is said powers as a matter of fact for over a year we have been living on a mere modus vivendi  oh mr powers cried angela what a way to live  we have tried everything said the secretary we offered the wazoo a condominium over the desert of el skrub they refused it  but its our desert said angela proudly  it is but what can we do the best we can hope is that el boob will acquiesce in the status quo  at that moment a manservant appeared in the doorway of the conservatory  mr powers sir he said sir john desires your attendance sir in the library sir  powers turned to angela a new seriousness upon his face  miss elphinspoon he said i think i know what is coming will you wait for me here i shall be back in half an hour  i will wait said the girl she sat down and waited among the begonias her mind still on the wazoo her whole intense nature strung to the highest pitch can the modus vivendi hold she murmured  in half an hour powers returned he was wearing now his hat and light overcoat and carried on a strap round his neck a tin box with a white painted label british foreign office confidential despatches this side up with care  miss elphinspoon he said and there was a new note in his voice angela i leave england tonight  tonight gasped angela  on a confidential mission  to wazuchistan exclaimed the girl  powers paused a moment to wazuchistan he said yes but it must not be known i shall return in a monthor never if i failhe spoke with an assumed lightnessit is only one more grave among the hills if i succeed the cabinet is saved and with it the destiny of england  oh mr powers cried angela rising and advancing towards him how splendid how noble no reward will be too great for you  my reward said powers and as he spoke he reached out and clasped both of the girls hands in his own yes my reward may i come and claim it here  for a moment he looked straight into her eyes in the next he was gone and angela was alone  his reward she murmured what could he have meant his reward that he is to claim what can it be  but she could not divine it she admitted to herself that she had not the faintest idea     chapter iii   in the days that followed all england was thrilled to its base as the news spread that the wazoo might rise at any moment  will the wazoos rise was the question upon every lip  in london men went to their offices with a sense of gloom at lunch they could hardly eat a feeling of impending disaster pervaded all ranks  sir john as he passed to and fro to the house was freely accosted in the streets  will the wazoos rise sir asked an honest labourer lord help us all sir if they do  sir john deeply touched dropped a shilling in the honest fellows hat by accident  at no 10 downing street women of the working class with children in their arms stood waiting for news  on the exchange all was excitement consols fell two points in twentyfour hours even raising the bank rate and shutting the door brought only a temporary relief  lord glump the greatest financial expert in london was reported as saying that if the wazoos rose england would be bankrupt in fortyeight hours  meanwhile to the consternation of the whole nation the government did nothing the cabinet seemed to be paralysed  on the other hand the press became all the more clamorous the london times urged that an expedition should be sent at once twentyfive thousand household troops it argued should be sent up the euphrates or up the ganges or up something without delay if they were taken in flat boats carried over the mountains on mules and lifted across the rivers in slings they could then be carried over the desert on jackasses they could reach wazuchistan in two years other papers counselled moderation the manchester guardian recalled the fact that the wazoos were a christian people their leader el boob so it was said had accepted christianity with childlike simplicity and had asked if there was any more of it the spectator claimed that the wazoos or more properly the wazi were probably the descendants of an iranic or perhaps urgumic stock it suggested the award of a rhodes scholarship it looked forward to the days when there would be wazoos at oxford even the presence of a single wazoo or more accurately a single wooz would help  with each day the news became more ominous it was reported in the press that a wazoo inflamed apparently with ghee or perhaps with bhong had rushed up to the hills and refused to come down it was said that the shriekelfoozlum the religious head of the tribe had torn off his suspenders and sent them to mecca  that same day the illustrated london news published a drawing wazoo warriors crossing a river and shouting ho and the general consternation reached its height  meantime for sir john and his colleagues the question of the hour became could the cabinet be held together every effort was made the news that the cabinet had all been seen together at the circus for a moment reassured the nation but the rumour spread that the first lord of the admiralty had said that the clowns were a bum lot the radical press claimed that if he thought so he ought to resign  on the fatal friday the question already referred to was scheduled for its answer the friends of the government counted on the answer to restore confidence to the consternation of all the expected answer was not forthcoming the colonial secretary rose in his place visibly nervous ministers he said had been asked where wazuchistan was they were not prepared at the present delicate stage of negotiations to say more hung upon the answer than ministers were entitled to divulge they could only appeal to the patriotism of the nation he could only say this that wherever it was and he used the word wherever with all the emphasis of which he was capable the government would accept the full responsibility for its being where it was  the house adjourned in something like confusion  among those seated behind the grating of the ladies gallery was lady elphinspoon her quick instinct told her the truth driving home she found her husband seated crushed in his library  john she said falling on her knees and taking her husbands hands in hers is this true is this the dreadful truth  i see you have divined it caroline said the statesman sadly it is the truth we dont know where wazuchistan is  for a moment there was silence  but john how could it have happened  we thought the colonial office knew we were confident that they knew the colonial secretary had stated that he had been there later on it turned out that he meant saskatchewan of course they thought we knew and we both thought that the exchequer must know we understood that they had collected a hut tax for ten years  and hadnt they  not a penny the wazoos live in tents  but surely pleaded lady elphinspoon you could find out had you no maps  sir john shook his head  we thought of that at once my dear weve looked all through the british museum once we thought we had succeeded but it turned out to be wisconsin  but the map in the times everybody saw it  again the baronet shook his head lord southcliff had it made in the office he said it appears that he always does otherwise the physical features might not suit him  but could you not send some one to see  we did we sent perriton powers to find out where it was we had a month to the good it was barely time just time powers has failed and we are lost tomorrow all england will guess the truth and the government falls     chapter iv   the crowd outside of no 10 downing street that evening was so dense that all traffic was at a standstill but within the historic room where the cabinet were seated about the long table all was calm few could have guessed from the quiet demeanour of the group of statesmen that the fate of an empire hung by a thread  seated at the head of the table the prime minister was quietly looking over a book of butterflies while waiting for the conference to begin beside him the secretary for ireland was fixing trout flies while the chancellor of the exchequer kept his serene face bent over upon his needlework at the prime ministers right sir john elphinspoon no longer agitated but sustained and dignified by the responsibility of his office was playing spillikins  the little clock on the mantel chimed eight  the premier closed his book of butterflies  well gentlemen he said i fear our meeting will not be a protracted one it seems we are hopelessly at variance you sir charles he continued turning to the first sea lord who was in attendance are still in favour of a naval expedition  send it up at once said sir charles  up where asked the premier  up anything answered the old sea dog it will get there  voices of dissent were raised in undertones around the table  i strongly deprecate any expedition said the chancellor of the exchequer i favour a convention with the shriek let the shriek sign a convention recognizing the existence of a supreme being and receiving from us a million sterling in acknowledgment  and where will you find the shriek said the prime minister come come gentlemen i fear that we can play this comedy no longer the truth is he added with characteristic nonchalance we dont know where the bally place is we cant meet the house tomorrow we are hopelessly split our existence as a government is at an end  but at that very moment a great noise of shouting and clamour rose from the street without the prime minister lifted his hand for silence listen he said one of the ministers went to a window and opened it and the cries outside became audible a kings messenger make way for the kings messenger  the premier turned quietly to sir john  perriton powers he said  in another moment perriton powers stood before the ministers  bronzed by the tropic sun his face was recognizable only by the assured glance of his eye an afghan bernous was thrown back from his head and shoulders while his commanding figure was draped in a long chibuok a pair of pistols and a curved yasmak were in his belt  so you got to wazuchistan all right said the premier quietly  i went in by way of the barooda said powers for many days i was unable to cross it the waters of the river were wild and swollen with rains to cross it seemed certain death  but at last you got over said the premier and then  i struck out over the fahuri desert for days and days blinded by the sun and almost buried in sand i despaired  but you got through it all right and after that  my first care was to disguise myself staining myself from head to foot with betel nut  to look like a beetle said the premier exactly and so you got to wazuchistan where is it and what is it  my lord said powers drawing himself up and speaking with emphasis i got to where it was thought to be there is no such place  the whole cabinet gave a start of astonishment  no such place they repeated  what about el boob asked the chancellor  there is no such person  and the shriekelfoozlum  powers shook his head  but do you mean to say said the premier in astonishment that there are no wazoos there you must be wrong true we dont just know where they are but our despatches have shown too many signs of active trouble traced directly to the wazoos to disbelieve in them there are wazoos somewhere therethere must be  the wazoos said powers are there but they are irish so are the ohulîs they are both irish  but how the devil did they get out there questioned the premier and why did they make the trouble  the irish my lord interrupted the chief secretary for ireland are everywhere and it is their business to make trouble  some years ago continued powers a few irish families settled out there the ohulîs should be properly called the ohooleys the word wazoo is simply the urdu for mcginnis el boob is the urdu for the arabic el papa the pope it was my knowledge of urdu itself an agglutinative language  precisely said the premier then he turned to his cabinet well gentlemen our task is now simplified if they are irish i think we know exactly what to do i suppose he continued turning to powers that they want some kind of home rule  they do said powers  separating of course the ohulî counties from the wazoo  yes said powers  precisely the thing is simplicity itself and what contribution will they make to the imperial exchequer  none  and will they pay their own expenses  they refuse to  exactly all this is plain sailing of course they must have a constabulary lord edward continued the premier turning now to the secretary of war how long will it take to send in a couple of hundred constabulary i think theyll expect it you know its their right  let me see said lord edward calculating quickly with military precision sending them over the barooda in buckets and then over the mountains in basketsi think in about two weeks  good said the premier gentlemen we shall meet the house tomorrow sir john will you meantime draft us an annexation bill and you young man what you have done is really not half bad his majesty will see you tomorrow i am glad that you are safe  on my way home said powers with quiet modesty i was attacked by a lion  but you beat it off said the premier exactly good night     chapter v   it was on the following afternoon that sir john elphinspoon presented the wazoo annexation bill to a crowded and breathless house  those who know the house of commons know that it has its moods at times it is grave earnest thoughtful at other times it is swept with emotion which comes at it in waves or at times again it just seems to sit there as if it were stuffed  but all agreed that they had never seen the house so hushed as when sir john elphinspoon presented his bill for the annexation of wazuchistan and when at the close of a splendid peroration he turned to pay a graceful compliment to the man who had saved the nation and thundered forth to the delighted ears of his listeners       arma virumque cano wazoo qui primus ab oris  and then with the words england england still on his lips fell over backwards and was carried out on a stretcher the house broke into wild and unrestrained applause     chapter vi   the next day sir perriton powersfor the king had knighted him after breakfaststood again in the conservatory of the house in carlton terrace  i have come for my reward he said do i get it  you do said angela  sir perriton clasped her in his arms  on my way home he said i was attacked by a lion i tried to beat it  hush dearest she whispered let me take you to father     iv  who do you think did it  or the mixedup murder mystery  done after the very latest fashion in this sort of thing     ivwho do you think did it or the mixedup murder mystery  noteany reader who guesses correctly who did it is entitled in all fairness to a beautiful gold watch and chain     chapter i  he dined with me last night   the afternoon edition of the metropolitan planet was going to press five thousand copies a minute were reeling off its giant cylinders a square acre of paper was passing through its presses every hour in the huge planet building which dominated broadway employés compositors reporters advertisers surged to and fro placed in a single line only of course they wouldnt be likely to consent to it they would have reached across manhattan island placed in two lines they would probably have reached twice as far arranged in a procession they would have taken an hour in passing a saloon easily that  in the whole vast building all was uproar telephones megaphones and gramophones were ringing throughout the building elevators flew up and down stopping nowhere  only in one place was quietnamely in the room where sat the big man on whose capacious intellect the whole organization depended  masterman throgton the general manager of the planet was a man in middle life there was something in his massive frame which suggested massiveness and a certain quality in the poise of his great head which indicated a balanced intellect his face was impenetrable and his expression imponderable  the big chief was sitting in his swivel chair with ink all round him through this mans great brain passed all the threads and filaments that held the news of a continent snap one and the whole continent would stop  at the moment when our story opens there was no sense in opening it sooner a written message had just been handed in  the chief read it he seemed to grasp its contents in a flash  good god he exclaimed it was the strongest expression that this solid selfcontained semidetached man ever allowed himself anything stronger would have seemed too near to profanity good god he repeated kivas kelly murdered in his own home why he dined with me last night i drove him home  for a brief moment the big man remained plunged in thought but with throgton the moment of musing was short his instinct was to act  you may go he said to the messenger then he seized the telephone that stood beside him this man could telephone almost without stopping thinking and spoke into it in quiet measured tones without wasting a word  hullo operator put me through to two two two two two is that two two two two two hullo two two two two two i want transome kent kent speaking kent this is throgton speaking kent a murder has been committed at the kelly residence riverside drive i want you to go and cover it get it all dont spare expense the planet is behind you have you got carfare right  in another moment the big chief had turned round in his swivel chair at least forty degrees and was reading telegraphic despatches from jerusalem that was the way he did things     chapter ii  i must save her life   within a few minutes transome kent had leapt into a car a surface car and was speeding north towards riverside drive with the full power of the car as he passed uptown a newsboy was already calling club man murdered another club man murdered carelessly throwing a cent to the boy kent purchased a paper and read the brief notice of the tragedy  kivas kelly a wellknown club man and bon vivant had been found dead in his residence on riverside drive with every indicationor at least with a whole lot of indicationsof murder the unhappy club man had been found fully dressed in his evening clothes lying on his back on the floor of the billiardroom with his feet stuck up on the edge of the table a narrow black scarf presumably his evening tie was twisted tightly about his neck by means of a billiard cue inserted in it there was a quiet smile upon his face he had apparently died from strangulation a couple of bulletholes passed through his body one on each side but they went out again his suspenders were burst at the back his hands were folded across his chest one of them still held a white billiard ball there was no sign of a struggle or of any disturbance in the room a square piece of cloth was missing from the victims dinner jacket  in its editorial columns the same paper discussed the more general aspects of the murder this it said was the third club man murdered in the last fortnight while not taking an alarmist view the paper felt that the killing of club men had got to stop there was a limit a reasonable limit to everything why should a club man be killed it might be asked why should a club man live but this was hardly to the point they do live after all to be fair what does a club man ask of society not much merely wine women and singing why not let him have them is it fair to kill him does the gain to literature outweigh the social wrong the writer estimated that at the rate of killing now going on the club men would be all destroyed in another generation something should be done to conserve them  transome kent was not a detective he was a reporter after sweeping everything at harvard in front of him and then behind him he had joined the staff of the planet two months before his rise had been phenomenal in his first week of work he had unravelled a mystery in his second he had unearthed a packing scandal which had poisoned the food of the entire nation for ten years and in his third he had pitilessly exposed some of the best and most respectable people in the metropolis kents work on the planet consisted now almost exclusively of unravelling and unearthing and it was natural that the manager should turn to him  the mansion was a handsome sandstone residence standing in its own grounds on kents arrival he found that the police had already drawn a cordon around it with cords groups of morbid curiosityseekers hung about it in twos and threes some of them in fours and fives policemen were leaning against the fence in all directions they wore that baffled look so common to the detective force of the metropolis it seems to me remarked one of them to the man beside him that there is an inexorable chain of logic about this that i am unable to follow so do i said the other  the chief inspector of the detective department a large heavylooking man was standing beside a gatepost he nodded gloomily to transome kent  are you baffled edwards asked kent  baffled again mr kent said the inspector with a sob in his voice i thought i could have solved this one but i cant  he passed a handkerchief across his eyes  have a cigar chief said kent and let me hear what the trouble is  the inspector brightened like all policemen he was simply crazy over cigars all right mr kent he said wait till i chase away the morbid curiosityseekers  he threw a stick at them  now then continued kent what about tracks footmarks had you thought of them  yes first thing the whole lawn is covered with them all stamped down look at these for instance these are the tracks of a man with a wooden legkent noddedin all probability a sailor newly landed from java carrying a singapore walkingstick and with a tinwhistle tied round his belt  yes i see that said kent thoughtfully the weight of the whistle weighs him down a little on the right side  do you think mr kent a sailor from java with a wooden leg would commit a murder like this asked the inspector eagerly would he do it  he would said the investigator they generally doas soon as they land  the inspector nodded and look at these marks here mr kent you recognize them surelythose are the footsteps of a barkeeper out of employment waiting for the eighteenth amendment to pass away see how deeply they sink in  yes said kent hed commit murder  there are lots more continued the inspector but theyre no good the morbid curiosityseekers were walking all over this place while we were drawing the cordon round it  stop a bit said kent pausing to think a moment what about thumbprints  thumbprints said the inspector dont mention them the house is full of them  any thumbprints of italians with that peculiar incurvature of the ball of the thumb that denotes a sicilian brigand  there were three of those said inspector edwards gloomily no mr kent the thumb stuff is no good  kent thought again  inspector he said what about mysterious women have you seen any around  four went by this morning said the inspector one at eleventhirty one at twelvethirty and two together at onethirty at least he added sadly i think they were mysterious all women look mysterious to me  i must try in another direction said kent let me reconstruct the whole thing i must weave a chain of analysis kivas kelly was a bachelor was he not  he was he lived alone here  very good i suppose he had in his employ a butler who had been with him for twenty years  edwards nodded  i suppose youve arrested him  at once said the inspector we always arrest the butler mr kent they expect it in fact this man williams gave himself up at once  and let me see continued the investigator i presume there was a housekeeper who lived on the top floor and who had been stone deaf for ten years  precisely  she had heard nothing during the murder  not a thing but this may have been on account of her deafness  true true murmured kent and i suppose there was a coachman a thoroughly reliable man who lived with his wife at the back of the house  but who had taken his wife over to see a relation on the night of the murder and who did not return until an advanced hour mr kent weve been all over that theres nothing in it  were there any other persons belonging to the establishment  there was mr kellys stenographer alice delary but she only came in the mornings  have you seen her asked kent eagerly what is she like  i have seen her said the inspector shes a looloo  ha said kent a looloo the two men looked into one anothers eyes  yes repeated edwards thoughtfully a peach  a sudden swift flash of intuition an inspiration leapt into the young reporters brain  this girl this peach at all hazards he must save her life     chapter iii  i must buy a book on billiards   kent turned to the inspector take me into the house he said edwards led the way the interior of the handsome mansion seemed undisturbed i see no sign of a struggle here said kent  no answered the inspector gloomily we can find no sign of a struggle anywhere but then we never do  he opened for the moment the door of the stately drawingroom no sign of a struggle there he said the closed blinds the draped furniture the covered piano the muffled chandelier showed absolutely no sign of a struggle  come upstairs to the billiardroom said edwards the body has been removed for the inquest but nothing else is disturbed  they went upstairs on the second floor was the billiardroom with a great english table in the centre of it but kent had at once dashed across to the window an exclamation on his lips ha ha he said what have we here  the inspector shook his head quietly the window he said in a monotonous almost singsong tone has apparently been opened from the outside the sash being lifted with some kind of a sharp instrument the dust on the sill outside has been disturbed as if by a man of extraordinary agility lying on his stomachdont bother about that mr kent its always there  true said kent then he cast his eyes upward and again an involuntary exclamation broke from him did you see that trapdoor he asked  we did said edwards the dust around the rim has been disturbed the trap opens into the hollow of the roof a man of extraordinary dexterity might open the trap with a billiard cue throw up a fine manila rope climb up the rope and lie there on his stomach  no use continued the inspector for the matter of that look at this huge oldfashioned fireplace a man of extraordinary precocity could climb up the chimney or this dumbwaiter on a pulley for serving drinks leading down into the maids quarters a man of extreme indelicacy might ride up and down in it  stop a minute said kent what is the meaning of that hat  a light gossamer hat gay with flowers hung on a peg at the side of the room  we thought of that said edwards and we have left it there whoever comes for that hat has had a hand in the mystery we think  but transome kent was no longer listening he had seized the edge of the billiard table  look look he cried eagerly the clue to the mystery the positions of the billiard balls the white ball in the very centre of the table and the red just standing on the verge of the end pocket what does it mean edwards what does it mean  he had grasped edwards by the arm and was peering into his face  i dont know said the inspector i dont play billiards  neither do i said kent but i can find out quick the nearest bookstore i must buy a book on billiards  with a wave of the arm kent vanished  the inspector stood for a moment in thought  gone he murmured to himself it was his habit to murmur all really important speeches aloud to himself now why did throgton telephone to me to put a watch on kent ten dollars a day to shadow him why     chapter iv  that is not billiard chalk   meantime at the planet office masterman throgton was putting on his coat to go home  excuse me sir said an employé theres a lot of green billiard chalk on your sleeve  throgton turned and looked the man full in the eye  that is not billiard chalk he said it is face powder  saying which this big imperturbable selfcontained man stepped into the elevator and went to the ground floor in one drop     chapter v  has anybody here seen kelly   the inquest upon the body of kivas kelly was held upon the following day far from offering any solution of what had now become an unfathomable mystery it only made it deeper still the medical testimony though given by the most distinguished consulting expert of the city was entirely inconclusive the body the expert testified showed evident marks of violence there was a distinct lesion of the oesophagus and a decided excoriation of the fibula the mesodenum was gibbous there was a certain quantity of flab in the binomium and the proscenium was wide open  one striking fact however was decided from the testimony of the expert namely that the stomach of the deceased was found to contain half a pint of arsenic on this point the questioning of the district attorney was close and technical was it unusual he asked to find arsenic in the stomach in the stomach of a club man no was not half a pint a large quantity he would not say that was it a small quantity he should not care to say that it was would half a pint of arsenic cause death of a club man no not necessarily that was all  the other testimony submitted to the inquest jury brought out various facts of a substantive character but calculated rather to complicate than to unravel the mystery the butler swore that on the very day of the murder he had served his master a halfpint of arsenic at lunch but he claimed that this was quite a usual happening with his master on crossexamination it appeared that he meant apollinaris he was certain however that it was half a pint the butler it was shown had been in kivas kellys employ for twenty years  the coachman an irishman was closely questioned he had been in mr kellys employ for three yearsever since his arrival from the old country was it true that he had had on the day of the murder a violent quarrel with his master it was had he threatened to kill him no he had threatened to knock his block off but not to kill him  the coroner looked at his notes call alice delary he commanded there was a deep sensation in the court as miss delary quietly stepped forward to her place in the witnessbox  tall graceful and willowy alice delary was in her first burst of womanhood those who looked at the beautiful girl realized that if her first burst was like this what would the second or the third be like  the girl was trembling and evidently distressed but she gave her evidence in a clear sweet low voice she had been in mr kellys employ three years she was his stenographer but she came only in the mornings and always left at lunchtime the question immediately asked by the jurywhere did she generally have lunchwas disallowed by the coroner asked by a member of the jury what system of shorthand she used she answered pitmans asked by another juryman whether she ever cared to go to moving pictures she said that she went occasionally this created a favourable impression miss delary said the district attorney i want to ask if it is your hat that was found hanging in the billiardroom after the crime  dont you dare ask that girl that interrupted the magistrate miss delary you may step down  but the principal sensation of the day arose out of the evidence offered by masterman throgton general manager of the planet kivas kelly he testified had dined with him at his club on the fateful evening he had afterwards driven him to his home  when you went into the house with the deceased asked the district attorney how long did you remain there with him  that said throgton quietly i must refuse to answer  would it incriminate you asked the coroner leaning forward  it might said throgton  then youre perfectly right not to answer it said the coroner dont ask him that any more ask something else  then did you questioned the attorney turning to throgton again play a game of billiards with the deceased  stop stop said the coroner that question i cant allow its too direct too brutal theres something about that question something mean dirty ask another  very good said the attorney then tell me mr throgton if you ever saw this blue envelope before he held up in his hand a long blue envelope  never in my life said throgton  of course he didnt said the coroner lets have a look at it what is it  this envelope your honour was found sticking out of the waistcoat pocket of the deceased  you dont say said the coroner and whats in it  amid breathless silence the attorney drew forth a sheet of blue paper bearing a stamp and read  this is the last will and testament of me kivas kelly of new york i leave everything of which i die possessed to my nephew peter kelly  the entire room gasped no one spoke the coroner looked all around has anybody here seen kelly he asked  there was no answer  the coroner repeated the question  no one moved  mr coroner said the attorney it is my opinion that if peter kelly is found the mystery is fathomed  ten minutes later the jury returned a verdict of murder against a person or persons unknown adding that they would bet a dollar that kelly did it  the coroner ordered the butler to be released and directed the issue of a warrant for the arrest of peter kelly     chapter vi  show me the man who wore those boots   the remains of the unhappy club man were buried on the following day as reverently as those of a club man can be none followed him to the grave except a few morbid curiosityseekers who rode on top of the hearse  the great city turned again to its usual avocations the unfathomable mystery was dismissed from the public mind  meantime transome kent was on the trail sleepless almost foodless and absolutely drinkless he was everywhere he was looking for peter kelly wherever crowds were gathered the investigator was there searching for kelly in the great concourse of the grand central station kent moved to and fro peering into everybodys face an official touched him on the shoulder stop peering into the peoples faces he said i am unravelling a mystery kent answered i beg your pardon sir said the man i didnt know  kent was here and everywhere moving ceaselessly pro and con watching for kelly for hours he stood beside the sodawater fountains examining every drinker as he drank for three days he sat on the steps of masterman throgtons home disguised as a plumber waiting for a wrench  but still no trace of peter kelly young kelly it appeared had lived with his uncle until a little less than three years ago then suddenly he had disappeared he had vanished as a brilliant writer for the new york press framed it as if the earth had swallowed him up  transome kent however was not a man to be baffled by initial defeat  a week later the investigator called in at the office of inspector edwards  inspector he said i must have some more clues take me again to the kelly residence i must reanalyse my first diæresis  together the two friends went to the house it is inevitable said kent as they entered again the fateful billiardroom that we have overlooked something  we always do said edwards gloomily  now tell me said kent as they stood beside the billiard table what is your own theory the police theory of this murder give me your first theory first and then go on with the others  our first theory mr kent was that the murder was committed by a sailor with a wooden leg newly landed from java  quite so quite proper nodded kent  we knew that he was a sailor the inspector went on dropping again into his singsong monotone by the extraordinary agility needed to climb up the thirty feet of bare brick wall to the windowa landsman could not have climbed more than twenty the fact that he was from the east indies we knew from the peculiar knot about his victims neck we knew that he had a wooden leg  the inspector paused and looked troubled  we knew it he paused again im afraid i cant remember that one  tut tut said kent gently you knew it edwards because when he leaned against the billiard table the impress of his hand on the mahogany was deeper on one side than the other the man was obviously top heavy but you abandoned this first theory  certainly mr kent we always do our second theory was  but kent had ceased to listen he had suddenly stooped down and picked up something off the floor  ha ha he exclaimed what do you make of this he held up a square fragment of black cloth  we never saw it said edwards  cloth muttered kent the missing piece of kivas kellys dinner jacket he whipped out a magnifying glass look he said its been stamped uponby a man wearing hobnailed bootsmade in irelanda man of five feet nine and a half inches high  one minute mr kent interrupted the inspector greatly excited i dont quite get it  the depth of the dint proves the lift of his foot said kent impatiently and the lift of the foot indicates at once the mans height edwards find me the man who wore these boots and the mystery is solved  at that very moment a heavy step unmistakably to the trained ear that of a man in hobnailed boots was heard upon the stair the door opened and a man stood hesitating in the doorway  both kent and edwards gave a start two starts of surprise  the man was exactly five feet nine and a half inches high he was dressed in coachmans dress his face was saturnine and evil  it was dennis the coachman of the murdered man  if youre mr kent he said theres a lady here asking for you     chapter vii  oh mr kent save me   in another moment an absolutely noiseless step was heard upon the stair  a young girl entered a girl tall willowy and beautiful in the first burst or just about the first burst of womanhood  it was alice delary  she was dressed with extreme taste but kents quick eye noted at once that she wore no hat  mr kent she cried you are mr kent are you not they told me that you were here oh mr kent help me save me  she seemed to shudder into herself a moment her breath came and went quickly  she reached out her two hands  calm yourself my dear young lady said kent taking them dont let your breath come and go so much trust me tell me all  mr kent said delary regaining her control but still trembling i want my hat  kent let go the beautiful girls hands sit down he said then he went across the room and fetched the hat the light gossamer hat with flowers in it that still hung on a peg  oh i am so glad to get it back cried the girl i can never thank you enough i was afraid to come for it  it is all right said the inspector the police theory was that it was the housekeepers hat you are welcome to it  kent had been looking closely at the girl before him  you have more to say than that he said tell me all  oh i will i will mr kent that dreadful night i was here i saw at least i heard it all  she shuddered  oh mr kent it was dreadful i had come back that evening to the library to finish some work i knew that mr kelly was to dine out and that i would be alone i had been working quietly for some time when i became aware of voices in the billiardroom i tried not to listen but they seemed to be quarrelling and i couldnt help hearing oh mr kent was i wrong  no said kent taking her hand a moment you were not  i heard one say get your foot off the table youve no right to put your foot on the table then the other said well you keep your stomach off the cushion then the girl shivered then presently one said quite fiercely get back into balk there get back fifteen inches and the other voice said by god ill shoot from here then there was a dead stillness and then a voice almost screamed youve potted me youve potted me that ends it and then i heard the other say in a low tone forgive me i didnt mean it i never meant it to end that way  i was so frightened mr kent i couldnt stay any longer i rushed downstairs and ran all the way home then next day i read what had happened and i knew that i had left my hat there and was afraid oh mr kent save me  miss delary said the investigator taking again the girls hands and looking into her eyes you are safe tell me only one thing the man who played against kivas kellydid you see him  only for one momentthe girl pausedthrough the keyhole  what was he like asked kent had he an impenetrable face  he had  was there anything massive about his face  oh yes yes it was all massive  miss delary said kent this mystery is now on the brink of solution when i have joined the last links of the chain may i come and tell you all  she looked full in his face  at any hour of the day or night she said you may come  then she was gone     chapter viii  you are peter kelly   within a few moments kent was at the phone  i want four four four four is that four four four four mr throgtons house i want mr throgton mr throgton speaking mr throgton kent speaking the riverside mystery is solved  kent waited in silence a moment then he heard throgtons voicenot a note in it disturbed  has anybody found kelly  mr throgton said kent and he spoke with a strange meaning in his tone the story is a long one suppose i relate it to youhe paused and laid a peculiar emphasis on what followedover a game of billiards  what the devil do you mean answered throgton  let me come round to your house and tell the story there are points in it that i can best illustrate over a billiard table suppose i challenge you to a fifty point game before i tell my story  it required no little hardihood to challenge masterman throgton at billiards his reputation at his club as a cool determined player was surpassed by few throgton had been known to run nine ten and even twelve at a break it was not unusual for him to drive his ball clear off the table his keen eye told him infallibly where each of the three balls was instinctively he knew which to shoot with  in kent however he had no mean adversary the young reporter though he had never played before had studied his book to some purpose his strategy was admirable keeping his ball well under the shelter of the cushion he eluded every stroke of his adversary and in his turn caused his ball to leap or dart across the table with such speed as to bury itself in the pocket at the side  the score advanced rapidly both players standing precisely equal at the end of the first halfhour it stood at ten all throgton a grim look upon his face had settled down to work playing with one knee on the table kent calm but alive with excitement leaned well forward to his stroke his eye held within an inch of the ball  at fifteen they were still even throgton with a sudden effort forced a break of three but kent rallied and in another twenty minutes they were even again at nineteen all  but it was soon clear that transome kent had something else in mind than to win the game presently his opportunity came with a masterly stroke such as few trained players could use he had potted his adversarys ball the red ball was left over the very jaws of the pocket the white was in the centre  kent looked into throgtons face  the balls were standing in the very same position on the table as on the night of the murder  i did that on purpose said kent quietly  what do you mean asked throgton  the position of those balls said kent mr throgton come into the library i have something to say to you you know already what it is  they went into the library throgton his hand unsteady lighted a cigar  well he said what is it  mr throgton said kent two weeks ago you gave me a mystery to solve tonight i can give you the solution do you want it  throgtons face never moved  well he said  a mans life kent went on may be played out on a billiard table a mans soul throgton may be pocketed  what devils foolery is this said throgton what do you mean  i mean that your crime is knownplotter schemer that you are you are found outhypocrite traitor yes masterman throgton or ratherlet me give you your true namepeter kelly murderer i denounce you  throgton never flinched he walked across to where kent stood and with his open palm he slapped him over the mouth  transome kent he said youre a liar  then he walked back to his chair and sat down  kent he continued from the first moment of your mock investigation i knew who you were your every step was shadowed your every movement dogged transome kentby your true name peter kelly murderer i denounce you  kent walked quietly across to throgton and dealt him a fearful blow behind the ear  youre a liar he said i am not peter kelly  they sat looking at one another  at that moment throgtons servant appeared at the door  a gentleman to see you sir  who said throgton  i dont know sir he gave his card  masterman throgton took the card  on it was printed  peter kelly     chapter ix  let me tell you the story of my life   for a moment throgton and kent sat looking at one another  show the man up said throgton  a minute later the door opened and a man entered kents keen eye analysed him as he stood his blue clothes his tanned face and the extraordinary dexterity of his fingers left no doubt of his calling he was a sailor  sit down said throgton  thank you said the sailor it rests my wooden leg  the two men looked again one of the sailors legs was made of wood with a start kent noticed that it was made of east indian sandalwood  ive just come from java said kelly quietly as he sat down  kent nodded i see it all now he said throgton i wronged you we should have known it was a sailor with a wooden leg from java there is no other way  gentlemen said peter kelly ive come to make my confession it is the usual and right thing to do gentlemen and i want to go through with it while i can  one moment said kent do you mind interrupting yourself with a hacking cough  thank you sir said kelly ill get to that a little later let me begin by telling you the story of my life  no no urged throgton and kent dont do that  kelly frowned i think i have a right to he said youve got to hear it as a boy i had a wild impulsive nature had it been curbed  but it wasnt said throgton what next  i was the sole relative of my uncle and heir to great wealth pampered with every luxury i was on a footing of  one minute interrupted kent rapidly analysing as he listened how many legs had you then  twoon a footing of ease and indolence i soon lost  your leg said throgton mr kelly pray come to the essential things  i will said the sailor gentlemen bad as i was i was not altogether bad  of course not said kent and throgton soothingly probably not more than ninety per cent  even into my life gentlemen love entered if you had seen her you would have known that she is as innocent as the driven snow three years ago she came to my uncles house i loved her one day hardly knowing what i was doing i took her he paused  yes yes said throgton and kent you took her  to the aquarium my uncle heard of it there was a violent quarrel he disinherited me and drove me from the house i had a liking for the sea from a boy  excuse me said kent from what boy  kelly went right on i ran away as a sailor before the mast  pardon me interrupted kent i am not used to sea terms why didnt you run behind the mast  hear me out said kelly i am nearly done we sailed for the east indiesfor java there a malay pirate bit off my leg i returned home bitter disillusioned the mere wreck that you see i had but one thought i meant to kill my uncle  for a moment a hacking cough interrupted kelly kent and throgton nodded quietly to one another  i came to his house at night with the aid of my wooden leg i scaled the wall lifted the window and entered the billiardroom there was murder in my heart thank god i was spared from that at the very moment when i got in a light was turned on in the room and i saw before mebut no i will not name hermy better angel peter she cried then with a womans intuition she exclaimed you have come to murder your uncle dont do it my whole mood changed i broke down and cried like alike a  kelly paused a moment  like a boob said kent softly go on  when i had done crying we heard voices quick she exclaimed flee hide he must not see you she rushed into the adjoining room closing the door my eye had noticed already the trap above i climbed up to it shall i explain how  dont said kent i can analyse it afterwards  there i saw what passed i saw mr throgton and kivas kelly come in i watched their game they were greatly excited and quarrelled over it throgton lost  the big man nodded with a scowl by his potting the white he said  precisely said kelly he missed the red your analysis was wrong mr kent the game ended you started your reasoning from a false diæresis in billiards people never mark the last point the board still showed ninetynine all throgton left and my uncle as often happens kept trying over the last shota halfball shot sir with the red over the pocket he tried again and again he couldnt make it he tried various ways his rest was too unsteady finally he made his tie into a long loop round his neck and put his cue through it now by gad he said i can do it  ha said kent fool that i was  exactly continued kelly in the excitement of watching my uncle i forgot where i was i leaned too far over and fell out of the trap i landed on uncle just as he was sitting on the table to shoot he fell  i see it all said kent he hit his head the loop tightened the cue spun round and he was dead  thats it said kelly i saw that he was dead and i did not dare to remain i straightened the knot in his tie laid his hands reverently across his chest and departed as i had come  mr kelly said throgton thoughtfully the logic of your story is wonderful it exceeds anything in its line that i have seen published for months but there is just one point that i fail to grasp the two bullet holes  they were old ones answered the sailor quietly my uncle in his youth had led a wild life in the west he was full of them  there was silence for a moment then kelly spoke again  my time gentlemen is short a hacking cough interrupted him i feel that i am withering it rests with you gentlemen whether or not i walk out of this room a free man  transome kent rose and walked over to the sailor  mr kelly he said here is my hand     chapter x  so do i   a few days after the events last narrated transome kent called at the boardinghouse of miss alice delary the young investigator wore a light grey tweed suit with a salmoncoloured geranium in his buttonhole there was something exultant yet at the same time grave in his expression as of one who has taken a momentous decision affecting his future life  i wonder he murmured whether i am acting for my happiness  he sat down for a moment on the stone steps and analysed himself  then he rose  i am he said and rang the bell  miss delary said a maid she left here two days ago if you are mr kent the note on the mantelpiece is for you  without a word kent never wasted them the investigator opened the note and read       dear mr kent       peter and i were married yesterday morning and have taken an      apartment in java new jersey you will be glad to hear that      peters cough is ever so much better the lawyers have given peter      his money without the least demur       we both feel that your analysis was simply wonderful peter says      he doesnt know where he would be without it       very sincerely       alice kelly       psi forgot to mention to you that i saw peter in the      billiardroom but your analysis was marvellous just the same   that evening kent sat with throgton talking over the details of the tragedy  throgton he said it has occurred to me that there were points about that solution that we didnt get exactly straight somehow  so do i said throgton     v  broken barriers  or red love on a blue island  the kind of thing that has replaced the good old sea story     vbroken barriers or red love on a blue island   it was on a bright august afternoon that i stepped on board the steamer patagonia at southampton outward bound for the west indies and the port of new orleans  i had at the time no presentiment of disaster i remember remarking to the ships purser as my things were being carried to my stateroom that i had never in all my travels entered upon any voyage with so little premonition of accident very good mr borus he answered you will find your stateroom in the starboard aisle on the right i distinctly recall remarking to the captain that i had never in any of my numerous seafarings seen the sea of a more limpid blue he agreed with me so entirely as i recollect it that he did not even trouble to answer  had anyone told me on that bright summer afternoon that our ship would within a week be wrecked among the dry tortugas i should have laughed had anyone informed me that i should find myself alone on a raft in the caribbean sea i should have gone into hysterics  we had hardly entered the waters of the caribbean when a storm of unprecedented violence broke upon us even the captain had never so he said seen anything to compare with it for two days and nights we encountered and endured the full fury of the sea our soup plates were secured with racks and covered with lids in the smokingroom our glasses had to be set in brackets and as our steward came and went we were from moment to moment in imminent danger of seeing him washed overboard  on the third morning just after daybreak the ship collided with something probably either a floating rock or one of the dry tortugas she blew out her four funnels the bowsprit dropped out of its place and the propeller came right off the captain after a brief consultation decided to abandon her the boats were lowered and the sea being now quite calm the passengers were emptied into them  by what accident i was left behind i cannot tell i had been talking to the second mate and telling him of a rather similar experience of mine in the china sea and holding him by the coat as i did so when quite suddenly he took me by the shoulders and rushing me into the deserted smokingroom said sit there mr borus till i come back for you the fellow spoke in such a menacing way that i thought it wiser to comply  when i came out they were all gone by good fortune i found one of the ships rafts still lying on the deck i gathered together such articles as might be of use and contrived though how i do not know to launch it into the sea  on my second morning on my raft i was sitting quietly polishing my boots and talking to myself when i became aware of an object floating in the sea close beside the raft judge of my feelings when i realized it to be the inanimate body of a girl hastily finishing my boots and stopping talking to myself i made shift as best i could to draw the unhappy girl towards me with a hook  after several ineffectual attempts i at last managed to obtain a hold of the girls clothing and drew her on to the raft  she was still unconscious the heavy lifebelt round her person must so i divined have kept her afloat after the wreck her clothes were sodden so i reasoned with the seawater  on a handkerchief which was still sticking into the belt of her dress i could see letters embroidered realizing that this was no time for hesitation and that the girls life might depend on my reading her name i plucked it forth it was edith croyden  as vigorously as i could i now set to work to rub her hands my idea was partly to restore her circulation i next removed her boots which were now rendered useless as i argued by the seawater and began to rub her feet  i was just considering what to remove next when the girl opened her eyes stop rubbing my feet she said  miss croyden i said you mistake me  i rose with a sense of pique which i did not trouble to conceal and walked to the other end of the raft i turned my back upon the girl and stood looking out upon the leaden waters of the caribbean sea the ocean was now calm there was nothing in sight  i was still searching the horizon when i heard a soft footstep on the raft behind me and a light hand was laid upon my shoulder forgive me said the girls voice  i turned about miss croyden was standing behind me she had so i argued removed her stockings and was standing in her bare feet there is something i am free to confess about a woman in her bare feet which hits me where i live with instinctive feminine taste the girl had twined a piece of seaweed in her hair seaweed as a rule gets me every time but i checked myself  miss croyden i said there is nothing to forgive  at the mention of her name the girl blushed for a moment and seemed about to say something but stopped  where are we she queried presently  i dont know i answered as cheerily as i could but i am going to find out  how brave you are miss croyden exclaimed  not at all i said putting as much heartiness into my voice as i was able to  the girl watched my preparations with interest  with the aid of a bent pin hoisted on a long pole i had no difficulty in ascertaining our latitude  miss croydon i said i am now about to ascertain our longitude to do this i must lower myself down into the sea pray do not be alarmed or anxious i shall soon be back  with the help of a long line i lowered myself deep down into the sea until i was enabled to ascertain approximately at any rate our longitude a fierce thrill went through me at the thought that this longitude was our longitude hers and mine on the way up hand over hand i observed a long shark looking at me realizing that the fellow if voracious might prove dangerous i lost but little timeindeed i may say i lost absolutely no timein coming up the rope  the girl was waiting for me  oh i am so glad you have come back she exclaimed clasping her hands  it was nothing i said wiping the water from my ears and speaking as melodiously as i could  have you found our whereabouts she asked  yes i answered our latitude is normal but our longitude is i fear at least three degrees out of the plumb i am afraid miss croyden i added speaking as mournfully as i knew how that you must reconcile your mind to spending a few days with me on this raft  is it as bad as that she murmured her eyes upon the sea  in the long day that followed i busied myself as much as i could with my work upon the raft so as to leave the girl as far as possible to herself it was so i argued absolutely necessary to let her feel that she was safe in my keeping otherwise she might jump off the raft and i should lose her  i sorted out my various cans and tins tested the oil in my chronometer arranged in neat order my various ropes and apparatus and got my fryingpan into readiness for any emergency of food we had for the present no lack  with the approach of night i realized that it was necessary to make arrangements for the girls comfort with the aid of a couple of upright poles i stretched a grey blanket across the raft so as to make a complete partition  miss croyden i said this end of the raft is yours here you may sleep in peace  how kind you are the girl murmured  you will be quite safe from interference i added i give you my word that i will not obtrude upon you in any way  how chivalrous you are she said  not at all i answered as musically as i could understand me i am now putting my head over this partition for the last time if there is anything you want say so now  nothing she answered  there is a candle and matches beside you if there is anything that you want in the night call me instantly remember at any hour i shall be here i promise it  good night she murmured in a few minutes her soft regular breathing told me that she was asleep  i went forward and seated myself in a tarbucket with my head against the mast to get what sleep i could  but for some timewhy i do not knowsleep would not come  the image of edith croyden filled my mind in vain i told myself that she was a stranger to me thatbeyond her longitudei knew nothing of her in some strange way this girl had seized hold of me and dominated my senses  the night was very calm and still with great stars in a velvet sky in the darkness i could hear the water lapping the edge of the raft  i remained thus in deep thought sinking further and further into the tarbucket by the time i reached the bottom of it i realized that i was in love with edith croyden  then the thought of my wife occurred to me and perplexed me our unhappy marriage had taken place three years before we brought to one another youth wealth and position yet our marriage was a failure my wifefor what reason i cannot guessseemed to find my society irksome in vain i tried to interest her with narratives of my travels they seemedin some way that i could not divineto fatigue her leave me for a little harold she would say i forgot to mention that my name is harold borus i have a pain in my neck at her own suggestion i had taken a trip around the world on my return she urged me to go round again i was going round for the third time when the wrecking of the steamer had interrupted my trip  on my own part too i am free to confess that my wifes attitude had aroused in me a sense of pique not to say injustice i am not in any way a vain man yet her attitude wounded me i would no sooner begin when i was in the himalayas hunting the humpo or humped buffalo than she would interrupt and say oh harold would you mind going down to the billiardroom and seeing if i left my cigarettes under the billiardtable when i returned she was gone  by agreement we had arranged for a divorce on my completion of my third voyage we were to meet in new orleans clara was to go there on a separate ship giving me the choice of oceans  had i met edith croyden three months later i should have been a man free to woo and win her as it was i was bound i must put a clasp of iron on my feelings i must wear a mask cheerful helpful and full of narrative i must yet let fall no word of love to this defenceless girl  after a great struggle i rose at last from the tarbucket feeling if not a brighter at least a cleaner man  dawn was already breaking i looked about me as the sudden beams of the tropic sun illumined the placid sea i saw immediately before me only a hundred yards away an island a sandy beach sloped back to a rocky eminence broken with scrub and jungle i could see a little stream leaping among the rocks with eager haste i paddled the raft close to the shore till it ground in about ten inches of water  i leaped into the water  with the aid of a stout line i soon made the raft fast to a rock then as i turned i saw that miss croyden was standing upon the raft fully dressed and gazing at me the morning sunlight played in her hair and her deep blue eyes were as soft as the caribbean sea itself  dont attempt to wade ashore miss croyden i cried in agitation pray do nothing rash the waters are simply infested with bacilli  but how can i get ashore she asked with a smile which showed all or nearly all of her pearllike teeth  miss croyden i said there is only one way i must carry you  in another moment i had walked back to the raft and lifted her as tenderly and reverently as if she had been my sisterindeed more soin my arms  her weight seemed nothing when i get a girl like that in my arms i simply dont feel it just for one moment as i clasped her thus in my arms a fierce thrill ran through me but i let it run  when i had carried her well up the sand close to the little stream i set her down to my surprise she sank down in a limp heap  the girl had fainted  i knew that it was no time for hesitation  running to the stream i filled my hat with water and dashed it in her face then i took up a handful of mud and threw it at her with all my force after that i beat her with my hat  at length she opened her eyes and sat up  i must have fainted she said with a little shiver i am cold oh if we could only have a fire  i will do my best to make one miss croyden i replied speaking as gymnastically as i could i will see what i can do with two dry sticks  with dry sticks queried the girl can you light a fire with that how wonderful you are  i have often seen it done i replied thoughtfully when i was hunting the humpo or humped buffalo in the himalayas it was our usual method  have you really hunted the humpo she asked her eyes large with interest  i have indeed i said but you must rest later on i will tell you about it  i wish you could tell me now she said with a little moan  meantime i had managed to select from the driftwood on the beach two sticks that seemed absolutely dry placing them carefully together in indian fashion i then struck a match and found no difficulty in setting them on fire  in a few moments the girl was warming herself beside a generous fire  together we breakfasted upon the beach beside the fire discussing our plans like comrades  our meal over i rose  i will leave you here a little i said while i explore  with no great difficulty i made my way through the scrub and climbed the eminence of tumbled rocks that shut in the view  on my return miss croyden was still seated by the fire her head in her hands  miss croyden i said we are on an island  is it inhabited she asked  once perhaps but not now it is one of the many keys of the west indies here in old buccaneering days the pirates landed and careened their ships  how did they do that she asked fascinated  i am not sure i answered i think with whitewash at any rate they gave them a good careening but since then these solitudes are only the home of the seagull the seamew and the albatross  the girl shuddered  how lonely she said  lonely or not i said with a laugh luckily i can speak with a laugh when i want to i must get to work  i set myself to work to haul up and arrange our effects with a few stones i made a rude table and seats i took care to laugh and sing as much as possible while at my work the close of the day found me still busy with my labours  miss croyden i said i must now arrange a place for you to sleep  with the aid of four stakes driven deeply into the ground and with blankets strung upon them i managed to fashion a sort of rude tent roofless but otherwise quite sheltered  miss croyden i said when all was done go in there  then with little straps which i had fastened to the blankets i buckled her in reverently  good night miss croyden i said  but you she exclaimed where will you sleep  oh i i answered speaking as exuberantly as i could i shall do very well on the ground but be sure to call me at the slightest sound  then i went out and lay down in a patch of cactus plants  i need not dwell in detail upon the busy and arduous days that followed our landing upon the island i had much to do each morning i took our latitude and longitude by this i then set my watch cooked porridge and picked flowers till miss croyden appeared  with every day the girl came forth from her habitation as a new surprise in her radiant beauty one morning she had bound a cluster of wild arbutus about her brow another day she had twisted a band of convolvulus around her waist on a third she had wound herself up in a mat of bulrushes  with her bare feet and wild bulrushes all around her she looked as a cave woman might have looked her eyes radiant with the caribbean dawn my whole frame thrilled at the sight of her at times it was all i could do not to tear the bulrushes off her and beat her with the heads of them but i schooled myself to restraint and handed her a rock to sit upon and passed her her porridge on the end of a shovel with the calm politeness of a friend  our breakfast over my more serious labours of the day began i busied myself with hauling rocks or boulders along the sand to build us a house against the rainy season with some tackle from the raft i had made myself a set of harness by means of which i hitched myself to a boulder by getting miss croyden to beat me over the back with a stick i found that i made fair progress  but even as i worked thus for our common comfort my mind was fiercely filled with the thought of edith croyden i knew that if once the barriers broke everything would be swept away heaven alone knows the effort that it cost me at times nothing but the sternest resolution could hold my fierce impulses in check once i came upon the girl writing in the sand with a stick i looked to see what she had written i read my own name harold with a wild cry i leapt into the sea and dived to the bottom of it when i came up i was calmer edith came towards me all dripping as i was she placed her hands upon my shoulders how grand you are she said i am i answered then i added miss croyden for heavens sake dont touch me on the ear i cant stand it i turned from her and looked out over the sea presently i heard something like a groan behind me the girl had thrown herself on the sand and was coiled up in a hoop miss croyden i said for gods sake dont coil up in a hoop  i rushed to the beach and rubbed gravel on my face  with such activities alternated with wild bursts of restraint our life on the island passed as rapidly as in a dream had i not taken care to notch the days upon a stick and then cover the stick with tar i could not have known the passage of the time the wearing out of our clothing had threatened a serious difficulty but by good fortune i had seen a large black and white goat wandering among the rocks and had chased it to a standstill from its skin leaving the fur still on edith had fashioned us clothes our boots we had replaced with alligator hide i had by a lucky chance found an alligator upon the beach and attaching a string to the fellows neck i had led him to our camp i had then poisoned the fellow with tinned salmon and removed his hide  our costume was now brought into harmony with our surroundings for myself garbed in goatskin with the hair outside with alligator sandals on my feet and with whiskers at least six inches long i have no doubt that i resembled the beau ideal of a cave man with the openair life a new agility seemed to have come into my limbs with a single leap in my alligator sandals i was enabled to spring into a coconut tree  as for edith croyden i can only say that as she stood beside me on the beach in her suit of black goatskin she had chosen the black spots there were times when i felt like seizing her in the frenzy of my passion and hurling her into the sea fur always acts on me just like that  it was at the opening of the fifth week of our life upon the island that a new and more surprising turn was given to our adventure it arose out of a certain curiosity harmless enough on edith croydens part mr borus she said one morning i should like so much to see the rest of our island can we  alas miss croyden i said i fear that there is but little to see our island so far as i can judge is merely one of the uninhabited keys of the west indies it is nothing but rock and sand and scrub there is no life upon it i fear i added speaking as jauntily as i could that unless we are taken off it we are destined to stay on it  still i should like to see it she persisted  come on then i answered if you are good for a climb we can take a look over the ridge of rocks where i went up on the first day  we made our way across the sand of the beach among the rocks and through the close matted scrub beyond which an eminence of rugged boulders shut out the further view  making our way to the top of this we obtained a wide look over the sea the island stretched away to a considerable distance to the eastward widening as it went the complete view of it being shut off by similar and higher ridges of rock  but it was the nearer view the foreground that at once arrested our attention edith seized my arm look oh look she said  down just below us on the right hand was a similar beach to the one that we had left a rude hut had been erected on it and various articles lay strewn about  seated on a rock with their backs towards us were a man and a woman the man was dressed in goatskins and his whiskers so i inferred from what i could see of them from the side were at least as exuberant as mine the woman was in white fur with a fillet of seaweed round her head they were sitting close together as if in earnest colloquy  cave people whispered edith aborigines of the island  but i answered nothing something in the tall outline of the seated woman held my eye a cruel presentiment stabbed me to the heart  in my agitation my foot overset a stone which rolled noisily down the rocks the noise attracted the attention of the two seated below us they turned and looked searchingly towards the place where we were concealed their faces were in plain sight as i looked at that of the woman i felt my heart cease beating and the colour leave my face  i looked into ediths face it was as pale as mine  what does it mean she whispered  miss croyden i answered edithit means this i have never found the courage to tell you i am a married man the woman seated there is my wife and i love you  edith put out her arms with a low cry and clasped me about the neck harold she murmured my harold  have i done wrong i whispered  only what i have done too she answered i too am married harold and the man sitting there below john croyden is my husband  with a wild cry such as a cave man might have uttered i had leapt to my feet  your husband i shouted then by the living god he or i shall never leave this place alive  he saw me coming as i bounded down the rocks in an instant he had sprung to his feet he gave no cry he asked no question he stood erect as a cave man would waiting for his enemy  and there upon the sands beside the sea we fought barehanded and weaponless we fought as cave men fight  for a while we circled round one another growling we circled four times each watching for an opportunity then i picked up a great handful of sand and threw it flap into his face he grabbed a coconut and hit me with it in the stomach then i seized a twisted strand of wet seaweed and landed him with it behind the ear for a moment he staggered before he could recover i jumped forward seized him by the hair slapped his face twice and then leaped behind a rock looking from the side i could see that croyden though half dazed was feeling round for something to throw to my horror i saw a great stone lying ready to his hand beside me was nothing i gave myself up for lost when at that very moment i heard ediths voice behind me saying the shovel quick the shovel the noble girl had rushed back to our encampment and had fetched me the shovel swat him with that she cried i seized the shovel and with the roar of a wounded bullor as near as i could make iti rushed out from the rock the shovel swung over my head  but the fight was all out of croyden  dont strike he said im all in i couldnt stand a crack with that kind of thing  he sat down upon the sand limp seen thus he somehow seemed to be quite a small man not a cave man at all his goatskin suit shrunk in on him i could hear his pants as he sat  i surrender he said take both the women they are yours  i stood over him leaning upon the shovel the two women had closed in near to us  i suppose you are her husband are you croyden went on  i nodded  i thought you were take her  meantime clara had drawn nearer to me she looked somehow very beautiful with her golden hair in the sunlight and the white furs draped about her  harold she exclaimed harold is it you how strange and masterful you look i didnt know you were so strong  i turned sternly towards her  when i was alone i said on the himalayas hunting the humpo or humped buffalo  clara clasped her hands looking into my face  yes she said tell me about it  meantime i could see that edith had gone over to john croyden  john she said you shouldnt sit on the wet sand like that you will get a chill let me help you to get up  i looked at clara and at croyden  how has this happened i asked tell me  we were on the same ship croyden said there came a great storm even the captain had never seen  i know i interrupted so had ours  the ship struck a rock and blew out her four funnels  ours did too i nodded  the bowsprit was broken and the stewards pantry was carried away the captain gave orders to leave the ship  it is enough croyden i said i see it all now you were left behind when the boats cleared by what accident you dont know  i dont said croyden  as best you could you constructed a raft and with such haste as you might you placed on it such few things  exactly he said a chronometer a sextant  i know i continued two quadrants a bucket of water and a lightning rod i presume you picked up clara floating in the sea  i did croyden said she was unconscious when i got her but by rubbing  croyden i said raising the shovel again cut that out  im sorry he said  its all right but you neednt go on i see all the rest of your adventures plainly enough  well im done with it all anyway said croyden gloomily you can do what you like as for me ive got a decent suit back there at our camp and ive got it dried and pressed and im going to put it on  he rose wearily edith standing beside him  whats more borus he said ill tell you something this island is not uninhabited at all  not uninhabited exclaimed clara and edith together i saw each of them give a rapid look at her goatskin suit  nonsense croyden i said this island is one of the west indian keys on such a key as this the pirates used to land here they careened their ships  did what to them asked croyden  careened them all over from one end to the other i said here they got water and buried treasure but beyond that the island was and remained only the home of the wild gull and the seamews  all right said croyden only it doesnt happen to be that kind of key its a west indian island all right but theres a summer hotel on the other end of it not two miles away  a summer hotel we exclaimed  yes a hotel i suspected it all along i picked up a tennis racket on the beach the first day and after that i walked over the ridge and through the jungle and i could see the roof of the hotel only he added rather shamefacedly i didnt like to tell her  oh you coward cried clara i could slap you  dont you dare said edith im sure you knew it as well as he did and anyway i was certain of it myself i picked up a copy of last weeks paper in a lunchbasket on the beach and hid it from mr borus i didnt want to hurt his feelings  at that moment croyden pointed with a cry towards the sea  look he said for heavens sake look  he turned  less than a quarter of a mile away we could see a large white motor launch coming round the corner the deck was gay with awnings and bright dresses and parasols  great heavens said croyden i know that launch its the appinjoneses  the appinjoneses cried clara why we know them too dont you remember harold the sunday we spent with them on the hudson  instinctively we had all jumped for cover behind the rocks  whatever shall we do i exclaimed  we must get our things said edith croyden jack if your suit is ready run and get it and stop the launch mrs borus and mr borus and i can get our things straightened up while you keep them talking my suit is nearly ready anyway i thought some one might come mr borus would you mind running and fetching me my things theyre all in a parcel together and perhaps if you have a lookingglass and some pins mrs borus i could come over and dress with you  that same evening we found ourselves all comfortably gathered on the piazza of the hotel christopher columbus appinjones insisted on making himself our host and the story of our adventures was related again and again to an admiring audience with the accompaniment of cigars and iced champagne only one detail was suppressed by common instinct both clara and i felt that it would only raise needless comment to explain that mr and mrs croyden had occupied separate encampments  nor is it necessary to relate our safe and easy return to new york  both clara and i found mr and mrs croyden delightful travelling companions though perhaps we were not sorry when the moment came to say goodbye  the word goodbye i remarked to clara as we drove away is always a painful one oddly enough when i was hunting the humpo or humped buffalo of the himalayas  do tell me about it darling whispered clara as she nestled beside me in the cab     vi  the kidnapped plumber  a tale of the new time  being one chapterand quite enoughfrom the reminiscences of an operating plumber     vithe kidnapped plumber a tale of the new time   personally said thornton speaking for the first time i never care to take a case that involves cellar work  we were sittinga little group of usround about the fire in a comfortable corner of the steam and air club our talk had turned as always happens with a group of professional men into more or less technical channels i will not say that we were talking shop the word has an offensive sound and might be misunderstood but we were talking as only a group of practising plumbersincluding some of the biggest men in the professionwould talk with the exception of everett who had a national reputation as a consulting barber and thomas who was a vacuum cleaner expert i think we all belonged to the same profession we had been holding a convention and fortescue who had one of the biggest furnace practices in the country had read us a paper that afternoona most revolutionary thingon external diagnosis of defective feed pipes and naturally the thing had bred discussion fortescue who is one of the most brilliant men in the profession had stoutly maintained his thesis that the only method of diagnosis for trouble in a furnace is to sit down in front of it and look at it for three days others held out for unscrewing it and carrying it home for consideration others of us again claimed that by tapping the affected spot with a wrench the pipe might be fractured in such a way as to prove that it was breakable it was at this point that thornton interrupted with his remark about never being willing to accept a cellar case  naturally all the men turned to look at the speaker henry thornton at the time of which i relate was at the height of his reputation beginning quite literally at the bottom of the ladder he had in twenty years of practice as an operating plumber raised himself to the top of his profession there was much in his appearance to suggest the underlying reasons of his success his face as is usual with men of our calling had something of the dreamer in it but the bold set of the jaw indicated determination of an uncommon kind three times president of the plumbers association henry thornton had enjoyed the highest honours of his chosen profession his book on nut coal was recognized as the last word on the subject and had been crowned by the french academy of nuts  i suppose that one of the principal reasons for his success was his singular coolness and resource i have seen thornton enter a kitchen with that quiet reassuring step of his and lay out his instruments on the table while a kitchen tap with a broken washer was sprizzling within a few feet of him as calmly and as quietly as if he were in his lectureroom of the plumbers college  you never go into a cellar asked fortescue but hang it man i dont see how one can avoid it  well i do avoid it answered thornton at least as far as i possibly can i send down my solderist of course but personally unless it is absolutely necessary i never go down  thats all very well my dear fellow fortescue cut in but you know as well as i do that you get case after case where the cellar diagnosis is simply vital i had a case last week a most interesting thing he turned to the group of us as he spokea double lesion of a gaspipe under a cement floorhalf a dozen of my colleagues had been absolutely baffled they had made an entirely false diagnosis operated on the diningroom floor which they removed and carried home and when i was called in they had just obtained permission from the stone masons protective association to knock down one side of the house  excuse me interrupting just a minute interjected a member of the group who hailed from a distant city have you much trouble about that i mean about knocking the sides out of houses  no trouble now said fortescue we did have but the public is getting educated up to it our law now allows us to knock the side out of a house when we feel that we would really like to see what is in it we are not allowed of course to build it up again  no of course not said the other speaker but i suppose you can throw the bricks out on the lawn  yes said fortescue and sit on them to eat lunch we had a big fight in the legislature over that but we got it through  thank you but i feel i am interrupting  well i was only saying that as soon as i had made up my mind that the trouble was in the cellar the whole case was simple i took my colleagues down at once and we sat on the floor of the cellar and held a consultation till the overpowering smell of gas convinced me that there was nothing for it but an operation on the floor the whole thing was most successful i was very glad as it happened that the proprietor of the house was a very decent fellow employed i think as a manager of a bank or something of the sort he was most grateful it was he who gave me the engraved monkey wrench that some of you were admiring before dinner after we had finished the whole operationi forgot to say that we had thrown the coal out on the lawn to avoid any complicationhe quite broke down he offered us to take his whole house and keep it  you dont do that do you asked the outsider  oh no never said fortescue weve made a very strict professional rule against it we found that some of the younger men were apt to take a house when they were given it and we had to frown down on it but gentlemen i feel that when mr thornton says that he never goes down into a cellar there must be a story behind it i think we should invite him to relate it to us  a murmur of assent greeted the speakers suggestion for myself i was particularly pleased inasmuch as i have long felt that thornton as a raconteur was almost as interesting as in the rôle of an operating plumber i have often told him that if he had not happened to meet success in his chosen profession he could have earned a living as a day writer a suggestion which he has always taken in good part and without offence  those of my readers who have looked through the little volume of reminiscences which i have put together will recall the narrative of the missing nut and the little tale entitled the blue blow torch as instances in point  not much of a story perhaps said thornton but such as it is you are welcome to it so if you will just fill up your glasses with raspberry vinegar you may have the tale for what it is worth  we gladly complied with the suggestion and thornton continued  it happened a good many years ago at a time when i was only a young fellow fresh from college very proud of my plumb b and inclined to think that i knew it all i had done a little monograph on choked feed in the blow torch which had attracted attention and i suppose that altogether i was about as conceited a young puppy as one would find in the profession i should mention that at this time i was not married but had set up a modest apartment of my own with a consultingroom and a single manservant naturally i could not afford the services of a solderist or a gassist and did everything for myself though simmons my man could at a pinch be utilized to tear down plaster and break furniture  thornton paused to take a sip of raspberry vinegar and went on  well then i had come home to dinner particularly tired after a long day i had sat in an attic the greater part of the afternoon a case of top story valvular trouble and had had to sit in a cramped position which practically forbade sleep i was feeling therefore none too well pleased when a little while after dinner the bell rang and simmons brought word to the library that there was a client in the consultingroom i reminded the fellow that i could not possibly consider a case at such an advanced hour unless i were paid emergency overtime wages with time and a half during the day of recovery  one moment interrupted the outside member you dont mention compensation for mental shock do you not draw that here  we do now explained thornton but the time of which i speak is some years ago and we still got nothing for mental shock nor disturbance of equilibrium nowadays of course one would insist on a substantial retainer in advance  well to continue simmons to my surprise told me that he had already informed the client of this fact and that the answer had only been a plea that the case was too urgent to admit of delay he also supplied the further information that the client was a young lady i am afraid added thornton looking round his audience with a sympathetic smile that simmons i had got him from harvard and he had not yet quite learned his place even said something about her being strikingly handsome  a general laugh greeted thorntons announcement  after all said fortescue i never could see why an ice man should be supposed to have a monopoly on gallantry  oh i dont know said thornton for my parti say it without affectationthe moment i am called in professionally women as women cease to exist for me i can stand beside them in the kitchen and explain to them the feed tap of a kitchen range without feeling them to be anything other than simply clients and for the most part i think they reciprocate that attention there are women of course who will call a man in with motivesbut thats another story i must get back to what i was saying  on entering the consultingroom i saw at once that simmons had exaggerated nothing in describing my young client as beautiful i have seldom even among our own class seen a more strikingly handsome girl she was dressed in a very plain and simple fashion which showed me at once that she belonged merely to the capitalist class i am as i think you know something of an observer and my eye at once noted the absence of heavy gold earrings and wristbangles the blue feathers at the side of her hat were none of them more than six inches long and the buttons on her jacket were so inconspicuous that one would hardly notice them in short while her dress was no doubt good and serviceable there was an absence of chic a lack of noise about it that told at once the tale of narrow circumstances  she was evidently in great distress  oh mr thornton she exclaimed advancing towards me do come to our house at once i simply dont know what to do  she spoke with great emotion and seemed almost on the point of breaking into tears  pray calm yourself my dear young lady i said and try to tell me what is the trouble  oh dont lose any time she said do do come at once  we will lose no time i said reassuringly as i looked at my watch it is now seventhirty we will reckon the time from now with overtime at time and a half but if i am to do anything for you i must have some idea of what has happened  the cellar boiler she moaned clasping her hands together the cellar boiler wont work  ah i said soothingly the cellar boiler wont work now tell me is the feed choked miss  i dont know she exclaimed  have you tried letting off the exhaust  she shook her head with a doleful look  i dont know what it is she said  but already i was hastily gathering together a few instruments questioning her rapidly as i did so  hows your pressure gauge i asked hows your water do you draw from the mains or are you on the high level reservoir  it had occurred to me at once that it might be merely a case of stoppage of her main feed complicated perhaps with a valvular trouble in her exhaust on the other hand it was clear enough that if her feed was full and her gauges working her trouble was more likely a leak somewhere in her piping  but all attempts to draw from the girl any clear idea of the symptoms were unavailing all she could tell me was that the cellar boiler wouldnt work beyond that her answers were mere confusion i gathered enough however to feel sure that her main feed was still working and that her top story check valve was probably in order with that i had to be content  as a young practitioner i had as yet no motor car simmons however summoned me a taxi into which i hurriedly placed the girl and my basket of instruments and was soon speeding in the direction she indicated it was a dark lowering night with flecks of rain against the windows of the cab and there was something in the lateness of the hour it was now after halfpast eight and the nature of my mission which gave me a stimulating sense of adventure the girl directed me as i felt sure she would towards the capitalist quarter of the town we had soon sped away from the brightly lighted streets and tall apartment buildings among which my usual practice lay and entered the gloomy and dilapidated section of the city where the unhappy capitalist class reside i need not remind those of you who know it that it is scarcely a cheerful place to find oneself in after nightfall the thick growth of trees the silent gloom of the illlighted houses and the rank undergrowth of shrubs give it an air of desolation not to say danger it is certainly not the place that a professional man would choose to be abroad in after dark the inhabitants living so it is said on their scanty dividends and on such parts of their income as our taxation is still unable to reach are not people that one would care to fall in with after nightfall  since the time of which i speak we have done much to introduce a better state of things the opening of day schools of carpentry plumbing and calcimining for the children of the capitalist is already producing results strange though it may seem one of the most brilliant of our boiler fitters of today was brought up haphazard in this very quarter of the town and educated only by a french governess and a university tutor but at the time practically nothing had been done the place was infested with consumers and there were still so it was said servants living in some of the older houses a butler had been caught one night in a thick shrubbery beside one of the gloomy streets  we alighted at one of the most sombre of the houses and our taxidriver with evident relief made off in the darkness  the girl admitted us into a dark hall where she turned on an electric light we have light she said with that peculiar touch of pride that one sees so often in her class we have four bulbs  then she called down a flight of stairs that apparently led to the cellar  father the plumber has come do come up now dear and rest  a step sounded on the stairs and there appeared beside us one of the most forbiddinglooking men that i have ever beheld i dont know whether any of you have ever seen an anglican bishop probably not outside of the bush they are now never seen but at the time of which i speak there were a few still here and there in the purlieus of the city the man before us was tall and ferocious and his native ferocity was further enhanced by the heavy black beard which he wore in open defiance of the compulsory shaving laws his black shovelshaped hat and his black clothes lent him a singularly sinister appearance while his legs were bound in tight gaiters as if ready for an instant spring he carried in his hand an enormous monkey wrench on which his fingers were clasped in a restless grip  can you fix the accursed thing he asked  i was not accustomed to being spoken to in this way but i was willing for the girls sake to strain professional courtesy to the limit  i dont know i answered but if you will have the goodness first to fetch me a little light supper i shall be glad to see what i can do afterwards  my firm manner had its effect with obvious reluctance the fellow served me some biscuits and some not bad champagne in the diningroom  the girl had meantime disappeared upstairs  if youre ready now said the bishop come on down  we went down to the cellar it was a huge gloomy place with a cement floor lighted by a dim electric bulb i could see in the corner the outline of a large furnace in those days the poorer classes had still no central heat and near it a tall boiler in front of this a man was kneeling evidently trying to unscrew a nut but twisting it the wrong way he was an elderly man with a grey moustache and was dressed in open defiance of the law in a military costume or uniform  he turned round towards us and rose from his knees  im dashed if i can make the rotten thing go round he said  its all right general said the bishop i have brought a plumber  for the next few minutes my professional interest absorbed all my faculties i laid out my instruments upon a board tapped the boiler with a small hammer tested the feedtube and in a few moments had made what i was convinced was a correct diagnosis of the trouble  but here i encountered the greatest professional dilemma in which i have ever been placed there was nothing wrong with the boiler at all it connected as i ascertained at once by a thermodynamic valvular test with the furnace in fact i could see it did and the furnace quite evidently had been allowed to go out  what was i to do if i told them this i broke every professional rule of our union if the thing became known i should probably be disbarred and lose my overalls for it it was my plain professional duty to take a large hammer and knock holes in the boiler with it smash up the furnace pipes start a leak of gas and then call in three or more of my colleagues  but somehow i couldnt find it in my heart to do it the thought of the girls appealing face arose before me  how long has this trouble been going on i asked sternly  quite a time answered the bishop it began did it not general the same day that the confounded furnace went out the general here and admiral hay and i have been working at it for three days  well gentlemen i said i dont want to read you a lesson on your own ineptitude and i dont suppose you would understand it if i did but dont you see that the whole trouble is because you let the furnace out the boiler itself is all right but you see gents it feeds off the furnace  ah said the bishop in a deep melodious tone it feeds off the furnace now that is most interesting let me repeat that i must try to remember it it feeds off the furnace just so  the upshot was that in twenty minutes we had the whole thing put to rights i set the general breaking up boxes and had the bishop rake out the clinkers and very soon we had the furnace going and the boiler in operation  but now tell me said the bishop suppose one wanted to let the furnace outsuppose i mean to say that it was summertime and suppose one rather felt that one didnt care about a furnace and yet one wanted ones boiler going for ones hot water and that sort of thing what would one do  in that case i said you couldnt run your heating off your furnace youd have to connect in your tubing with a gas generator  ah there you get me rather beyond my depth said the bishop  the general shook his head bishop he said just step upstairs a minute i have an idea  they went up together leaving me below to my surprise and consternation as they reached the top of the cellar stairs i saw the general swing the door shut and heard a key turn in the lock i rushed to the top of the stairs and tried in vain to open the door i was trapped in a moment i realized my folly in trusting myself in the hands of these people  i could hear their voices in the hall apparently in eager discussion  but the fellow is priceless the general was saying we could take him round to all the different houses and make him fix them all hang it bishop i havent had a decent tap running for two years and admiral hays pantry has been flooded since last march  but one couldnt compel him  certainly why not id compel him bally quick with this  i couldnt see what the general referred to but had no doubt that it was the huge wrench that he still carried in his hand  we could gag the fellow he went on take him from house to house and make him put everything right  ah but afterwards said the bishop  afterwards answered the general why kill him knock him on the head and bury him under the cement in the cellar hay and i could easily bury him or for that matter i imagine one could easily use the furnace itself to dispose of him  i must confess that my blood ran cold as i listened  but do you think it right objected the bishop you will say of course that it is only killing a plumber but yet one asks oneself whether it wouldnt be just a leetle bit unjustifiable  nonsense said the general you remember that last year when hay strangled the income tax collector you yourself were very keen on it  ah that was different said the bishop one felt there that there was an end to serve but here  nonsense repeated the general come along and get hay hell make short work of him  i heard their retreating footsteps and then all was still  the horror which filled my mind as i sat in the half darkness waiting for their return i cannot describe my fate appeared sealed and i gave myself up for lost when presently i heard a light step in the hall and the key turned in the lock  the girl stood in front of me she was trembling with emotion  quick quick mr thornton she said i heard all that they said oh i think its dreadful of them simply dreadful mr thornton im really ashamed that father should act that way  i came out into the hall still half dazed  theyve gone over to admiral hays house there among the trees thats their lantern please please dont lose a minute do you mind not having a cab i think really youd prefer not to wait and look wont you please take thisshe handed me a little packet as she spokethis is a piece of pie you always get that dont you and theres a bit of cheese with it but please run  in another moment i had bounded from the door into the darkness a wild rush through the darkened streets and in twenty minutes i was safe back again in my own consultingroom  thornton paused in his narrative and at that moment one of the stewards of the club came and whispered something in his ear  he rose  im sorry he said with a grave face im called away a very old client of mine valvular trouble of the worst kind i doubt if i can do anything but i must at least go please dont let me break up your evening however  with a courtly bow he left us  and do you know the sequel to thorntons story asked fortescue with a smile  we looked expectantly at him  why he married the girl explained fortescue you see he had to go back to her house for his wrench one always does  of course we exclaimed  in fact he went three times and the last time he asked the girl to marry him and she said yes he took her out of her surroundings had her educated at a cooking school and had her given lessons on the parlour organ shes mrs thornton now  and the bishop asked some one  oh thornton looked after him he got him a position heating furnaces in the synagogues he worked at it till he died a few years ago they say that once he got the trick of it he took the greatest delight in it well i must go too good night     vii  the blue and the grey  a prewar war story  the title is selected for its originality a set of seventyfive maps will be supplied to any reader free for seventyfive cents this offer is only open till it is closed     viithe blue and the grey a prewar war story     chapter i   the scene was a striking one it was night never had the mississippi presented a more remarkable appearance broad bayous swollen beyond our powers of description swirled to and fro in the darkness under trees garlanded with spanish moss all moss other than spanish had been swept away by the angry flood of the river  eggleston lee carey randolph a young virginian captain of the th company of the th regiment of s brigadeeven this is more than we ought to say and is hard to pronounceattached to the army of the tennessee struggled in vain with the swollen waters at times he sank at other times he went up  in the intervals he wondered whether it would ever be possible for him to rejoin the particular platoon of the particular regiment to which he belonged and of whichs whereabouts not having the volume of the army record at hand he was in ignorance in the intervals also he reflected on his past life to a sufficient extent to give the reader a more or less workable idea as to who and to what he was his father the old greyhaired virginian aristocrat he could see him still take this sword eggleston he had said use it for the state never for anything else dont cut string with it or open tin cans never sheathe it till the soil of virginia is free keep it bright my boy oil it every now and then and youll find it an a 1 sword  did eggleston think too in his dire peril of anotheryounger than his father and fairer necessarily he did go eggleston she had exclaimed as they said farewell under the portico of his fathers house where she was visiting it is your duty but mine lies elsewhere i cannot forget that i am a northern girl i must return at once to my people in pennsylvania oh egg when will this cruel war end  so had the lovers parted  meanwhilewhile eggleston is going up and down for the third time which is of course the lastsuppose we leave him and turn to consider the general position of the confederacy all right suppose we do     chapter ii   at this date the confederate army of the tennessee was extended in a line with its right resting on the tennessee and its left resting on the mississippi its rear rested on the rugged stone hills of the chickasaba range while its front rested on the marshes and bayous of the yazoo having thusas far as we understand military mattersboth its flanks covered and its rear protected its position was one which we ourselves consider very comfortable  it was thus in an admirable situation for holding a review or for discussing the constitution of the united states in reference to the right of secession  the following generals rode up and down in front of the army namely mr a p hill mr longstreet and mr joseph johnston all these three celebrated men are thus presented to our readers at one and the same time without extra charge  but who is this tall commanding figure who rides beside them his head bent as if listening to what they are saying he really isnt while his eye alternately flashes with animation or softens to its natural melancholy in fact we can only compare it to an electric light bulb with the power gone wrong who is it it is jefferson c davis president as our readers will be gratified to learn of the confederate states  it being a fine day and altogether suitable for the purpose general longstreet reined in his prancing black charger during this distressed period all the horses in both armies were charged there was no other way to pay for them and in a few terse words about three pages gave his views on the constitution of the united states  jefferson davis standing up in his stirrups delivered a stirring harangue about six columns on the powers of the supreme court admirably calculated to rouse the soldiers to frenzy after which general a p hill offered a short address soldierlike and to the point on the fundamental principles of international law which inflamed the army to the highest pitch  at this moment an officer approached the president saluted and stood rigidly at attention davis with that nice punctilio which marked the southern army returned the salute  do you speak first he said or did i  let me said the officer your excellency he continued a young virginian officer has just been fished out of the mississippi  daviss eye flashed good he said look and see if there are many more and then he added with a touch of melancholy the south needs them fish them all out bring this one here  eggleston lee carey randolph still dripping from the waters of the bayou was led by the faithful negroes who had rescued him before the generals davis who kept every thread of the vast panorama of the war in his intricate brain eyed him keenly and directed a few searching questions to him such as who are you where are you what day of the week is it how much is nine times twelve and so forth satisfied with egglestons answers davis sat in thought a moment and then continued  i am anxious to send some one through the entire line of the confederate armies in such a way that he will be present at all the great battles and end up at the battle of gettysburg can you do it  randolph looked at his chief with a flush of pride  i can  good resumed davis to accomplish this task you must carry despatches what they will be about i have not yet decided but it is customary in such cases to write them so that they are calculated if lost to endanger the entire confederate cause the main thing is can you carry them  sir said eggleston raising his hand in a military salute i am a randolph  davis with soldierly dignity removed his hat i am proud to hear it captain randolph he said  and a carey continued our hero  davis with a graciousness all his own took off his gloves i trust you major randolph he said  and i am a lee added eggleston quickly  davis with a courtly bow unbuttoned his jacket it is enough he said i trust you you shall carry the despatches you are to carry them on your person and as of course you understand you are to keep on losing them you are to drop them into rivers hide them in old trees bury them under moss talk about them in your sleep in fact sir said davis with a slight gesture of impatienceit was his one faultyou must act towards them as any bearer of confederate despatches is expected to act the point is can you do it or cant you  sir said randolph saluting again with simple dignity i come from virginia  pardon me said the president saluting with both hands i had forgotten it     chapter iii   randolph set out that night mounted upon the fastest horse in fact the fleetest that the confederate army could supply he was attended only by a dozen faithful negroes all devoted to his person  riding over the tennessee mountains by paths known absolutely to no one and never advertised he crossed the tombigbee the tahoochie and the tallahassee all frightfully swollen and arrived at the headquarters of general braxton bragg  at this moment bragg was extended over some seven miles of bush and dense swamp his front rested on the marshes of the tahoochie river while his rear was doubled sharply back and rested on a dense growth of cactus plants our readers can thus form a fairly accurate idea of braggs position over against him not more than fifty miles to the north his indomitable opponent grant lay in a frogswamp the space between them was filled with union and confederate pickets fraternizing joking roasting corn and firing an occasional shot at one another  one glance at randolphs despatches was enough  take them at once to general hood said bragg  where is he asked eggleston with military precision  bragg waved his sword towards the east it was characteristic of the man that even on active service he carried a short sword while a pistol probably loaded protruded from his belt but such was bragg anyway he waved his sword over there beyond the tahoochicaba range he said do you know it  no said randolph but i can find it  do said bragg and added one thing more on your present mission let nothing stop you go forward at all costs if you come to a river swim it if you come to a tree cut it down if you strike a fence climb over it but dont stop if you are killed never mind do you understand  almost said eggleston  two days later eggleston reached the headquarters of general hood and flung himself rather than dismounted from his jaded horse  take me to the general he gasped  they pointed to the log cabin in which general hood was quartered  eggleston flung himself rather than stepped through the door  hood looked up from the table  who was that flung himself in he asked  randolph reached out his hand despatches he gasped food whisky  poor lad said the general you are exhausted when did you last have food  yesterday morning gasped eggleston  youre lucky said hood bitterly and when did you last have a drink  two weeks ago answered randolph  great heaven said hood starting up is it possible here quick drink it  he reached out a bottle of whisky randolph drained it to the last drop  now general he said i am at your service  meanwhile hood had cast his eye over the despatches  major randolph he said you have seen general bragg  i have  and generals johnston and smith  yes  you have been through mississippi and tennessee and seen all the battles there  i have said randolph  then said hood there is nothing left except to send you at once to the army in virginia under general lee remount your horse at once and ride to gettysburg lose no time     chapter iv   it was at gettysburg in pennsylvania that randolph found general lee  the famous field is too well known to need description the armies of the north and the south lay in and around the peaceful village of gettysburg about it the yellow cornfields basked in the summer sun the voices of the teachers and the laughter of merry children rose in the harvestfields but already the shadow of war was falling over the landscape as soon as the armies arrived the shrewder of the farmers suspected that there would be trouble  general lee was seated gravely on his horse looking gravely over the ground before him  major randolph said the confederate chieftain gravely you are just in time we are about to go into action i need your advice  randolph bowed ask me anything you like he said  do you like the way i have the army placed asked lee  our hero directed a searching look over the field frankly i dont he said  whats the matter with it questioned lee eagerly i felt there was something wrong myself what is it  your left said randolph is too far advanced it sticks out  by heaven said lee turning to general longstreet the boy is right is there anything else  yes said randolph your right is crooked it is all sideways  it is it is said lee striking his forehead i never noticed it ill have it straightened at once major randolph if the confederate cause is saved you and you alone have saved it  one thing more said randolph is your artillery loaded  major randolph said lee speaking very gravely you have saved us again i never thought of it  at this moment a bullet sang past egglestons ear he smiled  the battle has begun he murmured another bullet buzzed past his other ear he laughed softly to himself a shell burst close to his feet he broke into uncontrolled laughter this kind of thing always amused him then turning grave in a moment put general lee under cover he said to those about him spread something over him  in a few moments the battle was raging in all directions the confederate army was nominally controlled by general lee but in reality by our hero eggleston was everywhere horses were shot under him mules were shot around him and behind him shells exploded all over him but with undaunted courage he continued to wave his sword in all directions riding wherever the fight was hottest  the battle raged for three days  on the third day of the conflict randolph his coat shot to rags his hat pierced his trousers practically useless still stood at lees side urging and encouraging him  mounted on his charger he flew to and fro in all parts of the field moving the artillery leading the cavalry animating and directing the infantry in fact he was the whole battle  but his efforts were in vain  he turned sadly to general lee it is bootless he said  what is asked lee  the army said randolph we must withdraw it  major randolph said the confederate chief i yield to your superior knowledge we must retreat  a few hours later the confederate forces checked but not beaten were retiring southward towards virginia  eggleston his head sunk in thought rode in the rear  as he thus slowly neared a farmhouse a womana girlflew from it towards him with outstretched arms  eggleston she cried  randolph flung himself from his horse leonora he gasped you here in all this danger how comes it what brings you here  we live here she said this is pas house this is our farm gettysburg is our home oh egg it has been dreadful the noise of the battle we couldnt sleep for it pas all upset about it but come in do come in dinners nearly ready  eggleston gazed a moment at the retreating army duty and affection struggled in his heart  i will he said     chapter v  conclusion   the strife is done the conflict has ceased the wounds are healed north and south are one east and west are even less the civil war is over lee is dead grant is buried in new york the union pacific runs from omaha to san francisco there is total prohibition in the united states the output of dressed beef last year broke all records  and eggleston lee carey randolph survives hale and hearty bright and cheery free and easyand so forth there is grey hair upon his temples some not much and his step has lost something of its elasticity not a great deal and his form is somewhat bowed though not really crooked  but he still lives there in the farmstead at gettysburg and leonora now like himself an old woman is still at his side  you may see him any day in fact he is the old man who shows you over the battlefield for fifty cents and explains how he himself fought and won the great battle     viii  buggam grange  a good old ghost story     viiibuggam grange a good old ghost story   the evening was already falling as the vehicle in which i was contained entered upon the long and gloomy avenue that leads to buggam grange  a resounding shriek echoed through the wood as i entered the avenue i paid no attention to it at the moment judging it to be merely one of those resounding shrieks which one might expect to hear in such a place at such a time as my drive continued however i found myself wondering in spite of myself why such a shriek should have been uttered at the very moment of my approach  i am not by temperament in any degree a nervous man and yet there was much in my surroundings to justify a certain feeling of apprehension the grange is situated in the loneliest part of england the marsh country of the fens to which civilization has still hardly penetrated the inhabitants of whom there are only one and a half to the square mile live here and there among the fens and eke out a miserable existence by frogfishing and catching flies they speak a dialect so broken as to be practically unintelligible while the perpetual rain which falls upon them renders speech itself almost superfluous  here and there where the ground rises slightly above the level of the fens there are dense woods tangled with parasitic creepers and filled with owls bats fly from wood to wood the air on the lower ground is charged with the poisonous gases which exude from the marsh while in the woods it is heavy with the dank odours of deadly nightshade and poison ivy  it had been raining in the afternoon and as i drove up the avenue the mournful dripping of the rain from the dark trees accentuated the cheerlessness of the gloom the vehicle in which i rode was a fly on three wheels the fourth having apparently been broken and taken off causing the fly to sag on one side and drag on its axle over the muddy ground the fly thus moving only at a foots pace in a way calculated to enhance the dreariness of the occasion the driver on the box in front of me was so thickly muffled up as to be indistinguishable while the horse which drew us was so thickly coated with mist as to be practically invisible seldom i may say have i had a drive of so mournful a character  the avenue presently opened out upon a lawn with overgrown shrubberies and in the half darkness i could see the outline of the grange itself a rambling dilapidated building a dim light struggled through the casement of a window in a tower room save for the melancholy cry of a row of owls sitting on the roof and croaking of the frogs in the moat which ran around the grounds the place was soundless my driver halted his horse at the hither side of the moat i tried in vain to urge him by signs to go further i could see by the fellows face that he was in a paroxysm of fear and indeed nothing but the extra sixpence which i had added to his fare would have made him undertake the drive up the avenue i had no sooner alighted than he wheeled his cab about and made off  laughing heartily at the fellows trepidation i have a way of laughing heartily in the dark i made my way to the door and pulled the bellhandle i could hear the muffled reverberations of the bell far within the building then all was silent i bent my ear to listen but could hear nothing except perhaps the sound of a low moaning as of a person in pain or in great mental distress convinced however from what my friend sir jeremy buggam had told me that the grange was not empty i raised the ponderous knocker and beat with it loudly against the door  but perhaps at this point i may do well to explain to my readers before they are too frightened to listen to me how i came to be beating on the door of buggam grange at nightfall on a gloomy november evening  a year before i had been sitting with sir jeremy buggam the present baronet on the verandah of his ranch in california  so you dont believe in the supernatural he was saying  not in the slightest i answered lighting a cigar as i spoke when i want to speak very positively i generally light a cigar as i speak  well at any rate digby said sir jeremy buggam grange is haunted if you want to be assured of it go down there any time and spend the night and youll see for yourself  my dear fellow i replied nothing will give me greater pleasure i shall be back in england in six weeks and i shall be delighted to put your ideas to the test now tell me i added somewhat cynically is there any particular season or day when your grange is supposed to be specially terrible  sir jeremy looked at me strangely why do you ask that he said have you heard the story of the grange  never heard of the place in my life i answered cheerily till you mentioned it tonight my dear fellow i hadnt the remotest idea that you still owned property in england  the grange is shut up said sir jeremy and has been for twenty years but i keep a man therehorrodhe was butler in my fathers time and before if you care to go ill write him that youre coming and since you are taking your own fate in your hands the fifteenth of november is the day  at that moment lady buggam and clara and the other girls came trooping out on the verandah and the whole thing passed clean out of my mind nor did i think of it again until i was back in london then by one of those strange coincidences or premonitionscall it what you willit suddenly occurred to me one morning that it was the fifteenth of november whether sir jeremy had written to horrod or not i did not know but none the less nightfall found me as i have described knocking at the door of buggam grange  the sound of the knocker had scarcely ceased to echo when i heard the shuffling of feet within and the sound of chains and bolts being withdrawn the door opened a man stood before me holding a lighted candle which he shaded with his hand his faded black clothes once apparently a butlers dress his white hair and advanced age left me in no doubt that he was horrod of whom sir jeremy had spoken  without a word he motioned me to come in and still without speech he helped me to remove my wet outer garments and then beckoned me into a great room evidently the diningroom of the grange  i am not in any degree a nervous man by temperament as i think i remarked before and yet there was something in the vastness of the wainscoted room lighted only by a single candle and in the silence of the empty house and still more in the appearance of my speechless attendant which gave me a feeling of distinct uneasiness as horrod moved to and fro i took occasion to scrutinize his face more narrowly i have seldom seen features more calculated to inspire a nervous dread the pallor of his face and the whiteness of his hair the man was at least seventy and still more the peculiar furtiveness of his eyes seemed to mark him as one who lived under a great terror he moved with a noiseless step and at times he turned his head to glance in the dark corners of the room  sir jeremy told me i said speaking as loudly and as heartily as i could that he would apprise you of my coming  i was looking into his face as i spoke  in answer horrod laid his finger across his lips and i knew that he was deaf and dumb i am not nervous i think i said that but the realization that my sole companion in the empty house was a deaf mute struck a cold chill to my heart  horrod laid in front of me a cold meat pie a cold goose a cheese and a tall flagon of cider but my appetite was gone i ate the goose but found that after i had finished the pie i had but little zest for the cheese which i finished without enjoyment the cider had a sour taste and after having permitted horrod to refill the flagon twice i found that it induced a sense of melancholy and decided to drink no more  my meal finished the butler picked up the candle and beckoned me to follow him we passed through the empty corridors of the house a long line of pictured buggams looking upon us as we passed their portraits in the flickering light of the taper assuming a strange and lifelike appearance as if leaning forward from their frames to gaze upon the intruder  horrod led me upstairs and i realized that he was taking me to the tower in the east wing in which i had observed a light  the rooms to which the butler conducted me consisted of a sittingroom with an adjoining bedroom both of them fitted with antique wainscoting against which a faded tapestry fluttered there was a candle burning on the table in the sittingroom but its insufficient light only rendered the surroundings the more dismal horrod bent down in front of the fireplace and endeavoured to light a fire there but the wood was evidently damp and the fire flickered feebly on the hearth  the butler left me and in the stillness of the house i could hear his shuffling step echo down the corridor it may have been fancy but it seemed to me that his departure was the signal for a low moan that came from somewhere behind the wainscot there was a narrow cupboard door at one side of the room and for the moment i wondered whether the moaning came from within i am not as a rule lacking in courage i am sure my reader will be decent enough to believe this yet i found myself entirely unwilling to open the cupboard door and look within in place of doing so i seated myself in a great chair in front of the feeble fire i must have been seated there for some time when i happened to lift my eyes to the mantel above and saw standing upon it a letter addressed to myself i knew the handwriting at once to be that of sir jeremy buggam  i opened it and spreading it out within reach of the feeble candlelight i read as follows        my dear digby       in our talk that you will remember i had no time to finish      telling you about the mystery of buggam grange i take for granted      however that you will go there and that horrod will put you in the      tower rooms which are the only ones that make any pretence of      being habitable i have therefore sent him this letter to deliver      at the grange itself       the story is this       on the night of the fifteenth of november fifty years ago my      grandfather was murdered in the room in which you are sitting by      his cousin sir duggam buggam he was stabbed from behind while      seated at the little table at which you are probably reading this      letter the two had been playing cards at the table and my      grandfathers body was found lying in a litter of cards and gold      sovereigns on the floor sir duggam buggam insensible from drink      lay beside him the fatal knife at his hand his fingers smeared      with blood my grandfather though of the younger branch      possessed a part of the estates which were to revert to sir duggam      on his death sir duggam buggam was tried at the assizes and was      hanged on the day of his execution he was permitted by the      authorities out of respect for his rank to wear a mask to the      scaffold the clothes in which he was executed are hanging at full      length in the little cupboard to your right and the mask is above      them it is said that on every fifteenth of november at midnight      the cupboard door opens and sir duggam buggam walks out into the      room it has been found impossible to get servants to remain at the      grange and the placeexcept for the presence of horrodhas been      unoccupied for a generation at the time of the murder horrod was a      young man of twentytwo newly entered into the service of the      family it was he who entered the room and discovered the crime on      the day of the execution he was stricken with paralysis and has      never spoken since from that time to this he has never consented      to leave the grange where he lives in isolation       wishing you a pleasant night after your tiring journey       i remain       very faithfully       jeremy buggam   i leave my reader to imagine my state of mind when i completed the perusal of the letter  i have as little belief in the supernatural as anyone yet i must confess that there was something in the surroundings in which i now found myself which rendered me at least uncomfortable my reader may smile if he will but i assure him that it was with a very distinct feeling of uneasiness that i at length managed to rise to my feet and grasping my candle in my hand to move backward into the bedroom as i backed into it something so like a moan seemed to proceed from the closed cupboard that i accelerated my backward movement to a considerable degree i hastily blew out the candle threw myself upon the bed and drew the bedclothes over my head keeping however one eye and one ear still out and available  how long i lay thus listening to every sound i cannot tell the stillness had become absolute from time to time i could dimly hear the distant cry of an owl and once far away in the building below a sound as of some one dragging a chain along a floor more than once i was certain that i heard the sound of moaning behind the wainscot meantime i realized that the hour must now be drawing close upon the fatal moment of midnight my watch i could not see in the darkness but by reckoning the time that must have elapsed i knew that midnight could not be far away then presently my ear alert to every sound could just distinguish far away across the fens the striking of a church bell in the clock tower of buggam village church no doubt tolling the hour of twelve  on the last stroke of twelve the cupboard door in the next room opened there is no need to ask me how i knew it i couldnt of course see it but i could hear or sense in some way the sound of it i could feel my hair all of it rising upon my head i was aware that there was a presence in the adjoining room i will not say a person a living soul but a presence anyone who has been in the next room to a presence will know just how i felt i could hear a sound as of some one groping on the floor and the faint rattle as of coins  my hair was now perpendicular my reader can blame it or not but it was  then at this very moment from somewhere below in the building there came the sound of a prolonged and piercing cry a cry as of a soul passing in agony my reader may censure me or not but right at this moment i decided to beat it whether i should have remained to see what was happening is a question that i will not discuss my one idea was to get out and to get out quickly the window of the tower room was some twentyfive feet above the ground i sprang out through the casement in one leap and landed on the grass below i jumped over the shrubbery in one bound and cleared the moat in one jump i went down the avenue in about six strides and ran five miles along the road through the fens in three minutes this at least is an accurate transcription of my sensations it may have taken longer i never stopped till i found myself on the threshold of the buggam arms in little buggam beating on the door for the landlord  i returned to buggam grange on the next day in the bright sunlight of a frosty november morning in a sevencylinder motor car with six local constables and a physician it makes all the difference we carried revolvers spades pickaxes shotguns and an ouija board  what we found cleared up for ever the mystery of the grange we discovered horrod the butler lying on the diningroom floor quite dead the physician said that he had died from heart failure there was evidence from the marks of his shoes in the dust that he had come in the night to the tower room on the table he had placed a paper which contained a full confession of his having murdered jeremy buggam fifty years before the circumstances of the murder had rendered it easy for him to fasten the crime upon sir duggam already insensible from drink a few minutes with the ouija board enabled us to get a full corroboration from sir duggam he promised moreover now that his name was cleared to go away from the premises for ever  my friend the present sir jeremy has rehabilitated buggam grange the place is rebuilt the moat is drained the whole house is lit with electricity there are beautiful motor drives in all directions in the woods he has had the bats shot and the owls stuffed his daughter clara buggam became my wife she is looking over my shoulder as i write what more do you want   the end
